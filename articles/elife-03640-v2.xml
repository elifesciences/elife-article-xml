beyond the stop codon. To identify functional translational readthrough, we estimated the readthrough propensity (RTP) of all stop codon contexts of the human genome by a new regression model in silico, identified a nucleotide consensus motif for high RTP by using this model, and analyzed all readthrough extensions in silico with a new predictor for peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1). Lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) showed the highest combined RTP and PTS1 probability. Experimentally we show that at least 1.6% of the total cellular LDHB is targeted to the peroxisome by a conserved hidden PTS1. The readthrough-extended lactate dehydrogenase subunit LDHBx can also co-import LDHA, the other LDH subunit, into peroxisomes. Peroxisomal LDH is conserved in mammals and likely contributes to redox equivalent regeneration in peroxisomes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03640.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03640.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03640.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and the order of the amino acids in a protein is determined by the order in which ‘codons’ appear in a messenger RNA molecule. Most codons represent a specific amino acid, but there are also three stop codons that are used to mark the end of a protein.</p><p>When the cellular machinery that ‘translates’ the messenger RNA molecule into a protein encounters a stop codon, it stops and releases the completed protein. Sometimes, however, the stop codon is not interpreted as a stop signal, and the translation of the messenger RNA molecule continues until another stop codon is encountered. This process is known as readthrough.</p><p>Some organisms, in particular viruses and fungi, use readthrough to produce a wider range of proteins than their genomes would otherwise allow. While readthrough also occurs in higher organisms such as mammals, it is not known if the resulting proteins perform extra functions that the original protein does not perform.</p><p>A number of factors affect whether readthrough occurs when an mRNA template is being translated. For example, each of the three stop codons has a different likelihood of having its stop signal misinterpreted, and the mRNA sequence that surrounds the stop codon can also affect the likelihood of readthrough.</p><p>Schueren et al. have developed a computational model that estimates how common this form of translational readthrough is in the human genome. The model was based on the identity of the stop codons themselves and the surrounding mRNA sequence. This model was then combined with another model that identifies proteins that are targeted to a structure inside a cell called the peroxisome, which is where a number of essential energy-releasing reactions take place. The combined model enabled Schueren et al. to identify proteins that both perform functions in the peroxisome and are likely to be formed by readthrough.</p><p>The combined model suggested a protein that is a part of lactate dehydrogenase: an enzyme that speeds up chemical reactions that are important for the cell to produce energy. Low levels of lactate dehydrogenase had previously been found in the peroxisome, despite it apparently lacking a specific sequence of amino acids that proteins need to have to enter the peroxisome. However, Schueren et al. confirmed experimentally that readthrough does occur for the lactate dehydrogenase component identified by the model, revealing that it contains a ‘hidden’ peroxisome-targeting region. Furthermore, when more translational readthrough occurred, more lactate dehydrogenase was found in the peroxisomes.</p><p>This unusual way that lactate dehydrogenase enters the peroxisome is an example of how the cell optimizes the used of the genetic information encoded in the genome and in messenger RNA. Translational readthrough always ensures that a certain proportion of lactate dehydrogenase will be brought to the peroxisome. The computational model developed here will be a valuable tool to identify other such proteins produced from genomes, including the human genome and those of other species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03640.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03640.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>translational readthrough</kwd><kwd>stop codon suppression</kwd><kwd>lactate dehydrogenase</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>genome-wide in silico screen</kwd><kwd>peroxisomal targeting signal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003385</institution-id><institution>Georg-August-Universität Göttingen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Program, Faculty of Medicine,</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thoms</surname><given-names>Sven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LI2050/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lingner</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GA354/7-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gärtner</surname><given-names>Jutta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Whole-genome in silico screening for stop codon contexts that produce elevated translational readthrough and peroxisome targeting reveals that in mammals, the amount of lactate dehydrogenase in the peroxisome is controlled by translational readthrough.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Translation of genetic information encoded in mRNAs into proteins is carried out by ribosomes. When a stop codon enters the ribosomal A site, release factors bind the stop codon, hydrolyze the peptidyl-tRNA bond, and trigger the release of the polypeptide from the ribosome. If instead of release factor 1 (eRF1), a near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA pairs with the stop codon in the ribosomal A site, the stop signal is suppressed. Such decoding of a stop codon as a sense codon is known as translational readthrough. As a consequence, translation continues to the next stop codon resulting in the synthesis of C-terminally extended proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baranov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Firth and Brierley, 2012</xref>). Mutant tRNAs are classic stop codon suppressors, but termination also occurs with less than 100% efficiency in normal physiology.</p><p>A number of cis-elements on the mRNA, typically 3′ of the stop codon together with trans-acting factors, are known to influence stop codon readthrough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Firth et al., 2011</xref>). A case of translational readthrough dependent on RNA cis-elements has recently been found and termed programmed translational readthrough (PTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eswarappa et al., 2014</xref>). But it is also known that the stop codon itself and the nucleotides before and after the stop codon affect readthrough. The three stop codons differ in their tendency to be suppressed. In human, UAA is least and UGA is most likely to allow readthrough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beier and Grimm, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baranov et al., 2002</xref>). Studies also show that the nucleotide immediately downstream of the stop codon is biased and can strongly influence readthrough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCaughan et al., 1995</xref>). We here define translational readthrough that is entirely dependent on the stop codon and the nucleotides in its immediate vicinity as basal translational readthrough (BTR). Thus BTR is independent of cis-acting elements and also differs from pharmacologically induced readthrough. Induction of readthrough, most prominently by aminoglycoside antibiotics, is an attractive strategy in the treatment of the large number of genetic disorders caused by premature stop codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bidou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keeling et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In viruses, readthrough optimizes the coding capacity of compact genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Firth and Brierley, 2012</xref>). In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the eukaryotic release factor eRF3 can form prion-like polymers, which introduces a level of epigenetic regulation not found in other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tuite and Cox, 2003</xref>). In fungi, translational readthrough extends cytosolic glycolytic enzymes by a cryptic peroxisomal targeting signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freitag et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, readthrough is known to affect between 200 and 300 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jungreis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dunn et al., 2013</xref>), and in mammals readthrough has been described for more than 50 individual transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geller and Rich, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chittum et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamaguchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dunn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eswarappa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loughran et al., 2014</xref>). Ribosome profiling and phylogenetic approaches provide powerful methods for the systematic identification of readthrough in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jungreis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dunn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eswarappa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loughran et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We wanted to find a physiological role for translational readthrough in humans by identifying C-terminal extensions with targeting signals that would create a functional difference between the normal and the readthrough-extended form. To achieve this aim, we concentrated on proteins deriving from BTR. Based on experimental data, we assigned regression coefficients to all possible nucleotides in the stop codon context (SCC) and, using those regression coefficients, estimated the readthrough propensity (RTP) of all stop codons in the human genome or transcriptome. We were able to formally derive a new nucleotide consensus for high RTP from the regression coefficients of our model. Then we screened all predicted C-terminal extensions for peroxisomal targeting signals because peroxisomes import most of their matrix proteins through a short targeting signal (PTS1) at the very C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith and Aitchison, 2013</xref>). We here show that lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) combines a very high translational readthrough with a hidden, yet functional and evolutionarily conserved, PTS1. This peroxisomal isoform of LDH, containing the readthrough-extended LDHBx subunit, is likely to be involved in the regeneration of redox equivalents for peroxisomal β-oxidation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide in silico analysis of basal translational readthrough</title><p>In order to develop a computational method to assess the RTP of all human SCCs that would allow the identification of genes with high BTR, we focused on SCCs comprising 15 nucleotides including and surrounding the stop codon (nucleotides −6 to +9, stop codon at positions 1 to 3). In order to calculate linear regression between the SCCs and their experimental BTR values, we formalized SCCs using a binary vector that represented the stop context in a multi-dimensional vector space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The three stop codons were condensed into one position, so that the binary vector required 51 dimensions, for the four possible nucleotides in the six positions before and after the stop codon, and for the three stop codons (12 × 4 + 3). The vector was combined with experimentally accessible BTR frequencies. For the first approximation model (LIN), we used 66 sequences derived from human nonsense mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Floquet et al., 2012</xref>). The nucleotide sequences of these stop contexts show no bias with respect to RTP, because the contexts and the stop codons evolved independently, and therefore the context nucleotides are random in relation to the stop codon. We calculated a linear regression model for these SCCs and used only the experimental BTR values that had been measured in the absence of aminoglycosides. The model assigns regression coefficients to all possible nucleotides in the stop context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03640.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genome-wide in silico analysis of basal translational readthrough (BTR) in humans.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the readthrough propensity (RTP) predictor algorithm.

A sortable list of LIN RTP values for all human transcripts is contained in Dataset 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schueren et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To expand the data basis of the RTP algorithm and to obtain evidence that the algorithm indeed predicts BTR values, we selected candidate transcripts with high, intermediate, and low RTP and tested them using a dual reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). For experimental analysis, SCCs spanning 10 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the stop codon were expressed with a 5′/N-terminal yellow fluorescent protein (Venus) and a 3′/C-terminal humanized Renilla luciferase (hRluc) tag. Stop suppression leads to the expression of hRluc, and Venus served as an internal expression control. Readthrough is expressed as luciferase activity per Venus fluorescence. This approach excludes introns and exon junction complexes and, due to the relatively short stretch of variable nucleotides between the reporters, also does not allow for extensive RNA structures that could modulate readthrough. Consequently, this form of the dual reporter assay focuses on the assessment of BTR not influenced by specific cis-elements. The additional candidates tested showed BTR between 0.10% (±0.006%) and 2.91% (±0.15%) relative to the 100% readthrough control expressing the Venus-hRluc fusion protein without an intervening stop codon region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The aminoglycoside antibiotic geneticin (G418) increased readthrough by between 3.25 (±0.41) and 40.38 (±5.33)-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Geneticin could only increase the luciferase-per-Venus signal when a stop codon separated Venus and luciferase, indicating that our dual reporter assay faithfully reports readthrough. The finding that experimental readthrough could be increased by treatment with aminoglycosides also excludes alternative mechanisms such as RNA editing or splicing that might explain the relative increase of the luciferase over the Venus signal. The highest levels of induction can only be reached when basal readthrough is low, and, vice versa, a high BTR somewhat limits the maximum induction factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that maximal BTR readthrough is limited to levels below 15%.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03640.006</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Additional experimental dual reporter readthrough data of stop codon context constructs used for the LINiter model</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03640.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03640.006</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Gene symbol</th><th>Stop codon context</th><th>Readthrough (%) (SD)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic>ZNF-574</italic></td><td>GATCAGTGGC TGA CTCTGCCCGA</td><td>0.31 (0.020)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>LDHB</italic></td><td>AAAAGACCTG TGA CTAGTGAGCT</td><td>1.55 (0.087)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>PPP1R3F</italic></td><td>ATTCTCCCAA TAA AGCTTTACAG</td><td>0.18 (0.009)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>LDHB [TGAT]</italic></td><td>AAAAGACCTG TGA TTAGTGAGCT</td><td>0.17 (0.009)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>LDHB [TAA]</italic></td><td>AAAAGACCTG TAA CTAGTGAGCT</td><td>0.20 (0.009)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>LDHB [TAAT]</italic></td><td>AAAAGACCTG TAA TTAGTGAGCT</td><td>0.17 (0.009)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>LENG1</italic></td><td>CCTTACTCAC TGA CTCCTGAGGG</td><td>0.26 (0.009)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>VASN</italic></td><td>GCCCTACATC TAA GCCAGAGAGA</td><td>0.12 (0.004)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>MDH1</italic></td><td>TTCCTCTGCC TGA CTAGACAATG</td><td>2.91 (0.147)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>PRDM10</italic></td><td>CACCAAACCA TGA CTTCCACCCT</td><td>0.13 (0.005)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>FBXL20</italic></td><td>CATCATCCTA TGA CAATGGAGGT</td><td>0.10 (0.006)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>THG1L</italic></td><td>AGCCAGGCTT TGA CGGAAGAGTC</td><td>0.15 (0.006)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>EDEM3</italic></td><td>GGATGAGCTA TGA CTTGCTAAAC</td><td>0.66 (0.027)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>EDN1</italic></td><td>AGCACATTGG TGA CAGACCTTCG</td><td>0.25 (0.008)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>UBQLN1</italic></td><td>CCAGCCATCA TAG CAGCATTTCT</td><td>0.13 (0.009)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>IRAK3</italic></td><td>CAAAAAAGAA TAA ATTCTACCAG</td><td>0.10 (0.007)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>SLC3A1</italic></td><td>TACCTCGTGT TAG GCACCTTTAT</td><td>0.18 (0.008)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>LEPRE1</italic></td><td>GGATGAGCTA TGA CAGCGTCCAG</td><td>0.27 (0.010)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Stop codon constructs expressing plus/minus 10 nucleotides were analyzed in HeLa cells.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>Next we added our candidate sequences and their experimentally determined readthrough levels to obtain an iterative and extended RTP model (LINiter).

The quantitative manner in which we derived LINiter values allowed us to rationally derive a nucleotide motif permitting high readthrough in humans. We identified the nucleotide positions with the strongest influence on BTR in humans by feature selection, that is by successively eliminating those positions that contribute least to the prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). One by one the nucleotide positions with the smallest sum of squared regression coefficients were removed from the model. We find that two reduced models improve the prediction. Models with either five or three relevant context positions in addition to the stop codon correspond to the local and global residual error minimum, respectively. LINfs5 comprises nucleotide position −6, the stop codon, and positions +4 to +7, and LINfs3 comprises only the stop codon and positions +4 to +6, that is the codon following the stop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The results of this analysis indicate that in humans the stop codon and the three nucleotides immediately downstream of the stop codon have the largest influence on BTR (LINfs3). The corresponding consensus is <underline>UGA</underline> CUA (stop codon underlined). Possibly also the nucleotides at positions +7 (the fourth position after the stop) and −6 contribute to BTR. The RTP-BTR correlation associated with LINfs3 was 0.41 (p = 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test if the LINfs3 consensus indeed confers high BTR, we analyzed four additional candidate SCCs. Three high-RTP SCCs were derived from AQP4, SYTL2, and CACNA2D4, and DHX38 was used as a control with a low RTP. AQP4, SYTL2, and CACNA2D4 conform with the LINfs3 consensus, whereas DHX38 does not. AQP4, SYTL2, and CACNA2D4 showed 2.29% (±0.09%), 0.99% (±0.06%), and 0.61% (±0.02%) readthrough in HeLa cells, whereas for DHX38 readthrough was only 0.27% (±0.04%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), confirming that LINfs3 SCC indeed allows a very high rate of stop suppression. Next we wanted to test if these conclusions obtained in HeLa cells can be extended to other cell types. We therefore performed dual reporter experiments using the HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line, the human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK), and the U373 cell line. In all these experiments, the relative distribution of BTR values remained the same, with AQP4 showing the highest and DHX38 the lowest BTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The finding that readthrough is lower in CACNA2D4 than in AQP4 and SYTL2 can also be taken as evidence that SCC position +7 (fourth after the stop) makes a contribution. Taken together, these experiments show that BTR is indeed a property of the respective SCC, and that readthrough may be differently regulated in different tissues.</p><p>The linear approximation underlying the LINiter and the LINfs3 models led to the identification of the UGA CUA (LINfs3) consensus conferring high BTR. A partially overlapping set of genes with this consensus was recently tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loughran et al., 2014</xref>). An overview of all experimentally confirmed cases of translational readthrough shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> reveals that ribosome profiling, phylogenetic approaches, and RTP screening are complementary approaches. For example, only one of the 42 readthrough genes found by ribosome profiling in foreskin fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dunn et al., 2013</xref>) contains the UGA CUA consensus. The widely varying levels and sequence requirements for efficient stop codon suppression suggest that multiple molecular mechanisms can cause readthrough in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Identification of peroxisomal targeting signals in readthrough extensions</title><p>The genome-wide in silico analysis of RTP provides the basis for the identification of the physiological functions of a readthrough protein.

This targeting mechanism had been shown to divert a small fraction of cytosolic glycolytic proteins to peroxisomes in fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freitag et al., 2012</xref>). PTS1 cover more than 90% of the targeting motifs of peroxisomal matrix proteins. The alternative PTS2 is found in only very few matrix proteins, and has even been lost in some organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lanyon-Hogg et al., 2010</xref>). PTS1 is localized at the very C-terminus of a substrate protein. However, the quintessential PTS1, Ser-Lys-Leu (SKL), is neither necessary nor sufficient to support matrix protein import into peroxisomes. Variations exist, and amino acids upstream of the terminal tripeptide also contribute to targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brocard and Hartig, 2006</xref>). Moreover, PTS1 does not confer a binary decision (to import or not to import), but is likely to determine an equilibrium between cytosolic and peroxisomal localization. This is best exemplified by the peroxisomal marker protein catalase, a considerable amount of which is not imported into peroxisomes due to an inherently weak PTS1 which is associated with low affinity to the cytosolic PTS1-receptor PEX5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maynard et al., 2004</xref>). We took advantage of these scalable properties of PTS1 and adapted to human PTS1 a prediction algorithm that we had previously developed for plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lingner et al., 2011</xref>). This machine learning-based method has been shown to accurately predict proteins with canonical and non-canonical PTS1 peptides and provides evidence for peroxisome targeting in terms of a posterior probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lingner et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To program the human PTS1 prediction algorithm, we conducted orthology searches on 24 known human PTS1 sequences in metazoa using BLAST against protein and EST databases. The resulting dataset and several thousand metazoan sequences without peroxisomal association were used as positive and negative examples in a discriminative machine learning setup. Here, the sequences were represented by binary vectors encoding the presence or absence of up to 15 C-terminal amino acids. Models were trained and validated using regularized least squares classifiers (RLSC) and fivefold cross-validation. A more detailed description of the human PTS1 scoring can be found in the ‘Materials and methods’ section.

We expressed LDHBx as a fusion protein with an N-terminal enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and co-labeled cells by immunofluorescence with the peroxisomal marker PEX14, a peroxisomal membrane protein. YFP-LDHB showed the expected cytosolic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). We hypothesized that a large excess of cytosolic YFP-LDHB masks the peroxisomal localization of LDHBx. To remove cytosolic YFP-LDHB, we permeabilized cells by digitonin before fixation and washed out the cytosol using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). In agreement with peroxisomal targeting through the cryptic PTS1, LDHBx is found localized in peroxisomes after removal of the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4B and 5B</xref>). In control experiments, we show complete removal of cytosolically expressed YFP by cytosol wash-out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and peroxisomal localization of a YFP variant fused to PTS1 of the peroxisomal matrix protein ACOX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). To confirm that LDHB targeting to peroxisomes is dependent on the putative PTS1 in the readthrough extension, we changed the SRL terminus (PTS1 probability 94.3%) to SSI (0.002%) and to SR (ΔL, 0.00001%). These mutations blocked YFP-LDHBx targeting to the peroxisome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4C and 5C–F</xref>). Remarkably, exchange of the leaky UGA stop with the tighter UAA reduced peroxisomal localization of YFP-LDHB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Our results show that the high-RTP SCCs as well as the PTS1 in the extension after the stop codon are needed for peroxisome targeting. The extension must be accessible to ribosomal translation and contain a functional PTS1. It is known that PTS1-dependent targeting guides proteins into peroxisomes and not only to the membrane. The dependence of LDH targeting on the hidden PTS1 and on the nature of the stop codon thus confirms that the protein is indeed inside the peroxisome. As expected, replacing the stop codon by tryptophan-encoding UGG renders LDHBx entirely dependent on the PTS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03640.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>LDHBx targets to the peroxisome by translational readthrough and a hidden peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1) in the 3′ extension.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Direct fluorescence microscopy of transfected HeLa cells.

We therefore wanted to test if peroxisomal LDHBx piggy-backs LDHA into peroxisomes. For this purpose we adapted a two-hybrid assay previously used to analyze co-import of subunits of the dimeric peroxisomal hydrolase Lpx1 in a heterologous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thoms et al., 2011</xref>). When LDHA was expressed as a fusion protein with N-terminal YFP without co-expression of any form of LDHB, the protein localized to the cytosol as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). However, when we co-expressed YFP-LDHA with CFP-LDHBx[TGG], that is cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) fused to the readthrough form of LDHB, we found YFP-LDHA in peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). This experiment shows that the readthrough form of LDHB, LDHBx, can interact with LDHA, and that LDHBx is capable of carrying LDHA into the peroxisome. To show that co-import of LDHA is dependent on the hidden targeting signal in LDHBx, we mutated the targeting signal to SSI, or we deleted the terminal leucine. Either LDHBx PTS1 mutation blocked co-import of LDHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). The peroxisome is thus accessible to all four new LDH isoforms containing LDHBx. To support our data on LDHBx-LDHA co-import, we drew a structural model of the LDH-1 tetramer, the fundamental all-B isoform of LDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). The C-terminal amino acid leucine is extended by three amino acids not resolved in the structure, and, in LDHBx, by an additional seven amino acids. The model shows that this extension protrudes from the tetramer and is located distal to the protomer-interaction site, confirming that oligomerization is not hampered by the extension. The protruding LDHBx extension carrying the PTS1 is also accessible on the tetramer surface for PEX5 binding and import into the peroxisome.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03640.021</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Piggy-back co-import of LDHA by LDHBx into peroxisomes.</title><p>Direct fluorescence of YFP-labeled LDHA (green) in the absence or presence of CFP-labeled LDHBx[TGG] (red) combined with immunofluorescence with a peroxisome marker (blue).

This structural model shows that the termini protrude from the compact tetramer. The readthrough LDH contains at least one subunit LDHBx that is extended by seven amino acids containing the PTS1. For import into the peroxisome, at least one C-terminus has to bind to the soluble PTS1 receptor PEX5. The structure also shows that the added PTS1 is unlikely to block oligomerization of the protein because the C-termini are far away from the interaction surface of the protomers. The PTS1 has to be protruding from the compact oligomer in an unstructured manner to be buried in the TPR domain pocket of PEX5. Therefore, it is also unlikely that the PTS1 extensions generated by readthrough fold back onto the protein to induce a conformational change that would interfere with the subunit interaction.

This mechanism has been termed programmed translational readthrough (PTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eswarappa et al., 2014</xref>). It is known, however, that the stop codon together with the preceding and immediately following nucleotides (SCC) also influence translational readthrough. We have termed this process basal translational readthrough (BTR) to distinguish it from PTR in general, and also from pharmacologically induced readthrough. In this study we derive a motif conferring high BTR from a linear regression model of SCCs and show that LDHBx undergoes BTR, which in turn affects the intracellular distribution of LDH.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A new LDH subunit</title><p>LDH is an enzyme with several isoforms, which has also been instrumental in devising the enzyme isoform concept per se.

Peroxisomal LDH is a novel isoform of LDH containing at least one readthrough-extended LDHBx subunit. LDHB readthrough and readthrough-dependent peroxisomal localization are evident in various human cell types, suggesting that the LDHBx subunit is expressed and localized to peroxisomes in all tissues that express LDHB. LDHBx exemplifies a new mechanism of post-transcriptional diversification of the genome's coding potential in mammals.</p><p>The 1.6% LDHBx stop codon readthrough that we find in our experiments corresponds to the 1.5–2% LDH activity found in association with peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McGroarty et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Osmundsen, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumgart et al., 1996</xref>), suggesting that cellular suppression of the stop codon is the only pathway for LDHB into peroxisomes. Assuming that peroxisomes fill approximately 1–2% of the cell volume, translational readthrough ensures almost equal concentration of LDH in cytosol and in peroxisomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A role for peroxisomal LDH</title><p>Fatty acid β-oxidation reactions are the hallmark of peroxisomes in most cell types and organisms. In mammalian peroxisomes, β-oxidation is involved in the degradation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) and biogenetic reactions such as the synthesis of bile acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lodhi and Semenkovich, 2014</xref>). Therefore patients with peroxisomal disorders accumulate VLCFA and bile acid intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braverman et al., 2013</xref>). During fatty acid oxidation and other peroxisomal processes, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is reduced to NADH. However, the pathway of NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration inside peroxisomes is not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kunze and Hartig, 2013</xref>). For efficient β-oxidation to occur, it is necessary that a redox shuttle system exists for NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration, because peroxisomes are impermeable to NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Visser et al., 2007</xref>). The identification of LDH inside the peroxisome suggested the existence of a lactate/pyruvate shuttle involved in the regeneration of redox equivalents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumgart et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McClelland et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gladden, 2004</xref>).

Generally, functional LDHBx targeting to peroxisomes highlights the role of intracellular lactate shuttle mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooks, 2009</xref>). In liver peroxisomes, pyruvate production is catalyzed by alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase, an important enzyme in glyoxylate detoxification. Glyoxylate, however, is itself a substrate of LDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Salido et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, peroxisomal LDH may also be involved in peroxisomal glyoxylate metabolism.</p><p>Peroxisomal LDH is not the first glycolytic enzyme found in peroxisomes. Trypanosomes have sequestered the full set of glycolytic enzymes in specialized peroxisomes called glycosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gualdrón-López et al., 2012</xref>). And recently, in fungi, part of the glycolytic pathway upstream of pyruvate including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, was shown to be localized to peroxisomes by alternative splicing and/or translational readthrough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freitag et al., 2012</xref>). It is compelling that fungi as well as mammals use stop codon suppression to localize a small fraction of glycolytic enzymes to peroxisomes. We hypothesize that both translational readthrough as well as PTS1 evolve easily, and so can divert a low and steady amount of these enzymes to peroxisomes.</p><p>A small fraction of cytosolic LDHB is imported into peroxisomes. This fraction is likely to be constant with respect to the overall LDHB expression levels in given tissue. We speculate that the peroxisomal LDHB shunt helps to coordinate redox processes between the cytosol and the peroxisome. Importantly, our study reveals a new pharmacological effect of readthrough-inducing drugs such as the commonly prescribed aminoglycosides, as they will increase LDHB readthrough and peroxisome import of LDHBx.</p><p>It is not known at the moment whether translational readthrough is regulated in humans. The very high readthrough of approximately 5% in a glioblastoma cell line suggests that readthrough is differentially regulated in different tissues. Future experiments will show if the increased LDHB readthrough we find in this cell line are a cancer-associated dysregulation linked to the Warburg effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hsu and Sabatini, 2008</xref>), or if it just matches a higher abundance of peroxisomes in these cells to ensure an equal concentration of LDH in cytosol and peroxisomes in these cells as suggested above. It is also possible that glial cells generally have a higher demand for peroxisomal LDH that could be involved in neuronal/glial lactate metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A rational approach to translational readthrough</title><p>The first mammalian readthrough proteins were identified by chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geller and Rich, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chittum et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamaguchi et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, two powerful and complementary methods have been employed in the genome-wide identification of readthrough-extended proteins. Ribosome profiling can recognize translating ribosomes in 3′UTRs and thereby identify readthrough and other recoding events outside known coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dunn et al., 2013</xref>). Phylogenetic approaches such as those implemented in PhyloCSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2011</xref>) evaluate the coding potential of sequences before and after the stop codon to help predict readthrough and are particularly powerful when genome sequences from closely related species are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jungreis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loughran et al., 2014</xref>). Ribosome profiling, however, depends on gene expression, and can identify readthrough events only when the cell type in question is actually analyzed. Ribosome profiling may also fail to identify short readthrough extensions. Phylogenetic approaches, on the other hand, may miss readthrough when it is not conserved in the given dataset or when sufficiently dense datasets are not available, or when the extensions are too short to provide a basis for phylogenetic comparison.</p><p>Our approach to systems-level identification of translational readthrough is based on the formalization of SCCs and a linear regression model with experimental readthrough values. The majority of the input sequences have been derived from patient nonsense mutations. In consequence, these sequences are biased neither by preselection by any pre-determined RTP or experimental readthrough levels, or by the SCCs, because the contexts did not evolve together with the respective stop codons. The algorithm we develop in this paper is limited to six nucleotide positions before and after the stop codon. This approach excludes the identification of extended RNA secondary structures involved in PTR and other recoding events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baranov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Firth and Brierley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eswarappa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loughran et al., 2014</xref>). The identification of the LINfs3 consensus and the human genes associated with this consensus justifies this approach. The LINfs3 motif, derived by feature selection, encompasses the stop codon and the first codon after the stop: UGA CUA. Our analysis suggests that positions +7 and −6 might also further contribute to readthrough. We have tested five of the 144 candidates in the genome with the UGA CUA motif and confirmed their high BTR. Highest BTR appears to correlate with a G in position +7 (UGA CUA G) within the LINfs5 consensus. This motif is found 30 times in the human genome and has recently been shown to support high translational readthrough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loughran et al., 2014</xref>). The motifs for high BTR are distinct from the consensus UGA CAR YYA (R = A/G, Y = C/U) found in some viruses and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Namy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrell et al., 2002</xref>) but resembles the alphavirus-like high readthrough stop codon context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li and Rice, 1993</xref>). Interestingly, the same stop suppression context in the <italic>LAMA3</italic> gene has been shown to alleviate the disease severity of an otherwise fatal nonsense mutation in a patient with junctional epidermolysis bullosa, the major and most devastating form of epidermolysis bullosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pacho et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The existence of the consensus motif UGA CUA is the origin of the non-linear contribution to RTP in our models. This is supported by the finding that correlation of BTR and RTP for LINfs3 is higher than for the LINiter model, so that the reduced number of parameters in LINfs3 provides a better model fit. This finding implies that with the currently small dataset, compact linear models should be preferred over non-linear models with many parameters. The identification of the few relevant nucleotide positions will help to create datasets with fully specified BTR for a wide range of SCCs and cell types. A larger training set of sequences with verified readthrough rates will allow the development of non-linear approximation models.</p><p>LDHBx shows an unusually high readthrough of 1.6%, and its stop context <underline>UGA</underline> CUA G (stop codon underlined) matches the LINfs3 consensus. The 18-nucleotide extension in LDHBx is unlikely to contain a extensive secondary structure that would suggest a combined effect of BTR and PTR. The identification of LDHBx and the recently discovered readthrough form of vascular endothelial growth factor A, VEGF-Ax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eswarappa et al., 2014</xref>), thus mark two extreme and separable cases of physiological stop suppression: LDHBx appears independent of cis-factors beyond the SCC and marks a prototypical example of BTR. In contrast, the readthrough of VEGF-Ax is relatively independent of its SCC but instead requires a more distantly located cis-element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eswarappa et al., 2014</xref>). The distinction between PTR and BTR, however, is not exclusive. A thorough analysis of readthrough in OPRK1 and OPRL1 indicates that readthrough levels of more than 30% can be obtained by a combination of cis-elements and UGA CUA-based BTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loughran et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The era of systematic analysis of translational readthrough in humans is only beginning. We expect that a combination of in silico modeling and screening, ribosome profiling, phylogenetic methods, and mass spectrometry will help to identify the ‘extensome’, the complete set of readthrough-extended proteins in mammals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>RTP calculation algorithm</title><p>To predict the RTP of gene transcripts, we developed a linear regression model based on the SCCs and their experimentally determined basal readthrough values.

For this purpose, we used 24 known human PTS1 proteins (ACOT4, ACOX1, ACOX2, ACOX3, AGXT, AMACR, BAAT, CRAT, DAO, EHHADH, GNPAT, HAO1, HAO2, HSD17B4, IDE, MLYCD, PRDX5, ACOT8, CROT, PECI, ECH1, LONP2, PECR, and PIPOX) and performed orthology searches on metazoan protein and EST sequences using a bidirectional best BLAST hit strategy. Starting from each human protein sequence, we identified significant BLAST hits (e-value &lt; 10<sup>−10</sup>) to metazoan sequences within the ‘nr’ and ‘dbEST’ database. Then, the best hit of each organism was searched against the human proteome and sequences not re-identifying the starting sequence were removed.

Antibody dilutions were 1:200 for anti-PEX14 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (ProteinTech, Chicago, Illinois) and 1:500 for anti-LDHB mouse monoclonal antibodies (Abnova, Taiwan). Secondary antibody labeling (1:200) was done for 1 hr with antibodies labeled with Cy3 and/or Alexa647 (Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, Pennsylvania) and/or Alexa488 (MoBiTech, Germany). Cover slips were mounted with Mowiol containing 0.01 mg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). DAPI was omitted in cases where cells had been transfected with CFP-expressing plasmids.</p><p>Fluorescence microscopy was done using a 100× oil objective (1.3 NA) with a Zeiss Imager M1 fluorescence wide field scope equipped with the Zeiss Axiocam HRm Camera and Zeiss Axiovision 4.8 acquisition software. z-Stacks with 30 images and 0.25 µm spacing were recorded and subjected to deconvolution. Where necessary, linear contrast enhancements were applied (Axiovision).</p><p>To quantify induction of endogenous LDHB by geneticin, fluorescence images from samples prepared with anti-LDHB and anti-PEX14 antibodies were recorded under identical conditions and subjected to deconvolution. The LDHB/PEX14 intensities were measured, and the same threshold ratios were applied to all channel pairs (ImageJ). Induction is expressed as the ratio of LDHB/PEX14 ratios with and without geneticin treatment, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF, Complete protease inhibitors [Roche, Switzerland]) 24 hr after transfection. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with primary and secondary antibodies. The following antibodies were used: anti-HA rabbit polyclonal (Abcam, UK), anti-Myc mouse monoclonal (Cell Signaling, UK), anti-luciferase mouse monoclonal (Millipore), anti-GFP mouse monoclonal (Living Colors, Mountain View, California), and anti-actin mouse monoclonal (Sigma). HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immuno Research) were used as secondary antibodies. We also used 1:1000 dilutions of primary antibody and 1:5000 dilutions of secondary antibody. Reactive bands were revealed with Lumi-light and Lumi-light plus Western blotting substrate (Roche). Images were scanned using Luminescent image analyzer LAS 4000.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data availability</title><p>Dataset 1.

We regret to inform you that the extra work we think will be needed falls outside the scope of a resubmission, but if you can address the concerns below we would be happy to review a new submission at a later date.</p><p>You describe the derivation of a new algorithm to deduce the propensity for nonsense codon readthrough. The resulting quantitative predictor, called the RTP score, was initially derived from published data on aminoglycoside-promoted readthrough efficiency and further developed by the use of dual reporter readthrough assays. You find provocative correlations of expression and readthrough, i.e., genes that are highly expressed have a lower RTP score, whereas genes that are expressed at low levels have higher RTP scores. By coupling the RTP predictor with a peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS) prediction algorithm you sought genes that have high scores for RTP as well as PTS. This approach identified a new isoform of LDHB that arises from the readthrough of the normal termination codon resulting in translation of a C-terminally extended protein product harboring the peroxisomal targeting sequence. Monitoring the subcellular localization of the appropriate fluorescent fusion proteins validated this conclusion.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting manuscript, the experiments are well executed, and many of the conclusions are well supported by the data. However, there are major concerns with the paper. One problem is the fact that the function for LDHBP+ in the peroxisome is only postulated, not formally demonstrated (for example, by a loss-of-function experiment or by clinical data). Another major problem is the molecular mechanism involved (please see below). Another concern relates to the repeated claims that the RTP models are “a quantitative predictor for readthrough propensity in the human genome,” which are not supported by a clear, quantitative analysis of RTP performance. Because RTP is a major focus of the manuscript, you should provide additional analyses to substantiate these claims. These are critical questions you must address in any future new submission to <italic>eLife.</italic></p><p>1) The overall rationale of the authors' algorithms needs to be explained in more elaborate, general terms. Further, there needs to be some indication of “public” availability of the algorithm.</p><p>2) Dual reporter assays play a key role in the assessment of nonsense codon contexts that are prone to readthrough. However, it appears that all of these assays used by the authors have the traditional format that excludes any introns. This may be a significant problem since deposition of EJC proteins appears to play a key role in translational efficiency (Wiegand et al [2003] Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100: 11327-11332; Gudikote et al. [2005] Nature Struct Mol Biol 12: 801-819; Nott et al. [2004] Genes Dev 18: 210-222). The latter experiments raise the possibility that the lack of introns/EJC proteins may affect readthrough efficacy. Hence, at a minimum, the authors need to acknowledge this shortcoming of their experimental approach.</p><p>3) The authors make a strong point of being the “first” to observe that nonsense suppression allows two mammalian proteins to be derived from the same mRNA. However, this point is also apparent from the supplementary data presented in Welch et al. (2007) (Nature 447: 87-91). Again, this should be acknowledged.</p><p>4) The authors do not discuss/compare the consensus sequence identified from their analyses with any of the stop codon sequence contexts that have been reported in the literature. A comparison with known sequence contexts would be helpful for the readers and may exemplify the strength of the RTP predictor.</p><p>5) The authors use one specific case study, the peroxisomal targeting sequence, to show physiological functions of a readthrough protein. However, adding one more example, other than the PTS, would greatly enhance the applicability of the RTP predictor combined with other in silico analyses. Experimental validation of another case study might be beyond the scope of the paper, but it would show a wider applicability of the method described.</p><p>6) In the experimental validation of the role of readthrough in the synthesis of LDHB+P, the authors should demonstrate the validity of their RTP predictor by doing mutational analyses of the stop codon context according to their consensus models.</p><p>7) Although the authors have an intriguing model for the co-import of LDHA with LDHB, It would be important to show two-hybrid data to support it, or address it biochemically using co-IP analyses of the LDHB+P and LDHA.</p><p>8) Although they clearly demonstrate that the extended protein is addressed to the peroxysome it is still not clear what is the function of this protein in this organelle. There is no clear demonstration of a physiological function for this protein. Is there any genetic disease linked either to the absence of the PTS1 motif in LDHB or to the modification of the readthrough consensus motif identified by the authors?</p><p>9) Concerning the molecular mechanism involved. The fact that this readthrough is UGA specific is very intriguing. Indeed up to now the context is known to modify readthrough efficiency but not in such extend. We would expect variations but not a total absence of readthrough product with the two other stop codons. This is reminiscent to the insertion of Sel that is also specific of the UGA codon. It seems that this possibility can be excluded due to the absence of a SECIS element, but can you clearly exclude an alternative mechanism such an editing or an alternative splicing? Supplementary data answering these questions will be important to provide.</p><p>10) It is unclear whether RTP identifies true readthrough candidates, because there are no obvious negative controls to determine whether the readthrough level is “programmed”.</p><p>The authors select fifteen stop codon contexts scored by the lin model, and measure their readthrough rates using an eYFP-stop-luciferase reporter. The observed readthrough rates – with the exceptions of MDH1 (2.91% readthrough) and LDHB (1.55%) are quite low, ranging from 0.1-0.66%. This is a much lower amount of readthrough than is observed for bovine VEGF-Ax (10%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eswarappa et al., 2014</xref>) or various human genes (ranging from 0.7 to 60%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dunn et al., 2013</xref>). It is unclear whether this amount of readthrough represents a basal level of readthrough that could be obtained with more or less any stop codon context, or an elevated level of readthrough due to something special about the nucleotide contexts selected by the lin model.</p><p>To address this, the authors should include in this assay a set of negative controls, including a construct lacking luciferase, and a set of contexts with very low RTP scores, to establish a background readthrough rate. The authors should then discuss how far above background, if at all, their readthrough candidates are.</p><p>11) The authors claim that RTP is a genome-wide predictor of readthrough, but they do not substantiate this claim with genome-wide data. The authors should provide a genome-wide examination of readthrough using some sort of experimental measure. For example, they could estimate readthrough rates genome-wide using published ribosome profiling data, and compare these to the predictions made by RTP.</p><p>12) The authors claim that RTP is quantitative, but provide no analysis of its quantitative performance. The authors should provide an explicit analysis demonstrating that RTP is quantitative, or a discussion of why it might not be, especially in light of the fact that they acknowledge that “...there is non-linear contribution to RTP in the sense that other high-RTP genes are likely to show readthrough levels higher than predicted.” Such an analysis might be a quantitative comparison (e.g., a scatter plot and a Pearson correlation coefficient) of predicted and observed readthrough rates for all stop codon contexts tested, or an ROC curve describing the sensitivity and specificity of RTP at different score thresholds. Finally, because RTP is a new metric, descriptive statistics on the RTP score distribution should be provided to facilitate interpretation of individual scores.</p><p>13) As mentioned above, the readthrough rates observed for the vast majority of candidates identified in this work are very low compared to known examples. It therefore seems likely that stop codons undergoing higher levels of readthrough were either missed by RTP, or not tested by the experimenters. In addition, certain cases of readthrough are regulated in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamaguchi et al., 2012</xref>) and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dunn et al., 2013</xref>; Robinson &amp; Cooley, 1997) or differ between different wild-type yeast strains (Torabi &amp; Kruglyak, 2011). Consistent with these observations, the authors themselves note that LDHB undergoes far more readthrough in human U118 cells (∼5%) compared to human fibroblasts and HEK cells (1-2%). It is therefore possible that these models could be overfit to the cell type in which the experiment was performed, in addition to the specific contexts on which the models were trained. In light of these facts, the authors must establish the scope of their claims.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03640.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We are now submitting a completely revised manuscript. In this paper, we have addressed all of the concerns raised by the reviewers. The changes we made cover both the experimental work and the written material in all sections of the manuscript. Nearly all figures were revised and new figures and figure panels were included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 1 and 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10–figure supplement 1</xref>). We have also restructured the distribution of data between the main and supplementary figures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig10">Figures 5 and 10</xref> to achieve a more logical succession of arguments. For the same reason, one figure was split into two (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figure 5 and 6</xref>), and, following one reviewer’s suggestion, we have deleted one figure (formerly Figure 3). Lastly, we have amended the supplementary database by more <italic>in silico</italic> analyses and an “applet” (see below). Julia Hofhuis has been involved in some of the additional experiments and is now added as a co-author.</p><p>While our manuscript was under review, Eswarappa et al. [Cell 157, 1405-18 (2014)] reported programmed translational readthrough (PTR) in the vascular endothelial growth factor A. This study gave us the opportunity to explain our intentions and the focus of our work in more detail. In their study, Eswarappa et al. investigate a case of programmed translational readthrough, which is dependent on a 63 nucleotide cis-element in the transcript. Remarkably, this case of PTR is relatively independent on the stop codon and its context. In contrast, our work focuses on the ability of the stop codon and its context (stop codon context, SCC) to stimulate translational readthrough. To distinguish this type of readthrough from PTR, we now define this SCC-dependent readthrough as basal translational readthrough (BTR). BTR differs also from pharmacologically induced readthrough. The distinction between PTR and BTR might help to explain why the experimental readthrough values vary over a large range with PTR reaching levels of 10, 30, or even 60% for some genes, while BTR does not seem to exceed 1.5 to 5%. In the latter case, readthrough is entirely dependent on a natural stop codon and the nucleotides in its immediate vicinity, whereas PTR involves cis-elements and trans-factors that can enhance readthrough to a large extend. 1.5% BTR may appear low from the perspective of a PTR-regulated gene, but considering that stop codons usually permit less than 0.13% readthrough, this is an at least 10-fold increase. And for the case of LDHB+P (which we now term LDHBx) we provide evidence that it has a biological function. The distinction between PTR and BTR is not to imply that both are mutually exclusive. Another recent study by Loughran et al. [NAR; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gku608">doi 10.1093/nar/gku608</ext-link> (2014)] investigates cases of what is probably a combination of both. To allude to what is the main focus of the paper, we have changed the title to “Peroxisomal lactate dehydrogenase is generated by translational readthrough in mammals”.</p><p><italic>1) The overall rationale of the authors' algorithms needs to be explained in more elaborate, general terms. Further, there needs to be some indication of “public” availability of the algorithm</italic>.</p><p>In the revised version of the manuscript we elaborate in detail the rationale of our <italic>in silico</italic>-approach (see Introduction, Results, and Discussion sections). We also extended the explanations in the Figure legends. We have taken special care to point out that our approach focuses on the nucleotides of the stop codon context (SCC) and can therefore only assess readthrough that is dependent on this relatively short stretch close to the stop codon. We have included the RTP values for all human stop codons (Dataset 1). To further increase the accessibility, we have added the regression coefficients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), and we add an ‘applet’ to the dataset (Excel sheet containing a set of cell functions) that allows RTP-calculation of user-entered SCCs.</p><p><italic>2) Dual reporter assays play a key role in the assessment of nonsense codon contexts that are prone to readthrough. However, it appears that all of these assays used by the authors have the traditional format that excludes any introns. This may be a significant problem since deposition of EJC proteins appears to play a key role in translational efficiency (Wiegand et al [2003] Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100: 11327-11332; Gudikote et al. [2005] Nature Struct Mol Biol 12: 801-819; Nott et al. [2004] Genes Dev 18: 210-222). The latter experiments raise the possibility that the lack of introns/EJC proteins may affect readthrough efficacy. Hence, at a minimum, the authors need to acknowledge this shortcoming of their experimental approach</italic>.</p><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for pointing this out, and helping us clarify the scope of our study. Indeed, we analyzed SCCs, and all of the RTP calculations are entirely based on the regression coefficients of the few nucleotides of the SCC. We do not take into account that cis-sequences or secondary structures within the extension could contribute to readthrough. As stated above, Eswarappa et al. [Cell 157, 1405-1418 (2014)] recently published complementary work by analyzing one example of programmed translational readthrough (PTR), dependent on a 63 nucleotide cis-element 3’ of the stop codon. In contrast, our work concentrates on basal translational readthrough (BTR), which is defined here as being independent of genetic elements outside of the nucleotides surrounding the stop codon. We have identified an SCC motif that leads to high basal translational readthrough (BTR). We also provide evidence that this element acts independently of cis-acting factors in the case of the dual reporter constructs (absence of EJC, responsiveness to aminoglycosides, mutational analysis). The RTP calculation in our study is not based on “aminoglycoside-promoted readthrough efficiency”. We only used “basal” readthrough efficiency, which is non-induced readthrough by definition. Also the BTR levels measured by us for inclusion in the iterative model are non-induced (but inducible!), so they were recorded in the absence of readthrough-inducing drugs, indicating that they are entirely dependent on the SCC. While the inducibility of the signal in the assay sufficiently proves that it is real readthrough (because e.g. splicing is not induced by aminoglycosides), we cannot exclude that some of the genes with high BTR are additionally influenced in translational efficiency by introns/EJC. For the case of LDHBx, however, this is unlikely, due to the quantitative correspondence of LDH activity in the peroxisome with readthrough propensity and its very short extension.</p><p>We do not think that focusing on BTR is a shortcoming of our approach. The genome-wide screens by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eswarappa et al. 2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dunn et al. 2013</xref> do not identify LDH and none (Eswarappa) or only 1/42 (Dunn) of the other candidates that we have identified. This is also not a shortcoming of their work. It just means that so far no experimental or <italic>in silico</italic> approach is capable of identifying all cases of translational readthrough in mammals. It also indicates that the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying PTR and BTP are likely different. We believe that a combination of our new approach with ribosome profiling and analysis of conservation of ‘non-coding’ regions together with mass spectrometry will identify the ‘extensome’ that is the full set of proteins with above-average readthrough in the proteome.</p><p><italic>3) The authors make a strong point of being the “first” to observe that nonsense suppression allows two mammalian proteins to be derived from the same mRNA. However, this point is also apparent from the supplementary data presented in Welch et al. (2007) (Nature 447: 87-91). Again, this should be acknowledged</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for pointing this out! We have now deleted a somewhat misleading line from the Abstract and the beginning of the Discussion. We do not wish to claim, we are ‘the “first” to observe that nonsense suppression allows two mammalian proteins to be derived from the same mRNA’. Throughout the manuscript, we are quoting several papers together reporting more than 50 proteins that have shown this before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dunn et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jungreis et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geller and Rich 1980</xref>, and now additionally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chittum et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eswarappa et al. 2014</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loughran et al. 2014</xref>]. We have now included a diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>) that gives an overview on the experimentally confirmed mammalian readthrough genes. Together, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eswarappa et al. 2014</xref> our study is the first reporting functional translational readthrough in humans, defined as a readthrough event, in which the normal and the extended form have distinct physiological roles and/or localizations. Nonetheless, we have toned down all reference to being “first” in the manuscript.</p><p>In our study, we have used the pharmacological induction of readthrough only to support the idea that what we are measuring is indeed readthrough (as opposed to splicing, or RNA editing, see below). We have not included the genes identified by Welch et al. because in our study we only focus on genes undergoing detectable levels of readthrough without drug treatment.</p><p><italic>4) The authors do not discuss/compare the consensus sequence identified from their analyses with any of the stop codon sequence contexts that have been reported in the literature. A comparison with known sequence contexts would be helpful for the readers and may exemplify the strength of the RTP predictor</italic>.</p><p>We have now expanded the Discussion section and compare the SCCs with already published readthrough motifs to point out the strength of the RTP predictor. In addition, we have now included a diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>) that displays the experimentally confirmed mammalian readthrough genes in context.</p><p><italic>5) The authors use one specific case study, the peroxisomal targeting sequence, to show physiological functions of a readthrough protein. However, adding one more example, other than the PTS, would greatly enhance the applicability of the RTP predictor combined with other in silico analyses. Experimental validation of another case study might be beyond the scope of the paper, but it would show a wider applicability of the method described</italic>.</p><p>To enhance the applicability of the RTP algorithm, we now include more <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of the readthrough extensions, containing potential endoplasmic reticulum retention signals, glycosylation sites, transmembrane domains, and possible farnesylation sites (Database 1).</p><p><italic>6) In the experimental validation of the role of readthrough in the synthesis of LDHB+P, the authors should demonstrate the validity of their RTP predictor by doing mutational analyses of the stop codon context according to their consensus models</italic>.</p><p>We already were working on an extended mutational analysis of the LDHB+P (now LDHBx) stop codon context according to our consensus model while the paper was under review. In the revised manuscript, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> the result of our analysis. In addition we have measured more candidates with the LINfs3 consensus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p><italic>7) Although the authors have an intriguing model for the co-import of LDHA with LDHB, It would be important to show two-hybrid data to support it, or address it biochemically using co-IP analyses of the LDHB+P and LDHA</italic>.</p><p>We use a two-hybrid (albeit not a yeast two-hybrid) experiment that shows the interaction of LDHBx with LDHA. Numerous descriptions in the literature indicate that any protein can enter peroxisomes when it interacts with a protein that is imported into peroxisomes [eg. McNew et al. TiBS 21, 54-58 (1996), Thoms et al. J Struct Biol 175, 362-371 (2011)]. The two-hybrid assay is based on this co-import and uses LDHA fused with the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in combination with LDHBx fused to the C-terminus of the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP). We show that overexpressed YFP-LDHA can only enter the peroxisome, when CFP-LDHBx is co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). When we mutate the targeting signal of LDHBx in the extension, LDHA cannot enter the peroxisome any more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10–figure supplement 1</xref>). We checked if the amino acid extension present in LDHBx could potentially interfere with the interaction of LDHB with LDHA. To answer this question, we now show the structure of tetrameric LDH in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10–figure supplement 2</xref>. The C-termini of LDHB are at the very surface of LDH with maximum distance from the interaction surface of the protomers. We can conclude the following from this analysis: (1) The (extended) C-terminus of LDHBx is unlikely to interfere with the oligomerization in the tetramer, and (2) the C-terminal extension is easily accessible to the peroxisomal import receptor PEX5 that must bind the short PTS1 contained in the additional amino acids. If the extension was buried inside the protein, it could affect conformation of LDHBx to interfere with LDHA binding, and the extension would be inaccessible to PEX5, and thereby LDHBx-containing oligomers could not be targeted to the peroxisome.</p><p><italic>8) Although they clearly demonstrate that the extended protein is addressed to the peroxysome it is still not clear what is the function of this protein in this organelle. There is no clear demonstration of a physiological function for this protein. Is there any genetic disease linked either to the absence of the PTS1 motif in LDHB or to the modification of the readthrough consensus motif identified by the authors?</italic></p><p>At least six previous studies found LDH activity and/or LDH protein(s) in the peroxisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McGroarty et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Osmundsen, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Völkl and Fahimi, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumgart et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McClelland et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gronemeyer et al., 2013</xref>). One of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumgart et al., 1996</xref>) experimentally addresses the function of the protein in this organelle and suggested a role in NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration. In spite of all these reports of peroxisomal LDH association, it has never been universally accepted that LDH indeed enters the peroxisome and indeed exerts a function in peroxisomes, because a targeting signal or targeting mechanism could not be identified. In the second, cell biological part of our paper we therefore chose to study the readthrough-dependent targeting (as a function of the readthrough-extension) of LDHBx to peroxisomes. We not only identify a (cryptic) peroxisomal targeting signal, and peroxisomal localization of a protein, but also provide evidence for readthrough-dependent targeting to the peroxisome. We show that targeting (1) occurs in untransfected cells; (2) is dependent on the stop codon: UAA, a tighter stop codon than UGA, abrogates targeting, whereas UGG, a sense-mutation of the stop, improved targeting; and (3) that aminoglycoside –treatment increases the amount of LDH in the peroxisome. Our work provides an answer to this long-standing question, of how LDH enters the peroxisome.</p><p>At the moment, the LDHBx extension is expected to be in the 3’UTR, so it is not under scrutiny when it comes to the identification of genetic diseases by exon sequencing. We are however, discussing what is probably the only known disease associated with the LINfs3 consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pacho et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p><italic>9) Concerning the molecular mechanism involved. The fact that this readthrough is UGA specific is very intriguing. Indeed up to now the context is known to modify readthrough efficiency but not in such extend. We would expect variations but not a total absence of readthrough product with the two other stop codons. This is reminiscent to the insertion of Sel that is also specific of the UGA codon. It seems that this possibility can be excluded due to the absence of a SECIS element, but can you clearly exclude an alternative mechanism such an editing or an alternative splicing? Supplementary data answering these questions will be important to provide</italic>.</p><p>We now show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> that the readthrough for LDHBx is indeed UGA specific, because we find absence of readthrough (or only background levels) with the other stop codons or mutations in the LINfs3 consensus. We agree about the absence of SECIS element. However, we analyzed LDHB and the other experimentally tested transcripts regarding potential A-to-I editing sites using the RADAR database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rnaedit.com">http://rnaedit.com</ext-link>), and based on these results we can exclude RNA editing in these transcripts. We are certain that alternative splicing does not occur that close to the stop codon, because alternatively spliced transcripts would be included in the Ensembl database and as such would have been subject of our genome-wide <italic>in silico</italic> screen. Perhaps the most convincing argument ruling out RNA editing or splicing is our finding that the apparent readthrough is strongly induced (in some cases more the 40-fold) by aminoglycosides in the SCC as well as in the full-length experiments. Neither RNA editing nor splicing are known to be stimulated by these drugs.</p><p><italic>10) It is unclear whether RTP identifies true readthrough candidates, because there are no obvious negative controls to determine whether the readthrough level is “programmed”</italic>.</p><p><italic>The authors select fifteen stop codon contexts scored by the lin model, and measure their readthrough rates using an eYFP-stop-luciferase reporter. The observed readthrough rates</italic> – <italic>with the exceptions of MDH1 (2.91% readthrough) and LDHB (1.55%) are quite low, ranging from 0.1-0.66%. This is a much lower amount of readthrough than is observed for bovine VEGF-Ax (10%,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"><italic>Eswarappa et al., 2014</italic></xref><italic>) or various human genes (ranging from 0.7 to 60%,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"><italic>Dunn et al., 2013</italic></xref><italic>). It is unclear whether this amount of readthrough represents a basal level of readthrough that could be obtained with more or less any stop codon context, or an elevated level of readthrough due to something special about the nucleotide contexts selected by the lin model</italic>.</p><p><italic>To address this, the authors should include in this assay a set of negative controls, including a construct lacking luciferase, and a set of contexts with very low RTP scores, to establish a background readthrough rate. The authors should then discuss how far above background, if at all, their readthrough candidates are</italic>.</p><p>Our data and experiments contain negative controls in the sense that we have included many genes with low RTP and therefore a low BTR, for example PPP1R3F (0.18%), or PRDM10 (0.13%), or THG1L (0.15%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we have now included a new negative control that is even better suited than a luciferase-less control to establish the background levels: We use a construct that has two successive stop codons. This construct shows a BTR of 0.13%, indicating that this is the background level below we cannot distinguish between readthrough and experimental noise. As we neither want to obscure this fact, nor do we want to artificially scale our data, we decided not to subtract this value in the BTR measurement. Instead we indicate the background level in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> by a red line. As stated above, due to the specific form of the dual reporter assay we are using, cis-element dependent readthrough cannot be the origin of the readthrough levels we are measuring. The high-RTP consensus emerged from data that was in no way primed to readthrough, so we are confident (even if we cannot prove it), that readthrough of more than 5%, depending on the cell type, cannot be obtained by BTR. For PTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eswarappa et al., 2014</xref>, and probably also Dunn et al., even though the latter study does not analyze the mechanism leading to readthrough) there seem to be no upper limit of readthrough levels, depending on the type of cis-elements and trans-acting factors, even 100% readthrough seem possible. Again, we are very thankful that the reviewers’ comments have given us the opportunity to distinguish between cis-element dependent readthrough (PTR) and SCC-dependent readthrough (BTR). It is clear that BTR can (Loughran et al.) but need not (Eswarappa et al.) be modulated by PTR. And, as stated above and below, the BTR of approx. 1.5% for LDHBx is not low, because, as we explain in the Discussion, it leads to a roughly equal distribution of LDH in the peroxisome and in the cytosol. With higher readthrough, the peroxisomal LDH activity would exceed the cytosolic! Regarding our prediction of readthrough for all human transcripts we are aware that many of the listed RTP values correspond to what could be interpreted as the ‘baseline’ of measurable BTR. We are also aware that negative RTP values are somehow counter-intuitive, as they would suggest a negative BTR, which is not possible. Here, a calibration of RTP values to BRT probabilities by means of, e.g., analysis of the distribution of RTP scores could help to assess more intuitively interpretable RTP values. However, with the limited dataset and the apparent nonlinear dependence of BTR on the SCC a calibration is not possible at the moment. A workaround would be to just include the first 144 (consensus) sequences in Dataset 1 (or trim the list according to the first negative control or an arbitrary threshold), but we feel that readers could be interested in the complete list. (Another possibility for avoiding negative RTP would have been to use “constrained” estimation methods, i.e. methods that avoid negative coefficients. However, for our first approach we wanted to use the simplest methods possible to take into account the limited number of sequences.) We hope that extended datasets of BTR measurements and nonlinear methods in the future will provide improved RTP values.</p><p><italic>11) The authors claim that RTP is a genome-wide predictor of readthrough, but they do not substantiate this claim with genome-wide data. The authors should provide a genome-wide examination of readthrough using some sort of experimental measure. For example, they could estimate readthrough rates genome-wide using published ribosome profiling data, and compare these to the predictions made by RTP</italic>.</p><p>We have now linked our genome-wide <italic>in silico</italic> screen better to existing experimental data on translational readthrough. We have analyzed more candidates to validate the LINfs3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We have extended the Discussion on the hits found in several studies comparing them in more detail. We have also added a figure (supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) describing the overlap between our data and the previously identified readthrough proteins. This includes a search for existing readthrough proteins for the consensus described in our paper and an extended the discussion on why there is relatively little overlap between the different approaches applied so far. And we have extended the discussion on the regression between measured BTR and RTP.</p><p><italic>12) The authors claim that RTP is quantitative, but provide no analysis of its quantitative performance. The authors should provide an explicit analysis demonstrating that RTP is quantitative, or a discussion of why it might not be, especially in light of the fact that they acknowledge that “...there is non-linear contribution to RTP in the sense that other high-RTP genes are likely to show readthrough levels higher than predicted.” Such an analysis might be a quantitative comparison (e.g. a scatter plot and a Pearson correlation coefficient) of predicted and observed readthrough rates for all stop codon contexts tested, or an ROC curve describing the sensitivity and specificity of RTP at different score thresholds. Finally, because RTP is a new metric, descriptive statistics on the RTP score distribution should be provided to facilitate interpretation of individual scores</italic>.</p><p>We added scatter plots showing the correlation of BTR and RTP for 81 sequences for the LINiter as well as the LINfs3 model (Figure supplements to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref>). Here, the RTP values have been obtained from predictions within the leave-one-out cross-validation and are therefore an indicator of the generalization capacity of our approach. The plots show a nonlinear dependency of BTR and RTP for both models, indicating that nonlinear regression models could provide a better fit. The Pearson correlation for both models is significant but weak with the LINfs3 model showing a slightly higher correlation (0.41, p=0.0001) than the LINiter model (0.34, p=0.0022). This suggests that the LINfs3 model with its only 15 parameters is more suitable for our purpose than the LINiter model with 51 parameters. Due to the lack of true negative readthrough (readthrough 0%) examples a computation of classification performance indices such as sensitivity and specificity is not possible. We do not claim RTP to be a new metric; we rather introduce this notion to keep the formulation throughout the manuscript as concise as possible.</p><p><italic>13) As mentioned above, the readthrough rates observed for the vast majority of candidates identified in this work are very low compared to known examples. It therefore seems likely that stop codons undergoing higher levels of readthrough were either missed by RTP, or not tested by the experimenters. In addition, certain cases of readthrough are regulated in rodents (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59"><italic>Yamaguchi et al., 2012</italic></xref><italic>) and flies (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"><italic>Dunn et al., 2013</italic></xref><italic>; Robinson &amp; Cooley, 1997) or differ between different wild-type yeast strains (Torabi &amp; Kruglyak, 2011). Consistent with these observations, the authors themselves note that LDHB undergoes far more readthrough in human U118 cells (∼5%) compared to human fibroblasts and HEK cells (1-2%). It is therefore possible that these models could be overfit to the cell type in which the experiment was performed, in addition to the specific contexts on which the models were trained. In light of these facts, the authors must establish the scope of their claims</italic>.</p><p>The BTR readthrough rates are in the low percent range. As detailed above, we provide evidence that these rates are entirely dependent on the SCC and do not require cis-elements or trans-factors. Considering our finding that readthrough of some of the LINfs3 consensus candidates are at least 10-fold above the physiological background, we do not think that, from the perspective of a stop codon and its’ usual function to stop translation, these are low rates. It is clear that the RTP approach would miss any cases of readthrough that is independent of the stop codon, and we now state this more clearly in the Introduction, the Results and in the Discussion. Overfitting: we are aware that the number of 66/81 sequences represents the lower limit for a multivariate regression on 51 dimensions. However, with that knowledge in mind we deliberately restricted our analysis to linear models, applied a rigorous model validation using a leave-one-out strategy and performed a feature selection procedure to further reduce the number of model parameters (to 15 in the case of LINfs3). The fact that we could identify the relevant position of the SCC as well as the consensus motif for high RTP assured us that our model generalizes as good as possible for linear approaches. Furthermore, we pave the way for future extended datasets that now can be built by concentrating on the relevant SCC positions. This reduces the number of experiments for fully specified BTR assessment based on the SCC considerably (from 4^12*3 ∼ 50,000,000 to 4^3*3=192) and will allow the application of nonlinear models for RTP prediction. The additional experiments we have added to test the LINfs3 consensus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) suggest that the predictions derived from one cell type in principle can be applied to another, although the overall level of BTR may differ between cell types.</p></body></sub-article></article>
