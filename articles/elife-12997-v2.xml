We previously found genetic clearance of senescent cells from progeroid INK-ATTAC mice prevents lipodystrophy. Here we show that primary human senescent fat progenitors secrete activin A and directly inhibit adipogenesis in non-senescent progenitors. Blocking activin A partially restored lipid accumulation and expression of key adipogenic markers in differentiating progenitors exposed to senescent cells. Mouse fat tissue activin A increased with aging. Clearing senescent cells from 18-month-old naturally-aged INK-ATTAC mice reduced circulating activin A, blunted fat loss, and enhanced adipogenic transcription factor expression within 3 weeks. JAK inhibitor suppressed senescent cell activin A production and blunted senescent cell-mediated inhibition of adipogenesis. Eight weeks-treatment with ruxolitinib, an FDA-approved JAK1/2 inhibitor, reduced circulating activin A, preserved fat mass, reduced lipotoxicity, and increased insulin sensitivity in 22-month-old mice. Our study indicates targeting senescent cells or their products may alleviate age-related dysfunction of progenitors, adipose tissue, and metabolism.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12997.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12997.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12997.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The likelihood of developing metabolic diseases such as diabetes increases with age. This is, in part, because the cells within fat and other tissues become less sensitive to the hormone insulin as people and other animals get older. Also, the stem cells that give rise to new, insulin-responsive fat cells become dysfunctional with increasing age. This is related to the accumulation of “senescent” cells, which, unlike normal fat cell progenitors, release molecules that are toxic to nearby and distant cells.</p> <p>Xu, Palmer et al. have now investigated if senescent cells interfere with the activity of stem cells from human fat tissue, and if getting rid of these senescent cells might restore the normal activity and insulin responsiveness of aged fat tissue. The experiments revealed that human senescent fat cell progenitors release a protein called activin A, which impedes the normal function of stem cells and fat tissue. Additionally, older mice had higher levels of activin A in both their blood and fat tissue than young mice.</p> <p>Xu, Palmer et al. then analyzed older mice that had been engineered to have senescent fat cells that could be triggered to essentially kill themselves when the mice were treated with a drug. Eliminating the senescent cells from these mice led to lower levels of activin A and more fat tissue (due to improved stem cell capacity to become fully functional fat cells) that expressed genes required for insulin responsiveness. This showed that senescent cells are a cause of age-related fat tissue loss and metabolic disease in older mice.</p> <p>Next, Xu, Palmer et al. treated older mice with drugs called JAK inhibitors, which they found reduce the production of activin A by senescent cells isolated from fat tissue. After two months of treatment, the levels of activin A in the blood and in fat tissue were indeed reduced. The fat tissue in treated mice also showed fewer features associated with the development of diabetes than the fat tissue of untreated mice. As such, these results paralleled those after selectively eliminating the senescent cells.</p> <p>Together these findings suggest that JAK inhibitors or drugs (called senolytics) that selectively eliminate senescent cells may have clinical benefits in treating age-related conditions such as diabetes and stem cell dysfunction.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12997.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12997.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>INK-ATTAC</kwd><kwd>JAK/STAT</kwd><kwd>ruxolitinib</kwd><kwd>Activin A</kwd><kwd>insulin sensitivity</kwd><kwd>adipose-derived stem cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>Michael D</given-names></name><name><surname>LeBrasseur</surname><given-names>Nathan K</given-names></name><name><surname>Kirkland</surname><given-names>James L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LeBrasseur</surname><given-names>Nathan K</given-names></name><name><surname>Kirkland</surname><given-names>James L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Senescent cells contribute to age-related fat dysfunction and can directly impair healthy fat progenitor function, in part, via the secretion of activin A.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A major function of adipose tissue is to store potentially cytotoxic lipids, including fatty acids (FAs), as less reactive neutral triglycerides (TG) within fat droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Listenberger et al., 2003</xref>).

Cellular senescence refers to an essentially irreversible arrest of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayflickl and Moorhead, 1961</xref>).

Cultures of progenitors isolated from adipose depots of older animals or humans contain senescent cells and exhibit impaired adipogenic capacity, with reduced lipid accumulation and C/EBPα and PPARγ expression after exposure to differentiation-inducing stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tchkonia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tchkonia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Park et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mitterberger et al., 2014</xref>). Senescent cells appear to be able to spread inflammatory activation and perhaps even senescence to nearby non-senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nelson et al., 2012</xref>). In previous work, we used a genetically modified INK-ATTAC (<italic>Cdkn2a /p16<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> promoter driven apoptosis through targeted activation of caspase) mouse model to selectively eliminate <italic>Cdkn2a (p16<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic>) positive senescent cells through apoptosis by the administration of AP20187, a drug that induces dimerization of a membrane-bound myristoylated FK506 binding protein fused with caspase 8 (FKBP–Casp8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2011</xref>). We showed that clearance of senescent cells can delay age-related phenotypes including lordokyphosis and cataract formation, and can actually reverse age-related fat loss in progeroid <italic>BubR1<sup>H/H</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2011</xref>) , implicating senescent cells as a driver of age-related phenotypes. Furthermore, interleukin-6 (IL6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gustafson and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Okada et al., 2012</xref>) , tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tchkonia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gustafson and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Okada et al., 2012</xref>) , and interferon γ (IFNγ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McGillicuddy et al., 2009</xref>) can inhibit adipogenesis in vitro. These factors are among the SASP components in senescent fat progenitors and other senescent cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tchkonia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coppé et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coppé et al., 2010</xref>). However, causal links between these paracrine factors and impaired adipogenesis related to cellular senescence have not been demonstrated. We recently reported that the JAK/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway plays a role in regulating the SASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that JAK inhibition might rescue impaired adipogenesis due to senescent cells and thus preserve fat mass and metabolic function in older individuals.</p><p>We report here that senescent fat progenitors impede differentiation of non-senescent progenitors, in part by secreting activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor superfamily, which can inhibit adipogenesis and interfere with stem cell and progenitor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zaragosi et al., 2010</xref>). Eliminating senescent cells from naturally-aged INK-ATTAC mice reduced activin A and increased adipose tissue <italic>C/EBPα</italic> and <italic>PPARγ</italic>. JAK pathway inhibition suppressed production of activin A by senescent fat progenitors and partially rescued adipogenic capacity both in vitro and in vivo. JAK inhibition in aged mice reduced lipotoxicity and increased insulin sensitivity. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of age-related progenitor dysfunction, fat loss, and metabolic dysfunction, as well as potential therapeutic avenues for preventing or alleviating these common conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Senescent fat cell progenitors impede adipogenesis</title><p>To determine if senescent cells influence adipogenesis in adjacent non-senescent cells, we devised a co-culture system with non-senescent human primary fat progenitors as 'target' cells and either senescent or non-senescent human progenitors as 'source' cells. Primary cells were isolated from the stromal-vascular fraction of collagenase-digested subcutaneous fat from healthy human subjects undergoing surgery to donate a kidney. Cells were passaged 4–6 times under conditions to enrich for fat progenitors as opposed to endothelial cells or macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tchkonia et al., 2013</xref>). These cells were exposed to 10 Gy irradiation, which induced at least 70% of cells to become senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SABG) -positive within 20 days, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Target cells were distinguished from source cells by fluorescent labeling (CM-DiI) , which does not independently affect adipogenesis. We differentiated the mixture of cells using an adipogenic differentiation medium (DM) for 15 days. Differentiation was assessed by examining lipid accumulation inside the cells. We considered a cell to be differentiated if it contained doubly refractile lipid droplets visible by low power phase contrast microscopy, a change that occurs in fat cell progenitors following DM exposure, but not in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karagiannides et al., 2006</xref>).

However, it is still unknown whether senescent cell clearance has effect on age-related adipose phenotypes in naturally aged mice. To test this, we treated late middle-aged (18-month-old) INK-ATTAC<sup>+/-</sup> and wild-type (WT) littermates with two 3-day courses of AP20187, with 14 days between treatments, for 3 weeks (total 6 days of treatment) to activate the caspase-8 moiety in the <italic>ATTAC</italic> suicide gene product that is expressed only in <italic>p16<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic>positive senescent cells. This allowed us to investigate the short-term response to senescent cell clearance, for example effects on adipogenic transcription factors, and to reduce effects of possible long-term compensatory responses.

We also previously observed that direct addition of recombinant activin A to cultured human fat progenitors impedes adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zaragosi et al., 2010</xref>).

We therefore tested whether JAK inhibition alleviates impaired adipogenesis related to senescence. CM prepared from senescent progenitors exposed to JAK inhibitor caused less inhibition of adipogenesis in non-senescent target progenitors than CM prepared from senescent cells exposed to vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,d</xref>). Since JAK inhibitor was present in the CM, we examined whether the improvement of adipogenesis in the target non-senescent cells was due to the effect of JAK inhibitor on the senescent source cells or if JAK inhibitor had direct effects on the target cells. Addition of JAK inhibitor directly to CM previously collected from either control or senescent cells did not affect adipogenesis in the target non-senescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). This indicates that JAK inhibitor alleviated impaired adipogenesis mainly by acting on the senescent source fat progenitors, in turn altering the composition of the CM, rather than having direct effects on the target cells.

We also examined other potential causes of preservation of fat mass by JAK inhibition. Administering JAK inhibitor did not change metabolic rate or food intake in aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), and was previously found by us to actually increase activity of old mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Expression of two lipolytic enzymes, adipose triglyceride lipase (<italic>ATGL</italic>) and hormone-sensitive lipase (<italic>HSL</italic>), was induced in fat tissue by JAK inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). This suggests that the fat maintenance we observed was not due to increased food intake, decreased energy expenditure, or decreased lipolysis. Next, we examined whether increased adipogenic capacity was associated with suppressed FA spillover and ectopic lipid accumulation. Plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels were reduced by JAK inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>), while TG was not different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>).

JAK inhibitor improved glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a,b</xref>) and insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d,e</xref>) in 22-month-old mice, while it had little effect in young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Adipose tissue function declines with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tchkonia et al., 2010</xref>), likely contributing to increased prevalence of metabolic disorders with aging. Thus, potential pharmacotherapies that alleviate age-related adipose tissue dysfunction may lead to important clinical benefit. Previously, we found that senescent cells contribute to age-related adipose tissue dysfunction in a progeroid mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we used progenitor cells isolated from human adipose tissue to demonstrate that senescent cells directly inhibit adipogenesis of non-senescent human fat progenitors. One mechanism by which senescent cells exert this inhibitory effect is through secretion of activin A, a protein that we previously showed inhibits adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zaragosi et al., 2010</xref>). We tested the role of senescent cells in naturally-aged INK-ATTAC mice and confirmed that senescent cells play a causal role in age-related fat dysfunction in vivo. Moreover, we found that JAK inhibitor reduced activin A secretion both in vitro and in vivo. Two months of JAK inhibitor administration preserved adipose tissue function and restored insulin sensitivity in 22-month-old mice. Our study provides proof-of-concept evidence that senescent cells play an important role in age-related adipose tissue loss and dysfunction. It also suggests that inhibiting the JAK signaling pathway or selectively eliminating senescent cells hold promise as avenues to prevent or treat age-related metabolic dysfunction.</p><p>The JAK/STAT pathway plays an important role in adipose tissue development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richard and Stephens, 2014</xref>). Previously, we found that JAK inhibitor treatment inhibited production of SASP factors and improved physical function in aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we show that JAK1/2 inhibition has metabolic benefits in aged mice. JAK inhibitor treatment suppressed activin A production by senescent cells in vitro and in fat progenitors, fat tissue, and the circulation in aged mice. These observations are concordant with improved adipogenesis and reduced activin A in fat tissue after genetic clearance of senescent cells from 18-month-old INK-ATTAC<italic><sup>+/- </sup></italic>mice. One possible mechanism for improved adipogenesis and fat tissue function by JAK inhibitor treatment is reduction of activin A production by senescent cells. Other SASP components (i.e. IL-6, TNFα, and IFNγ) may also contribute to impairment of adipose tissue function in aged animals.</p><p>It is possible that mechanisms other than those directly affecting senescent cells contributed to the improved adipogenesis we found. Also, senescent cells of many types and in multiple tissues, not only in fat, are likely affected by systemic administration of JAK1/2 inhibitors to mice or AP20187 to INK-ATTAC animals. Very likely, these systemic effects of our interventions contributed to alleviating metabolic dysfunction. To partially address this, rather than conducting an epistasis experiment (treating senescent cell-depleted INK-ATTAC mice with JAK inhibitor to check for off-target effects), we compared effects of JAK inhibitor treatment in old to young mice, since the latter have fewer senescent cells, like AP20187-treated INK-ATTAC mice. We feel this experiment achieves essentially the same goals as would an epistasis experiment, and arguably may even have certain advantages: potential off-target effects of AP20187 are avoided and senescent cells are very few in young mice, unlike older AP20187-treated INK-ATTAC mice, in which more than 50% of senescent cells can remain after treatment with AP20187 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The lack of substantial effects of JAK inhibitor treatment on adipogenesis, fat depot weights, and insulin sensitivity in young animals, but strong effects in old animals with higher senescent cell burden and activin A, coupled with parallel effects between JAK inhibitor treatment in wild type mice to those of genetic clearance with AP20187 in INK-ATTAC mice, suggest that effects of JAK inhibitors on senescent cells may contribute to improved metabolic function in older mice.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with the speculation that impaired adipogenesis leads to ectopic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gustafson et al., 2015</xref>). We found that JAK pathway inhibition led to maintained fat mass and enhanced metabolic function in tandem with improved adipogenic capacity in aged mice. Expression of <italic>PPARγ</italic> and <italic>C/EBPα</italic>, both of which are essential for insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El-Jack et al., 1999</xref>) , increased in adipose tissue of JAK inhibitor-treated mice. These changes were accompanied by reduced circulating FFAs and hepatic lipid accumulation, two important manifestations of lipotoxicity associated with insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Slawik and Vidal-Puig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boden, 2011</xref>). Indeed, JAK inhibition improved insulin sensitivity in these mice. In addition to improved adipogenesis, JAK inhibition reduces systemic inflammation (including reducing circulating IL6) in aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) and promotes 'browning' of adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moisan et al., 2015</xref>) , both of which are known to affect adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity. These mechanisms might also contribute to improved insulin sensitivity in aged mice in addition to reduced activin A level. Importantly, JAK inhibition improved adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity in aged mice but did so much less in younger mice, suggesting that the JAK pathway participates in age- or senescence-related pathogenesis of adipose tissue dysfunction. Furthermore, the effects of JAK inhibitors seem to be similar in mouse, rat, and human models. This is consistent with the speculation that the most fundamental aging mechanisms are conserved across mammalian species.</p><p>Activin A is a member of the transforming growth factor superfamily and is involved in a variety of biological events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xia and Schneyer, 2009</xref>). Activin A has widespread effects on multiple types of progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zaragosi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowser et al., 2013</xref>) both directly and through interaction with the closely related growth and differentiation factors (GDFs), which share receptor and signaling mechanisms with activin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sako et al., 2010</xref>). Our results suggest that circulating activin A levels could be a bio-marker of senescent cell burden since: 1) circulating levels of activin A increase with aging, consistent with the increase in senescent cell abundance with aging, 2) senescent cells secrete activin A, 3) genetic clearance of senescent cells from 18-month-old INK-ATTAC<italic><sup>+/- </sup></italic>mice reduced circulating activin A, and 4) JAK inhibition suppresses activin A production in senescent cells in vitro and in aged mice in vivo. It is important to note that a variety of cell types can regulate activin A production, including macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zaragosi et al., 2010</xref>). It is possible that these cell types contribute to increased activin A levels with aging. It will be valuable to study the effect of specific inhibition of activin A during aging. However, most activin A-blocking agents such as follistatin also inhibit myostatin due to structural similarity to activin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cash et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakatani et al., 2008</xref>). These agents would therefore be anticipated to alter both muscle and fat mass though additional mechanisms that may be independent of activin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McPherron and Lee, 2002</xref>).</p><p>JAK inhibitor treatment did not alter lean mass in aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,e</xref>). Thus, JAK inhibition might be superior to current activin A-blocking agents for alleviation of age-related adipose tissue dysfunction. Ruxolitinib, the JAK1/2 inhibitor we used in vivo, is approved by FDA for treating myelofibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Verstovsek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrison et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Verstovsek et al., 2012</xref>). Although it has side-effects in human subjects with myelofibrosis including anemia and thrombocytopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Verstovsek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Verstovsek et al., 2012</xref>) , we and others found that ruxolitinib has minimal effects on peripheral blood cell populations in both young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quintás-Cardama et al., 2010</xref>) and old mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Considerable work remains to be done to assess potential side-effects from JAK1/2 inhibitors, especially in older subjects. We stress this needs to be done before contemplating their use for age-related dysfunction in clinical practice.</p><p>We observed an unusually rapid loss of fat from 18-month old INK-ATTAC<italic><sup>+/- </sup></italic>mice within 3 weeks. This fat loss could be related to the need to administer AP20187 by intraperitoneal (ip) injection, despite our making every effort to reduce this effect. Both WT and INK-ATTAC<italic><sup>+/- </sup></italic>mice were injected ip with AP20187 for three consecutive days, with 14 days between treatments. Thus, both groups received 6 ip injections within 3 weeks, the stress from which might have accelerated fat loss. Due to limited numbers of naturally aged INK-ATTAC<italic><sup>+/- </sup></italic>mice, we selected the most closely matched control group to detect an effect of clearing senescent cells on activin A and adipogenesis. The strategy of treating both the WT and INK-ATTAC<italic><sup>+/- </sup></italic>littermates with AP20187 had the advantages that both the treated and control groups received ip injection of the same drug in parallel. We used 18-month-old INK-ATTAC<italic><sup>+/- </sup></italic>mice because we have previously observed that 18 month old mice already have a detectable increase in senescent cell burden in their adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stout et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, we decided to focus on the acute effect of clearance of senescent cells from INK-ATTAC<italic><sup>+/- </sup></italic>mice on adipogenic transcription factor expression, which can precede other changes. Therefore, we decided to treat these INK-ATTAC<italic><sup>+/- </sup></italic>mice for 3 weeks. Intermittent clearance of senescent cells with AP20187 was used based on our recent finding that senolytics are effective when administered intermittently, likely because senescent cells do not divide and may be slow to re-accumulate once cleared in the absence of a strong continuing insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, AP20187 has to be administered i.p., precluding daily administration. On the other hand, we showed that JAK inhibitors, which blunt the SASP and can be administered orally, need to be continuously present to inhibit the SASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated a likely causal role for senescent cells in age-related fat dysfunction and discovered a novel mechanism through which senescent cells can directly impair healthy fat progenitor function. Pharmacologic inhibition of the JAK pathway reduced activin A production in vitro and in vivo, alleviated age-related adipose tissue dysfunction, and improved insulin sensitivity in aged mice. Albeit speculative, our findings are consistent with the general hypothesis that senescent cells might exert profound effects on tissue and organismal function by affecting normal progenitors or stem cells through production of TGFβ family members, such as activin A, and potentially other types of factors secreted by senescent cells. Our work suggests that targeting senescent cells or their products could be a promising avenue for delaying, preventing, alleviating, or treating age-related stem cell, progenitor, and adipose tissue dysfunction and metabolic disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>Primary human fat progenitors were isolated from subcutaneous fat collected from healthy, lean (BMI 26.6 ± 0.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) kidney donors aged 39 ± 3.3 years as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tchkonia et al., 2005</xref>).

Human fat cell progenitors were also treated with 0.2 μM doxorubicin for 24 hours to induce senescence. Senescence was induced by irradiation unless otherwise indicated. For co-culture experiments, primary progenitors were stained with CellTracker CM-DiI dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. These cells were then seeded into wells containing either non-senescent control or senescent progenitors. The mixtures of cells were differentiated for 15 days. Differentiation of progenitors was assessed by observers who were not aware of which treatments the cultures had been exposed to.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor) and two reviewers: Andrew Dillin, who also served as Reviewing Editor, and Amy Wagers.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>The manuscript by Kirkland and colleagues investigates the influence of senescent cells on adiposity in aged animals. The authors present evidence that soluble factors produced by senescent cells inhibit the differentiation of non-senescent adipogenic progenitors, and, using a transgenic system that ablates senescent cells in vivo, they show that reducing the endogenous burden of senescent cells prevents age-related loss of fat mass. The manuscript is well-written, clearly describes the approach and rationale for the work (although the INK-ATTAC system could be described in a bit more detail here, rather than simply referring to past work), and presents a logical series of experiments. The demonstration that senescent cell ablation rescues a phenotype of normal aging is a significant advance, which has been anticipated by the aging research community since the original publication of the INK-ATTAC allele and its effects in a progeroid mouse model. In the current paper, the authors also investigate the potential molecular mediators of the effects of senescent cells on adipose tissue. They implicate activin A as a critical mediator of the suppression of adipogenesis by senescent cells and suggest that its production by senescent cells requires activation of JAK signaling. Consistent with this, JAK inhibition reduces activin A production and partially rescues adipogenesis, restores fat mass, and increases insulin sensitivity in aged mice.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>The authors do not fully close the loop on the proposed mechanism, as the manuscript in its current form does not fully link the effects of JAK inhibition in vivo with JAK inhibition in senescent cells. In other words, it remains possible that inhibition of JAK signaling in other cell types contributes to the observed phenotypes, a caveat that the authors do mention. Ideally, this caveat would be addressed experimentally (e.g. by treating the INK-ATAAC mice with JAKi), especially since the basic components of the mechanism were already known.</p> <p>While both reviewers agree that this experiment would put this paper over the edge, we agree that the paper should be accepted if the authors temper their claims of mechanism within the text, highlighting this point (unless of course this data is in hand).</p> <p>Lastly, both reviewers had issues with the weight gain studies. This point needs to be addressed (see details below).</p> <p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p> <p>Following-up on a previous study, Xu and co-workers investigated the nature of the signal secreted by senescent cells to cause age-dependent lipodystrophy and decline in glucose homeostasis. In an extensive body of work the authors propose that the secreted factor is Activin A and acts via a downstream effector in adipose tissue, the JAK signaling pathway. Using a pharmacologic approach, they show that JAK signaling interferes with differentiation of non-senescent progenitor cells, and inhibits adipogenesis in vitro. The strength of this paper relies on in vivo mouse models where pharmacological inhibition of Activin-A/JAK reduces lipotoxicity and increased insulin sensitivity in aged mice. However, in order to be accepted for publication, two major concerns must be addressed:</p> <p>1) Specificity of Activin A in the senescent response:</p> <p>When inhibiting SASP factors, only results implicating Activin A as an adipogenesis inhibitor are presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, the text also mentions testing IL6, TNFα, IFNγ. Please provide the data in the figure. Additionally, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, it is shown that JAK inhibits Activin A production by senescent fat progenitors. Other potential mediators of the senescent response are dismissed. These data must be presented in order to consolidate the role of Activin A in the senescent response. Later in the paper, JAK inhibition of the Activin A pathway is presented as a partial way to rescue adipogenesis and improve metabolic parameters in old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). This implies that other factors are also participating in the degradation of adipogenesis with age. Please speculate in the Discussion on other SASP factors that might work together with Activin A to affect lipotoxicity with age.</p> <p>2) Mouse studies design:</p> <p>Why are the wild-type mice loosing fat so rapidly at 18 months in just 3 weeks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>? Other studies in C57BL/6 do not report such a dramatic body weight change with age (Selan et al., Science 2009, Ortega-Molina et al., Cell Metab 2012, Riera et al., Cell 2014, etc.). It seems highly unlikely that fat loss with age occurs so dramatically in the course of 3 weeks. Also, a vehicle control for the INK-ATTAC and WT mice must be provided in addition to drug treatment.</p> <p>Later in the manuscript, treatment with the JAK inhibitor is assessed in older animals (22 months) over the course of 8 weeks. The experimental procedure used here is more convincing to observe a change in adipogenesis and glucose metabolism with age than the INK-ATTAC experiment. Can the authors comment on why they used different ages, and different latencies of drug treatment in INK-ATTAC versus JAK inhibitor treatment?</p> <p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p> <p>The manuscript by Kirkland and colleagues investigates the influence of senescent cells on adiposity in aged animals.

Rather than conducting an epistasis experiment (treating senescent cell-depleted INK-ATTAC mice with JAK inhibitor to check for off-target effects), we instead compared effects of JAK inhibitor treatment in old to young mice, since the latter, like AP20187-treated INK-ATTAC mice, have fewer senescent cells. In the young mice, treating with the JAK inhibitor did not reduce activin A expression or improve adipogenesis in their fat tissue. Insulin sensitivity was not altered by JAK inhibition in the young animals either. We believe this piece of new evidence further supports our proposed mechanism for JAK inhibition in vivo. We feel this experiment achieves essentially the same goals as the suggested epistasis experiment, and arguably may even have certain advantages: potential off-target effects of AP20187 are avoided and senescent cells are very few in young mice, unlike older AP20187-treated INK-ATTAC mice, in which around 50% of senescent cells remain after treatment with AP20187. We included these new data and discussion about these points in the revised manuscript.</p> <p>We also point out in the revised Discussion that, as the editor correctly suggests, JAK inhibitors most likely also have effects on multiple cell types besides senescent cells. These effects could well contribute to our findings. However, the lack of substantial effects on adipogenesis, fat depot weights, and insulin sensitivity in young animals, but strong effects in old animals with higher senescent cell burden and activin A, coupled with parallel effects between JAK inhibitor treatment in wild type mice to those of genetic clearance with AP20187 in INK-ATTAC mice, indicate that effects of JAK inhibitors on senescent cells potentially contribute to improved metabolic function in older mice.</p> <p><italic>While both reviewers agree that this experiment would put this paper over the edge, we agree that the paper should be accepted if the authors temper their claims of mechanism within the text, highlighting this point (unless of course this data is in hand).</italic></p> <p>We tempered our claims of proposed mechanism in the Abstract, Results, and Discussion.

In our recently published work, we showed that JAK inhibitors suppress IL6 and TNFα secretion by senescent cells (but not for IFNγ; Xu, M., et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA); published ahead of print November 2, 2015, doi:10.1073/pnas.1515386112). We included this information in our revised manuscript. We also discussed the potential role of these factors in age-related metabolic dysfunction in the Discussion.</p> <p><italic>2) Mouse studies design:</italic></p> <p> <italic>Why are the wild-type mice loosing fat so rapidly at 18 months in just 3 weeks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>? Other studies in C57BL/6 do not report such a dramatic body weight change with age (Selan et al., Science 2009, Ortega-Molina et al., Cell Metab 2012, Riera et al., Cell 2014, etc.). It seems highly unlikely that fat loss with age occurs so dramatically in the course of 3 weeks. Also, a vehicle control for the INK-ATTAC and WT mice must be provided in addition to drug treatment.</italic></p> <p>We agree with that the rapid fat loss in our INK-ATTAC mouse model is unusual. We believe this rapid fat loss could be related to the need to administer AP20187 by intraperitoneal (ip) injection, despite our making every effort to reduce this effect. Both wild type (WT) and INK-ATTAC mice were injected ip with AP20187 for three consecutive days, with 14 days between treatments. Thus, both groups received 6 ip injections within 3 weeks, the stress from which might have accelerated fat loss.</p> <p>We also agree that a vehicle control for the INK-ATTAC and WT mice would be desirable. However, due to limited numbers of naturally aged INK-ATTAC mice, we had to select the most closely matched control group to detect an effect of clearing senescent cells on activin A and adipogenesis. The strategy of treating both the WT and INK-ATTAC littermates with AP20187 had the advantages that both the treated and control groups received ip injection of the same drug in parallel and this strategy controls for any off-target effects of AP20187. We included these points in the revised Discussion.</p> <p> <italic>Later in the manuscript, treatment with the JAK inhibitor is assessed in older animals (22 months) over the course of 8 weeks. The experimental procedure used here is more convincing to observe a change in adipogenesis and glucose metabolism with age than the INK-ATTAC experiment. Can the authors comment on why they used different ages, and different latencies of drug treatment in INK-ATTAC versus JAK inhibitor treatment?</italic> </p> <p>We were able to obtain 22 month old WT mice from NIA, while we needed to generate older INK-ATTAC mice ourselves. We only had 18-month-old INK-ATTAC mice available. From previous work (Stout, M.B., et al., Aging 6:575-586, 2014), we knew that 18-month-old mice already have detectible senescent cell burden in their adipose tissue. Also, we decided to focus on the acute effect of clearance of senescent cells from INK-ATTAC mice on adipogenic transcription factor expression, which can precede other changes. Therefore, we decided to treat these INK-ATTAC mice for 3 weeks, the time at which we had first observed detectible effects of JAK inhibitors. We added these points to the revised Discussion.</p> <p>We used intermittent treatment with AP20187 and continuous treatment with JAK inhibitors. Intermittent clearance of senescent cells with AP20187 was used based on our recent finding that senolytics are effective when administered periodically, likely because senescent cells do not of course divide and may be slow to re-accumulate once cleared in the absence of a strong continuing insult (Zhu, Y., et al., Aging Cell 14:644-658, 2015. PMID: 25754370). Furthermore, the AP20187 has to be administered ip, precluding daily administration. On the other hand, we showed that JAK inhibitors, which blunt the SASP and can be administered orally, need to be continuously present to inhibit the SASP (Xu, M., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA); published ahead of print November 2, 2015, doi:10.1073/pnas.1515386112). We explained our rationale for the different administration strategies in the revised Methods and Discussion.</p> <p>Reviewer #2:</p> <p> <italic>The manuscript by Kirkland and colleagues investigates the influence of senescent cells on adiposity in aged animals.

(USA); published ahead of print November 2, 2015, doi:10.1073/pnas.1515386112). However, activin A was not studied in that paper. Here, we showed that senescent preadipocytes secrete more activin A than non-senescent cells. We also show that activin A secretion by senescent cells can be decreased by JAK inhibitors for the first time. We report that JAK inhibition has metabolic benefits specifically in aged, but not young, mice for the first time as far as we are aware. Restoration of adipogenesis by clearing senescent cells is shown here for the first time. In new data added to the paper, we demonstrate an age-related increase in adipose tissue activin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Nevertheless, as mentioned above, we fully agree that the loop of our proposed mechanism is not completely closed. As suggested by the reviewer, we revised our manuscript accordingly.</p></body> </sub-article></article>
