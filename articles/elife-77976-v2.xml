This has been accelerated by the discovery of new and engineered CRISPR effectors, which have expanded the portfolio of diagnostic applications to include a broad range of pathogenic and non-pathogenic conditions. However, each diagnostic CRISPR pipeline necessitates customized detection schemes based on the fundamental principles of the Cas protein used, its guide RNA (gRNA) design parameters, and the assay readout. This is especially relevant for variant detection, a low-cost alternative to sequencing-based approaches for which no in silico pipeline for the ready-to-use design of CRISPRDx currently exists. In this manuscript, we fill this lacuna using a unified web server, CriSNPr (CRISPR-based SNP recognition), which provides the user with the opportunity to de novo design gRNAs based on six CRISPRDx proteins of choice (<italic>Fn</italic>/en<italic>Fn</italic>Cas9, <italic>Lw</italic>Cas13a, <italic>Lb</italic>Cas12a, <italic>Aa</italic>Cas12b, and Cas14a) and query for ready-to-use oligonucleotide sequences for validation on relevant samples. Furthermore, we provide a database of curated pre-designed gRNAs as well as target/off-target for all human and SARS-CoV-2 variants reported thus far. CriSNPr has been validated on multiple Cas proteins, demonstrating its broad and immediate applicability across multiple detection platforms.

Traditional probe-based diagnostic tests rely on a polynucleotide hybridizing to the target DNA/RNA and providing a readout via an amplification reaction to provide a readout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wetmur, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carpenter et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thaxton et al., 2006</xref>). These quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) tests and their derivatives have proven to be the gold standard for detecting trace amounts of pathogenic nucleic acids in samples, and they have been used globally to detect SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although qRT-PCR is highly sensitive to detect only a few copies of the target pathogenic sequence, its ability to differentiate very closely related sequences has not yet been successfully demonstrated for accurate clinical diagnosis.</p><p>The association of Cas proteins with a target nucleic acid is followed by a secondary readout, either directly through the bound ternary complex or catalytic cleavage of the substrate followed by collateral cleavage of reporter molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jinek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sternberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mali et al., 2013</xref>). DNA/RNA interrogation begins with a guide RNA (gRNA) binding to a target sequence and is then followed by the catalytic activity of Cas effectors. It has been demonstrated that for some Cas proteins, this two-step process generates a very high specificity of target recognition, which can be extended to the diagnosis of single nucleotide variants (SNVs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Teng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karvelis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Myhrvold et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azhar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrington et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acharya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>). In comparison to the gold standard SNV detection technologies based on Sanger/Deep sequencing, which necessitate dedicated infrastructure, manpower, and analysis pipelines, as well as longer turnaround times, CRISPR-based variant calling is an appealing alternative for rapid, low-cost diagnosis of disease-causing mutations. Currently (until January 2022), the ClinVar database contains information on approximately 117,437 (GRCh38) pathogenic human variants associated with diseases, the vast majority of which can be detected using CRISPR-based tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azhar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrington et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Landrum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Landrum et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kellner et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants emphasize the importance of detecting mutations in pathogenic sequences in order to develop public health strategies, effective vaccines, and a better understanding of disease pathophysiology.</p><p>CRISPR-based diagnostics (CRISPRDx) is a relatively new addition to the arsenal of diagnostic methodologies for detecting SNVs. The majority of these pipelines rely on the ability of the Cas protein to differentiate nucleic acids based on mismatches in the gRNA at predetermined positions. This nucleotide position-specific mismatch sensitivity, first reported with <italic>Lw</italic>Cas13a, has now been linked to several other Cas effectors and used for SNV detection, including <italic>Fn</italic>/en<italic>Fn</italic>Cas9, <italic>Lb</italic>Cas12a, <italic>Aa</italic>Cas12b, and Cas14a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Myhrvold et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azhar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrington et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acharya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Acharya et al., 2021</xref>). Several CRISPR/Cas systems have also demonstrated protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) mismatch sensitivity, but because PAM is not always present at the target DNA/RNA sequences, their applicability for diagnostic assays is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Although the overall strategy for mismatch identification remains largely consistent across Cas proteins, each Cas protein possesses distinctive properties with regard to mismatch-sensitive positions in the gRNA. These were discovered through extensive nucleic acid: protein structural and biochemical research. As a result, while the same SNV can be targeted by multiple Cas proteins, each diagnostic strategy necessitates a unique crRNA design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Myhrvold et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azhar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrington et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acharya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Acharya et al., 2021</xref>). Because each Cas system differs in terms of gRNA sequence, readout mode, PAM requirement, and mismatch sensitivity positions, it can be time-consuming for a user to first identify which Cas effector to use and then design appropriate gRNA and primers for performing diagnostic assays. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a unified method that equips any user with the minimal knowledge and information necessary for designing detection assays for any SNV of interest.</p><p>In response, we present a web server called CRISPR-based SNP recognition (CriSNPr) for designing CRISPRDx pipelines across the CRISPR platforms reported so far for variant detection. CriSNPr is a pipeline for CRISPR-based detection of pathogenic and non-pathogenic mutations in all reported human nucleotide variants (SNP Database [dbSNP]) and SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest/concern (VOI/VOC). Furthermore, it allows for the design and implementation of de novo variants of choice. The server searches for the SNV of interest and returns information about all Cas systems that can be used to detect that SNV, as well as the required crRNA and primer design parameters based on gRNA design principles available in the literature for each Cas protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Myhrvold et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azhar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrington et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acharya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Acharya et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, CriSNPr, unlike other available sgRNA design tools, also provides information about off-targets for SNVs targeting modified crRNA sequences and scores them based on the number of off-targets they produce.</p><p>CriSNPr has integrated mismatch-sensitive position data for <italic>Fn</italic>/en<italic>Fn</italic>Cas9, <italic>Lw</italic>Cas13a, <italic>Lb</italic>Cas12a, <italic>Aa</italic>Cas12b, and Cas14a and has been experimentally validated on SNVs for a subset of Cas proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Myhrvold et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azhar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrington et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acharya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Acharya et al., 2021</xref>). To expand its immediate application to existing human and SARS-CoV-2 variants, the current version of CriSNPr contains SNV information from the human dbSNP and SARS-CoV-2 CNCB-NGDC databases. Even without prior sequence information about an SNV, a user can avail designed sequences by using the rsID (Reference SNP cluster ID) for humans or mutant amino acid position for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sherry et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xue et al., 2021</xref>). For new SNV-containing sequences not in CriSNPr’s database, users can fetch crRNA and primer sequences by providing a sequence length of 20–30 nucleotides with an SNV position and variant nucleobase identity. Finally, we were able to experimentally detect the SARS-CoV-2 E484K variant as well as clinically relevant human SNPs rs2073874 and rs138739292 using <italic>Fn</italic>Cas9, Cas14a, and <italic>Aa</italic>Cas12b, exhibiting the efficacy of the crRNA designed by CriSNPr.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conventional gRNA design tools are not tailored for CRISPR diagnostic pipelines</title><p>While there are numerous in silico pipelines for gRNA design for individual Cas proteins, these are primarily intended for gene editing applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haeussler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Montague et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Labun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heigwer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moreno-Mateos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doench et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Concordet and Haeussler, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). For a given Cas9, the workflow for gRNA design integrates specificity and sensitivity scores generated from multiple factors, such as identification of available PAM sites relevant to the target, presence of preferred nucleotides in proximity to PAM, their context within the full-length gRNA sequence, GC (guanine-cytosine) content, and the overall correlation between the gRNA sequence and experimentally validated editing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haeussler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Montague et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heigwer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doench et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to gRNA sequence features, local genetic and epigenetic characteristics, the presence or absence of structural motifs, nucleosome positioning, and other factors are taken into account for optimal gRNA design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Montague et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Labun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Specificity scores are assigned to gRNAs either through alignment to the genome or through hypothesis-driven approaches that incorporate gRNA structural information in addition to sequence data. Machine learning has recently contributed to optimal computational design parameters that empirical sequence and structure-driven gRNA prediction algorithms are unable to incorporate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, these algorithms are designed to make predictions about the best gene-targeting sgRNAs based on the biological parameters of DNA recognition by the individual Cas systems. In the case of CRISPR diagnostics, the paradigm has been empirically shifted; the target sgRNA binding region is relatively fixed, and diagnostic sgRNAs, corresponding amplicons, or reporters must be tailored around the target region. For each Cas used in the diagnosis of a particular SNV, the available PAMs and the guidelines for mismatch sensitivity positions are unique. Also distinct is the off-targeting propensity of gRNAs designed based on the Cas effector of choice, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nucleotide mismatch sensitive crRNA positions have been reported for a variety of Cas systems.</title><p>These positions are included in CRISPR-based SNP recognition (CriSNPr) for <italic>Lw</italic>Cas13a, <italic>Lb</italic>Cas12a, Cas14a, <italic>Aa</italic>Cas12b, <italic>FnCas9,</italic> and enFnCas9, respectively.

Cas14a, like <italic>Lb</italic>Cas12a, can cleave ssDNA as well as dsDNA targets but only when targeting dsDNA. Cas14a necessitates a T-rich 5’ TTTA PAM, whereas ssDNA does not have this requirement. Even though Cas14a has sensitivity for only 11 and 12 or 12 crRNA positions, this PAM flexibility is a proposed advantage when used for SNV detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karvelis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrington et al., 2018</xref>). Although <italic>Aa</italic>Cas12b requires 5’ TTN PAM to cleave the ssDNA/dsDNA sequences, it exhibits dual mismatch sensitivity at several positions, expanding the possible target SNV combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Teng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teng et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Aa</italic>Cas12b’s dual mismatch sensitivity has been demonstrated at a wide range of crRNA positions; however, only combinations demonstrating efficient WT and mutated sequence discrimination were chosen. These include positions 1 and 4, positions 1 and 5, positions 4 and 11, positions 5 and 16, and positions 5 and 19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teng et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, previous research suggested that <italic>Fn</italic>/en<italic>Fn</italic>Cas9 systems with dual mismatch sensitivity require mismatches at specific positions, such as 2 and 6 or 16 and 19, preventing target dsDNA binding for variant detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azhar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acharya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to dual mismatch sensitivity, it has been reported that enFnCas9 also exhibits single mismatch sensitivity at the PAM distal 17th, 18th, and 19th positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Acharya et al., 2021</xref>). The ability to faithfully discriminate between sequences contingent on single nucleotide mutations across the crRNA sequence provides an opportunity to repurpose and utilize all of these Cas effectors.</p><p>It is important to note that we have added <italic>Lw</italic>Cas13a to our web server because it has been reported for SNV detection. <italic>Lw</italic>Cas13a belongs to a class of RNA-targeting Cas effectors that are not constrained by PAM. As a result, their targetability across the genome cannot be directly compared to other PAM-dependent DNA-targeting Cas effectors.

This includes single nucleotide changes, insertions, deletions, and microsatellites, as well as population-level frequency, publication, genomic annotation of common variations, and pathological mutations. To begin, we isolated pathological SNPs from the most recent dbSNP Build 155 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, Materials and methods) by omitting relatively uncommon, non-clinical, and non-SNP variants. For SARS-CoV2, we filtered SNVs by removing UTR and non-SNP mutations from the most recent CNCB-NGDC SARS-CoV-2 variations database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xue et al., 2021</xref>).

CriSNPr employs the previously reported offline versatile algorithm Cas-OFFinder to identify potential off-targets against the modified crRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bae et al., 2014</xref>). Using this information, CriSNPr provides off-target information against a crRNA, including chromosome location and coordinates of the off-targets, DNA strand information, and a number of off-target sequences with up to four mismatches, etc., as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. All of the primer sequences provided by CriSNPr have been pre-filtered for off-targets with up to two nucleotide mismatches against representative bacterial genome databases (NCBI), virus genome databases (NCBI), and human genome/transcriptome databases (GENCODE GRCh38). This is especially important when the sample contains both human and pathogenic nucleic acids (such as in the SARS-CoV-2 infection). In addition, for Cas proteins without trans-cleavage activity (such as <italic>Fn</italic>Cas9/en<italic>Fn</italic>Cas9), in vitro cleavage-based discrimination is facilitated by designing primers for longer amplicons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

These can be resolved on an agarose gel following a CRISPR-mediated cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azhar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Given that the first two interfaces provide information that has been curated within the CriSNPr database, it is possible to generate the outputs in less than a minute. To target any previously unreported or novel SNP or SNV present in humans or SARS-CoV-2, Seq-CriSNPr considers a 20–30-nucleotide sequence containing the SNP/SNV along with the position and nucleobase identity of the SNP/SNV as input and performs a real-time design of crRNA and primer oligos for each CRISPR/Cas detection assay, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and Materials and methods.

This is followed by <italic>Aa</italic>Cas12b, <italic>Fn</italic>Cas9, and <italic>Lb</italic>Cas12a with target SNPs of 62.32% (11,702,008), 43.86% (8,234,812), and 29.95% (5,623,279), respectively. Cas14a could target 500,786 variations (2.66%) of the total 18,775,119 variations when the substrate is double-stranded target DNA due to the TTTA PAM constraint. These findings imply that, while the number of sensitive mismatch positions increases the chances of targeting an SNP from dbSNP, PAM relaxation provides more coverage for detecting SNVs. <italic>Lb</italic>Cas12a, on the other hand, despite seven single mismatch sensitive positions, targets only 5,623,279 SNPs due to a stringent TTTN PAM. In comparison, <italic>Aa</italic>Cas12b detects more SNPs (62.32%) due to relaxed TTN PAM and various combinations of dual mismatch sites. But since Cas14a with dsDNA targets is only sensitive for two positions and uses a very stringent TTTA PAM, the overall detection ratio is the lowest of any PAM-dependent SNP detection Cas system, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>.</p><p>Following that, we examined the potential disease-causing/associated SNPs detected by various Cas systems. A total of 493,105 disease-related SNPs were extracted from the SNPs that were found in dbSNP after they were filtered. Among PAM-dependent Cas systems, en<italic>Fn</italic>Cas9 and Cas14a (dsDNA) exhibit the highest (90.74%) and lowest (1.50%) SNP detection rates, respectively, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>. Interestingly, aside from <italic>Fn</italic>/en<italic>Fn</italic>Cas9, all of the other PAM-dependent Cas systems showed a lower number of disease-related SNPs that can be targeted. This could be due to the presence of NRG/NGR PAMs near the majority of these disease-related SNPs, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>. This could be further explained by examining the distribution of different mutation classes among SNVs of interest. Total and clinically relevant target mutations in the dbSNP are enriched for the G.C &gt; A.T mutation class in all Cas systems, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>In clinically significant mutations, the G.C &gt; A.T class predominates the other mutation classes, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>. There is a clear difference in the abundance of mutational classes among the various Cas systems for clinically relevant SNVs. Thus, Cas systems with G-rich PAMs, such as <italic>Fn</italic>/en<italic>Fn</italic>Cas9 (42.59 and 40.87%), can target G.C &gt; A.T mutation classes, whereas Cas systems with T-rich PAMs, such as <italic>Aa</italic>Cas12b, <italic>Lb</italic>Cas12a, and Cas14a (dsDNA) cannot (37.17, 34.8, and 32.69%).

In recent years, the field of CRISPR diagnostics has exploded, with multiple Cas systems demonstrating tremendous promise in reading and detecting nucleotide modifications in a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Myhrvold et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azhar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrington et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acharya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Acharya et al., 2021</xref>). As this opens up applications in a variety of biotechnology and clinical diagnostic regimens, particularly for early, on-site detection, the need for streamlined design parameters for assay design is critical. CriSNPr is one of the first web servers aimed at reducing the time and effort required to design CRISPR/Cas-based SNV detection assays. When combined with different readout modalities tailored for multiple CRISPR effectors, it can enable the design of CRISPR diagnostics for the rapid detection of monogenic and infectious diseases in different Cas systems.</p><p>While this manuscript was being written, a few web servers that design gRNAs specifically for targeting SNVs across the genome, particularly in an allele-specific manner, were reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rabinowitz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keough et al., 2019</xref>). These present an important advancement toward gRNA design for precision medicine in general. However, the CriSNPr platform is tailored for generating gRNAs specifically for diagnostics, taking into account the design parameters for each diagnostic CRISPR protein. Thus, it caters to applications that are not covered by general gRNA design databases and toolsets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>In the current version of CriSNPr, six of the widely used CRISPR diagnostic platforms have been added because there is enough research to back up their design guidelines. CRISPR diagnostics is a rapidly evolving field; recently, several other Cas proteins have been reported for identifying pathogenic DNA or RNA and their variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fasching et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nan et al., 2022</xref>). As more literature supporting these diagnostic pipelines became available, we would incorporate it into the server. The inclusion of multiple CRISPR pipelines on an integrated server serves two purposes. To begin, an SNV of interest may be detected only by certain Cas proteins and not by others, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Second, when multiple diagnostic options are available, users can choose their preferred CRISPR platform based on the availability of reagents and methodologies. The latter is especially useful because the sensitivity and scope of readout modes can differ depending on the diagnostic query: pathogenic polynucleotide or single nucleobase variant (monoallelic or biallelic; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arizti-Sanz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joung et al., 2020</xref>). While lateral flow readouts have been demonstrated for detecting full-length sequences and variants, fluorescence-based readouts are better suited for detecting disease mutation carriers (monoallelic SNVs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Myhrvold et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azhar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrington et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kellner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gootenberg et al., 2018</xref>). CriSNPr recommendations for the given SNV of interest can help with such decisions. Importantly, a wide range of design options allows users to test and standardize the best pipeline for their chosen SNV. This is especially true because the various CRISPR systems with PAM requirements prefer AT/GC-rich PAM sequences. As the number of such sequences differs between human and other pathogenic genomes, so does the ability of CRISPR proteins to distinguish between SNVs based on the target species.</p><p>There are a variety of ways in which CriSNPr could be improved immediately. For instance, the current framework of CriSNPr cannot perform sequence batch processing. This limitation is due to the technical parameters of the server’s hosting system, which will be updated in the near future to accommodate batch processing. Furthermore, CriSNPr currently does not include variants that are not single nucleotide changes. Although SNVs are the most sensitive and critical diagnostic challenge, later versions of CriSNPr will include gRNA design parameters for polynucleotide changes in the target.</p><p>In our study, the importance of certain mismatch-sensitive nucleotide positions for the detection of SNV has been emphasized, making their selection crucial when determining a mismatch combination. When scoring sgRNAs, modified crRNAs that have been shown to be experimentally efficient with their respective Cas effectors are given priority. This suggests that in several cases, the design strategy used to assign mismatches in gRNAs will be greatly improved by further experimental validation of gRNA mismatches by multiple Cas species. This is especially true for several of the Cas effectors considered in this server, such as <italic>Fn</italic>Cas9, Cas14, and Cas13, where systematic dissection of every combination of nucleobase mismatch on gRNA sensitivity has not yet been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Myhrvold et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azhar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrington et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kellner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Acharya et al., 2021</xref>). As more such data becomes available, we will be able to improve our scoring of gRNAs returned as output, allowing users to spend less time validating more efficient pipelines.</p><p>CriSNPr currently hosts genomic targets for humans and SARS-CoV-2 lineages. This is a limitation given that a large number of pathogenic variants exist in the microbial community, and a number of these have significant clinical manifestations, such as drug or antibiotic resistance. Although the web server has a de novo design feature, we hope to expand the scope of the tool to include as many sequences that can be retrieved from public repositories as possible. Perhaps the most critical evaluation of CriSNPr will be possible once more such web servers are made available for comparison. Until that happens, CriSNPr, in its current form, should help implement CRISPR diagnostics in a wide range of clinical and academic settings and reduce the time and effort needed for design and validation for every nucleotide variant.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Oligos</title><p>A list of all oligomers (Merck) used in the study can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, along with a figure-wise mention of their use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Generation of the CriSNPr database</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>For the human SNPs/SNVs with pathological relevance</title><p>To build the CriSNPr database for variant detection through various Cas systems for population-specific SNPs and pathological mutations in humans, the latest dbSNP build 155 (GCF 000001405.39) was downloaded from the NCBI FTP site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sherry et al., 2001</xref>). Since the focus was on SNPs/SNVs, all other variation types like insertion, deletion, duplication, and translocation were filtered out, leaving only variants with a common SNV tag and valid ClinVar ID for further analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Landrum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Landrum et al., 2018</xref>). vcflib (v1.0.0) was used to convert vcf into a tabular format for smooth analysis while retaining trivial information such as chromosome coordinates, reference and alternate alleles, reference SNP (rsID), gene, disease, and population level frequency, and so on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrison et al., 2021</xref>. Besides that, multi-allelic SNPs were split into multiple entries for easier processing and labeled as ‘not available’ if missing or ‘not provided’ if the information was unavailable. All previous data filtrations and curations were carried out using the Pandas Python library (v1.3.5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McKinney, 2010</xref>). Finally, to design the gRNAs for detection, filtered SNVs/SNPs positions were mapped to the human reference genome (Gencode GRCh38.p13) to cross-check that the reference base lies within the PAM proximity, followed by the incorporation of a synthetic mismatch at positions based on the use of different Cas systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frankish et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frankish et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, genome coordinates for the target SNV were used to obtain flanking sequences for the design of target amplification primers. Since <italic>Fn</italic>Cas9 does not have any collateral activity, primers were made so that in vitro cleaved products after an enzyme treatment can be optimally resolved, keeping the lengths of the cleaved products in a ratio of 1:3 to 2:3.</p><p>All of this was accomplished by utilizing the BioPython SeqIO library (v1.76) for genome parsing, followed by PAM allocation by using the regex library (v2021.11.10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cock et al., 2009</xref>). Nucleotide base incorporation was done by creating a custom function. The entire CriSNPr database was created using Python’s SQLite3 library (v3.31.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Van Rossum and Drake, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">SQLite, 2020</xref>).

After downloading the variant annotation data table, gene and transcript mutations were analyzed, and variations in intergenic and untranslated regions were removed. Non-SNV mutations were then filtered out of the data. Information like chromosome, position, reference allele, alternate allele, amino acid change, and variation frequency was included for further analysis. In real time, the number of virus sequences with an SNP is plotted as a bar plot using the matplotlib library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hunter, 2007</xref>). The standard CoV-2 variation nomenclature requires a gene name followed by an underscore, a reference amino acid, its position on the protein, and an alternative amino acid. So, a column was added for the variation identity that could be used as a query by the user. The target gRNAs and primers for SARS-CoV-2 variants were designed in the same manner as previously described for the human dbSNPs dataset.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Generation of seq-CriSNPr</title><p>Seq-CriSNPr is a real-time sequence variant detection tool that employs crRNA and primer design. The user must enter the sequence, variant position, and identity. Initially, the identity of the variant base was distinguished in relation to the reference base at the user-supplied position. If the variant base identity is the same as the reference base, the back-end server returns an error message. Additionally, Flask-WTForms checks an input sequence for the invalid base (‘non-ACGT’ characters) and length (20–30 nucleotides; v2.2.1). The sequence is then mapped to the user-selected organism reference genome using the BWA aligner with no mismatch to obtain the variant position on the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li and Durbin, 2010</xref>). If the sequence is not found in the genome as defined by the user, it is returned with a warning. Furthermore, the variant’s genome position is queried against the existing CriSNPr database; if not found, PAM sequences are searched nearby as defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Upon PAM localization, the variant base is inserted into the sequence, followed by a random mismatch at the appropriate position, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;CriSNPr: a single interface for the curated and de-novo design of gRNAs for CRISPR diagnostics using diverse Cas systems&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Shruthi Sridhar Vembar (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the authors have provided a small set of data that validated the design of the software, more validation experiments will be needed to demonstrate how well the guide RNAs work, or which designs are predicted to work better than others. These additional data should further support the usability of the software.</p><p>1) Figure 4 gives one example with the detection of a short WT and mutated oligo from SARS-CoV-2 as the template. Similar experiments may be done with several SNVs in real cells, to also include the complexity of genomic DNA. For comparison, it would be elegant to include a gRNA also recognizing the WT sequence in some of the experiments, including in Figure 4.</p><p>2) The authors only test their system for a single mutation (E484K) with three CRISPR effector proteins (FnCas9 and LbCas12a). More extensive validation (multiple designs per mutation, many mutations examined) is crucial for sequence design methods like CriSNPr.</p><p>3) How well do the pre-designed gRNAs work for detecting human SNPs? The authors should compare their method with existing assays to detect human SNPs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I congratulate the authors on a great piece of work. Here are some suggestions which could improve the manuscript:</p><p>1. The Yes/No options in the flowchart of Figure 3a were confusing. For example, for the Input SNP ID box, the first check is if it is valid or not. The flowchart uses 'Not Valid' instead of 'Valid', and hence there is a double negative which becomes a positive, and so on. My suggestion is to change 'Not Valid' to 'Valid or not': if the answer to this is 'Valid', the Python Flask is invoked; if it is 'Not valid', the program outputs an error message and exits. The same is true for the 'Not found' option. I am sorry if this point doesn't make sense, but if I could have included a figure here, it would have been easier to explain.</p><p>2. To improve the flow of the paper, figures 4 and 5 could be switched. Basically, the paper could end with the experimental detection of the SARS-CoV-2 variant, S gene containing E484K mutation, using CriSNPr-designed CRISPR RNAs and PCR primers.</p><p>3. Since page and line numbers were not included in the submitted manuscript, it is difficult for me to point out the sentences which could be reworded for clarity. There were also a few typos and phrase/word repetitions that should be addressed.</p><p>One last suggestion is to develop a stand-alone version of CriSNPr which researchers can download and work with locally.</p><p>For the online version, please include a form in the 'Contact us' section where researchers could write to the authors requesting their organism of choice to be included in CriSNPr.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Here follows some suggestions:</p><p>It makes the review process easier if the manuscript has line numbers. I suggest adding this in the future to any manuscripts.</p><p>I realize that this could be difficult, but is there anyway the user can be helped to prioritize which gRNAs to use? Is there any scoring system that could be used or developed? It would be useful to at least discuss this a bit in the manuscript.</p><p>As briefly stated above, the manuscript would benefit from more validation experiments, in a systematic way showing to what level the suggested guide RNAs work. Figure 4 gives one example with the detection of a short WT and mutated oligo from SARS-CoV-2 as the template. I would suggest doing similar experiments also with several SNVs in real cells, to also include the complexity of genomic DNA. For comparison, it would be elegant to include a gRNA also recognizing the WT sequence in some of the experiments, including in Figure 4.</p><p>The manuscript would benefit from more detailed information about the basis for the guide RNA design for the different Cas proteins, including highlighting references better in the methods part as well as elsewhere in the manuscript (e.g. on p. 5 &quot;… and the required crRNA and primer design parameters based on gRNA design principles available in the literature for each Cas protein&quot; would benefit from adding references).</p><p>I lack references on other places too:</p><p>On p. 20 &quot;performed the diagnostic assays according to previously published protocols&quot;.</p><p>On p. 23 &quot;In clinically relevant variations, G.C&gt;A.T class is dominating the other mutation classes&quot;.</p><p>On several places in the manuscript, its stated that specific updates will be made to the software (e.g. page 26). On the one hand I appreciate the dedication, but it also begs the question if they really think the software is ready to be published already.</p><p>Figure 3 and Sup. figure 2, are of fairly low quality. I realize that this is because the figure has been copied from the webpage, but consider if you can make some changes so that the quality is higher.</p><p>Consider rearranging the first page of the web page. To me it doesn't make sense that the &quot;Seq-CriSNPr&quot; part is shifted to the right compared to the &quot;human&quot; part. It also looks a bit strange that the distance on the y-axis between the &quot;Seq-CriSNPr&quot; and &quot;Human&quot;, is much longer than the distance between &quot;CriSNPr&quot; and &quot;Human&quot;. I think the web page will look more professional if this is fixed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The first three figures are essentially schematics. There isn't enough data in this paper to support the claims made by the authors. The authors should provide additional data showing how they tested their system (both computationally and experimentally).</p><p>2. The authors only test their system for a single mutation (E484K) with three CRISPR effector proteins (FnCas9 and LbCas12a). More extensive validation (multiple designs per mutation, many mutations examined) is crucial for sequence design methods like CriSNPr.</p><p>3. How well do the pre-designed gRNAs work for detecting human SNPs? The authors should compare their method with existing assays to detect human SNPs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77976.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I congratulate the authors on a great piece of work.

However, we have now implemented a scoring method that prioritizes crRNAs with the lowest number of off-targets in the target genome, and if off-targets are high for a crRNA with any combinatorial positions, the next set of positions is automatically preferred.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As briefly stated above, the manuscript would benefit from more validation experiments, in a systematic way showing to what level the suggested guide RNAs work.

We have now added more pathogenic SNP targets, made crRNAs for multiple Cas proteins using CriSNPr, tested them, and included them in Figure 6 of the new version of the paper. The target SNPs (rs2073874 and rs138739292) were selected based on their high prevalence in the Indian population and their targetability with different Cas systems.</p><p>The reviewer has also mentioned doing similar experiments inside cells to negate the effects of genomic DNA complexity, if any. We would like to humbly point out that all CRISPR diagnostics described so far are done exclusively in vitro and in a non-invasive manner where the complexity of genomic DNA doesn’t come into the picture due to prior amplification steps.</p><p>The reviewer has suggested including a gRNA recognizing the WT sequence. We would like to point out that there are multiple existing software pipelines (CRISPOR, Chop-Chop etc.) that design gRNAs against a given WT sequence. The objective of CriSNPr is not to design de-novo gRNA sequences against a target but to design gRNAs that can distinguish a WT sequence from its mutant counterpart.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript would benefit from more detailed information about the basis for the guide RNA design for the different Cas proteins, including highlighting references better in the methods part as well as elsewhere in the manuscript (e.g. on p. 5 &quot;… and the required crRNA and primer design parameters based on gRNA design principles available in the literature for each Cas protein&quot; would benefit from adding references).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and apologize for this inadvertent error. We have corrected this in the updated manuscript and added all the necessary references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I lack references on other places too:</p><p>On p. 20 &quot;performed the diagnostic assays according to previously published protocols&quot;.</p><p>On p. 23 &quot;In clinically relevant variations, G.C&gt;A.T class is dominating the other mutation classes&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize once again for these errors; references have now been updated in the current version of the manuscript. On p. 23, the statement is supported by the analysis done in Figure 4b showing the percentage of targeted SNPs having clinical significance or disease relevance in humans, again with percentage base distribution at each SNP position targeted by individual Cas systems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On several places in the manuscript, its stated that specific updates will be made to the software (e.g. page 26). On the one hand I appreciate the dedication, but it also begs the question if they really think the software is ready to be published already.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. The current version of CriSNPr is fully functional to design crRNA and primers for <italic>Fn</italic>/en<italic>Fn</italic>Cas9, <italic>Lw</italic>Cas13a, <italic>Lb</italic>Cas12a, <italic>Aa</italic>Cas12b, and Cas14a. As a field, novel CRISPR diagnostic methodologies are continuously evolving, and thus the statement about updates meant that such methodologies may be incorporated into the pipeline as these technologies mature. We apologize if this meaning was not clearly communicated to the reviewer.</p><p>That said, the stand-alone version of CriSNPr with the batch-processing mode is included in the updated version of our manuscript. We have also made crRNA databases for humans and SARS-CoV-2 to speed up the rate of data output.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 and Sup. figure 2, are of fairly low quality. I realize that this is because the figure has been copied from the webpage, but consider if you can make some changes so that the quality is higher.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this inadvertent error and have corrected it in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Consider rearranging the first page of the web page. To me it doesn't make sense that the &quot;Seq-CriSNPr&quot; part is shifted to the right compared to the &quot;human&quot; part. It also looks a bit strange that the distance on the y-axis between the &quot;Seq-CriSNPr&quot; and &quot;Human&quot;, is much longer than the distance between &quot;CriSNPr&quot; and &quot;Human&quot;. I think the web page will look more professional if this is fixed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and have made the suggested changes to make it look more professional.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The first three figures are essentially schematics. There isn't enough data in this paper to support the claims made by the authors. The authors should provide additional data showing how they tested their system (both computationally and experimentally).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has mentioned the paucity of data in this paper to support the claims. We agree that the first figure is a schematic to introduce the concept of CRISPR-based detection platforms to readers. But we respectfully disagree with the idea that the second and third figures should just be called schematics. The second figure depicts the entire pipeline that has been optimized to create the CriSNPr database for both humans and SARS-CoV-2 and highlights key steps that are being taken. While the second figure shows the pipeline, the third figure introduces the front end of CriSNPr as a web server and highlights its utilities, which are important to avail crRNA and primer designs for developing SNP-detection assays.</p><p>To address the concern about the paucity of validation data, we now include more data on additional SNVs in Figures 5 and 6 to conclusively establish the utility of criSNPr for designing CRISPR diagnostic assays for pathogenic and non-pathogenic SNVs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors only test their system for a single mutation (E484K) with three CRISPR effector proteins (FnCas9 and LbCas12a). More extensive validation (multiple designs per mutation, many mutations examined) is crucial for sequence design methods like CriSNPr.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out; we have now added more target human SNPs and validated them with all three Cas systems (<italic>Fn</italic>Cas9, Cas14a, and <italic>Aa</italic>Cas12b) in Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. How well do the pre-designed gRNAs work for detecting human SNPs? The authors should compare their method with existing assays to detect human SNPs.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to humbly point out that the pre-designed sgRNAs validated in this manuscript are indeed for human SNPs. However, CriSNPr is not a new platform for CRISPRDx, as the reviewer has probably pointed out. The CriSNPr algorithm uses crRNA design parameters reported for different Cas systems for SNP detection. Its utility is in providing a single platform for designing these for different SNVs as well as testing multiple CRISPR systems for the same SNV. In this way, it reduces the time and effort spent on designing crRNAs and primers for the SNV of choice.</p></body></sub-article></article>
