pathogenesis of acute cardiac injuries, but little is known about its role in chronic cardiac dysfunction. Here, we demonstrate that angiotensin II infusion induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis at 1 week and caused cardiac dysfunction and impaired lymphatic transport at 6 weeks in mice, while co-administration of VEGFCc156s improved these parameters. To identify novel mechanisms underlying this protection, RNA sequencing analysis in distinct cell populations revealed that VEGFCc156s specifically modulated angiotensin II-induced inflammatory responses in cardiac and peripheral lymphatic endothelial cells. Furthermore, telemetry studies showed that while angiotensin II increased blood pressure acutely in all animals, VEGFCc156s-treated animals displayed a delayed systemic reduction in blood pressure independent of alterations in angiotensin II-mediated aortic stiffness. Overall, these results demonstrate that VEGFCc156s had a multifaceted therapeutic effect to prevent angiotensin II-induced cardiac dysfunction by improving cardiac lymphatic function, alleviating fibrosis and inflammation, and ameliorating hypertension.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lymphatic</kwd><kwd>endothelial</kwd><kwd>cardiac dysfunction</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>fibrosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004319</institution-id><institution>Pfizer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roth Flach</surname><given-names>Rachel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lymphangiogenic therapy VEGFCc156s improved angiotensin-II-induced impairments in heart function via novel mechanisms, which include transcriptional responses to alleviate inflammation and cardiac fibrosis, and systemic responses to ameliorate hypertension.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lymphatic vasculature plays an important role in mediating fluid balance and local inflammation in many tissues and organs throughout the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oliver et al., 2020</xref>). The heart also carries a complex lymphatic network and relies on cardiac lymphatics to drain interstitial fluids and immune cells for maintaining homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brakenhielm and Alitalo, 2019</xref>). Disrupting cardiac lymphatics can cause myocardial edema and lead to impaired cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cui et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mehlhorn et al., 1995</xref>), indicating a critical role of cardiac lymphatics in cardiovascular physiology. Recently, cardiac lymphatics have emerged as a new therapeutic target for acute cardiac injuries. Several studies have demonstrated using rodent models that therapeutic lymphangiogenesis reduced myocardial edema and fibrosis, resolved inflammation, and improved cardiac function after myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Houssari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klotz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tatin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trincot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vieira et al., 2018</xref>) or ischemia and reperfusion injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shimizu et al., 2018</xref>). These studies in aggregate concluded that the improvement in cardiac function was due to local proliferation of lymphatic vessels at the site of injury in response to lymphangiogenic therapies. Importantly, these animal models represent cardiac injuries, in which blood and lymphatic vessels are surgically manipulated. However, the role of the lymphatic vasculature in the pathogenesis of chronic cardiac dysfunction and the effects of lymphangiogenic therapies on cardiac dysfunction remain to be explored. Here, we explored the role of the lymphatic vasculature in cardiac dysfunction and investigated the effects of a lymphangiogenic therapy (VEGFCc156s) on the angiotensin II infusion-induced cardiac dysfunction model. We found that angiotensin II infusion-induced cardiac dysfunction is associated with impaired lymphatic vascular function as well as increased cardiac fibrosis and inflammation, whereas VEGFCc156s treatment ameliorated these pathologies. Interestingly, angiotensin II-infused mice treated with VEGFCc156s also demonstrated a delayed and dramatic response to reverse angiotensin II-induced hypertension. Thus, we propose that the beneficial effects of the lymphangiogenic therapy VEGFCc156s on angiotensin II infusion-induced cardiac dysfunction are multifaceted and mediated by its concomitant effects on cardiac lymphatic function, inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression, and systemic hypertension.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lymphatic endothelial markers associate with cardiac comorbidities and are reduced in human failing hearts</title><p>To investigate the role of the lymphatic vasculature in human heart failure and cardiac dysfunction, we first analyzed human genome wide association studies (GWAS) for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were near lymphatic marker gene loci and were associated with human cardiovascular or metabolic comorbidities.

Thus, we hypothesized that continuous infusion to maintain a stable increase in plasma VEGFCc156s concentration would be the most effective mode of administration. Therefore, an osmotic pump was implanted subcutaneously to infuse angiotensin II and VEGFCc156s simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The VEGFCc156s infusion was calculated to maintain a two-fold increase in plasma VEGFC concentration, and the analysis at endpoint confirmed a significant 1.9-fold average increase in plasma VEGFC concentration in the treated mice compared with control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>VEGFC<sub>C156S</sub> treatment prevented angiotensin II-induced cardiac dysfunction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design for animal studies.

More interestingly, podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessel lumen area was significantly increased in the hearts of VEGFCc156s + angiotensin II-infused animals compared with animals that had been treated with angiotensin II alone, indicating that VEGFCc156s may improve lymphatic transport function in diseased animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>).

FITC-dextran and cadaverine were injected intravenously to label the cardiac blood vasculature and reveal any vascular leak, respectively. Next, fluorescent qdots were injected into the apex of the heart. Qdots are macromolecules that diffuse into interstitial fluid and may be cleared by the lymphatic vasculature and transported back to the blood circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shimizu et al., 2018</xref>). Angiotensin II treatment induced vascular leakage, leading to interstitial accumulation of cadaverine in angiotensin II-infused hearts. In contrast, VEGFCc156s-treated, angiotensin II-infused animals showed significantly reduced cadaverine accumulation in heart, indicating reduced leakage and improved fluid clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Transcriptional changes in diaphragm lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) were also profiled to evaluate the effect of VEGFCc156s on peripheral lymphatics, as the treatment is systemic. To efficiently distinguish LECs from blood endothelial cells (BECs), we generated a Prox1-eGFP knock-in mouse model in which eGFP expression is driven by the endogenous promoter of the lymphatic endothelial marker <italic>Prox1</italic> gene using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and confirmed the eGFP signals from lymphatic vessels in the heart and the diaphragm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–1C</xref>). The Prox1-eGFP mice were next used for in vivo studies following the study design shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. From the animals, LECs, BECs and cardiomyocytes were isolated from the heart, and LECs were additionally isolated from the diaphragm following an optimized protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and used for RNA-seq. A principal component analysis of the normalized expression counts across cell types indicated that the samples clustered based on cell population and showed a distinct expression profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Differential expression and signaling pathway analysis revealed that angiotensin II significantly altered gene expression in all four cell populations.

In summary, VEGFCc156s treatment ameliorated angiotensin II-induced pathological gene expression and angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibrosis and inflammation at 1 week after treatment, a time point at which no divergence in blood pressure is observed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent studies indicated that the lymphatic vasculature, a traditionally-neglected target for therapeutic interventions, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, and enhancing lymphangiogenesis could be beneficial for acute cardiac injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Houssari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klotz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu and Oliver, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shimizu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tatin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trincot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vieira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vivien et al., 2019</xref>). However, the role of the lymphatic vasculature in chronic cardiac dysfunction remains to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the lymphatic vasculature in the pathogenesis of chronic heart failure and cardiac dysfunction. We found several SNPs near lymphatic marker gene loci that were associated with human cardiovascular or metabolic comorbidities in human GWAS studies, although some of the associations did not meet the genome-wide threshold and some of the loci are close to another gene in addition to the lymphatic endothelial marker (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To validate the findings from the GWAS analysis, we conducted expression profiling using human heart samples and found reduced expression of lymphatic endothelial markers in human chronic heart failure hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), suggesting that the lymphatic vasculature may play a role in the pathogenesis of human chronic heart failure and cardiac dysfunction. Our observations are in line with previously published RNA sequencing analyses of human hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sweet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Heesch et al., 2019</xref>) and a recent clinical report indicating that serum VEGFC levels are significantly and inversely associated with all-cause and cardiovascular death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wada et al., 2018</xref>), supporting a role of lymphatic vasculature in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. However, previous reports found minimal changes in lymphatic vascular density in left ventricular endomyocardial biopsies from terminal heart failure hearts and healthy donor hearts using immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dashkevich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dashkevich et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, further investigations are required to characterize the changes in lymphatic vasculature in human chronic heart failure pathogenesis.</p><p>Using a murine model of cardiac dysfunction, we demonstrate that a chronic cardiac insult such as angiotensin II infusion induced lymphatic vascular dysfunction by reducing lymphatic vascular density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and impairing lymphatic vascular transport function in the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Podoplanin is widely used as a marker for LECs and is preferentially expressed in pre-collectors and collectors of the cardiac lymphatic vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henri et al., 2016</xref>). A previous study demonstrated that enhancing lymphangiogenesis by over-expressing VEGFC with adenoviruses in a mouse model of lymphedema induced robust growth of lymphatic capillaries in axillary tissues after 2 weeks but failed to improve lymphatic vascular leakage, while with prolonged VEGFC stimulation (2–6 months), the lymphatic capillaries underwent an intrinsic remodeling and maturation and became functional collecting vessels, leading to reduced tissue edema and restored lymphatic drainage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Norrmén et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tammela et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, VEGFCc156s can reportedly directly enhance lymphatic pump activity and lymphatic output in rat mesentery collecting lymphatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breslin et al., 2007</xref>), indicating a potential direct beneficial effect of VEGFCc156s on lymphatic vascular function in addition to its role in enhancing lymphangiogenesis and maturation. Here, consistent with these previous reports, we observed that 6 week continuous infusion of VEGFCc156s concomitant with angiotensin II restored collecting vessel function and improved cardiac lymphatic drainage, leading to improved cardiac fluid balance regulation. Myocardial edema is a key clinical feature of cardiac dysfunction and chronic heart failure, and heart function could be significantly compromised with a subtle increase in interstitial fluid volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dongaonkar et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the improved cardiac lymphatic vascular function and tissue fluid homeostasis in the VEGFCc156s-treated, angiotensin II-infused animals might contribute to the improved cardiac function and reduced cardiac hypertrophy observed. One area for future investigation is a further characterization of the changes in cardiac lymphatic valves, which play an important role in regulating the lymph flow in collecting vessels. In addition, podoplanin, a marker of lymphatic collecting vessels, is also reportedly expressed in inflammatory cells. Previous reports indicated that a high frequency of podoplanin-expressing cells appeared in the infarcted heart and facilitated local inflammation, and podoplanin neutralization improved cardiac function after myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cimini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cimini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Quintanilla et al., 2019</xref>). In our study, we assessed podoplanin-expressing lymphatic vessels but not other podoplanin-expressing cells; further analysis of other podoplanin-expressing cells in our disease model would be an area for future investigation.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated impairments in the lymphatic vasculature in a myocardial infarction model, where the left anterior descending artery is surgically ligated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klotz et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, the lymphatic vessel parallel to this major blood vessel is likely also mechanically impaired by this surgical manipulation, thus testing the hypothesis that mechanical disruption of the lymphatic vasculature can impair heart function, and regrowth using lymphangiogenic therapy is beneficial. Our observations are in line with these previous studies; however, the studies presented herein importantly assess lymphatic dysfunction in the absence of direct injury or surgical manipulation. Likely the impairments in lymphatic vascular function observed in angiotensin II-infused mice could come directly from angiotensin II actions on the endothelium, as angiotensin II can induce endothelial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gomolak and Didion, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Watanabe et al., 2005</xref>) or perhaps indirectly from angiotensin II infusion-induced hypertension, which reportedly alters lymphatic vascular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dongaonkar et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The lymphatic vasculature also plays an important role in mediating local inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brakenhielm and Alitalo, 2019</xref>), and in acute cardiac injury models, resolution of inflammation following lymphangiogenic therapy has been proposed to be an underlying therapeutic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tatin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vieira et al., 2018</xref>). Our RNA-seq analysis indicated that LECs expressed proinflammatory chemokines after angiotensin II stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which is consistent with previous reports indicating a role of angiotensin II in initiating inflammatory and chemotactic responses in tissues and vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benigni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suzuki et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, VEGFCc156s treatment alleviated the inflammatory responses induced by angiotensin II infusion in LECs by reducing the expression of proinflammatory chemokines, which may contribute to the beneficial effects of VEGFCc156s on angiotensin II-induced cardiac dysfunction. Our results are in line with a previous report indicating that VEGFCc156s treatment downregulated the expression of genes involved in immune regulation and inflammation in dermal LECs without stress or stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dieterich et al., 2017</xref>), while here we report that VEGFCc156s treatment ameliorated inflammatory responses in LECs under stress (angiotensin II infusion). Moreover, the transcriptional changes in LECs detected by RNA-seq analysis translated to tissue and systemic levels, and we observed elevations in chemokine levels in skin and plasma in angiotensin II-infused mice, which were alleviated by VEGFCc156s treatment. These results in aggregate suggest that lymphatic vessels may play a more active role in mediating local and systemic inflammation than simply providing a route for immune cell clearance, and VEGFCc156s may directly alleviate systemic inflammation through transcriptional effects on LECs.</p><p>More interestingly, upon VEGFCc156s treatment, a significant reduction of angiotensin II-induced increases in blood pressure and kidney damage was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Our observations are in line with a previous report indicating that the treatment of VEGFC, a ligand for both VEGFR2 and VEGFR3, also induced a delayed systemic hemodynamic response to reduce blood pressure and attenuated related renal damage in a high-salt induced hypertension model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaini et al., 2019</xref>). Our study used VEGFCc156s, a ligand with specificity for VEGFR3, suggesting that VEGFC-mediated effects are indeed mediated by VEGFR3 activation. Furthermore, these effects are not limited to salt-induced pathology, as VEGFCc156s also ameliorated angiotensin II-induced hypertension and renal damage, suggesting that VEGFC may play a broad role to modulate hypertension. Moreover, in line with the observations using the murine models, a recent clinical study also showed that patients with hypertension have significantly lower serum VEGFC levels compared with healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chachaj et al., 2018</xref>), supporting a potential role of lymphatic vasculature in the pathogenesis of human hypertension. Hypertension is a major risk factor for heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dorans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tackling and Borhade, 2019</xref>), and anti-hypertensive therapies significantly reduce cardiovascular events and mortality in patients in clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ettehad et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the effect of VEGFCc156s on blood pressure might also contribute significantly to its beneficial effects on angiotensin II-induced cardiac dysfunction.</p><p>Consistent with previous reports regarding the role of renal lymphatics in the pathogenesis of hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balasubbramanian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lopez Gelston et al., 2018</xref>), we also observed an endogenous expansion of renal lymphatics in response to angiotensin II-induced hypertension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The previous reports also demonstrated that enhancing renal lymphatic expansion by over-expressing VEGFD prevented the development of hypertension. Therefore, we initially hypothesized that VEGFCc156s might enhance the endogenous renal lymphangiogenesis response and thus ameliorate angiotensin II infusion-induced hypertension. Surprisingly, no lymphangiogenic response was observed in the kidney of VEGFCc156s-treated angiotensin II-infused animals at both the 1-week and 6-week time points assessed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E–1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F–1H</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the lymphangiogenesis response we observed in the kidney of angiotensin II-infused mice could be an adaptation to hypertension and was therefore ameliorated in VEGFCc156s-treated, angiotensin II-infused mice at the 6-week timepoint due to reduced blood pressure. In the previous reports, the authors used a transgenic line to over-express VEGFD by 800-fold over baseline specifically in kidney and observed significant expansion of renal lymphatics, while our study used VEGFCc156s at a low dose that only increased plasma VEGFC levels by 1.6-fold to 1.9-fold on average. In addition, as a low-molecular weight protein, VEGFCc156s will be quickly filtered through glomeruli followed by adsorptive endocytosis and lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franssen et al., 1994</xref>), resulting in poor local retention and exposure of VEGFCc156s in kidney. Therefore, the discrepancy between our study and previous studies could possibly be explained by differences in local exposure of the lymphangiogenic factors with transgenic overexpression and chronic systemic administration.</p><p>Although VEGFCc156s significantly ameliorated angiotensin II-induced hypertension, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be explored. We first carefully examined the possibility that VEGFCc156s interfered with angiotensin II-mediated effects, and several lines of evidence in our studies indicate that there were no alterations in angiotensin II-mediated vascular effects after VEGFCc156s treatment, as angiotensin II caused aortic remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), induced vascular leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and vascular hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and increased renal <italic>Ace2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>) similarly in both the angiotensin II-infused and the VEGFCc156s-treated, angiotensin II-infused group, indicating that angiotensin II acted as a vasoactive molecule in both groups. In addition, causal reasoning analysis of RNA-seq data also pointed at angiotensin II as a causal factor for the changes observed in cardiomyocytes from both the angiotensin II-infused and the VEGFCc156s-treated, angiotensin II-infused group. Finally, the similar blood pressure elevations detected in the first week in both angiotensin II-infused and VEGFCc156s-treated, angiotensin II-infused groups indicated successful release of angiotensin II from the pumps in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that VEGFCc156s did not interfere with angiotensin II effects to alleviate the phenotypes in this disease model. Another possibility is that VEGFCc156s might affect the skin lymphatic vasculature to regulate blood pressure, as skin lymphatics have been implicated as a potential disease-modifying factor in the pathogenesis of salt-sensitive hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karlsen et al., 2018</xref>). After 6 weeks of treatment, VEGFCc156s significantly increased skin lymphatic vessel density and diameter in angiotensin II-infused mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1O–1R</xref>); these changes may contribute to the reductions observed in blood pressure in these animals. Further investigations are needed to fully characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of VEGFCc156s on angiotensin II-induced hypertension.</p><p>To dissect the potential direct effect of VEGFCc156s on the heart from its effect on blood pressure, we examined the effects of VEGFCc156s in angiotensin II-infused mice at 1 week after treatment, at which timepoint the blood pressure was similarly high in animals treated with angiotensin II alone or a combination of angiotensin II and VEGFCc156s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Although VEGFCc156s treatment enhanced podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessel growth in the heart at this timepoint, it did not alleviate cardiac hypertrophy in angiotensin II-infused mice. More interestingly, VEGFCc156s treatment restored angiotensin II-induced pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory markers in angiotensin II-infused hearts in gene expression analyses and immunohistochemistry staining, indicating a beneficial effect of VEGFCc156s in a blood pressure-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>). The lymphatic vasculature has been proposed to play an important role in regulating myocardial fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brakenhielm et al., 2020</xref>) and a previous report indicated that lymphangiogenic factor treatment in a rat model of myocardial infarction improved cardiac function by reducing cardiac fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henri et al., 2016</xref>). Our results are in line with this previous report, as VEGFCc156s also reduced cardiac fibrosis in angiotensin II-infused mice as early as 1 week post-treatment, which may contribute to the efficacy we observed at the 6-week timepoint.</p><p>In summary, our study demonstrates that lymphatic vessels are impaired in cardiac dysfunction, and the lymphangiogenic therapy VEGFCc156s prevented cardiac dysfunction by improving lymphatic vascular function, alleviating cardiac fibrosis and inflammation, and ameliorating hypertension. These results provide new insights into the potential effects of a lymphangiogenic therapy on chronic cardiac diseases and underlying mechanisms and indicate that the lymphatic vasculature could be a therapeutic target for hypertension and hypertensive heart disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and treatments</title><p>10 to14 weeks old C57/BL6N (#027 purchased from Charles River laboratories) male mice were used for most of the studies, and Prox1-eGFP knock-in male mice were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology and used for in vivo studies at 9–15 weeks old.

Cryo-section (10 μm thickness) of OCT embedded hearts at different depths spanning the whole ventricle were generated for immunohistochemistry. Cryo-section (10 μm thickness) of OCT embedded ears at different depths spanning the whole ear were generated for immunohistochemistry. Picrosirius red (PSR) stain were conducted using mouse heart or kidney frozen sections following an optimized protocol using Bouin’s solution (FXBOULT, American Mastertech), 1% phosphomolybdic acid (26693–08, EMS), 0.1% picrosirius red solution (F-357–2, Rowley Biochemical) and 1% acetic acid (100–1, Ricca). Lyve1 (abcam, ab14917, 1:500), podoplanin (abcam, ab11936, 1:250), CD68 (ThermoFisher, MA5-16674, 1:300), smooth muscle actin (abcam, ab7817,1:100) and GFP (abcam, ab13970, 1:100) immunostaining was performed in 3% goat serum (ThermoFisher) and 2% BSA in 0.3% Triton-X (ThermoFisher) at 4°C overnight, followed by fluorescent secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Autofluorescence were quenched using trueview autofluorescence quenching kit and sections were mounted in VECTASHIELD Vibrance Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI (vector laboratories). For the whole mount stain of diaphragm, the whole diaphragm of Prox1-eGFP mice was used for staining following the immunostaining protocol for cryo-sections without the autofluorescence quenching step. For the whole mount stain of ear skins, the ear skins were isolated and cleaned, and stained for Lyve1 following the immunostaining protocol for cryo-sections without the autofluorescence quenching step. The whole-mount-stained samples were imaged using a confocal microscope (ZEISS) with 20x objective. WGA stain was conducted using Alexa 594-conjugated WGA (W11262, ThermoFisher) following manufacturer’s protocol with one modification that sections were incubated with WGA overnight at 4°C instead of 10 mins under room temperature. The WGA-stained sections were washed after WGA incubation and mounted with Prolong Gold mounting medium with DAPI (P36935, Thermofisher). Stained slides were scanned using a ZEISS Axio Scan Slide Scanner with 20x objective and whole section images were analyzed using Visiopharm and custom-designed apps. For the quantification of CD68-positive macrophages, three to six sections spanning the ventricle were used, and macrophages were defined as CD68 and DAPI double-positive cells. Macrophage density was calculated by dividing the count of macrophages to the total area for each section. The density of macrophages near arteries was defined as the total count of macrophages within 20 μm distance from any smooth muscle actin-positive artery normalized to the total area for each section. The data for macrophage density was normalized to the average value of ctrl group and represented as fold change. For the quantification of podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessel density and area, 6 to 12 sections spanning the ventricle were used. A size filter of 500 μm<sup>2</sup> was used to define the vessels and reduce the noise from podoplanin-positive cells. The count of podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessels was normalized to the total area for each section and defined as the density of podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessels. The average lumen area was calculated by dividing the lumen area of the podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessels by the density of podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessels in each section. A linear mixed model with animals treated as random effects and group and sections treated as fixed effects was used for the statistical analysis for the quantification of podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessel density and lumen area. Tukey’s multiple comparison adjustment was used for pairwise comparisons in the linear mixed model. The data for podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessel density was normalized to the average value of ctrl group and represented as fold change. The analysis for the quantification of cardiomyocyte size and variance coefficient was conducted following previously published methods and SOPs for muscle fiber size and size variability quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briguet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pertl et al., 2013</xref>). The variance coefficient is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of cardiomyocyte size to the mean value of cardiomyocyte size and represents the variability of cell size among the quantified population. A linear mixed model with defined regions of interest (ROIs) treated as random effects and group treated as fixed effects was used for the statistical analysis for variance coefficient and Tukey’s multiple comparison adjustment was used for pairwise comparisons in the model. For the quantification of lyve1-positive lymphatic vessel density in kidney and ear skin, the lyve1-positive lymphatic vessel count was normalized to the total area for each section. A linear mixed model with defined regions of interest (ROI) treated as random effects and group treated as fixed effects was used for the statistical analysis of lyve1-positive lymphatic vessel density. Tukey’s multiple comparison adjustment was used for pairwise comparisons in the linear mixed model. For the quantification of PSR stains, three sections spanning the ventricle were used for staining and the images were analyzed using visiopharm. The total PSR-positive area and perivascular PSR-positive area were normalized to total area of the section. For the quantification of lyve1-positive lymphatic vessel diameter in ear skin, the analysis was conducted blindly by L.S. using Image J. Visiopharm-based image analyses were conducted blindly by J.P. All the representative images were taken using a confocal microscope (ZEISS) with 20x or 40x objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Lymphangiography</title><p>Lymphangiography was performed in anesthetized mice 5–6 weeks after minipump implantation following a previously reported method with modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henri et al., 2016</xref>). The animal first received a dose of FITC-Dextran (30 mg/ml, FD500S, MW: 500 kDa, Sigma-Aldrich) mixed with alexa Fluor 555 Cadaverine (6 μg/g, A30677, ThermoFisher) and heparin (20 U/ml) via retro-orbital (R.O.) injection under isoflurane. Next, the mouse was further anesthetized and placed under a surgical plane of anesthesia using isoflurane with intubation through tracheotomy. Ten μl fluorescent quantum dots (Q21021MP, ThermoFisher) were injected intramyocardially into the apex of the heart using a Hamilton neuros micro-injection syringe (Hamilton 6546006). Five min after injection, blood was sampled from the animal in EDTA, and the heart was extracted from the animal, arrested in diastole with saturated potassium chloride and fixed with formalin for imaging. The plasma qdot signal (emission at 655) in 50 μl plasma was measured using a fluorescent plate reader. Whole heart was imaged using a LSM 880 Confocal microscope (ZEISS) with a 1x objective, and HDR imaging was used to enhance image contrast. The same intensity and imaging settings were used for acquiring the cadaverine images for all the animals. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> were acquired from two rounds of independent in vivo studies. The cadaverine-positive areas were quantified from at least four images taken from four different sides of each heart and normalized to the total area of the heart using image J. The values were normalized to the average value of the control group for presentation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. The qdot plasma concentrations of each group were normalized to the average qdot plasma concentration of the control group for each round of studies and then combined for illustration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Cell isolation using Prox1-eGFP mice and low input RNA-seq</title><p>Prox1-eGFP mice were used for cell isolation at 5–6 weeks after minipump implantation for preparing RNA-seq samples and wildtype non-carrier mice were used at similar age for preparing single stain controls. The animals were euthanized using carbon dioxide, and heart and diaphragm were isolated from the animals and transferred into a storage solution containing 2.5% BSA (A7030, Sigma-Aldrich) in HBSS (14025092, Thermo Fisher). The tissues were then cut into tiny pieces and digested with a digestion enzyme mixture with Collegenase A (11088793001, Roche), Collegenase from <italic>Clostridium histolyticum</italic> (C7657, Sigma-Aldrich), Dnase I (DN25, Sigma-Aldrich), Hydraluronidase (HX0514-1, Sigma-Aldrich) and 2.5% BSA in HBSS for 45 min in 37°C waterbath with shaking. The tissue pieces were next broken up further with pipetting and the enzymes were neutralized with DMEM/F12 medium (10565042, Thermo Fisher) containing 10% FBS (26140087, Thermo Fisher). The solutions with digested tissues were centrifuged at 400 g for 3 min, and cardiomyocytes were pelleted from digested heart tissues. The cardiomyocytes were next washed with PBS once and lysed for RNA with RLT cell lysis buffer. The supernatant of each solution was isolated and filtered through 40-µm cell strainer. The solutions were then centrifuged at 1500 g for 5 min to pellet the cells and the cells were resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer (11814389001, Roche) to lyse red blood cells. Next, the cells were pelleted and washed with FACS buffer (1% BSA in PBS) twice and cell density was counted. 0.2 million cells were aliquoted either from wild-type animal tissues or Prox1-eGFP tissues for single stain controls. Mouse Fc block (553142, BD) were added to each tube to inhibit non-specific binding and the samples were stained for CD45.2 (560696, BD, 1:100), or/and CD31 (561814, BD, 1:100) for 30 min on ice in the dark. The cells were then washed with FACS buffer twice and resuspended in sort buffer (10 mM HEPES (15630080, Thermo Fisher), 2 mM EDTA (AM9912, Thermo Fisher) and 0.5% BSA in PBS) at 20 million/ml for live cell sorting. DAPI (D1306, Thermo Fisher, 1:5000) was added to the cells before sorting to stain the dead cells and the cells were sorted using SONY SH800 cell sorter with 100 µm chip. Blood endothelial cells were defined as DAPI negative, CD45.2 negative, CD31 positive, and eGFP negative cells and lymphatic endothelial cells were defined as DAPI negative, CD45.2 negative, CD31 positive, and eGFP positive cells. The cells were sorted into RLT lysis buffer at 4°C, and total RNA was extracted from each isolated cell population using the RNeasy MinElute cleanup kit (74204, Qiagen) following manufacturer’s protocol. Extracted total RNA was stored at −80°C freezer until the library preparation step. For low-input RNA-seq, total RNA concentration for each sample was measured using high sensitivity plates on a Lunatic nanodrop instrument (Unchained Labs) before proceeding to library prep. Of total RNA, 2 ng were aliquoted from each sample from which mRNA was isolated and converted into cDNA using the Smart-Seq ultra low input RNA kit (634890, Takara) following manufacturer’s protocol. The libraries were next prepared from converted cDNA using Nextera DNA XT Library Prep Kit (FC-131–1096, Illumina) following manufacturer’s protocol. Library concentrations were quantified using Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay kit (Q33231, Thermo Fisher) and the quality of the libraries was examined using Agilent High Sensitivity D1000 Screentape System (5067–5584 and 5067–5585, Agilent) on an Agilent 4200 Tapestation. The libraries from cardiomyocytes were pooled together and sequenced using NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit (20024907, Illumina). The libraries from endothelial cells were randomized, divided into two sets and pooled together for two rounds of sequencing using NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kits (20024907, Illumina).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>RNA-seq analysis</title><p>Sequencing reads were de-multiplexed using the picard tool bcl2fastq, and quality control was performed on the fastq files using FastQC. The reads were then aligned to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38) using the STAR aligner (v.2.5.3a) with quantMode specified for Transcriptome SAM, out SAM type specified as BAM, out Filter Mismatch Nover Lmax as 0.05, align SJDBoverhang Min as 1, out Filter Score Min Over Lread as 0.9, out Filter Match Nmin Over Lread as 0.9, and align Intron Max as 1000000. Gene counts for each sample were generated from the BAM alignment files using Salmon (v.0.12.0) in alignment-aware mode, based on gene/isoform features annotated by Ensembl release 95. Using the log2 normalized gene counts, we performed principal components analysis across samples within each of the four different cell types to identify outlier samples and removed samples that were greater than three standard deviations from the mean value of the first two principal components. For differential expression analysis, all downstream differential expression analysis and functional enrichment analyses were performed in R (v.3.5.3). We performed differential expression analysis within each of the four different cell types among treatment groups using DESeq2, adjusting for age of the animals, and sequencing run batch for the endothelial cell experiments, as well as surrogate technical variables detected using sva analysis. We additionally performed differential expression analysis across all three endothelial cell groups to identify potential interactions with treatment using the limma-voom framework. To identify pathways and sets of genes enriched in our significantly differentially expressed results, we performed functional enrichment analysis using the topGO enrichment analysis with the weight01 method. Finally, in order to identify potential upstream regulators of the observed expression changes from our results, we performed causal reasoning analysis based on a previously reported approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chindelevitch et al., 2012</xref>). In order to generate the network to identify the upstream regulators, we used proprietary network data compiled from several different sources, but including information on proteins, mRNAs, compounds, and biological processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Plasma and skin chemokine measurement</title><p>Chemokine levels in plasma and native skin lysates were examined using MSD U-plex chemokine combo 1 (Ms) kit (K15321K-1, MSD) following manufacturer’s protocol. 20 μg of native skin lysate was loaded to each well.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Gou Young Koh as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Matthias Barton as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. In the light of the comments made by the reviewers, we decided to offer a &quot;major revision&quot; prior to publishing your manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The comments of all two reviewers are in good agreement. While the reviewers found this work to be of importance as a translational research, they raised concerns about the lack of mechanistic insights on the preclinical VEGFC1563 therapy for chronic cardiac dysfunction. The authors are required to carefully address the comments point-by-point in a data-driven manner or with further analyses or discussions. Specifically, the authors are encouraged to pay attention to the major comment 1 of reviewer 1 and comments 1-3 of reviewer 2. If necessary, please provide the reasons for not implementing the suggested changes. We believe the authors could revise the manuscript successfully given their expertise.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Song et al., shows the importance and mechanistic insights of lymphatic vasculature in chronic cardiac dysfunction. The authors demonstrated pathological and functional association of cardiac lymphatics in an angiotensin infusion-induced cardiac dysfunction model. Moreover, they showed that lymphangiogenic therapy using VEGFCc156s can alleviate pathological changes and ameliorate heart function by improving cardiac lymphatic function and mitigating inflammation and hypertension. The intriguing findings of this study suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for chronic cardiac dysfunction induced by hypertension. Therefore, I consider this work suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after addressing following points.</p><p>(1) VEGFC – VEGFR3 signaling pathway is the most well-known signaling axis regulating development and growth of lymphatic vasculature. The authors showed that VEGFCc156s infusion reduced the loss of cardiac lymphatic vasculature as demonstrated by increased podoplanin+ lymphatic vessel density and area in Figure 2J and Figure 2—figure supplement 1M. However, an interesting observation was made in kidney lymphatic vasculature, where the VEGFCc156s administration reduced lymphatic endothelial cell marker genes and lymphatic vessel density in Figure 6E, F and Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, C, D. What is the authors' explanation for such an opposite effect of VEGFCc156s, and what is the effect of VEGFCc156s on other organ lymphatics? For example, &quot;skin&quot; which is related to pathogenesis of hypertension.</p><p>2) How are cardiac lymphatic valves affected in AngII and AngII+VEGFC groups?</p><p>3) In Figure 2I and Figure 4G, what is the image showing? Is it ctrl, angll or angll+VEGFC group? The authors should provide a representative image for each group.</p><p>4) In Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, eGFP signal shown is quite not clear. Co-staining with LEC marker genes are required.</p><p>5) In Figure 2—figure supplement 1G and H – representative images for each group is required. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1L and Figure 6—figure supplement 1D, P-value for the quantification is omitted.</p><p>6) Results – LYVE1 is highly expressed in a subset of macrophages. How could the authors exclude the involvement of LYVE1 sequence from LYVE1+ macrophages when analyzing the SNP of the genome from whole human heart tissue?</p><p>7) Results – What is the source of VEGF-C?</p><p>8) Results – PDPN expression can be upregulated in inflamed heart, but the authors stated that the PDPN expression was reduced in chronic heart failure patients. What could be the reason for this discrepancy?</p><p>9) More defined analyses are required to visualize interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrate and tubular basophilia in the kidney.</p><p>10) Figure 1A can be arranged by Table 1.</p><p>11) Figure 2 – What is an implication of the lung weight change? Does it imply a reduction in lung edema?</p><p>12) In Figure 3 – The injection site and cardiac lymphatics are unclear.</p><p>13) Overall, the data presentation should be improved. It is hard to follow them.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Song et al. report that continuous infusion of Vegfr-3 ligand VEGF-C156S prevents development of chronic cardiac dysfunction using angiotensin II (AngII) infusion-induced model. Continuous delivery of VEGFC156s increased heart lymphatic vascular density and lymphatic drainage, reduced AngII-induced cardiac and lung hypertrophy and improved cardiac contractibility together with a decreased Nppb expression The authors also analysed the transcriptional changes in LECs, BECs and cardiomyocytes isolated from the heart and diaphragm LECs. They report that AngII produces global changes at the transcriptomes of LECs, BECs and cardiomyocytes and many of the changes are resolved upon VEGFC156s, specifically in LECs of heart and diaphragm. AngII induced genes involved in inflammation and immune cell chemotaxis, changes that were reversed upon VEGFC156s treatment. They also suggest that TLR, Hif1a and Gli1 pathways drive LEC transcriptional changes in cardiac dysfunction, which are then ameliorated upon VEGF-C treatment. Since hypertension is one of the characteristics of chronic cardiac disease, the authors analysed the effect of VEGFC156s and demonstrate by that it reduces blood pressure. Finally, the authors report kidney dysfunction (by Urine volume and ACR ratio) recovery after VEGFC156s treatment.</p><p>Finding that lymphangiogenic therapy improves resolution of myocardial edema and inflammation, and prevents cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis is not new, as reported in several previous studies (e.g. Henri et al. and Houssari et al. ). However, here the authors convincingly show that co-administration of VEGF-C improves multiple pathological parameters in chronic cardiac dysfunction model. It is therefore a clinically relevant result, especially because the authors deliver the protein systemically and show that relatively modest two-fold increase in circulating levels of VEGF-C156S produces substantial therapeutic benefits. Unfortunately, the study is rather descriptive and the authors did not pursue further molecular analysis of cardiac and diaphragm lymphatic endothelial cells to better characterize the molecular changes imposed by failing heart and treatment with VEGF-C.</p><p>1) An important distinguishing feature of the current manuscript is systemic delivery of VEGFR-3 ligand, as opposed to cardiac delivery in previous publications. Therefore the authors should provide better characterization of the effects of systemic VEGF-C administration on lymphatic vasculature both in heart and other organs, such as skin. Notably, they should establish whether their infusion method leads to the expansion of initial capillary network or, perhaps enlargement of pre-collecting or collecting vessels. At least one publication demonstrated that recombinant VEGF-C156S promoted lymphatic contractility (Breslin et al., 2007), hence improved lymphatic draining function upon VEGF-C156S administration can be potentially uncoupled from its lymphangiogenic activity. Indeed, in the lymphoangiography images of Figure 3 the angII effects on the heart and the vessel leakiness are clear, however the Qdot images do not show much expansion of lymphatic vascular network. Furthermore, increased skin lymphangiogenesis has been shown to improve outcomes in salt-induced hypertension model (Machnik et al., 2009), therefore lymphatic vessel expansion in organs other than heart is potentially directly relevant.</p><p>2) The beneficial effects of VEGFC156S infusion in AngII-infusion model are encouraging. However, AngII and VEGF-C156S were infused simultaneously. To know if lymphangiogenic treatment can be used as therapy, ideally it would be important to know whether VEGFC-156S administration helps after establishment of cardiac dysfunction. In the very least, the timeline of cardiac and other organ lymphangiogenesis should be documented in more detail.</p><p>3) Do the authors check the effect of VEGFC156s alone? It would have been great added value to include it as control in all in vivo experimentation.</p><p>4) The authors made a number of broad conclusions based on bulk RNAseq data of cardiac and diaphragm LECs. However, I am not convinced that they monitor cell-autonomous effects in their analyses. For example, several genes that they report to be modulate in LECs in their models are to the best of my knowledge, expressed in immune cells and not in LECs, such as PF4, ITGAM, CD276 etc. One potential explanation, and we observed this effect also in our models, is that bulk sorted LECs can be contaminated with small number of immune cells (and of course other cell types, depending on the organ). Please provide evidence of the purity of isolated populations by analysing the expression of established markers, such as CD31 and CDH5 (endothelial identity), <italic>Prox1</italic>, <italic>Flt1</italic> and <italic>Nrp1</italic> (lymphatic and blood endothelial cell markers), <italic>Ptprc</italic> (immune cells), collagen 6 subunits (fibroblasts) and confirm that at least some of the functionally relevant transcripts, identified as differentially expressed in LECs by bioinformatics analyses, are indeed expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells by immunostaining. Similarly, the suggestions that N-Myc drives VEGF-C effects and that AngII induces and Vegf-C repress activation of TLR, Hif1A and Gli1 pathways in LECs, are intriguing, but they are not substantiated by any other means, and therefore remains speculative.</p><p>5) Since patients with hypertension harbour lower VEGFC serum levels, did the authors analysed what were the serum levels of endogenous VEGF-C in their hypertension model for angII and angII+ VEGFC156s conditions?</p><p>6) The authors show that in concordance with reduction of hypertension, VEGFC156s improved kidney dysfunction. But what is the effect of VEGFC156s in renal lymphatics? Only expression levels of lymphatic markers and density analysis was performed. The authors confirm previous studies showing that in response to hypertension there is expansion of lymphatic vessels in kidneys and observe a decrease LEC markers expression upon VEGFC156s. This part is controversial, how do the authors explain the decrease on lymphatic markers expression upon VEGF156s? The authors suggest this is a result of the low dose used, however this dose was enough to recover lymphatic function, inflammation and hypertension and poor retention in the kidney would justify no differences, however there is a decrease of lymphatic endothelial cell markers when comparing angII and angII+ VEGFC. Indeed, in the kidney the effect of angII and angII +VEGFC156s on lymphatic markers is opposite to what is observed in the heart. How do the authors explain this point?</p><p>7) AngII infusion is known to induce extensive interstitial fibrosis. What was the effect of VEGF-C156S administration on this important pathophysiological parameter?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58376.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] (1) VEGFC – VEGFR3 signaling pathway is the most well-known signaling axis regulating development and growth of lymphatic vasculature.

For example, &quot;skin&quot; which is related to pathogenesis of hypertension.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that systemic administration of VEGFCc156s could have a multitude of effects outside of the heart. To address this concern, we examined the effect of VEGFCc156s on ear skin lymphatic vessels 6 weeks post-angiotensin II infusion, and observed that similar to the effects of VEGFCc156s on the lymphatic vessels in heart at this timepoint, VEGFCc156s treatment significantly increased ear skin lymphatic vessel diameter and lymphatic vascular density, supporting a systemic lymphangiogenic response induced by VEGFCc156s treatment (new data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1O-R). We agree that the changes in skin lymphatics could contribute to the effect of the treatment on hypertension and we have added text to the Discussion accordingly.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the lymphatic marker qPCR and <italic>lyve1</italic> staining data in the kidney at the 6-week timepoint are intriguing. As new data with this revision, we conducted in vivo studies to profile the time-course of the protective effects of VEGFCc156s on angiotensin II-induced cardiac dysfunction and characterized the changes induced by the treatment at 1 week after treatment. In this new study, VEGFCc156s treatment in healthy and angiotensin II-infused animals induced a trend towards increased lymphatic vessel density in skin and a significant increase in podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessel density in heart, indicating that VEGFCc156s can indeed induce lymphangiogenesis (Figure 7—figure supplement 1I-L). However, at this time point, <italic>Lyve1</italic> expression and <italic>Lyve1</italic>-positive lymphatic vessel density was not altered in the kidney of animals treated with VEGFCc156s alone (Figure 7—figure supplement 1F-H), confirming that the VEGFCc156s treatment did not induce lymphangiogenesis in kidney at the dose we use for our studies. These new data along with the data on kidney lymphatics at 6 weeks after angiotensin II infusion (Figure 6E, F, Figure 6—figure supplement 1E-H) suggest that the increase in renal <italic>lyve1</italic> gene expression and lymphatic vessel density in this model could be secondary to the hypertension status of the animals. At 1 week, the hypertension is not sufficient to drive this change, and by 6 weeks, hypertension has caused an adaptation in angiotensin II-infused animals to induce lymphangiogenesis that is ameliorated by the reduced hypertension in VEGFCc156s-infused, angiotensin II-treated animals. In addition, it is possible that the systemic infusion of VEGFCc156s did not significantly affect kidney lymphatics due to the low dose and poor local kidney retention, whereas transgenic overexpression of VEGFD specifically in kidney as in previous reports would sustain high local expression and therefore produce a greater local effect. We have discussed these hypotheses in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How are cardiac lymphatic valves affected in AngII and AngII+VEGFC groups?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we made cross-sections of the heart for immunofluorescence staining and we did not have additional heart tissue to perform whole mount imaging of the lymphatic valves. Therefore, we were unable to evaluate this parameter. This is discussed as a limitation in the manuscript Discussion and will be an area of interest for us to investigate in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 2I and Figure 4G, what is the image showing?

How could the authors exclude the involvement of LYVE1 sequence from LYVE1+ macrophages when analyzing the SNP of the genome from whole human heart tissue?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this helpful comment from the reviewer. The associations we observed in GWAS analysis are the associations between a specific loci with a disease phenotype where <italic>Lyve1</italic> and another gene are located or close to, and the results do not indicate the exact gene that mediates the effect or the exact cell type that mediates the effect. We agree with the reviewer that it is possible that several types of cells including both <italic>Lyve1</italic>+ macrophages and <italic>Lyve1</italic>+ lymphatic vessels may mediate the effect, and unfortunately the GWAS analysis will not provide us with the information concerning cell types due to the nature of the analysis. We have revised our description on the GWAS data to make it more accurate (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Results – What is the source of VEGF-C?</p></disp-quote><p>The VEGFCc156s we used for our in vivo studies is the recombinant human VEGF-C (Cys156Ser) protein purchased from R&amp;D systems. It has been used previously to induce lymphangiogenesis in vivo in mice (Klotz et al., 2015), and the sequence of this human VEGFC short-form is identical to the mouse VEGFC short-form.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Results – PDPN expression can be upregulated in inflamed heart, but the authors stated that the PDPN expression was reduced in chronic heart failure patients. What could be the reason for this discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware of previous publications (Cimini, et al., 2017; Miguel Quintanilla, et al., MDPI, 2019; Cimini, et al., 2019) indicating that podoplanin expression could be upregulated in inflamed hearts due to an increase in podoplanin-expressing cells that are not lymphatic endothelial cells. This upregulation would be most significant in the highly inflamed/fibrotic infarcted area due to the local accumulation of podoplanin-expressing cells that facilitate local inflammation. To that end, we used chronic heart failure human hearts and a chronic cardiac dysfunction model, which have a very different pathogenesis compared with a myocardial infarction model, which represents acute injury. In addition, compared with the previous reports that looked specifically at the infarcted/fibrotic site in heart, we sampled from the whole heart and also utilized immunohistochemistry staining for podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessels, in which we excluded podoplanin-positive cells that were not part of a vessel from the vessel quantification using a size filter in our visiopharm-based image analysis (subsection “Histology and immunohistochemistry”). Thus, we suggest that the changes in podoplanin expression we observed in our disease model largely come from the lymphatic vasculature but not podoplanin-expressing cells, and the discrepancy between our findings and previous reports is due to the differences in disease models and disease pathogenesis. We have added the references into our revised manuscript and added a Discussion point concerning this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) More defined analyses are required to visualize interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrate and tubular basophilia in the kidney.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment from the reviewer. The pathologist that evaluated the H&amp;E staining in the kidney used this nomenclature to describe the pathological findings. To improve visualization of these endpoints, we first enlarged the H&amp;E image in Figure 6—figure supplement 1A to improve the image resolution. To further evaluate kidney pathology, we conducted a PSR stain using the same kidney sections to add an additional evaluation of kidney fibrosis. The results indicated that angiotensin II infusion induced renal fibrosis, which was significantly reduced by VEGFCc156s treatment (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, C, D). We feel that the new PSR staining results will strengthen the kidney datasets reported at 6-week post-angiotensin II infusion and our overall conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 1A can be arranged by Table 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We were informed by the editor that the format of table supplements is not preferred by the journal and therefore we have rearranged Figure 1 and converted the original Figure 1A (GWAS analysis) into Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 2 – What is an implication of the lung weight change? Does it imply a reduction in lung edema?</p></disp-quote><p>An increase in lung weight is commonly observed in severe cardiac dysfunction or heart failure and it does reflect a change in lung edema (King and Goldstein, 2020). We regularly use both heart weight and lung weight to evaluate cardiac function of the animals at euthanasia, and it’s possible that the reduction in the lung weight of VEGFCc156s-treated, angiotensin II-infused animals compared with animals treated with angiotensin II alone implied a reduction in lung edema. However, definitive measurement of lung edema requires measurement of the wet/dry ratio using fresh lungs and unfortunately, we no longer have fresh lungs to perform this measurement. We have added text to denote this possibility to the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) In Figure 3 – The injection site and cardiac lymphatics are unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and added a red arrowhead to the injection site (apex) and have used white arrow heads to delineate the cardiac lymphatics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Overall, the data presentation should be improved.

To address this comment, we first conducted an additional analysis on the podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessel quantification in heart to evaluate the average podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessel lumen area. Indeed, as the reviewer pointed out, there was a significant enlargement of the podoplanin-positive pre-collector vessel lumen in VEGFCc156s-treated angiotensin II-infused hearts compared with hearts treated with angiotensin II alone (Figure 2K), which was consistent with the significant improvement we observed in cardiac lymphatic transport in VEGFCc156s-treated hearts using lymphangiography (Figure 3) and indicated a functional change in the collecting vessels.</p><p>In addition, we examined the effect of VEGFCc156s on the lymphatic vessels in ear skin 6 weeks after treatment. Similar to the effects of VEGFCc156s on the lymphatic vessels in heart at this timepoint, VEGFCc156s treatment significantly increased lymphatic vessel diameter and lymphatic vascular density in the ear skin of angiotensin II-infused animals, supporting a systemic lymphangiogenic response induced by VEGFCc156s treatment (Figure 2—figure supplement 1O-R). We agree that the changes in the lymphatics in skin induced by VEGFCc156s treatment could contribute to the effect of the treatment on hypertension, and we have added a point on this in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The beneficial effects of VEGFC156S infusion in AngII-infusion model are encouraging.

However, due to the minipump administration of angiotensin II and VEGFCc156s, this is very difficult to achieve, as our IACUC limits the number of surgical procedures on mice (only one surgery per animal allowed). Therefore unfortunately, we are unable to conduct a reversal experiment using the infusion method. We also agree with the reviewer that a more careful assessment of the lymphangiogenesis timeline should be performed. Following this suggestion, we conducted in vivo studies to characterize the timecourse of the beneficial effect of VEGFCc156s on angiotensin II-induced cardiac dysfunction. We specifically examined the effect of VEGFCc156s 1-week post-infusion, at which time, the blood pressure was equally high in both angiotensin II-infused and VEGFCc156s-treated angiotensin II-infused mice based on the telemetry study result from Figure 5. We found that at this early time point, whereas VEGFCc156s does not have an effect on blood pressure, it significantly reduced angiotensin II-induced gene expression in pathways involved in cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation. Furthermore, VEGFCc156s infusion alleviated angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibrosis and inflammation as assessed by histological staining at this early 1-week timepoint. These new results are included in Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and 2. We feel that these new data significantly improve the quality of the manuscript and solidify the conclusions drawn. We thank the reviewer for the constructive advice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Do the authors check the effect of VEGFC156s alone? It would have been great added value to include it as control in all in vivo experimentation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a VEGFCc156s alone arm would have added value in our studies. Following this advice, we added a treatment arm in new data added here that assesses one week of infusion of VEGFCc156s alone. In this assessment, a lymphangiogenic response in heart was observed in VEGFCc156s-alone infused animals, which was similar to animals that were infused with VEGFCc156s and angiotensin II concurrently. These new results are included in Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors made a number of broad conclusions based on bulk RNAseq data of cardiac and diaphragm LECs. However, I am not convinced that they monitor cell-autonomous effects in their analyses. For example, several genes that they report to be modulate in LECs in their models are to the best of my knowledge, expressed in immune cells and not in LECs, such as PF4, ITGAM, CD276 etc. One potential explanation, and we observed this effect also in our models, is that bulk sorted LECs can be contaminated with small number of immune cells (and of course other cell types, depending on the organ). Please provide evidence of the purity of isolated populations by analysing the expression of established markers, such as CD31 and CDH5 (endothelial identity), Prox1, Flt1 and Nrp1 (lymphatic and blood endothelial cell markers), Ptprc (immune cells), collagen 6 subunits (fibroblasts) and confirm that at least some of the functionally relevant transcripts, identified as differentially expressed in LECs by bioinformatics analyses, are indeed expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells by immunostaining. Similarly, the suggestions that N-Myc drives VEGF-C effects and that AngII induces and Vegf-C repress activation of TLR, Hif1A and Gli1 pathways in LECs, are intriguing, but they are not substantiated by any other means, and therefore remains speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern regarding the purity of the cell isolations used for RNAseq. We used several methods to ensure purity of sorted cells. First, we digested the hearts and did a slow spin to isolate heavy cells such as cardiomyocytes. We then flow sorted for CD45.2 (encoded by <italic>Ptprc</italic>) negative cells, which should ensure that we are not identifying immune cells, and we set stringent gates to ensure the sorted cell populations were expressing the correct markers (cell sorting workflow and gating parameters are detailed in Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). We conducted multiple tests to optimize the cell isolation workflow and performed qPCR to assess various marker genes in the sorted cell populations to assess purity. We provide a figure to the reviewer here from one of our test runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) demonstrating that the cardiomyocyte population (isolated by low speed centrifugation, which is relatively impure and may contain other cell types in addition to cardiomyocytes) expressed high levels of cardiac markers (<italic>Myh7</italic>, <italic>Actn2</italic>), whereas endothelial cells (sorted by CD45.2 negative, CD31 positive) did not express <italic>Ptprc</italic> (CD45) and expressed <italic>Pecam1</italic> (CD31). In addition, lymphatic endothelial cell populations (sorted by CD45.2 negative, CD31 positive, GFP positive) expressed high levels of lymphatic endothelial markers (<italic>Lyve1</italic>, <italic>Pdpn</italic>, <italic>Flt4</italic> and <italic>Prox1</italic>) (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of cell-specific marker expression in isolated cardiomyocytes (CMs), cardiac lymphatic endothelial cells (ECs), cardiac blood ECs and diaphragm lymphatic ECs.</title><p>The cells were isolated from the heart and diaphragm of a <italic>Prox1</italic>-eGFP mouse following the cell isolation procedure shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1D in main manuscript.

In addition, consistent with our pilot optimization test result, our RNAseq analysis could not detect <italic>ptprc</italic> (CD45) expression and detected high counts of <italic>Pecam1</italic> (CD31) (TPM count 410-530 for lymphatic ECs, 740-850 for blood ECs and 137-138 for cardiomyocytes) and Cdh5 (TPM count 65-90 for lymphatic ECs, 164-220 for blood ECs and 22-29 for cardiomyocytes) in our isolated blood and lymphatic endothelial cell populations.

The cardiomyocyte population (isolated by centrifugation, relatively impure) showed a relatively high expression of collagen 6 subunits (Col6a1 TPM count 100-210, Col6a2 TPM count 100-220) while lymphatic endothelial cell populations showed a low expression of collagen 6 subunits (Col6a1 TPM count 10-34, Col6a2 TPM count 12-27). We could only isolate 800-1200 lymphatic endothelial cells/heart and 1000-2000 lymphatic endothelial cells/diaphragm with the stringent cell isolation protocol, and the cell amount was just enough for a low-input RNAseq method for the transcriptional profiling of the distinct cell populations. Therefore unfortunately, we don’t have extra cells for additional immunostaining tests to confirm the identity of each isolated cell population. However, based on our stringent isolation and gating procedures described above as well as the RNAseq TPM count data, we suggest that the cell populations we isolated for RNAseq were relatively pure. We agree with the reviewer that the RNAseq results and pathway analysis need to be validated with more experiments, and that will fall into the scope of future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Since patients with hypertension harbour lower VEGFC serum levels, did the authors analysed what were the serum levels of endogenous VEGF-C in their hypertension model for angII and angII+ VEGFC156s conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>VEGFC concentration was assessed in plasma of the animals from our in vivo studies at both the 1-week and 6-week timepoints, and the results are included in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and Figure 7—figure supplement 1A. There was no significant difference in serum VEGFC levels between ctrl animals ang angiotensin II-infused animals. However, the human study we cited in the Discussion indicated that low serum VEGFC level was associated with a higher risk of hypertension, which is consistent with our finding that increasing serum VEGFC level could be beneficial for hypertension. In addition, the data from the human study we cited were from patients with refractory hypertension that doesn’t respond to regular anti-hypertensive therapy and there could be differences in pathogenesis and disease mechanisms between refractory hypertension in human and our angiotensin II model. We agree that further investigations are needed to understand the detailed mechanisms underlying these observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors show that in concordance with reduction of hypertension, VEGFC156s improved kidney dysfunction. But what is the effect of VEGFC156s in renal lymphatics? Only expression levels of lymphatic markers and density analysis was performed. The authors confirm previous studies showing that in response to hypertension there is expansion of lymphatic vessels in kidneys and observe a decrease LEC markers expression upon VEGFC156s. This part is controversial, how do the authors explain the decrease on lymphatic markers expression upon VEGF156s? The authors suggest this is a result of the low dose used, however this dose was enough to recover lymphatic function, inflammation and hypertension and poor retention in the kidney would justify no differences, however there is a decrease of lymphatic endothelial cell markers when comparing angII and angII+ VEGFC. Indeed, in the kidney the effect of angII and angII +VEGFC156s on lymphatic markers is opposite to what is observed in the heart. How do the authors explain this point?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the lymphatic marker qPCR and <italic>lyve1</italic> staining data in the kidney at the 6-week timepoint are intriguing. As new data with this revision, we conducted in vivo studies to profile the time-course of the protective effects of VEGFCc156s on angiotensin II-induced cardiac dysfunction and characterized the changes induced by the treatment at 1 week after treatment. In this new study, VEGFCc156s treatment in healthy and angiotensin II-infused animals induced a trend towards increased lymphatic vessel density in skin and a significant increase in podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessel density in heart, indicating that VEGFCc156s can indeed induce lymphangiogenesis (Figure 7—figure supplement 1I-L). However, at this time point, <italic>Lyve1</italic> expression and <italic>Lyve1</italic>-positive lymphatic vessel density was not altered in the kidney of animals treated with VEGFCc156s alone (Figure 7—figure supplement 1F-H), confirming that the VEGFCc156s treatment did not induce lymphangiogenesis in kidney at the dose we use for our studies. These new data along with the data on kidney lymphatics at 6 weeks after angiotensin II infusion (Figure 6E, F, Figure 6—figure supplement 1E-H) suggest that the increase in renal <italic>lyve1</italic> gene expression and lymphatic vessel density in this model could be secondary to the hypertension status of the animals and not a direct effect of VEGFCc156s on the kidney. At 1 week, the hypertension is not sufficient to drive this change, and by 6 weeks, hypertension has caused an adaptation in angiotensin II-infused animals to induce lymphangiogenesis that is ameliorated by the reduced hypertension in VEGFCc156s-infused, angiotensin II-treated animals. In addition, it is possible that the systemic infusion of VEGFCc156s did not significantly affect kidney lymphatics due to the low dose and poor local kidney retention, whereas transgenic overexpression of VEGFD specifically in kidney as in previous reports would sustain high local expression and therefore produce a greater local effect. We have discussed these hypotheses in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) AngII infusion is known to induce extensive interstitial fibrosis. What was the effect of VEGF-C156S administration on this important pathophysiological parameter?</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased to provide significant new data to address this point. PSR staining of mouse kidney sections indicated angiotensin II infusion induced significant kidney fibrosis after 6 weeks of infusion, which was significantly reduced in VEGFCc156s-treated animals(Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, C, D), indicating a beneficial effect of VEGFCc156s on kidney fibrosis and supporting an overall beneficial effect of VEGFCc156s on angiotensin II-induced kidney dysfunction at this timepoint. In addition, we also observed that VEGFCc156s treatment significantly reduced angiotensin II-induced pro-fibrotic gene expression and trended to reduce the level of cardiac fibrosis in the heart as early as 1-week post-treatment (Figure 7I-L, Figure 7—figure supplement 1P, Q). These new results indicate that VEGFCc156s improved the cardiac function in angiotensin II-infused animals by alleviating cardiac fibrosis in addition to the other mechanisms proposed in this manuscript.
