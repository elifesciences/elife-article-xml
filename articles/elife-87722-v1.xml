The activation of CRISPR in response to RNA biomarkers holds the potential for controlling CRISPR activity with spatiotemporal precision. This would enable the restriction of CRISPR activity to specific cell types expressing RNA biomarkers of interest while preventing unwanted activity in other cells. Here, we present a simple and specific platform for modulating CRISPR activity in response to RNA detection through engineering <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9 single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). sgRNAs are engineered to fold into complex secondary structures that, in the ground state, inhibit their activity. Engineered sgRNAs become activated upon recognising complementary RNAs, thus enabling Cas9 to perform its function. Our approach enables CRISPR activation in response to RNA detection in both HEK293T cells and zebrafish embryos. Iterative design optimisations allowed the development of computational tools for generating sgRNAs capable of detecting RNA sequences of choice. Mechanistic investigations reveal that engineered sgRNAs are cleaved during RNA detection, and we identify key positions that benefit from chemical modifications to improve the stability of engineered sgRNAs in vivo. Our sensors open up novel opportunities for developing new research and therapeutic applications using CRISPR activation in response to endogenous RNA biomarkers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>conditional activation</kwd><kwd>synthetic biology</kwd><kwd>RNA biomarkers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UKERC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grant EP/L016494/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelea</surname><given-names>Oana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/215615</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelea</surname><given-names>Oana</given-names></name><name><surname>Sauka-Spengler</surname><given-names>Tatjana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007795</institution-id><institution>Stowers Institute for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sauka-Spengler</surname><given-names>Tatjana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Such methods enable the visualisation of RNA foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mannack et al., 2016</xref>), but they cannot drive cellular reprogramming in response to RNA detection. Recent progress has been made towards enabling the activation of therapeutically relevant payloads in response to RNA detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2023</xref>). Nevertheless, linking RNA detection with gene editing or modulation of gene expression remains a challenge. Since cellular RNAs offer crucial information about cell identity, differentiation, disease status, and environmental exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdolhosseini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kotliar et al., 2019</xref>), modulating CRISPR activation in response to RNA detection holds tremendous promise for future innovations.</p><p>The single-guide RNA (sgRNA) component of <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> CRISPR-Cas9 systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>) tolerates extensive modifications and sgRNA engineering has been established as a method for controlling CRISPR activity. This is achieved by designing complex sgRNA secondary structures that can inactivate sgRNA function. Inactivated sgRNA structures serve as a starting point for the development of technologies that aim to control CRISPR in response to different molecular triggers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pelea et al., 2022</xref>).

While limited evidence is available for the modulation of CRISPR activity following RNA detection in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanewich-Hollatz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hochrein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hunt and Chen, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hunt and Chen, 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ying et al., 2020</xref>), published technologies that rely on sgRNA engineering still require improvement to enhance the dynamic range of activation. There is no clear evidence that existing engineering approaches can be generalised to detect a diverse panel of RNA sequences. Additionally, functional validation of engineered sgRNAs in vivo remains unexplored. Furthermore, the lack of computational tools to design engineered sgRNAs for RNA detection applications and limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying RNA detection by engineered sgRNAs further compound this challenge.</p><p>Our work presents a highly specific system for modulating CRISPR transcriptional activators in response to RNA detection. Here, we show that engineered RNA-sensing iSBH-sgRNAs (inducible spacer-blocking hairpin sgRNAs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferry et al., 2017</xref>) enable modulation of CRISPR activity in eukaryotic cells as well as in developing zebrafish embryos. Native sgRNAs have two components: the spacer and scaffold sequences. The spacer sequence is complementary to the CRISPR-targeting sequence (CTS) and determines sgRNA specificity, while the scaffold sequence stabilises interactions between the sgRNA and Cas9 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaj et al., 2013</xref>). iSBH-sgRNA designs are engineered sgRNAs that cannot drive CRISPR activity in their ground state due to their complex secondary structures. They differ from native sgRNAs by having a 14-nucleotide loop and a partially complementary spacer* sequence in addition to the spacer and scaffold sequences. The complementarity between the spacer and spacer* sequences creates a complex secondary structure that inactivates the sgRNA function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When iSBH-sgRNAs are introduced into cells that do not express complementary RNA sequences, spacer sequences are blocked, and CRISPR activity is turned OFF. However, when RNA sequences complementary to the loop and spacer* sequences are present, the iSBH-sgRNA conformation changes, exposing spacer sequences and turning ON CRISPR activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>First-generation iSBH-sgRNAs detect short RNA triggers in HEK293T cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Native sgRNA sequences are composed of spacer and scaffold sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>). iSBH-sgRNAs fold into complex secondary structures that interfere with the Cas9 ability to recognise target DNA sequences (OFF-state, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferry et al., 2017</xref>). iSBH-sgRNAs were designed by extending the 5’ end of the spacer sequence with a 14 nt loop and a spacer* sequence partially complementary with the spacer. Bulges were also introduced within the iSBH-sgRNA sequence in order to ensure that the interaction between the spacer* and RNA trigger is more energetically favourable. In the ON-state, iSBH-sgRNAs recognise complementary RNA triggers and become activated, enabling Cas9 to perform its function. Short RNA triggers are complementary with the iSBH-sgRNA loop and spacer* sequence. (<bold>B</bold>) Inside cells, RNA triggers are expected to bind to complementary iSBH-sgRNAs, inducing iSBH-sgRNA activation. Activated iSBH-sgRNAs are recognised by CRISPRa effectors and drive ECFP production from a fluorescent reporter. In this particular example, activated iSBH-sgRNAs interact with dCas9-Vp64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maeder et al., 2013</xref>) and drive ECFP production from an 8xCTS-ECFP reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nissim et al., 2014</xref>). Following reporter induction, ECFP production could be monitored by Flow Cytometry. (<bold>C</bold>) Starting from five different sgRNA spacer sequences, we designed five different iSBH-sgRNA sequences.

In contrast with dCas9-Vp64, dCas9-VPR is a stronger transcriptional activator due to the presence of the additional p65 and Rta domains.

Additionally, we introduced the MODesign algorithm, which allows users to create custom-engineered RNA-sensing iSBH-sgRNAs for their CRISPR applications. We also investigated the mechanism of iSBH-sgRNA activation and showed that RNA detection occurs through a double-stranded RNA cleavage mechanism. By studying this mechanism further, we identified key residue positions that are prone to cleavage by cellular factors and used chemical modifications to protect and stabilise engineered iSBH-sgRNAs in developing zebrafish embryos. We anticipate that our ability to control iSBH-sgRNA activity in response to RNA triggers in vivo will enable the development of novel therapeutic applications that harness endogenous RNA biomarkers to control CRISPR activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>iSBH-sgRNAs enable conditional CRISPR activation in response to RNA detection</title><p>The first aim of this study was to test whether a first generation of iSBH-sgRNA designs enabled modulation of CRISPR transcriptional activators in response to RNA detection in mammalian cells. To address this, five iSBH-sgRNAs were designed, each featuring a distinct sgRNA spacer sequence. For each iSBH-sgRNA, RNA triggers complementary to the loop, and the spacer* sequences were also designed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To prevent their degradation by cellular nucleases, RNA triggers were flanked by 5’ and 3’ hairpins (a detailed description of hairpins can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian plasmids containing iSBH-sgRNA and corresponding RNA triggers were constructed under the control of U6 promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paul et al., 2002</xref>). The plasmids were co-transfected into HEK293T cells along with a CRISPR activator (CRISPRa) and a fluorescent reporter cassette to monitor CRISPRa activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The CRISPRa enzymes used in this study included dCas9-VPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chavez et al., 2015</xref>) and dCas9-Vp64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maeder et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To drive the expression of the ECFP reporter, CRISPRa reporters containing either a single CRISPR-target sequence (1xCTS) or multiple (8xCTS) sequences were employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nissim et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Upon binding of RNA triggers to complementary iSBH-sgRNA sequences, the spacer sequences become exposed inside the cells. As the RNA triggers are complementary to both the loop and the spacer* sequence, this interaction is expected to be more energetically favourable than the interaction between the spacer and spacer* components. When activated iSBH-sgRNAs bind to CRISPRa enzymes, the resulting complex can recruit transcription activation factors to the ECFP synthetic promoter, leading to the production of ECFP from the CRISPRa reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The initial test performed using dCas9-VPR as well as 1xCTS-ECFP reporters showed that iSBH-sgRNA could be activated by RNA triggers, and the observed ON-state activation was comparable to the activation seen in cells transfected with native sgRNAs (spacer only, no iSBH fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In comparison, for all five iSBH-sgRNA sequences, a closed hairpin (OFF-state, absence of RNA trigger) significantly reduced CRISPRa activity, as demonstrated by a highly reduced reporter expression.</p><p>Although iSBH-sgRNAs reduced CRISPRa activity, background activation levels were still detectable in the OFF-state. This could be due to a percentage of iSBH-sgRNAs molecules that might not adopt desired secondary structures and stronger activators such as dCas9-VPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chavez et al., 2015</xref>) may then propagate this background noise. We reasoned that weaker activators such as dCas9-Vp64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maeder et al., 2013</xref>), which require concomitant binding of several effectors at the promoter to efficiently drive downstream gene expression, could mask this noise. Therefore, we tested our system using dCas9-Vp64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maeder et al., 2013</xref>) in combination with the 8xCTS-ECFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nissim et al., 2014</xref>) reporter cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Changing these components not only reduced the OFF-state activation but also increased the intensity of the ECFP signal detected by Flow Cytometry in the ON-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

The performance of second-generation iSBH-sgRNA designs was tested using six different combinations of CRISPRa reporter systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to the assessment performed for first-generation designs, we used 1xCTS-ECFP and 8xCTS-ECFP reporters. In terms of CRISPRa effectors, dCas9-Vp64 was included as a weak activator and dCas9-VPR as a stronger activator. Furthermore, dCas9-Vp64 was also tested in conjunction with the synergistic activation mediator (SAM) amplification system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Konermann et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In concordance with our observations for first-generation iSBH-sgRNA designs, dCas9-Vp64 and 8xCTS-ECFP had the cleanest OFF-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

These findings further support the hypothesis that the noise resulting from a portion of iSBH-sgRNA molecules that may not adopt desired secondary structures gets either amplified or masked by strong or weak CRISPRa activator/reporter combinations, respectively.</p><p>Next, we compared the ability of the first- and second-generation iSBH-sgRNAs to detect longer RNA triggers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). First, we designed longer RNA triggers by appending a 100 nt flank to the 3’ end of short RNA triggers (100 nt 3’ flanks). For first-generation designs, activation in the presence of the trigger with 100 nt 3’ flank was efficient only for iSBH-sgRNA 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). For second-generation iSBH-sgRNA designs, notable activation was observed for all three iSBH-sgRNAs tested, with ECFP production detected in 15–30% of the transfected cells. This result confirmed that second-generation iSBH-sgRNA designs have superior abilities in detecting longer RNA triggers. Next, we tested whether second-generation iSBH-sgRNAs could also detect other long RNA trigger designs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and appended 100 nt flanks at the 5’ end (100 nt 5’ flank) or at both ends (100 nt 5’+3’ flanks) of the original 44 nt trigger sequence. Second-generation iSBH-sgRNAs successfully detected different RNA trigger configurations, including triggers with sizes exceeding 250 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Computational pipeline for custom iSBH-sgRNA design</title><p>In the second-generation iSBH-sgRNAs, the requirement for complementarity between RNA trigger and the iSBH-sgRNA backfold resulted in the restriction of RNA trigger sequence choices by the spacer sequences. As such, these designs do not allow users to detect any RNA triggers of choice while targeting Cas9 to the desired CRISPR-targeting sequence (CTS). We reasoned that the detection of biologically relevant RNA sequences would be largely facilitated by developing a platform for designing modular iSBH-sgRNAs where spacer and trigger-sensing components could be chosen independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Modular iSBH-sgRNA designs enable spatial separation of spacer and trigger-sensing sequences.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In second-generation iSBH-sgRNAs, RNA triggers are complementary with the iSBH-sgRNA backfolds, thus sgRNA spacers influence RNA trigger sequences. In modular iSBH-sgRNAs, design constraints were eliminated as triggers are only complementary with the iSBH-sgRNA loop and first 15 nt of the backfold. To increase affinity between iSBH-sgRNAs and RNA triggers, we increased loop sizes. Separation between trigger-sensing and spacer sequences was also achieved by reducing the complementary between the spacer sequence and CTS from 20 to 17 nt. (<bold>B</bold>) MODesign enables users to design modular iSBH-sgRNAs starting from input RNA triggers, sgRNA spacers, and loop sizes. MODesign calculates the size of trigger-sensing sequences and creates a list of trigger sub-sequences having that size. Script determines the reverse complement of these sequences that could act as trigger-sensing sequences. iSBH-sgRNAs are assembled through adding spacer*, trigger-sensing sequences, extension, spacer, and scaffold sequences. Extension sequences are engineered to be partially complementary with trigger-sensing sequences. Before producing a list of output sequences, iSBH-sgRNA folding is checked using NuPACK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allouche, 2011</xref>). Simulations could result in multiple modular iSBH-sgRNA designs. Designs chosen for experimental validation were selected based on the probability of folding into the iSBH-sgRNA structure and lack of trigger secondary structures in the iSBH-sgRNA complementary region. Priority was also given to iSBH-sgRNAs that, by chance, displayed extra complementarity between RNA triggers and the last 15 nt of the backfold or more than 17 nt complementarity with the CTS.

In the original RNA trigger design, the trigger sequence was influenced by the 20 nt sgRNA spacer sequence. A way of avoiding this involves truncating the trigger sequence, so that there is little to no overlap with the spacer sequence.

We thus conceived a modular iSBH-sgRNA prototype in which RNA triggers are only complementary to the loop and the first 15 nt of the iSBH-sgRNA backfold, and iSBH-sgRNAs have only 17 nt spacer sequences complementary with CTSs. To mitigate the impact of truncating RNA trigger sequences on the affinity between iSBH-sgRNAs and RNA triggers, we increased the size of iSBH-sgRNA loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>Starting from the modular iSBH-sgRNA prototype, we developed the MODesign computational pipeline for enabling iSBH-sgRNA design using input RNA triggers, sgRNA spacers, and desired loop sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pelea, 2025a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). MODesign calculates the size of the iSBH-sgRNA trigger-sensing component and creates a list of all potential trigger sub-sequences having that particular size.

For proof-of-concept experiments, we decided to make educated guesses about which iSBH-sgRNAs to select for experimental validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The first criterion was to prioritise sequences predicted by NuPACK to adopt desired structures with high probabilities. We reasoned that a higher probability of adopting desired secondary structures would reduce the number of iSBH-sgRNAs that do not adopt perfect OFF switches within the cellular pool. Priority was also given to sequences that hybridise to RNA trigger sub-sequences lacking complex secondary structures.</p><p>In the modular iSBH-sgRNA design, triggers were designed to base-pair only with the iSBH-sgRNA loop and the first 15 nt of the backfold, while iSBH-sgRNA spacers only had 17 nt complementarity with the CTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Nevertheless, by random chance, depending on the trigger sensing sequence, modular iSBH-sgRNAs could have extra complementarity between RNA triggers and the last 15 nt of the backfold or more than 17 nt complementarity with the CTS. As these features are beneficial for iSBH-sgRNA activation and for detecting CRISPRa activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), extra priority was also given to sequences displaying these features.</p><p>In a first validation experiment, three MODesign simulations were run for designing iSBH-sgRNAs capable of sensing a U6-driven RNA trigger whose sequence corresponded to a 146 nt mouse α-globin enhancer RNA (trigger D). Initial modular iSBH-sgRNAs had different sgRNA spacer sequences and 14 nt loops. Outputs resulting from MODesign were cloned and co-transfected into HEK293T cells with plasmids expressing trigger D from U6 promoters. Our results suggested that the modular designs generated by the MODesign algorithm had good OFF-state activity and were activated by RNA trigger D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These tests were carried out using a combination of a ‘weaker’ dCas9-Vp64 activator and 8xCTS-ECFP reporters.</p><p>After recognising that modular iSBH-sgRNAs can be designed starting from different sgRNA spacer sequences, a second test was performed to investigate whether these designs could detect different input triggers. Trigger RNA A (146 nt), trigger RNA B (267 nt), trigger RNA C (268 nt), and trigger RNA D (146 nt) were chosen for this purpose. Triggers A, B, and C involved a mix of zebrafish enhancer RNAs and repetitive element sequences specifically upregulated in the neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trinh et al., 2017</xref>). For mammalian cell tests, these triggers were expressed under the control of U6 promoters. We ran 11 MODesign simulations for each trigger, incrementally extending the loop size while keeping the sgRNA 2 spacer input constant. HEK293T validation experiments showed that choosing modular iSBH-sgRNAs that detect the four U6-expressed triggers is possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Despite not performing quite as well as second-generation designs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>), modular iSBH-sgRNA still enable efficient RNA detection, especially for smaller RNAs such as triggers A and D. For highly efficient designs such as modular iSBH-sgRNA (D), addition of the SAM effector system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Konermann et al., 2015</xref>) boosted ON-state activation with only a negligible increase in the OFF-state non-specific activation. Orthogonality tests suggested that activation of modular iSBH-sgRNA designs was specifically conditioned by complementary RNA triggers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), showing the exquisite specificity of the system.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>iSBH-sgRNA activation occurs through RNA cleavage</title><p>Next, we sought to investigate the mechanisms of iSBH-sgRNA activation to further benefit iSBH-sgRNA technology development.

These results suggested that the formation of sgRNAs with 20 nt spacers may be dCas9-dependent. In the OFF-state, iSBH-sgRNAs were unable to bind to dCas9. However, when RNA triggers were present, the conformational change enabled iSBH-sgRNAs to bind to dCas9, leading to iSBH-sgRNA truncation.

In the absence of RNA triggers, embryos are expected to be ECFP negative, while in the presence of complementary RNA triggers, embryos should express ECFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Due to improved sgRNA activity in the presence of chemical modifications, we then tested iSBH-sgRNAs with chemical modifications. A first iteration of chemically modified iSBH-sgRNAs was designed to protect the 5’ end of the iSBH-sgRNA and the sgRNA scaffold. However, when co-injected with chemically synthesised RNA triggers, these modifications did not lead to activation of the 8xCTS-ECFP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Our mechanistic data suggested that iSBH-sgRNAs get truncated during activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and, in a first iteration of chemically modified iSBH-sgRNAs, such truncation would lead to a production of sgRNAs with unprotected spacer sequences. In this scenario, 5’–3’ sgRNA degradation was likely to occur. We thus reasoned that additional chemical modifications in the spacer sequence would reduce degradation by cellular nucleases and promote iSBH-sgRNA function in vivo. Therefore, we designed a second strategy for protecting iSBH-sgRNA integrity through chemical modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This was achieved by simultaneously protecting the 5’ end of the iSBH-sgRNA, the 5’ end of the spacer, and the scaffold sequences.</p><p>iSBH-sgRNAs synthesised using our second chemical modification strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) were injected in the absence or presence of chemically synthesised RNA triggers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and stronger ECFP signals were detected in the presence of matching RNA triggers (iSBH-sgRNA ON, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Data shows an increase in the number of embryos with high ECFP levels in the presence of RNA triggers. In contrast with the iSBH-sgRNA (OFF) condition, the iSBH-sgRNA (ON) condition presented an average of 3.2-fold increase in the number of embryos with high ECFP signals. Furthermore, the average number of embryos with no ECFP signals recovered in the iSBH-sgRNA (ON) condition was lower than in the iSBH-sgRNA (OFF) condition.</p><p>Our results show that iSBH-sgRNAs are functional in developing zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, gaining insight into the mechanism of the iSBH-sgRNA activation has allowed us to identify critical positions for chemical modifications that stabilised our design.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we provide evidence that iSBH-sgRNAs enable conditional CRISPR activation in response to RNA detection in both HEK293T cells and zebrafish embryos. We adopted a Synthetic Biology design-build-test cycle to develop iSBH-sgRNAs that can detect longer RNA triggers. We also developed the MODesign algorithm, which allows users to design modular iSBH-sgRNAs that detect desired RNA triggers while directing the CRISPR activator to a gene target of choice. We successfully detected RNA trigger sequences of up to 300 nt expressed from U6 promoters in HEK293T cells using modular iSBH-sgRNA designs. Orthogonality tests suggest that modular iSBH-sgRNA designs are highly specific to their trigger and can be custom-made for different RNA detection applications. Our data show that the choice of CRISPR activators and reporters greatly influences the dynamic ranges of iSBH-sgRNA activation. Furthermore, we also provide insights into the iSBH-sgRNA activation mechanism. Our results suggest that dCas9 is involved in iSBH-sgRNA processing and activation. iSBH-sgRNA truncation to sgRNA sequences that have 20 nt spacers is consistent with previous observations reported in studies that attempt to extend spacer sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ran et al., 2013a</xref>). Our data suggest that RNA triggers are cleaved by endogenous factors and molecules from the RNA interference pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meister and Tuschl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pong and Gullerova, 2018</xref>) could be responsible for the cleavage.</p><p>To date, a variety of RNA-inducible gRNA designs have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanewich-Hollatz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hochrein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jakimo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siu and Chen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galizi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hunt and Chen, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hunt and Chen, 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ying et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2023</xref>). Nevertheless, there is a lack of direct, head-to-head comparisons of these designs under standardised experimental conditions. Some designs were evaluated in vitro, others in bacterial systems, and some in mammalian cells. Consequently, it is challenging to conclusively determine which design exhibits superior properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pelea et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, to the best of our knowledge, the iSBH-sgRNA system is the first RNA-inducible gRNA design tested in vivo and characterising the iSBH-sgRNA activation mechanism was essential for implementing iSBH-sgRNA technology in zebrafish embryos. In vivo, chemical modifications in the spacer sequence were vital for iSBH-sgRNA stability and function.</p><p>In their current iteration, iSBH-sgRNAs show considerable promise for mammalian synthetic biology applications. Specifically, their ability to detect synthetic triggers could be pivotal in the development of complex synthetic RNA circuits and logic gates, thereby advancing the field of cellular reprogramming. However, further work is required to achieve better ON/OFF activation ratios in vivo and more homogeneous activity across tissues in the presence of RNA triggers. Additional chemical modifications could improve iSBH-sgRNA properties, and we believe that chemical modification strategies adopted for siRNA drugs or antisense oligos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khvorova and Watts, 2017</xref>) could also be essential for further iSBH-sgRNA technology development. As iSBH-sgRNAs might be targeted by endogenous nucleases, leading to their degradation, a strategy for preventing this could involve additional chemical modifications. When inserted at certain key positions, such modifications could prevent interaction between iSBH-sgRNAs and cellular enzymes by introducing steric clashes or inhibiting RNA hydrolysis.</p><p>Once achieving superior dynamic ranges of iSBH-sgRNA activation in vivo, the next steps would involve understanding the classes of endogenous RNAs that could act as triggers. The chances that an iSBH-sgRNA encounters an endogenous RNA trigger inside a cell would depend on the relative concentrations of the two RNA species. Therefore, a first step towards determining potential endogenous RNA triggers will involve identifying RNA species with comparable expression levels as iSBH-sgRNAs. Then, iSBH-sgRNAs could be designed against these RNA species, followed by experimental validation. It is important to note that eukaryotic cells express a wide range of transcripts of varying sizes, expression levels, and subcellular localisations, all of which could greatly affect iSBH-sgRNA activation levels. Based on the data presented here, we speculate that RNA species up to 300 nt that are also highly expressed might act as good triggers. Furthermore, as sgRNAs are involved in targeting Cas9 to genomic DNA in the nucleus, attempting to detect transcripts that are sequestered in the nucleus might also provide additional benefit.</p><p>After identifying RNA species that could act as triggers in vivo, iSBH-sgRNAs could pave the way for the development of more effective gene editing approaches with greater specificity and efficiency. In the field of therapeutics, safety concerns regarding the off-target effects of CRISPR-Cas9 persist. CRISPR-Cas9 commonly results in off-target effects such as Cas9 deployment at unintended genomic regions and the induction of unwanted DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). These DSBs can trigger chromosomal rearrangements and macro deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kosicki et al., 2018</xref>) and activate a p53-mediated DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haapaniemi et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it is crucial to restrict the activity of CRISPR components to the affected tissues to prevent off-target effects in healthy tissues that are not impacted by the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doudna, 2020</xref>). Recent developments in engineering lipid nanoparticles have demonstrated selective accumulation in different target organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosenblum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). However, targeted delivery strategies still rely heavily on the availability of cell-surface protein biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosenblum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dilliard et al., 2021</xref>), such as membrane receptors, which act as a proxy for cell identity. The RNA-sensing iSBH-sgRNA technology could provide a complementary approach to achieve targeted delivery by sensing endogenous RNA biomarkers expressed specifically in the affected tissues. In the pursuit of targeted gene editing, identifying cell surface biomarkers can be a daunting task for certain cell types or diseases. However, a promising solution may lie in utilising endogenous RNA biomarkers to activate CRISPR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Rather than relying on targeted delivery methods, iSBH-sgRNAs can be delivered to cells in an inactive form, only to be activated upon detection of specific RNA biomarkers within the target cells. This would ensure that CRISPR-Cas9 systems remain inactive in non-target cells where these RNA biomarkers are not expressed.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>In silico design of iSBH-sgRNAs</title><p>First-generation iSBH-sgRNA designs were designed by inputting different spacer sequences into a computational pipeline generated by Ferry et al.: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://apps.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/iSBHfold/">http://apps.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/iSBHfold/</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferry et al., 2017</xref>). Main features of iSBH-sgRNA designs include the spacer (20 nt), loop (14 nt), spacer* (20 nt), and scaffold sequences. Spacer* sequence is the reverse complement of the spacer sequence, and it was modified to contain mismatches at positions: 11–12 and 16–17. The NuPACK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allouche, 2011</xref>) fold corresponding to these sequences (excluding scaffold and extra GC sequences*) is: ((((((((((..(((..(((…………..)))..)))..)))))))))); where . represents an unpaired nucleotide, while ( and ) represent paired nucleotides.</p><p>Second-generation iSBH-sgRNA designs were generated by introducing 10 nt extensions between loop and spacer sequences of the first-generation design.

MODesign calculates the size of the iSBH-sgRNA trigger-sensing component and creates a list of all potential trigger sub-sequences having that particular size. For each sub-sequence, it determines the reverse complementary region, and it inserts it between extension and spacer* sequences while filling in the extension sequence.

Trypsin was inactivated using 500 μl FACS buffer. Cells were transferred to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, followed by centrifugation at 300×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 500 ml PBS followed by another centrifugation step at 300×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Supernatant was removed followed by snap-freezing of cellular pellets. Cells were stored at –80°C prior to RNA extraction using the Charge Switch Total RNA cell Kit (Thermo Fisher). All indications specified in the kit were followed, except for using 1/5 of suggested volume of buffers. The optional DNase treatment step was also included, and the RNA was eluted in 20 μl elution buffer.</p><p>The ligation reaction was set up by mixing 10 μl RNA, 2 μl T4 RNA ligase buffer (NEB), 1.9 μl H<sub>2</sub>O, 4 μl 50% PEG 8000 (NEB), 0.1 μl 10 mM ATP, 1 μl T4 RNA ligase (NEB), and 1 μl SUPERase in RNAase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher). The reaction was incubated for 4 h at room temperature, followed by another round of RNA extraction using Charge Switch Total RNA cell Kit. In this second round of RNA extraction, 1/10 off specified buffer volumes were used, the optional DNase treatment was not performed, and RNA was eluted in 12.5 μl elution buffer.</p><p>10μl circular RNAs were subjected to reverse transcription (RT) using the QuantiTect Rev. Transcription Kit (QIAGEN). Manual specifications were followed, but provided RT primers were replaced with custom made primers that specifically bind to regions of interest. According to user specifications, primers were diluted to 0.7 μM and RT reactions were incubated for 30 min at 42 °C.</p><p>Desired sequences were amplified using two subsequent PCR reactions using the Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with GC Buffer (NEB). All extension steps were carried out in a 15 s timeframe and the first PCR round consisted of 10 cycles. 2 μl RT product was used as a template in the first reaction. The product of the first reaction was diluted 1/10 and 1 μl of this dilution served as a template in the second round of PCR (25 cycles). Second PCR products were mixed with Gel Loading Dye, purple (NEB) followed by loading of 2 μl mixture into a 2% agarose gel. For optimal results, gels were run for approximately 90 min. Second PCR primers contained NotI/NheI restriction sites that enabled fragment cloning into the pcDNA3.1 plasmid followed by Sanger sequencing.</p><p>Circularisation assay primer sequences could be found in the Supplementary Material.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Zebrafish husbandry</title><p>Zebrafish experiments were carried out according to regulated procedures authorised by the UK Home Office within the framework of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

The DNA expression and reported constructs (Tol2(B-act:dCas9-Vp64-T2A-Citrine) and Tol2(8xCTS-ECFP), respectively) were built as described in the Molecular cloning subsection. Injection mixtures contained 2 μl of plasmid DNA (200 ng/μl), 1.5 μl Tol2 mRNA (160 ng/μl), as well as 0.5 μl Phenol Red. 2 nl mixture was injected using a PICOSPRITZER III injector. Following injections, embryos were kept in a 28°C incubator. 6 h post-injection, fertilised embryos were selected and transferred to E3 media. At 1 day post-fertilisation, dead embryos were removed. Surviving embryos were grown for 4 months and subsequently genotyped.</p><p>A strategy consisting of two rounds of crosses was employed for identifying founders. In a first round, potential male and female founders were incrossed for identifying founder pairs. Once a founder pair was identified, the next step was determining whether the male or the female from that cross contains the transgene. This was achieved by outcrossing males and females with wild-type fish. For each cross, DNA was extracted from a pool of embryos at 1 day post-fertilisation. Extraction was carried out using the PureLink Genomic DNA Mini kit (Thermo Fisher), while opting for a 1 h lysis step. Extracted DNA was measured by NanoDrop and 100 ng DNA was added to a first nested PCR reaction (10 cycles). Products of the first PCR reaction were diluted 1:10 and 2 μl products were transferred to a second PCR reaction (29 cycles). PCRs were carried out using the Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with GC Buffer (NEB) in a total volume of 20 ul, while opting for an extension time of 1 min/kb. Results were assessed by running PCR products in a 2% agarose gel.</p><p>After founder identification, the next steps involved generation of the first generation of fish (F1) encoding the transgene in all cells of their body. Founders were outcrossed with TgBAC(Sox10:BirA-Cherry) adult fish. At 1–3 days post-fertilisation, embryos expressing the Sox10:BirA-mCherry transgene were selected by assessing the mCherry expression using an Olympus MVX microscope. At 3 days post-fertilisation, embryos were tail clipped. Clipped tissue was transferred to 50 μl lysis buffer (25 mM NaOH, 0.2 mM EDTA). Samples were boiled at 95°C for 45 min, followed by cooling at 4°C for 5 min. 50 μl neutralisation buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl) was added to each sample and nested PCR was carried out for determining transgene presence. PCR reactions were set up in a similar way as for founder identification, except that 5 μl DNA was added to the first PCR reaction. F1 embryos were subsequently grown for another 4 months. Subsequent experiments were carried out in embryos resulting from incrosses of F1 adult fish.</p><p>All genotyping primer sequences could be found in the Supplementary Material.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Microinjection of zebrafish embryos using the Ac/Ds system</title><p>First generation (F1) fish encoding dCas9-Vp64 and 8xCTS-ECFP CRISPR reporter were incrossed.

Reaction mixtures contained 1 μl iSBH-sgRNA (1.5 μg/ul), 1 μl RNA trigger (3 μg/ul), 1.5 μl H<sub>2</sub>O, and 0.5 μl Phenol Red. 2 nl mixture was injected into single-cell embryos. 6 h post-injection, fertilised embryos were selected and transferred to E3 media. At 1 day post-fertilisation, dead embryos were removed. Surviving embryos were screened for ECFP production using an MVX microscope. For each experiment, fish were separated into three classes according to the intensity of ECFP expression: high, low, and no ECFP. Blinding was implemented by grouping embryos without knowledge of their injection condition (iSBH-OFF or iSBH-ON), ensuring unbiased assessment of fluorescence. χ<sup>2</sup> tests were performed for testing if results are statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Confocal microscopy</title><p>Embryos were anaesthetised in MS222 and mounted in 1% low-melting point agarose (Invitrogen) dissolved in E3 media. Embryos were imaged on a Zeiss780 LSM upright confocal microscope using a ×10 objective. For DNA-based injections, Citrine expression-labelled tissues where construct was expressed, while ECFP expression-labelled tissues where CRISPR systems were active. The same microscope settings were maintained in between imaging different samples injected with DNA constructs. Embryos injected with iSBH-sgRNAs without triggers were genotyped following injection to confirm the presence of dCas9-Vp64 and the 8xCTS-ECFP reporters. Due to the strength of the signal, laser power had to be decreased for samples injected with chemically modified sgRNAs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Zebrafish experiments were carried out according to regulated procedures authorised by the UK Home Office within the framework of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

This would require an endogenous transcript as the RNA trigger with a clear readout.

Indeed, the utilisation of endogenous transcripts as triggers in a natural setting is a logical next step. We further acknowledge the need to delve deeper into the complexities and challenges of our system, particularly concerning the detection of endogenous RNA, thus offering valuable insights for researchers looking to adapt our system for various applications. In order to clarify these limitations, we made some changes in the final version of our paper. The following paragraphs have been therefore included in the manuscript discussion:</p><p>“In their current iteration, iSBH-sgRNAs show considerable promise for mammalian synthetic biology applications. Specifically, their ability to detect synthetic triggers could be pivotal in the development of complex synthetic RNA circuits and logic gates, thereby advancing the field of cellular reprogramming. However, further work is required to achieve better ON/OFF activation ratios in vivo and more homogeneous activity across tissues in the presence of RNA triggers. Additional chemical modifications could improve iSBH-sgRNA properties, and we believe that chemical modification strategies adopted for siRNA drugs or antisense oligos (Khvorova and Watts (2017)) could also be essential for further iSBH-sgRNA technology development. As iSBH-sgRNAs might be targeted by endogenous nucleases, leading to their degradation, a strategy for preventing this could involve additional chemical modifications. When inserted at certain key positions, such modifications could prevent interaction between iSBH-sgRNAs and cellular enzymes by introducing steric clashes or inhibiting RNA hydrolysis.</p><p>Once achieving superior dynamic ranges of iSBH-sgRNA activation in vivo, the next steps would involve understanding the classes of endogenous RNAs that could act as triggers. The chances that an iSBH-sgRNA encounters an endogenous RNA trigger inside a cell would depend on the relative concentrations of the two RNA species. Therefore, a first step towards determining potential endogenous RNA triggers will involve identifying RNA species with comparable expression levels as iSBH-sgRNAs. Then, iSBH-sgRNAs could be designed against these RNA species, followed by experimental validation. It is important to note that eukaryotic cells express a wide range of transcripts of varying sizes, expression levels, and subcellular localisations, all of which could greatly affect iSBH-sgRNA activation levels. Based on the data presented here, we speculate that RNA species up to 300nt that are also highly expressed might act as good triggers. Furthermore, as sgRNAs are involved in targeting Cas9 to genomic DNA in the nucleus, attempting to detect transcripts that are sequestered in the nucleus might also provide additional benefit.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this work, the authors describe engineering of sgRNAs that render Cas9 DNA binding controllable by a second RNA trigger. The authors introduce several iterations of their engineered sgRNAs, as well as a computational pipeline to identify designs for user-specified RNA triggers which offers a helpful alternative to purely rational design. Also included is an investigation of the fate of the engineered sgRNAs when introduced into cells, and the use of this information to inform installation of modified nucleotides to improve engineered sgRNA stability. Engineered sgRNAs are demonstrated to be activated by trigger RNAs in both cultured mammalian cells and zebrafish.</p><p>The conclusions made by the authors in this work are predominantly supported by the data provided. However, some claims are not consistent with the data shown and some of the figures would benefit from revision or further clarification.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- The sgRNA engineering in this paper is performed and presented in a systematic and logical fashion.</p><p>- Inclusion of a computational method to predict iSBH-sgRNAs adds to the strength of the engineering.</p><p>- Investigation into the cellular fate of the engineered sgRNAs and the use of this information to guide inclusion of chemically modified nucleotides is also a strength.</p><p>- Demonstration of activity in both cultured mammalian cells and in zebrafish embryos increases the impact and utility of the technology reported in this work.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- While the methods here represent an important step forward in advancing the technology, they still fall short of the dynamic range and selectivity likely required for robust activation by endogenous RNA.</p><p>- While the iSBH-sgRNAs where the RNA trigger overlaps with the spacer appear to function robustly, the modular iSBH-sgRNAs seem to perform quite a bit less well. The authors state that modular iSBHsgRNAs show better activity without increasing background when the SAM system is added, but this is not supported by the data shown in Figure 3D, where in 3 out of 4 cases CRISPR activation in the absence of the RNA trigger is substantially increased.</p><p>- There is very little discussion of how the performance of the technology reported in this work compares to previous iterations of RNA-triggered CRISPR systems, of which there are many examples.</p></disp-quote><p>Concerning the methods falling short of the dynamic range and selectivity required for robust activation by endogenous RNA, we acknowledge this limitation and recognise the need for improvement in this area. In the resubmitted version of the manuscript, we provided a detailed discussion on how the selection of appropriate triggers might partially improve dynamic ranges and selectivity. This includes an exploration of various strategies and considerations that may enhance the robustness of our system (print screen above, also used for addressing Reviewer #1 comments).</p><p>Regarding the inconsistent performance of the modular iSBH-sgRNAs, we acknowledge that modular iSBH-sgRNAs seem to perform slightly less well than first- and second-generation designs. In order to illustrate this, we modified corresponding bar graphs to include fold turn-on iSBH-sgRNA activation in addition to significance (Figures 1, 2 and 3 of the manuscript). We also acknowledge this fact in the text, as well as we recognise this discrepancy in the Figure 3.D and provide further clarifications. To help conveying this message even further, we introduced a new figure (Figure 3- figure supplement 2) to accompany the heat map shown in the Figure 3.D. with corresponding bar graphs. These changes are documented below:</p><p>“…promoters. We ran 11 MODesign simulations for each trigger, incrementally extending the loop size while keeping the sgRNA 2 spacer input constant. HEK293T validation experiments showed that choosing modular iSBH-sgRNAs that detect the 4 U6-expressed triggers is possible (Figure 3.D, Figure 3- figure supplement 1.C). Despite not performing quite as well as second-generation designs (Figure 2.A.,Figure 3.D),modular iSBH-sgRNA still enable efficient RNA detection, especially for smaller RNAs such as triggers A and D. For highly efficient designs such asmodular iSBH-sgRNA (D), addition of the SAM effector system (Konermann et al. (2015)) boosted ON-state activation with only a negligible increase in the the OFF-state non-specific activation. Orthogonality tests suggested that activation of modular iSBH-sgRNA designs was specifically conditioned by complementary RNA triggers (Figure 3.E, Figure 3 - figure supplement 2), showing the exquisite specificity of the system.”</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>This supplementary figure reinterprets the data presented in Figure 3.</title><p>E. using bar plots for enhanced clarity and comparison. It depicts the results of cotransfecting HEK293T cells with four modular iSBH-sgRNAs (A, B, C, and D) and examines all combinations of iSBH-sgRNA: RNA trigger pairings.

We also point readers to a literature review we recently published (doi/full/10.1089/crispr.2022.0052) where we describe other similar technologies in more detail.</p><p>“To date, a variety of RNA-inducible gRNA designs have been developed (Hanewich-Hollatz et al. (2019); Hochrein et al. (2021); Jakimo et al. (2018); Jiao et al. (2021); Jin et al. (2019); Li et al. (2019); Liu et al. (2022); Lin et al. (2020); Siu and Chen (2019); Galizi et al. (2020); Hunt and Chen (2022b,a); Ying et al. (2020); Choi et al. (2023)). Nevertheless, there is a lack of direct, head-to-head comparisons of these designs under standardised experimental conditions. Some designs were evaluated in vitro, others in bacterial systems, and some in mammalian cells. Consequently, it is challenging to conclusively determine which design exhibits superior properties (Pelea et al. (2022)). Notably, to the best of our knowledge, the iSBH-sgRNA systemis the first RNA-inducible gRNA design tested in vivo and characterising the iSBH-sgRNA activation mechanism was essential for implementing iSBH-sgRNA technology in zebrafish embryos. In vivo, chemical modifications in the spacer sequence were vital for iSBH-sgRNA stability and function.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
