Extensively shared gene expression between neuromasts and ampullary organs suggests that conserved molecular mechanisms are involved in their development, but a few transcription factor genes are restricted either to the developing electrosensory or mechanosensory lateral line. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in G0-injected sterlet embryos (<italic>Acipenser ruthenus</italic>, a sturgeon) to test the function of three such genes. We found that the ‘hair cell’ transcription factor gene <italic>Atoh1</italic> is required for both hair cell and electroreceptor differentiation in sterlet, and for <italic>Pou4f3</italic> and <italic>Gfi1</italic> expression in both neuromasts and ampullary organs. These data support the conservation of developmental mechanisms between hair cells and electroreceptors. Targeting ampullary organ-restricted <italic>Neurod4</italic> did not yield any phenotype, potentially owing to redundancy with other <italic>Neurod</italic> genes that we found to be expressed in sterlet ampullary organs. After targeting mechanosensory-restricted <italic>Foxg1</italic>, ampullary organs formed within neuromast lines, suggesting that FoxG1 normally represses their development, whether directly or indirectly. We speculate that electrosensory organs may be the ‘default’ developmental fate of lateral line primordia in electroreceptive vertebrates.</p></abstract><kwd-group

In fishes and aquatic-stage amphibians, hair cells are also found in lateral line neuromasts in the skin, which are stimulated by local water movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mogdans, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Webb, 2021</xref>). Supporting cells in neuromasts differentiate into hair cells for homeostasis and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kniss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lush et al., 2019</xref>) and neuromasts are easily accessible in lines over the head and trunk, making the zebrafish lateral line an excellent model for hair cell development and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kniss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nicolson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pickett and Raible, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The lateral line system of zebrafish (a cyprinid teleost) is purely mechanosensory, as is the lateral line system of the other main anamniote lab model, the frog <italic>Xenopus</italic>. However, in many other vertebrates, the lateral line system also has an electrosensory division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bullock et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Crampton, 2019</xref>). In electroreceptive non-teleost jawed vertebrates, some or all of the neuromast lines on the head are flanked by fields of ampullary organs containing electroreceptors, which respond to weak cathodal stimuli such as the electric fields surrounding other animals in water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bodznick and Montgomery, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Crampton, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leitch and Julius, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chagnaud et al., 2021</xref>). Electroreception is mediated by voltage-gated calcium channels in the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bodznick and Montgomery, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leitch and Julius, 2019</xref>). The voltage sensor was recently identified in cartilaginous fishes as the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bellono et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bellono et al., 2018</xref>), whose pore-forming alpha subunit is encoded by <italic>Cacna1d</italic>. Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 is also required for synaptic transmission at hair-cell ribbon synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moser et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mukhopadhyay and Pangrsic, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Electroreceptors, like hair cells, have an apical primary cilium and basolateral ribbon synapses with lateral line afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jørgensen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker, 2019</xref>). However, in contrast to the highly ordered, stepped array of apical microvilli (‘stereocilia’) that forms the ‘hair bundle’ critical for hair-cell mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Caprara and Peng, 2022</xref>), electroreceptors in many species (for example, cartilaginous fishes; ray-finned paddlefishes and sturgeons) lack apical microvilli altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jørgensen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker, 2019</xref>). Electroreceptors in other species have a few apical microvilli, while the electroreceptors of the amphibian axolotl have around 200 microvilli surrounding an eccentrically positioned primary cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jørgensen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker, 2019</xref>). Indeed, axolotl electroreceptors were described as “remarkably similar to immature hair cells” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Northcutt et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, despite their shared function, the apical surface of electroreceptors (where voltage-sensing occurs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bodznick and Montgomery, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leitch and Julius, 2019</xref>) varies considerably across different vertebrate groups.</p><p>Fate-mapping experiments have shown that neuromasts, ampullary organs (where present) and their afferent neurons all develop from a series of pre-otic and post-otic lateral line placodes on the embryonic head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Northcutt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Piotrowski and Baker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker, 2019</xref>). In electroreceptive jawed vertebrates, lateral line placodes elongate to form sensory ridges that eventually fragment: neuromasts differentiate first, in a line along the centre of each ridge, and ampullary organs (if present) form later, in fields on the flanks of the ridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Northcutt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Piotrowski and Baker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker, 2019</xref>). The lateral line primordia of electroreceptive vertebrates therefore provide a fascinating model for studying the formation of different sensory cell types and organs. What molecular mechanisms control the formation within the same primordium of mechanosensory neuromasts containing hair cells, versus electrosensory ampullary organs containing electroreceptors?</p><p>To gain molecular insight into electroreceptor development, we originally took a candidate-gene approach, based on genes known to be important for neuromast and/or hair cell development. This enabled us to identify a variety of genes expressed in developing ampullary organs as well as neuromasts, in embryos from the three major jawed-vertebrate groups, that is, cartilaginous fishes (lesser-spotted catshark, <italic>Scyliorhinus canicula</italic>, and little skate, <italic>Leucoraja erinacea</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">O’Neill et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gillis et al., 2012</xref>); lobe-finned bony fishes/tetrapods (a urodele amphibian, the axolotl, <italic>Ambystoma mexicanum</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Modrell and Baker, 2012</xref>); and ray-finned bony fishes (a chondrostean, the Mississippi paddlefish, <italic>Polyodon spathula</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Modrell et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Modrell et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Modrell et al., 2017b</xref>). We also took an unbiased discovery approach using differential bulk RNA-seq in late-larval paddlefish, which yielded a dataset of almost 500 genes that were putatively enriched in lateral line organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Modrell et al., 2017a</xref>). Validation by in situ hybridisation (ISH) of a subset of candidates from this dataset suggested that conserved molecular mechanisms were involved in hair cell and electroreceptor development, and that hair cells and electroreceptors were closely related physiologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Modrell et al., 2017a</xref>). For example, developing ampullary organs express the key ‘hair cell’ transcription factor genes <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Pou4f3</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roccio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iyer and Groves, 2021</xref>), and genes essential for the function of hair cell ribbon synapses, including the voltage-gated calcium channel gene <italic>Cacna1d</italic>, encoding Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Modrell et al., 2017a</xref>). We also identified a handful of genes expressed in developing ampullary organs but not neuromasts, including two electroreceptor-specific voltage-gated potassium channel subunit genes (<italic>Kcna5</italic> and <italic>Kcnab3</italic>) and a single transcription factor gene, <italic>Neurod4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Modrell et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>Up to that point, we had reported the shared expression of fifteen transcription factor genes in both ampullary organs and neuromasts, but only one transcription factor gene with restricted expression, namely, electrosensory-restricted <italic>Neurod4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Modrell et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Modrell et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Modrell et al., 2017a</xref>). More recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Minařík et al., 2024</xref>), we used the late-larval paddlefish lateral line organ-enriched dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Modrell et al., 2017a</xref>), as well as a candidate gene approach, to identify 23 more transcription factor genes expressed within developing lateral line organs in paddlefish and/or in a related, more experimentally tractable chondrostean, the sterlet (<italic>Acipenser ruthenus</italic>, a small sturgeon; for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baloch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stundl et al., 2022</xref>). Twelve of these transcription factor genes—including <italic>Gfi1</italic>—were expressed in both ampullary organs and neuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Minařík et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, developing ampullary organs, as well as neuromasts, express the three ‘hair cell’ transcription factor genes—<italic>Atoh1</italic>, <italic>Pou4f3,</italic> and <italic>Gfi1</italic>—whose co-expression is sufficient to drive postnatal mouse cochlear supporting cells to adopt a ‘hair cell-like’ fate, albeit not to form fully mature hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roccio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iyer and Groves, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iyer et al., 2022</xref>). We also identified six novel ampullary organ-restricted transcription factor genes and the first-reported mechanosensory-restricted transcription factor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Minařík et al., 2024</xref>). One of the five mechanosensory-restricted transcription factor genes was <italic>Foxg1</italic>, which was expressed and maintained in the central region of sensory ridges where lines of neuromasts form, although excluded from hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Minařík et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in G0-injected sterlet embryos to investigate the function in lateral line organ development of <italic>Atoh1</italic>, electrosensory-restricted <italic>Neurod4</italic> and mechanosensory-restricted <italic>Foxg1</italic> (for reference, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the normal expression patterns of these genes). We report that <italic>Atoh1</italic> is required for the formation of electroreceptors, as well as hair cells. We did not see any phenotype after targeting ampullary organ-restricted <italic>Neurod4</italic>, potentially owing to redundancy with other <italic>Neurod</italic> family members that we found to be expressed in sterlet ampullary organs (and neuromasts). Targeting mechanosensory-restricted <italic>Foxg1</italic> resulted in a striking phenotype: the ectopic formation of ampullary organs within neuromast lines, and in some cases the fusion of ampullary organ fields that normally develop either side of a line of neuromasts. In addition, sections of neuromast lines were often missing mosaically, supporting a direct role for FoxG1 in neuromast development, as recently reported in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell et al., 2024</xref>). However, the presence of ectopic ampullary organs within neuromast lines in <italic>Foxg1</italic> crispants suggests the unexpected but intriguing hypothesis that ampullary organs may be the ‘default’ developmental fate for lateral line sensory ridges, and that this is repressed by FoxG1, allowing neuromasts to form instead.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Wild-type gene expression patterns within late-larval sterlet lateral line organs.</title><p>Detailed descriptions of the sterlet gene expression patterns shown for reference in this figure, including at earlier stages of lateral line development, have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Minařík et al., 2024</xref>), except for <italic>Neurod4</italic>.

Examples of <italic>Tyr</italic> crispants with pigmentation phenotypes, plus a control, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>. The most efficient results were obtained by injecting 1-cell embryos with a preassembled mix of Cas9 protein plus two chemically modified sgRNAs (purchased from Synthego) against the target gene, and subsequently maintaining the embryos at room temperature for around 6 hours. The time from fertilisation to completion of the first cleavage is around 2–3 hours at room temperature, giving plenty of time for the Cas9/sgRNA complex to act before returning the embryos to colder temperatures for subsequent development. (Sterlet are cold-water fish and the optimum temperature for maintaining embryos for normal development is 16°C.)</p><p>Following embryo injection at the 1–2-cell stage with pre-complexed sgRNAs/Cas9 and fixation at stage 45, genomic DNA was extracted from the trunk/tail prior to analysis of the heads by ISH. The sgRNA-targeted region from trunk/tail genomic DNA was amplified by PCR for direct Sanger sequencing and in silico analysis using Synthego’s online ‘Inference of CRISPR Edits’ (ICE) tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conant et al., 2022</xref>; also see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Uribe-Salazar et al., 2022</xref>) to analyse the identity and frequency of edits of the target gene. Although our genotyping primers were designed before chromosome-level sterlet genomes were available, comparison with the reference genome showed no mismatches against either of the two ohnologs. Genotyping and ICE analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conant et al., 2022</xref>) of tails from individual <italic>Tyr</italic> crispants showed successful disruption of the <italic>Tyr</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–I</xref> show examples of successful disruption of <italic>Tyr</italic>; the genotyping data were consistent with the primers amplifying both ohnologs).</p><p>We note that our genotyping results have shown that most crispants analysed, across all genes targeted, have shown some degree of targeted mutagenesis in the trunk/tail, with a range of deletion sizes. Although phenotypes from the initial spawning seasons were almost always highly mosaic, suggesting mutations occurred later in development, following optimisation a proportion of crispants showed complete unilateral and occasionally bilateral phenotypes. Such phenotypes suggest that mutation occurred in one cell at the 2-cell stage (unilateral phenotype) or even as early as the 1-cell stage (bilateral phenotype). Some degree of mosaicism can be useful, however, as the unaffected tissue provides an internal control for the normal expression of the gene being examined by ISH.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Targeting <italic>Atoh1</italic> resulted in the mosaic absence of hair cells and electroreceptors</title><p>We targeted <italic>Atoh1</italic> for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis by injecting sterlet embryos at the 1–2-cell stage with Cas9 protein pre-complexed with two sgRNAs targeting <italic>Atoh1</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Our genotyping primers were designed before chromosome-level sterlet genomes were available; comparison with the reference genome showed two mismatches in the forward primer against the ohnolog on chromosome 2, and the genotyping data were consistent with the primers amplifying the chromosome-1 ohnolog only. Thus, we could not determine whether the chromosome 2 ohnolog was disrupted. However, the genotyping data showed successful disruption of the <italic>Atoh1</italic> gene on chromosome 1 (examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F–I</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Tyr</italic> control crispants, ISH for the hair cell and electroreceptor marker <italic>Cacna1d</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Modrell et al., 2017a</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Minařík et al., 2024</xref>), which is a direct Atoh1 target gene in mouse cochlear hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jen et al., 2022</xref>), revealed no obvious lateral line organ phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>; n=0/24 across five independent batches; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Even in wildtype larvae, the number of ampullary organs in individual fields varies considerably at stage 45, so ampullary organ number was not in itself scored as a phenotype. However, <italic>Cacna1d</italic> expression was absent mosaically in neuromast lines and ampullary organ fields in <italic>Atoh1</italic> crispants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–J</xref>; n=13/22, i.e., 59%, across five independent batches; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This suggested that disruption of the <italic>Atoh1</italic> gene in sterlet resulted in the failure of hair cell differentiation (as expected from zebrafish; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Millimaki et al., 2007</xref>) and also electroreceptors.

Although post-ISH Sox2 immunostaining reliably revealed neuromasts, ampullary organs were only weakly and variably labelled by Sox2 immunostaining even before ISH in sterlet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Minařík et al., 2024</xref>), as in paddlefish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Modrell et al., 2017a</xref>).

Our sgRNAs target both <italic>Foxg1</italic> ohnologs without mismatches. Although our genotyping primers were designed before chromosome-level sterlet genomes were available, comparison with the reference genome showed no mismatches against either of the two ohnologs. Genotyping and ICE analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conant et al., 2022</xref>) of tails from individual <italic>Foxg1</italic> crispants showed successful disruption of the <italic>Foxg1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> shows examples; the genotyping data were consistent with the primers amplifying both ohnologs).</p><p>When compared with <italic>Tyr</italic> control crispants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>), a striking phenotype was seen mosaically after targeting mechanosensory-restricted <italic>Foxg1</italic> with sgRNAs 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>): neuromast lines were often interrupted by ectopic ampullary organs. These were defined as <italic>Cacna1d</italic>-expressing cells present within neuromast lines in larger clusters than expected for neuromasts, resembling ampullary organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–L</xref>; n=8/18, i.e., 44%, across two independent batches; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), or by expression of electroreceptor-specific <italic>Kcnab3</italic> within neuromast lines, not seen in <italic>Tyr</italic> control crispants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–P</xref>; n=15/24, i.e., 63%, across both batches; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This sometimes led to the apparent fusion of ampullary organ fields across a missing neuromast line (for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O, P</xref>). Post-ISH Sox2 immunostaining of selected <italic>Foxg1</italic> crispants showed that some phenotypes were initially missed, as the electroreceptor-specific <italic>Kcnab3</italic> labelling did not provide sufficient topographical context to assess ampullary organ field expansion into the infraorbital (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) and preopercular neuromast lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). Post-<italic>Kcnab3</italic> ISH immunostaining for Sox2 was thus performed in all crispants to reveal neuromasts; this also confirmed that the ectopic electroreceptors in <italic>Foxg1</italic> crispants were located within neuromast lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D,F,H,J,L</xref>).

We assessed each of the pre-otic neuromast lines separately (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>): the supraorbital and infraorbital lines (both of which derive from the anterodorsal lateral line placode; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gibbs and Northcutt, 2004</xref>), the otic line (derived from the otic lateral line placode; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gibbs and Northcutt, 2004</xref>), and the preopercular line (derived from the anteroventral lateral line placode; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gibbs and Northcutt, 2004</xref>).

The phenotype was classed as ‘severe’ when more than two-thirds of the neuromast line was affected; ‘moderate’ when between one-third and two-thirds of the line was affected; and ‘mild’ when less than one-third of the line was affected.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Differential disruption of individual neuromast lines in <italic>Foxg1</italic> crispants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In situ hybridisation for the hair cell/electroreceptor marker <italic>Cacna1d</italic> at stage 45 identifies neuromasts and ampullary organs.

Targeting <italic>Foxg1</italic> for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in G0 sterlet embryos led to a striking phenotype: the formation within neuromast lines of ectopic electroreceptors, often in the large clusters normally seen in ampullary organs. In some cases, ampullary organ fields, which normally flank neuromast lines, effectively ‘merged’ across missing neuromast lines. This phenotype was revealed by examining expression of the electroreceptor-specific marker <italic>Kcnab3</italic>, and two ampullary organ-restricted transcription factor genes: <italic>Mafa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Minařík et al., 2024</xref>) and <italic>Neurod4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Modrell et al., 2017a</xref>). In a subset of these crispants, small clusters of electroreceptors were observed to form within existing neuromasts. Thus, FoxG1 seems to repress an ampullary organ fate within the central domain of lateral line sensory ridges where neuromasts form, and to repress electroreceptor formation within neuromasts.</p><p>Post-ISH Sox2 immunostaining of <italic>Foxg1</italic> crispants also revealed some missing sections of neuromast lines (particularly in the otic neuromast line), without ectopic electroreceptors or merging of ampullary organ fields. This suggests that <italic>Foxg1</italic> is also necessary for neuromast formation and/or maintenance. Indeed, after this manuscript was submitted, <italic>foxg1a</italic> expression was reported in the migrating posterior lateral line primordium and neuromasts of zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell et al., 2024</xref>). Loss of <italic>foxg1a</italic> function resulted in slower primordium migration, a temporary reduction in the number of neuromasts, reduced neuromast cell proliferation and fewer hair cells during both development and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>In the mouse inner ear, <italic>Foxg1</italic> is expressed in the prospective cochlea and all sensory patches, in hair cell progenitors and supporting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pauley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tasdemir-Yilmaz et al., 2021</xref>), plus a subset of hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pauley et al., 2006</xref>). Knockout leads to a shorter cochlea with extra rows of hair cells, and to loss or reduction of vestibular end organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pauley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hwang et al., 2009</xref>). More hair cells and fewer supporting cells were seen after conditional knockdown of <italic>Foxg1</italic> in neonatal cochlear supporting cells, possibly via the transdifferentiation of supporting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests the possibility that FoxG1 may act in the central zone of lateral line sensory ridges to maintain a proliferative progenitor state, as it does in the mouse olfactory epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kawauchi et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, Fox family members can act as pioneer factors as well as transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Golson and Kaestner, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lukoseviciute et al., 2018</xref>). A pioneer factor role has been proposed for FoxI3 in otic placode development (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Singh and Groves, 2016</xref>). In the developing neural crest, FoxD3 acts early as a pioneer factor, opening enhancers and repositioning nucleosomes to prime genes controlling neural crest specification and migration and, concurrently, to repress the premature differentiation of, for example, melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lukoseviciute et al., 2018</xref>). Later in neural crest development, FoxD3 represses enhancers associated with mesenchymal, neuronal and melanocyte lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lukoseviciute et al., 2018</xref>). In cortical progenitors, FoxG1 suppresses the adoption at later stages of an early-born cell fate, namely, Cajal-Retzius cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanashima et al., 2004</xref>). In the developing chicken otic placode, FoxG1 represses markers of other lineages, such as the olfactory and lens placodes, and epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anwar et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, it is possible that FoxG1 acts in the central zone of lateral line sensory ridges in electroreceptive fishes as a pioneer factor for neuromast/hair cell formation, and/or that it represses ampullary organ/electroreceptor formation.</p><p>The formation of ectopic ampullary organs/electroreceptors within neuromast lines in <italic>Foxg1</italic> crispants could be explained by various scenarios. FoxG1 might act as a direct repressor of electrosensory fate, its loss leading to ampullary organ formation instead of neuromasts (and to ectopic electoreceptor formation within neuromasts, as we observed in a few cases). Alternatively, given that ampullary organs normally form later than neuromasts, and neuromasts are missing in the absence of FoxG1 (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell et al., 2024</xref>), the expansion of ampullary organ fields could be caused indirectly by the loss of inhibitory signals from neuromasts that normally repress ampullary organ development. The fact that we often saw sections of missing neuromasts without ectopic ampullary organs might argue against this indirect role. However, the ‘missing neuromasts only’ phenotype was primarily seen in the otic neuromast line, where ampullary organ-promoting signals might be more restricted, as the associated ampullary organ field is small and only forms on the dorsal side of part of the line (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). It is also possible that FoxG1 acts via both of these hypothetical mechanisms. Consistent with this possibility, FoxG1 was recently reported to play a dual role in regulating neurogenesis versus gliogenesis in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bose et al., 2025</xref>). In cortical progenitors, FoxG1 maintains neurogenesis and suppresses gliogenesis cell-autonomously by repressing expression of <italic>Fgfr3</italic>, encoding a receptor for the pro-gliogenic Fgf signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bose et al., 2025</xref>). In post-mitotic neurons, FoxG1 regulates (directly or indirectly) the expression of Fgf ligand genes, suggesting a non-cell-autonomous role for neuron-expressed FoxG1 in regulating gliogenesis in progenitors via Fgf signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bose et al., 2025</xref>). Thus, it is possible that FoxG1 plays both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous roles in regulating sensory organ and receptor cell formation in the central zone of lateral line sensory ridges.</p><p>Overall, these data lead us to propose a highly speculative hypothesis, namely that electrosensory organs may be the ‘default’ developmental fate within lateral line sensory ridges in electroreceptive vertebrates, and that FoxG1 represses this fate, whether directly or indirectly, to enable mechanosensory neuromasts and hair cells to form. (This speculation relates solely to developmental mechanisms: electroreceptors most likely evolved in the vertebrate ancestor via the diversification of lateral line hair cells; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker, 2019</xref>.) To test these hypotheses directly, it will be important in the future to identify global changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the absence of FoxG1, as well as analyse sensory cell identity within individual lateral line organs using multiple molecular markers across a range of developmental stages.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Summary and perspective</title><p>Overall, we have found that the ‘hair cell’ transcription factor Atoh1 is required for the formation of lateral line electroreceptors as well as hair cells, consistent with a close developmental relationship between these putative ‘sister cell’ types.

Single-guide (sg) RNAs were preferentially designed to target 5' exons, ideally upstream of or within regions encoding known functional domains, to increase the probability of disrupting gene function. SgRNAs were designed using the CRISPR Guide RNA Design Tool from Benchling (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://benchling.com">https://benchling.com</ext-link>) and selected for synthesis based on the following criteria: (1) a high on-target score, ideally no less than 0.5; (2) no off-target matches identified within coding sequences in transcriptome and genome data, unless there were at least two mismatches in the 3’ seed sequence (8–10 bp upstream of the protospacer adjacent motif [PAM], or in the PAM itself); and (3) if multiplexing, the sgRNA pair was ideally within 50–150 bases of each other to increase the probability of fragment deletion.</p><p>DNA templates for CRISPR sgRNAs were synthesised using plasmid pX335-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-hSpCas9n(D10A) (Addgene, plasmid #42335; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cong et al., 2013</xref>) containing the sgRNA scaffold. The sgRNA scaffold was amplified using a specific forward primer for each sgRNA, with an overhang containing the sgRNA target sequence and T7 promoter, and a reverse primer that was identical for all reactions (<named-content content-type="sequence">AAAAAAGCACCGACTCGGTGCC</named-content>; personal communication, Dr Ahmed Elewa, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden). To enable direct synthesis of the sgRNAs from the PCR products, an overhang was added to the forward primer that contained the T7 promoter, followed by the 20-nucleotide sgRNA target sequence: <named-content content-type="sequence">GATCAC<underline>TAATACGACTCACTATA</underline></named-content>(20N)<named-content content-type="sequence">GTTTTAGAGCTAGAAAT</named-content>, where the underlining indicates the T7 promoter and ‘(20N)’ represents the specific sgRNA target sequence, followed by the plasmid-specific primer sequence (Addgene, plasmid #42335; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cong et al., 2013</xref>). If the first nucleotide of the sgRNA target sequence was G, this completed the T7 promoter (and became the first base of the sgRNA). For sgRNA target sequences that did not start with G, an additional G was added before the sgRNA target sequence to complete the T7 promoter, to ensure efficient transcription. The DNA template was amplified using Q5 polymerase (New England Biolabs, NEB) and purified using the Monarch PCR &amp; DNA Cleanup Kit (NEB). The sgRNAs were synthesised using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (NEB) and purified using the Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit (NEB) and stored at –80°C before use. Alternatively, chemically modified synthetic sgRNAs were ordered directly from Synthego (CRISPRevolution sgRNA EZ Kit).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Embryo injection</title><p>On the day of injection, 1200 ng sgRNA were mixed with 2400 ng Cas9 protein with NLS (PNA Bio) in 5 μl nuclease-free water and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature to form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. For sgRNA multiplexing, each sgRNA was pre-complexed with Cas9 protein in a separate tube, to prevent binding competition. Two RNP mixes were then combined 1:1 to a final volume of 5 μl, and 0.5 μl of 10% 10,000 MW rhodamine dextran (Invitrogen) added to better visualise the injection mixture and allow selection of properly injected embryos using rhodamine fluorescence. Injection mixtures were kept on ice throughout the injection session. 50 μl glass microcapillaries (Drummond Microcaps) were pulled in a capillary needle puller (PC-10, Narishige) set to 58°C with two light and one heavy weights, in single-stage pulling mode. Fertilised sterlet eggs were manually dechorionated using Dumont #5 forceps. A 1000 μl pipette tip cut to the same diameter as a dechorionated sterlet egg was used to prepare a series of wells in an agar plate to allow ideal egg positioning during injection using an automatic microinjector (FemtoJet 4x, Eppendorf), set to 100 hPa. Approximately 20 nl of the injection mixture (corresponding to approximately 4.8 ng sgRNAs and 9.6 ng Cas9) were injected into fertilised eggs or two-cell stage embryos, targeting the animal pole at a 45° angle. Injected embryos were moved to a clean Petri dish and, for optimum Cas9 efficiency, kept at room temperature until the end of the injecting session or until at least the 32-cell stage, then moved to a 16°C incubator. No more than 30 eggs were kept per 90 mm Petri dish. Unfertilised eggs and dead embryos were removed at the end of the injection day. Petri dishes were checked regularly for dead embryos and the water was changed at least twice a day before gastrulation was completed, and once daily post-gastrulation. Hatched larvae were kept for approximately 16 days post fertilisation until stage 45, then euthanised by MS-222 overdose and fixed with modified Carnoy’s fixative (see above). Fixed larvae were then dehydrated stepwise into 100% ethanol and stored at –20°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Gene cloning, in situ hybridisation, and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from sterlet larvae using Trizol (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific), following the manufacturer’s protocol, and cDNA synthesised using the Superscript III First Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Using a gene knockout approach in the sterlet, this study convincingly demonstrates that the development of both types of receptor cells depends on the transcription factor Atoh1, it further shows that another transcription factor, FoxG1, promotes mechanoreceptor but represses electroreceptor development.

This leads the authors to propose the intriguing hypothesis that electrosensory organs may represent the 'default' fate within lateral line sensory ridges in electroreceptive vertebrates.

The authors acknowledge and discuss this limitation transparently.</p><p>In addition, this work represents a significant technical advance. The authors' use of CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in a non-standard animal model electroreceptive species demonstrates the utility of this approach for functional studies in understudied systems.</p><p>I have a few suggestions to consider:</p><p>It would be beneficial to include quantitative data of the observed phenotypes.

Close-up images or 'zoom-ins' in areas where differentiation is crucial would be extremely helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study uses CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing to knockout genes encoding three transcription factors with potential roles in lateral line development in F<sub>0</sub> embryos of the sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus). In this bony fish, related to sturgeons, the lateral line system comprises both mechanosensory and electrosensory receptor organs (neuromasts and ampullary organs, respectively), which originate from common embryonic precursors (lateral line placodes). In the first experiment, Atoh1, a transcription factor that is known to be essential for the development of mechanoreceptors (hair cells) in the ear and lateral line of other vertebrates, was knocked out. As a consequence, neuromasts and ampullary organs in the sterlet lateral lines and the expression of POU4f3 and Gfi1 were lost to varying degrees (this variability is expected due to the mosaicism of gene editing events in F<sub>0</sub> embryos). This demonstrates that Atoh1 is required for the development of electrosensory as well as mechanosensory receptor cells in the lateral line. It further suggests that POU4f3 and Gfi1, which are known to promote hair cell development in the inner ear downstream of Atoh1, may play a similar role in the development of electroreceptors.</p><p>Using the same approach, the study next investigated the effects of knocking out NeuroD4, a transcription factor with electrosensory specific expression, and FoxG1, a transcription factor with mechanosensory specific expression. While NeuroD4 knockout embryos were normal (possibly due to redundant functions of other NeuroD genes shown to be expressed in similar patterns), FoxG1 embryos exhibited losses of neuromasts. In addition, ampullary organs were seen ectopically in areas normally occupied by neuromasts. The authors conclude from this that FoxG1 represses ampullary organ development and suggest that the latter may be the default fate, which needs to be repressed in primordia of mechanoreceptors.</p><p>The study is very well conducted, written and documented and provides novel information on the regulation of sensory development in vertebrates. Since none of the established model organisms (e.g. <italic>Xenopus</italic> or zebrafish) possess electroreceptors, it uses the sterlet and successfully establishes CRISPR-based gene editing techniques in this non-model vertebrate organism. Using this technique, it clearly demonstrates a requirement for Atoh1 for the development of both electrosensory and mechanosensory cells and suggests that similar Atoh1 target genes are involved. Taken together with similarities in signal transduction mechanism, these findings strengthen the hypothesis that hair cells and electroreceptors may be evolutionarily closely related to &quot;sister cell types&quot;. The study further establishes a new role of FoxG1 in the development of lateral line mechanoreceptors.</p><p>The latter finding, however, does not necessarily support the authors' conclusion that FoxG1 represses ampullary organ development and that the latter is the default fate of lateral line receptors. The experiments really only demonstrate that FoxG1 is required for neuromast development in sterlets. The observation of ectopic ampullary organs in these embryos may be explained in several possible ways. There may, for example, be (1) a transformation of fate from neuromasts to ampullary organs due to the loss of FoxG1 as a repressor of ampullary fate (the authors' hypothesis); or (2) an expansion of ampullary precursors because of apoptosis of neuromasts; or (3) an expansion of ampullary precursors because of the absence of neuromasts that exert a repressive effect on ampullary organ development. The patterning disturbances observed in the embryos seem to be more in line with the latter scenario (FoxG1 promotes neuromasts; neuromasts repress ampullary organs), while the fact that FoxG1 seems to be expressed in neuromasts only in electroreceptive fishes (line 567) is more in accordance with the first scenario. Ultimately, this question can only be resolved experimentally (e.g. by overexpressing FoxG1 in electroreceptors; transplanting neuromasts into ampullary fields etc.), which will probably not be feasible in this non-model organism. I therefore, suggest that the authors discuss these various possible interpretations more carefully and tone down their claim of electroreceptors as default fate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Minarik and colleagues examine the effects of knockdown of the transcription factor genes Atoh1 and Foxg1 on the development of the mechanosensory and electrosensory lateral line systems in the sterlet (Acipenser ruthenius), a species of sturgeon. Recent work from the same group has demonstrated expression of Atoh1 and its targets Gfi1 and Pou4f3 in both sets of lateral line organs. These genes are highly conserved and necessary for mechanosensory hair cell development. Using CRISPR gene inactivation, the authors demonstrate that disruption of Atoh1 function results in loss of expression of Gfi1 and Pou4f3, as well as differentiation markers of both mechanosensory and electrosensory organs. Expression of the mechanosensory lateral line marker <italic>Sox2</italic> suggests that organs still form but that mechanoreceptors are missing. It is not clear whether ampullary organs still form, but lack electroreceptors, after Atoh1 inactivation.</p><p>By contrast targeting the electrosensory-specific transcription factor Neurod4 has no detectable effect, hypothesized due to compensation by other family members. Consistent with this idea, the authors show expression of Neurod1 and Neurod6 in the lateral line; however, they do not examine expression of these genes in the context of Neurod4 inactivation.</p><p>Finally, the authors provide evidence for ectopic ampullary organ differentiation after inactivation of the mechanosensory lateral line specific transcription factor Foxg1. These findings could be better documented with multicolor expression analysis, higher power imaging or other approaches to specifically differentiate endogenous organs from ectopic ones. In addition, it is not clear how frequently the ectopic electroreceptors are found. The authors hypothesize that Foxg1 suppresses electroreceptor organ differentiation and speculate that it is therefore a default fate. However, they do not examine expression of mechanoreceptor markers, providing more specific evidence for fate conversion. More evidence is needed to support the idea of a default fate.</p><p>The authors suggest that other Neurod family members compensate for disruption of Neurod4. This hypothesis would be further supported by examining the expression of these other genes in Neurod4 crispants.</p><p>It is somewhat challenging for the non-expert to distinguish between the different receptors, particularly by location, in the figures provided. While the <italic>Sox2</italic> immunoreactivity should be a helpful landmark, it is difficult to distinguish <italic>Sox2</italic> immunoreactivity with the ISH signal as both appear a similar color. Could alternative methods, including fluorescence, be used to determine whether organs are double-positive? Or could higher power images more clearly distinguish signals or different organ morphologies?</p><p>While the loss of organs is clearly documented, the addition of new or ectopic ampullary organs after FoxG1 inactivation is difficult to distinguish. How many new organs are there overall? Are they still <italic>Sox2</italic><sup>+</sup>?</p><p>In addition, the exact phenotype is not clear – has there been loss of neuromasts or neuromast markers (e.g. Isl1, Hmx2 and <italic>Rorb</italic>) – that is, conversion of neuromasts to ampullary organs? Or just the addition of new ectopic ampullae?</p><p>Although a very common error, the use of F<sub>0</sub> to describe CRISPR mutagenesis should be avoided, as in genetic nomenclature F stands for the filial (child) generation. G0 should instead be used.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96285.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that using Cas9/Crispr technology on the sterlet is a significant advancement of this unconventional model system on the highly interesting question of the development and evolution of mechano-/electroreceptors.</p><p>While the Atoh1 manipulation is overall well documented and convincing, the reviewers think that the following experiments are critical for a more solid manuscript:</p><p>1) Quantification and statistical assessment of results</p></disp-quote><p>As described in more detail below, we have undertaken a more quantitative analysis of both the <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Foxg1</italic> crispant phenotypes.

Thus, <italic>Foxg1</italic> plays a role in normal neuromast development and/or maintenance, as reported for zebrafish by Bell et al. (2024) after our original manuscript was submitted. The new analysis, together with skin-mounts, also revealed small patches of <italic>Kcnab3</italic>-positive or <italic>Mafa</italic>-positive electroreceptors within otherwise <italic>Kcnab3</italic>-negative and <italic>Mafa</italic>-negative neuromasts in uninterrupted neuromast lines, suggesting that Foxg1 also represses the formation of electroreceptors within neuromasts.</p><p>In the Discussion, we now discuss the various scenarios that could explain the <italic>Foxg1</italic> phenotypes, and cite another recent paper that reported both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous roles for Foxg1 in regulating glial specification in mouse cortex (Bose et al., 2025, DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.101851):</p><p>lines 921-43: &quot;The formation of ectopic ampullary organs/ electroreceptors within neuromast lines in <italic>Foxg1</italic> crispants could be explained by various scenarios. Foxg1 might act as a direct repressor of electrosensory fate, its loss leading to ampullary organ formation instead of neuromasts (and to ectopic electoreceptor formation within neuromasts, as we observed in a few cases). Alternatively, given that ampullary organs normally form later than neuromasts, and neuromasts are missing in the absence of Foxg1 (see also Bell et al., 2024), the expansion of ampullary organ fields could be caused indirectly by the loss of inhibitory signals from neuromasts that normally repress ampullary organ development. The fact that we often saw sections of missing neuromasts without ectopic ampullary organs might argue against this indirect role. However, the &quot;missing neuromasts only&quot; phenotype was primarily seen in the otic neuromast line, where ampullary organ-promoting signals might be more restricted, as the associated ampullary organ field is small and only forms on the dorsal side of part of the line (see schematic in Figure 9A). It is also possible that Foxg1 acts via both of these hypothetical mechanisms. Consistent with this possibility, Foxg1 was recently reported to play a dual role in regulating neurogenesis <italic>versus</italic> gliogenesis in the cortex (Bose et al., 2025). In cortical progenitors, Foxg1 maintains neurogenesis and suppresses gliogenesis cell-autonomously by repressing expression of <italic>Fgfr3</italic>, encoding a receptor for the pro-gliogenic FGF signalling pathway (Bose et al., 2025). In post-mitotic neurons, Foxg1 regulates (directly or indirectly) the expression of FGF ligand genes, suggesting a non-cell-autonomous role for neuron-expressed Foxg1 in regulating gliogenesis in progenitors via FGF signalling (Bose et al., 2025). Thus, it is possible that Foxg1 plays both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous roles in regulating sensory organ and receptor cell formation in the central zone of lateral line sensory ridges.&quot;</p><p>We have also added some new text immediately before the Summary and Perspective section, to reflect the need for further experiments to test the different scenarios (new text in red font below):</p><p>lines 953-7: &quot;To test these hypotheses directly, it will be important in the future to identify global changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the absence of <italic>Foxg1</italic>, as well as analyse sensory cell identity within individual lateral line organs using multiple molecular markers across a range of developmental stages.&quot;</p><p>Regarding the request for better documentation of the Foxg1 effects on patterning: As noted in the response to Essential Revision 1, we undertook post-ISH <italic>Sox2</italic> immunostaining on all <italic>Foxg1</italic> crispants and scored the severity and type of disruption for each of the four pre-otic neuromast lines (supraorbital, infraorbital, otic, preopercular) on each side of the head in 87 <italic>Foxg1</italic> crispants.

In this bony fish, related to sturgeons, the lateral line system comprises both mechanosensory and electrosensory receptor organs (neuromasts and ampullary organs, respectively), which originate from common embryonic precursors (lateral line placodes). In the first experiment, Atoh1, a transcription factor that is known to be essential for the development of mechanoreceptors (hair cells) in the ear and lateral line of other vertebrates, was knocked out. As a consequence, neuromasts and ampullary organs in the sterlet lateral lines and the expression of POU4f3 and Gfi1 were lost to varying degrees (this variability is expected due to the mosaicism of gene editing events in F<sub>0</sub> embryos). This demonstrates that Atoh1 is required for the development of electrosensory as well as mechanosensory receptor cells in the lateral line. It further suggests that POU4f3 and Gfi1, which are known to promote hair cell development in the inner ear downstream of Atoh1, may play a similar role in the development of electroreceptors.</p><p>Using the same approach, the study next investigated the effects of knocking out NeuroD4, a transcription factor with electrosensory specific expression, and FoxG1, a transcription factor with mechanosensory specific expression. While NeuroD4 knockout embryos were normal (possibly due to redundant functions of other NeuroD genes shown to be expressed in similar patterns), FoxG1 embryos exhibited losses of neuromasts. In addition, ampullary organs were seen ectopically in areas normally occupied by neuromasts. The authors conclude from this that FoxG1 represses ampullary organ development and suggest that the latter may be the default fate, which needs to be repressed in primordia of mechanoreceptors.</p><p>The study is very well conducted, written and documented and provides novel information on the regulation of sensory development in vertebrates. Since none of the established model organisms (e.g. Xenopus or zebrafish) possess electroreceptors, it uses the sterlet and successfully establishes CRISPR-based gene editing techniques in this non-model vertebrate organism. Using this technique, it clearly demonstrates a requirement for Atoh1 for the development of both electrosensory and mechanosensory cells and suggests that similar Atoh1 target genes are involved. Taken together with similarities in signal transduction mechanism, these findings strengthen the hypothesis that hair cells and electroreceptors may be evolutionarily closely related to &quot;sister cell types&quot;. The study further establishes a new role of FoxG1 in the development of lateral line mechanoreceptors.</p><p>The latter finding, however, does not necessarily support the authors' conclusion that FoxG1 represses ampullary organ development and that the latter is the default fate of lateral line receptors. The experiments really only demonstrate that FoxG1 is required for neuromast development in sterlets. The observation of ectopic ampullary organs in these embryos may be explained in several possible ways. There may, for example, be (1) a transformation of fate from neuromasts to ampullary organs due to the loss of FoxG1 as a repressor of ampullary fate (the authors' hypothesis); or (2) an expansion of ampullary precursors because of apoptosis of neuromasts; or (3) an expansion of ampullary precursors because of the absence of neuromasts that exert a repressive effect on ampullary organ development. The patterning disturbances observed in the embryos seem to be more in line with the latter scenario (FoxG1 promotes neuromasts; neuromasts repress ampullary organs), while the fact that FoxG1 seems to be expressed in neuromasts only in electroreceptive fishes (line 567) is more in accordance with the first scenario. Ultimately, this question can only be resolved experimentally (e.g. by overexpressing FoxG1 in electroreceptors; transplanting neuromasts into ampullary fields etc.), which will probably not be feasible in this non-model organism. I therefore, suggest that the authors discuss these various possible interpretations more carefully and tone down their claim of electroreceptors as default fate.</p></disp-quote><p>These are excellent points, though we note that our proposal that electroreceptors may be the 'default' fate within lateral line sensory ridges was presented explicitly as a speculation (Abstract) or speculative hypothesis (Discussion), rather than a conclusion or claim (now &quot;a highly speculative hypothesis&quot;, line 948). For the revised manuscript, we undertook a more detailed analysis of <italic>Foxg1</italic> phenotypes after performing post-ISH <italic>Sox2</italic> immunostaining on all <italic>Foxg1</italic> crispants to show neuromasts (originally performed only on a subset). Together with skin-mount analysis, this revealed that in some of the crispants analysed with electrosensory-specific markers <italic>Kcnab3</italic> or <italic>Mafa</italic>, small patches of ectopic electroreceptors in the normal position of neuromast lines were actually located within neuromasts in uninterrupted neuromast lines. This suggested that Foxg1 also acts (whether directly or indirectly) to repress electroreceptor formation within neuromasts.</p><p>The analysis also revealed that neuromast lines were often disrupted by gaps, without ectopic ampullary organs, consistent with a role for Foxg1 in neuromast development and/or maintenance. After our original manuscript was submitted, <italic>foxg1a</italic> expression and function were reported in the migrating posterior lateral line primordium and neuromasts of zebrafish (Bell et al., 2024; DOI 10.1242/bio.060580). We now cite this paper and have removed our previous statement and associated citations about lateral line expression of <italic>Foxg1</italic> being restricted to electroreceptive fishes (original lines 566-70). Another relevant recent paper identified both cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous roles for Foxg1 in regulating glial fate in the mouse cortex (Bose et al., 2025; DOI 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.101851).</p><p>Taking all of this together, we have added a discussion of the various scenarios that could explain the <italic>Foxg1</italic> phenotypes (lines 921-43). We also emphasise throughout the revised manuscript that Foxg1 may be acting directly or indirectly: line 31; line 813; lines 869-70 (Discussion subtitle); lines 941-3 (&quot;Thus, it is possible that Foxg1 plays both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous roles in regulating sensory organ and receptor cell formation in the central zone of lateral line sensory ridges&quot;); lines 950-51; line 965.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Minarik and colleagues examine the effects of knockdown of the transcription factor genes Atoh1 and Foxg1 on the development of the mechanosensory and electrosensory lateral line systems in the sterlet (Acipenser ruthenius), a species of sturgeon. Recent work from the same group has demonstrated expression of Atoh1 and its targets Gfi1 and Pou4f3 in both sets of lateral line organs. These genes are highly conserved and necessary for mechanosensory hair cell development. Using CRISPR gene inactivation, the authors demonstrate that disruption of Atoh1 function results in loss of expression of Gfi1 and Pou4f3, as well as differentiation markers of both mechanosensory and electrosensory organs. Expression of the mechanosensory lateral line marker Sox2 suggests that organs still form but that mechanoreceptors are missing. It is not clear whether ampullary organs still form, but lack electroreceptors, after Atoh1 inactivation.</p></disp-quote><p>The supporting-cell marker <italic>Sox2</italic> is expressed in ampullary organs, but at much lower levels than in neuromasts (Figure 1A,B).

Hence, the phenotype in ampullary organs was also specific to receptor cells.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>By contrast targeting the electrosensory-specific transcription factor Neurod4 has no detectable effect, hypothesized due to compensation by other family members.

(As they are already co-expressed in ampullary organs, we would not expect to see any change in their spatial expression patterns.)
