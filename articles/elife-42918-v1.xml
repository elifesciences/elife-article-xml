However, establishment and maintenance of quiescent NSC pools during development is not understood. Here, we show that Suppressor of Fused (Sufu) controls establishment of the quiescent NSC pool during mouse dentate gyrus (DG) development by regulating Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling activity. Deletion of <italic>Sufu</italic> in NSCs early in DG development decreases Shh signaling activity leading to reduced proliferation of NSCs, resulting in a small quiescent NSC pool in adult mice. We found that putative adult NSCs proliferate and increase their numbers in the first postnatal week and subsequently enter a quiescent state towards the end of the first postnatal week. In the absence of Sufu, postnatal expansion of NSCs is compromised, and NSCs prematurely become quiescent. Thus, Sufu is required for Shh signaling activity ensuring expansion and proper transition of NSC pools to quiescent states during DG development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>dentate gyrus</kwd><kwd>sonic hedgehog</kwd><kwd>hippocampal development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008732</institution-id><institution>Uehara Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Noguchi</surname><given-names>Hirofumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Overseas Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Noguchi</surname><given-names>Hirofumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007807</institution-id><institution>Japan Science Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Noguchi</surname><given-names>Hirofumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS075188</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pleasure</surname><given-names>Samuel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sufu controls dentate gyrus stem cell quiescence by acting as a positive regulator of Shh signaling and loss of Sufu leads to dramatic failure to produce sufficient quiescent stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Newborn neurons are generated in two restricted regions of the adult rodent brain: the cortical subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate subgranular zone (SGZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altman and Das, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eriksson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuhn et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lois and Alvarez-Buylla, 1993</xref>). Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) has been implicated in hippocampal-dependent memory and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2010</xref>). Newly generated neurons produced from neural stem cells (NSCs) residing in the SGZ are constantly added to the granule cell layer (GCL) and integrated into the existing hippocampal circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imayoshi et al., 2008</xref>). Persistence of adult hippocampal neurogenesis relies on the proper maintenance of NSCs even after development. However, little is known about the developmental programs governing the production and maintenance of long-lived NSCs.</p><p>Quiescence of NSCs during early development has been proposed to play a key mechanism for maintaining the NSC pool throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Furutachi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawaguchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mira et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Song et al., 2012</xref>). NSCs enter a quiescent state in a spatiotemporal manner during development, and this step is critical for ensuring the appropriate sized NSC pool for adult neurogenesis. At the beginning of forebrain development, NSCs are highly proliferative, but gradually lose proliferation competence with development and enter a quiescent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Furutachi et al., 2015</xref>). The failure to transition to a quiescent state during development triggers continuous proliferation of NSCs and leads to premature exhaustion of the NSC pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Furutachi et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the NSC pool must be properly established since NSCs can only undergo a limited number of rounds of cell division prior to terminal differentiation. Live imaging of NSCs in adult DG and thymidine-analog based cell tracing analysis demonstrated that quiescent NSCs undergo a series of asymmetric divisions to produce neurons, and subsequently are consumed by symmetric differentiation into astrocytes or neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calzolari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Encinas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pilz et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, adult neurogenesis and the NSC pool have been shown to decline with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuhn et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lugert et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that for neurogenesis to persist throughout life, the size of putative quiescent NSC pool must be established during development before the NSCs transition to a quiescent state.</p><p>Long-lived NSCs in the DG originate from the ventral hippocampus at E17.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013</xref>). These cells migrate along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus from the temporal to septal poles and eventually settle in the ventral and dorsal DG. The initial production and maintenance of long-lived NSCs is dependent on Shh signaling and Shh ligands, produced by local neurons in the embryonic amygdala and the postnatal DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Blocking Shh signaling by deleting <italic>Smoothened (Smo)</italic> from responsive cells in the DG or ablation of Shh ligands from local neurons impairs the emergence of long-lived NSCs and results in diminishing the NSC pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013</xref>). These findings highlight the significance of Shh signaling in production of the NSC pool during development. What is not clear yet from these studies is how Shh signaling activity is spatiotemporally regulated to ensure the expansion of the NSC pool during DG development and the role of Shh signaling in the transition of NSCs to a quiescent state.</p><p>Shh signaling is critical at early stages of embryonic brain development. Thus, complete ablation of Shh signaling activity by <italic>Smo</italic> deletion or the constitutive activation of Shh signaling by expressing an active Smo mutant (SmoM2) severely compromise the initial steps of DG development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2008</xref>). The embryonic nature of this phenotype prevents the further analysis of specific roles of Shh signaling in postnatal DG development, particularly in the production and maintenance of postnatal NSCs. To circumvent this, we are utilizing a Cre-loxP based system that allows spatiotemporal analysis of Shh signaling activity by genetic manipulation of the Shh signaling inhibitor, Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), a Gli-binding protein with an indispensable role in embryonic development. Conditional deletion of Sufu in a spatiotemporal manner allowed us to examine the role of Shh signaling in various aspects of NSC behavior during DG development. Our earlier studies showed that Sufu is important for the specification of NSC fate decision during cortical development via regulating Shh signaling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yabut et al., 2015</xref>). In this report, we set out to determine the contribution of Sufu in regulating Shh signaling during DG development and how Sufu and Shh signaling are involved in the mechanisms governing the expansion of long-lived NSCs and their transition to the quiescent state during DG development. Intriguingly, we find that deletion of <italic>Sufu</italic> decreases Shh signaling in NSCs during DG development – this is in distinction to the neocortex where loss of <italic>Sufu</italic> increases Shh signaling. Long-lived NSCs expand in the early part of first postnatal week, but proliferation of these NSCs is impaired in the absence of Sufu, resulting in a decreased NSC pool in the adult DG. We also found that long-lived NSCs gradually become quiescent towards the end of the first postnatal week. However, <italic>Sufu</italic> deletion precociously triggers this transition to the quiescent state. Taken together, these results indicate that loss of Sufu during DG development decreases Shh signaling activity and impairs expansion of long-lived NSCs and the timely transition to a quiescent state during DG development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deletion of <italic>Sufu</italic> in NSCs reduces Shh signaling during DG development</title><p>Shh ligands originate from amygdala neurons and the adjacent ventral dentate neuroepithelium to activate Shh signaling in ventral hippocampal NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013</xref>). These Shh-responding NSCs subsequently migrate to the dorsal DG and gradually accumulate between the hilus and GCL to form the SGZ postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Sufu is expressed in NSCs of the developing forebrain including presumptive DG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yabut et al., 2015</xref>). We previously reported that deletion of <italic>Sufu</italic> in NSCs at early gestational stages (E10.5) severely disrupted the overall cytoarchitecture of the forebrain as a consequence of ectopic activation of Shh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yabut et al., 2015</xref>). To determine the effects of Sufu specifically in DG development, we used a hGFAP-Cre line to delete <italic>Sufu</italic> in NSCs at E13.5, before the initiation of DG development (E14.5) – we call these mice hGFAP-Sufu-KO. We first asked if deletion of <italic>Sufu</italic> increases Shh signaling activity. Expression of <italic>Gli1</italic>, a downstream target gene of Shh signaling, is strictly dependent on Shh signaling stimulation. Thus, we used Gli1-LacZ reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2002</xref>), in which lacZ is expressed under the Gli1 promoter, to identify and characterize Shh-responding cells in the developing DG of hGFAP-Sufu-KO mice. Accordingly, we found abundant Gli1-lacZ + cells in the ventricular zone of the ventral hippocampus in <italic>Sufu<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Gli1-lacZ + cells were also present in the dorsal DG of <italic>Sufu<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Gli1 <sup>lacZ/+</sup></italic>mice at P0 and were enriched in the SGZ at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Surprisingly, we found a remarkable reduction of Gli1-LacZ + cells in ventral hippocampus of hGFAP-Sufu-KO;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup> mice at E15.5-P0, and small numbers detected throughout the anterior to posterior DG at P7. These data demonstrate that deletion of <italic>Sufu</italic> in NSCs decreases Shh signaling activity during DG development. This is distinct from the embryonic neocortex where deletion of Sufu increases Shh signaling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yabut et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42918.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Deletion of <italic>Sufu</italic> decreases Hh-responding cells during DG development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative Gli1-LacZ staining images of sagittal brain sections in <italic>Sufu<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup></italic>and hGFAP-Sufu-KO;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup> mice at E15.5-P0.

Ablation of Shh signaling in NSCs by deleting <italic>Smo</italic> leads to a drastic reduction in NSC proliferation and results in the failure of SGZ establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Since hGFAP-Sufu-KO;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup> mice showed a reduction in Gli1 expression at the onset of DG development, we investigated if deletion of <italic>Sufu</italic> influences the proliferation capacity of NSCs particularly in the SGZ where Sox2 +cells form the NSC pool. During early postnatal DG development, NSCs migrate to the border between the hilus and GCL to form SGZ. The SGZ can be distinguished by accumulation of Sox2 +cells around P7 and is fully established by second postnatal week. Thus, we examined the number of Sox2 +cells in SGZ at P7 and P14. Although we found no difference in the number of Sox2 +cells between Sufu<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice and hGFAP-Sufu-KO mice in the SGZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), there was a significant reduction in Ki67 +proliferating cells in the P7 hGFAP-Sufu-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, there was a significant reduction in ratio of Ki67 +cells to Sox2 +NSCs in the SGZ of hGFAP-Sufu-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) indicating that very few Sox2 +cells retained their proliferative capacity. We next examined the number of Sox2 +cells and Ki67 proliferating cells in the SGZ of DGs at P14. In addition to the reduction in Ki67 +proliferating cells, the number of Sox2 +cells was significantly reduced in SGZ of hGFAP-Sufu-KO mice at P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). These data suggest that deletion of <italic>Sufu</italic> decreases NSC proliferation and number. We found that these phenotypes of Sufu-KO mice contrasts starkly with those observed in the hGFAP-Cre;SmoM2 mice, in which Shh signaling is constitutively active in NSCs. The DG of hGFAP-Cre;SmoM2 mice display abnormal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2008</xref>) and exhibit higher numbers of dying cells as marked by cleaved caspase 3 + cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Despite this, there was a significant increase in proliferating Ki67 +cells in the SGZ of hGFAP-Cre;SmoM2 compared to WT mice at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>). Accordingly, the proliferating population of Sox2 +cells was significantly higher than WT mice at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Taken together, these findings establish the crucial roles of Shh signaling in regulating NSC proliferation in the developing DG. Importantly, that deletion of <italic>Sufu</italic> resulted in downregulation, instead of ectopic activation, of Shh signaling in DG NSCs, indicates the distinct effects of Sufu in specific NSC subtypes and may involve a novel mechanism by which Sufu controls Shh signaling activity in DG NSCs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42918.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Deletion of <italic>Sufu</italic> decreases proliferation of DG-NSCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative immunofluorescence images of Sox2 (red) and Ki67 (green) in the DG of <italic>Sufu<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and hGFAP-Sufu-KO mice at P7.

We found that Tbr2 +neuronal precursor cells, which was significantly reduced in hGFAP-Sufu-KO mice, was further reduced in hGFAP-Sufu-KO;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup> mice at P7 and P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>).

We extracted RNA from P3 DGs and examined the expression of <italic>Gli1</italic>, <italic>Gli2</italic> and <italic>Gli3</italic> by qPCR. As expected, <italic>Gli1</italic> expression was reduced in the DG of hGFAP-Sufu-KO;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) and correlated with the reduction of Gli1-lacZ + cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, these mice also showed remarkable reduction in <italic>Gli2</italic> and Gli3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The reduction of both Gli activators (Gli1 and Gli2) in hGFAP-Sufu-KO;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup> mice raise the possibility that reducing <italic>Gli1</italic> in mice lacking <italic>Sufu</italic> further decreases Shh signaling activity in NSCs.

Since <italic>Sufu</italic> deletion reduced the number of Sox2 +cells in SGZ at P14, we investigated whether reduction of newborn neurons in hGFAP-Sufu-KO;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup> mice was due to a reduction in the production or maintenance of the quiescent NSC pool. These quiescent NSCs display a radial morphology with fiber extending to the molecular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bignami and Dahl, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lugert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rickmann et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sievers et al., 1992</xref>).

This suggests that newborn neurons were produced from quiescent NSCs at comparable ratios and that the neurogenic competence was not impaired. Further, these findings supported our idea that decreased newborn neurons in hGFAP-Sufu-KO and hGFAP-Sufu-KO;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup> mice results from reduction of NSC pool.

To test this, we utilized two thymidine analogs 5-Chloro-2-deoxyuridine (CldU) and 5-Iodo-2-deoxyuridine (IdU), and injected each thymidine analogs at different time points; CldU at P0, 3, 7 or 14 and IdU at 8 weeks old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Because the thymidine analog is diluted as cells divide, cells that proliferated and stopped in the postnatal period will have detectable CldU, and therefore, when IdU is injected at adult stages, cells that became quiescent in developmental stages and then are reactivated in the adult will be double positive for CldU and IdU in adult stages. Double positive cells were observed more in mice injected with CldU at P3 and gradually decreased in groups injected with CldU at later postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). Accordingly, the number of DCX+/CldU+/IdU +cells in newborn neurons was highest in groups injected at P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). Similarly, control mice injected with CldU at P3 had the highest number of CldU and IdU double positive cells at adult stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>). These data suggest that around P3-P7, NSCs in the control DG reduce their proliferation rate and become quiescent. However, in hGFAP-Sufu-KO and hGFAP-Sufu-KO;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup> mice, the number of CldU and IdU double positive cells in CldU-injected groups at P3 or P7 was significantly decreased compared to control mice. Instead, detection of CldU and IdU double positive cells were significantly increased at P0 compared to control. The number of DCX + cells double labeled with CldU and IdU was also decreased in P3 or P7 CldU injected groups, whereas it was increased significantly in P0 CldU injected groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). These data suggest that NSCs in hGFAP-Sufu-KO and hGFAP-Sufu-KO;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup> mice prematurely exited the proliferative state from P0-3 instead of at P3-P7. To support this idea, we further clarified the timing of the transition towards quiescence by investigating the number of CldU+/Sox2+/GFAP +radial NSCs generated at each time point. Similar to our findings from the CldU and IdU double labeling experiments above, we found that the number of Sox2+/GFAP +radial NSCs labeled with CldU was decreased significantly in P3 and P7 CldU injected groups, whereas it was increased significantly in P0 CldU injected groups in hGFAP-Sufu-KO and hGFAP-Sufu-KO;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

Gli1-LacZ + cells were dramatically reduced in the embryonic ventral hippocampus and were abolished in the postnatal DG. Shh signaling is crucial for the initial production of dentate NSCs in the embryonic stage. <italic>Smo</italic> deletion in NSCs severely impairs initial NSC production and leads to decreased size of GCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Although <italic>Sufu</italic> deletion impaired proliferation of NSCs in the first postnatal week, we still observed comparable number of proliferating NSCs at P0, indicating that initial NSC production at embryonic stages was not affected. Whether this process is dependent on Shh signaling is yet to be investigated, since we cannot exclude the possibility that very low levels of Shh signaling activity, likely undetectable by LacZ activity, are sufficient to produce the proper number of NSCs in embryonic stages.</p><p>Sufu is primarily known for its role as a negative regulator of Shh signaling pathway through several mechanisms - promoting the formation of Gli repressors, removing Gli1 from nucleus, and recruiting transcription repressors to Gli-target genes sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnfield et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng and Bishop, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kise et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kogerman et al., 1999</xref>). However, recent studies provide evidence that Sufu may act as both a negative and positive regulator of Shh signaling under specific conditions. For example, in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF), Shh ligand binding triggers Sufu translocation to the nucleus with Gli1, where it binds to and facilitates cytoplasmic export of Gli3 repressor, thereby enhancing Shh signaling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, increasing the amount of Sufu added into <italic>Sufu<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEF compromises Hh-responsiveness in the absence of exogenous Shh, which is consistent with negative function of Sufu for Shh signaling. However, in the presence of exogenous Shh, Hh-responsiveness of <italic>Sufu<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEF is dramatically elevated with the addition of increasing levels of Sufu, an effect that was not observed when Ptch1 was added (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). These reports demonstrate that Sufu can act to enhance or maximize Shh signaling activity. Considering these roles, decreased Shh signaling activity in Sufu KO mice could result from the failure to maximize Shh signaling activity through mechanisms that likely involve stabilization of Gli transcription factors. Supporting this, our data showed that <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Gli2</italic> expression were down-regulated in hGFAP-Sufu-KO;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup> mice in which expression of Shh signaling target genes were significantly reduced. Altogether, our data demonstrate multiple regulatory roles of Sufu in Shh signaling pathway that is dependent on cell type and context.</p><p>We found that deletion of <italic>Sufu</italic> increased the dependency of proper DG development on Gli1 function. Gli1 is not necessary for initial activation of Shh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Gli1</italic> deletion normally does not cause any significant developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2000</xref>). However, the phenotypes in hGFAP-Sufu-KO mice clearly worsen when combined with <italic>Gli1</italic> deletion, suggesting that Gli1 function becomes necessary in the absence of Sufu. Previous studies show that Sufu is important for the stabilization of Gli2 and Gli3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Makino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Loss of Sufu results in diminishing Gli2 full-length activator. Sufu competitively binds to Gli2 and Gli3 with speckle-type POZ protein (Spop), which recruits ubiquitin ligases and degrades the full-length forms of Gli2 and Gli3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wen et al., 2010</xref>). These finding indicates that loss of Gli2 activators in the absence of Sufu increases the requirement for Gli1 function to maintain Shh signaling activity. Indeed, Gli1 is able to compensate for lost Gli2 activator function and rescue the developmental defects of Gli2 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai and Joyner, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Expansion of long-lived NSCs must occur in the first postnatal week during which time ventral-derived NSCs dramatically increase their numbers in both the ventral and dorsal DG. Interestingly, <italic>Sufu</italic> deletion only impaired the proliferation of NSCs in the dorsal DG, but not ventral DG. This difference could be due to underlying molecular differences between NSCs and the surrounding cells residing in these regions. Lineage tracing of Shh expressing cell shows that neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex and hilar mossy cells function as the local source of Shh ligand for ventral derived NSCs, while hair mossy cells in the dorsal DG, but not ventral DG, are the source of Shh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Conditionally removing Shh ligand from these local neurons abolishes signaling in Hh-responding cells and results in reduction of NSCs number, indicating that local Shh ligands are important for the activation of Shh signaling in NSCs after migration to the dorsal DGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Similar to mice lacking Shh, our data showed that deletion of <italic>Sufu</italic> abolished Hh-responding cells in postnatal DGs, followed by the reduction of proliferating NSCs in dorsal DGs. These findings indicate that dorsal and ventral NSCs use distinct developmental approaches to navigate the transition to produce long-lived NSCs. Dorsal NSCs must rely on Sufu to ensure optimal Shh signaling activity suitable for the expansion of long-lived NSCs during DG development, while NSCs in the ventral DG appear able to expand and become quiescent without Sufu.</p><p>Our data suggest that Shh signaling activity must be continuously maintained to promote NSC expansion and that eventual reduction in Shh signaling activity promotes NSCs to transition into the quiescent state. Supporting this, we found that Gli1-LacZ + cells were abundant in the ventral ventricular zone but progressively decreased after migration into the DG in the first postnatal week. Additionally, we found that constitutive activation of Shh signaling in NSCs, by conditional expression of SmoM2, increased proliferating NSCs and prevented transition into quiescence. These observations suggest that Sufu is important in sustaining NSC proliferation until NSCs begin to transition into a quiescent state. However, we also observed in SmoM2 mutants that subpopulations of NSCs become quiescent, indicating that reduction of Shh signaling activity alone is not sufficient to initiate quiescence and that other signaling mechanisms are involved in this process. Indeed, several extracellular factors can regulate the quiescent state of NSCs, such as Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs), Notch, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawaguchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mira et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Song et al., 2012</xref>). These molecules are secreted by granule neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and interneurons in the DG and are likely sources of signals for migrating ventral-derived NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonaguidi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bond et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawaguchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mira et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yousef et al., 2015</xref>). The activity of these signaling pathways, and the simultaneous reduction in Shh signaling with development, may coordinately function to ensure successful transition of NSCs into the quiescent state during DG development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Francois Guillemot, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a timely manuscript that examines the mechanisms underpinning the expansion and entry into quiescence of dentate neural stem cells at early postnatal stages. The data supports a role of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling regulated by Suppressor of Fused (Sufu) in this process. There is much interest in understanding how adult neural stem cells are generated during brain development and this manuscript has the potential to make a significant contribution in this field.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have previously shown that neural stem cells (NSCs) from the ventral hippocampus seed the subgranular zone of the postnatal dentate gyrus to form the adult NSC niche – a process that requires Shh signaling. This new work examines the effect of Sufu deletion on the establishment of the NSC pool in the mouse hippocampus.</p><p>Sufu is usually considered a repressor of the Shh pathway although it has also been shown to stimulate Shh signaling in certain contexts. This is the case here where the phenotypes arising from <italic>Sufu</italic> deletion resemble the phenotypes of a Smo floxed mutant mouse they analysed in their previous work (Li et al., 2013).</p><p>The authors conclude from a number of CldU/IdU incorporation and immunohistochemistry experiments that in wildtype animals, many NSCs enter into quiescence at the end of the first postnatal week. This is later than in the other adult NSC niche where NSCs lining the lateral ventricles enter quiescence at embryonic stages. They also find that decreasing Shh signaling by several mechanisms including <italic>Sufu</italic> deletion leads to precocious entry into quiescence, fewer NSCs in the hippocampus at 8 weeks of age and reduced neurogenesis at later time points.</p><p>The most novel aspect of this study is that it defines the precise timing of proliferation and entry into quiescence of NSCs during DG development and implicates downregulation of Shh signaling in promoting the transition of NSCs from proliferation to quiescence during development of the DG and thereby in determining the size of the adult NSC population.</p><p>Less novel is the establishment of a role of Sufu in enhancing Shh signaling, as Sufu is known to either stimulate or suppress Shh signaling depending on the cellular context. The implication of Shh signaling in the generation and proliferation of NSCs in the DG at early postnatal stages is also not novel as this was already shown in their previous paper (Li et al., 2013).</p><p>Overall, the data is well presented, the figures are of excellent quality and the paper well written, and the data mostly supports the conclusions reached (although not entirely, see below). However, there are several issues which will need to be resolved prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors show that there is a large expansion of NSCs during normal development of the dentate gyrus between P0 to P7 (Figure 5A-D) and they claim that deletion of <italic>Sufu</italic> causes NSCs to precociously transition to a quiescent state (P0-3 instead of P3-7 normally), thus reducing the pool of quiescent NSCs in the adult (Figure 4F). However, Figure 2B clearly shows that there is no difference in the number of Sox2+ NSCs in the dentate gyrus of Sufu KO mice at P7. If the expansion of NSCs occurs from P0 to P7, then the decrease in NSC number should be apparent by P7. In agreement with this, the model presented in Figure 7 suggests that there are fewer NSCs (quiescent and dividing combined) in the Sufu KO at P3-7, but the data in Figure 2B clearly shows that there is no difference in the number of Sox2+ NSCs at P7. Along the same line, if there is an excessive proliferation of NSCs in SmoM2 mice (Figure 2G, H), why is their number unchanged at P7 (Figure 2F)? The authors should comment on these apparent contradictions and may need to amend their model.</p><p>2) The authors show in Figure 5G, H that Sufu KO causes reduced proliferation of NSCs in the dorsal but not ventral dentate gyrus at P3. However, in Figure 1C it appears as though most of the Shh-responsive cells are in the posterior/ventral dentate gyrus at P7, which is presumably true for P3 as well. Can the authors explain this discrepancy?</p><p>3) The authors show in Supplementary Figure 1 that Gli1 deletion has no effect on the number or proliferation of NSCs at P7 in the dentate gyrus and conclude that &quot;Gli1 is largely dispensable [for forebrain development]&quot;. If this is true, then can the authors comment on why they think that a Gli1-lacZ reporter line is a good reporter of the level of Shh signaling required for development of the dentate gyrus (Figure 1)? In light of the fact that Sufu KO unexpectedly decreases Gli1-lacZ reporter expression, is there another way to confirm that Sufu KO decreases Shh signaling in the developing dentate gyrus? Related to this, the interpretation of the data on the regulation and function of Gli genes in wildtype and Sufu KO mice in Figure 3G is somewhat confusing and need to be clarified (subsection “In the absence of Sufu, Gli1 function becomes responsible for proper proliferation of NSCs during DG development”).</p><p>4) Important for the interpretation of the data is the assumption that DG development is not affected until the first postnatal week. The authors show that total Sox2+ cell numbers are unchanged. However, this appears to be a rather superficial read out and should be expanded by other measures (e.g., estimates of total neuronal and glial populations). If <italic>Sufu</italic> deletion affects the formation of the DG, all effects could be at least be partially explained by secondary effects. Using a conditional Cre line to test later stages of <italic>Sufu</italic> deletion (e.g., early postnatal) would be one way to address this concern. Related to this, the study focuses on the proliferation and quiescence of NSCs, yet much of the analysis is done by quantifying Sox2+ cells, which include both NSCs and the larger population of IPCs. Shh/Sufu might regulate the proliferation of IPCs as well as NSCs and it is unclear how much the changes in cell proliferation observed in loss and gain of function mutants concern specifically NSCs. The authors should use a more specific NSC marker or reassess their conclusions.</p><p>5) In Figure 4, the authors analysed neurogenesis in the adult DG and found reduced numbers of radial glia-like NSCs and reduced rate of neuron production, however it is unclear whether NSC proliferation is altered (percentage of NSCs that are Ki67+) and whether the total number of DCX+ cells produced decreases in adult Sufu KO mice.</p><p>6) The authors overinterpret their data regarding the role of Sufu in regulation of Shh signaling and NSC quiescence. The last sentence of the Introduction states that &quot;Sufu (…) is important for ensuring (…) the timely transition to a quiescent state during DG development&quot;. However there is no evidence that Sufu is implicated in determining the timing of the transition to quiescence. The authors add at the beginning of the Discussion: &quot;Thus Sufu modulates the timing of quiescence of NSCs in DG development by controlling NSCs expansion via modulation of Shh signaling activity&quot;. Again the paper does not provide evidence that Sufu normally modulates Shh activity and regulates the timing of quiescence of NSCs. Changes in Shh signaling and in timing of NSC quiescence are observed in Sufu mutant mice but there is no evidence that entry of NSCs in quiescence at the end of the first postnatal week in wildtype mice involves a modulation of Sufu function (i.e. another regulator might be normally involved in downregulating Shh signaling at that time). Please modify these interpretations of the data.</p><p>7) Why did the authors choose to do their analysis at P7 in Figure 2 and 3? The data from experiments in Figure 4-6 indicate that P7 is a transitional stage in which there is likely a mix of &quot;developmental&quot; and &quot;adult-like&quot; NSCs. Therefore, after going through Figure 4-6, it is unclear if the interpretation of the data at P7 is due to the shift in entry to quiescence or reduced proliferation of adult NSCs. As a result, the data in Figure 2 and 3 seems difficult to interpret and a bit out of place in the manuscript.</p><p>8) Overall, the dual thymidine analog experiment is difficult to interpret, because proliferation levels are different between genotypes at P0, 3, and 7, and the proliferation rates at 8 weeks are not presented (see comment #6). For example, if proliferation in adult DG decreased in Sufu KO animals, then IdU in the dual thymidine analog experiment would label fewer cells in Sufu KO animals, which would confound the interpretation of this experiment; the decrease in CldU+ IdU+ cells at P3 and P7 time points could be due to the altered transition of NSCs into quiescence or it could be due to the reduced proliferation in the adult or both. It might be simpler to interpret the results if you focus on CldU+ cells alone and look at how many CldU+ RGLs are generated at each time point in this experiment. On a similar note, most CldU+ IdU+ cells counted in Figure 6D and 6H are DCX+ (Figure 6F and 6I), which means that these data might reflect levels of proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult rather than altered entry into quiescence at postnatal stage. Additionally, the greater CldU+ IdU+ signals at P3 could indicate greater proliferation before P3 or greater quiescence after P3, or both. The gradual entry of NSCs into quiescence could be looked at in a simpler and more convincing fashion by examining the proportion of dividing (Ki67+) Sox2+ NSCs in wildtype mice from P0 to P7.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42918.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors show that there is a large expansion of NSCs during normal development of the dentate gyrus between P0 to P7 (Figure 5A-D) and they claim that deletion of Sufu causes NSCs to precociously transition to a quiescent state (P0-3 instead of P3-7 normally), thus reducing the pool of quiescent NSCs in the adult (Figure 4F). However, Figure 2B clearly shows that there is no difference in the number of Sox2+ NSCs in the dentate gyrus of Sufu KO mice at P7. If the expansion of NSCs occurs from P0 to P7, then the decrease in NSC number should be apparent by P7. In agreement with this, the model presented in Figure 7 suggests that there are fewer NSCs (quiescent and dividing combined) in the Sufu KO at P3-7, but the data in Figure 2B clearly shows that there is no difference in the number of Sox2+ NSCs at P7. Along the same line, if there is an excessive proliferation of NSCs in SmoM2 mice (Figure 2G, H), why is their number unchanged at P7 (Figure 2F)? The authors should comment on these apparent contradictions and may need to amend their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewers’ concerns. We have considered which stage is appropriate to examine the result of <italic>Sufu</italic> deletion. According to the data in Figure 6 (CldU and IdU), P7 is still a transitional stage in which NSCs shift to a quiescent state from a developmental proliferative state. Therefore, Sox2+ cells in the SGZ of P7 DGs would contain both states of NSCs, and there are still some expanding NSCs in the SGZ of P7 DGs. Given that the transition and expansion of NSCs are not completed yet at P7, it is difficult to determine the overall effects on the NSC pool in the Sufu-KO mice at this stage. Figure 6 demonstrated that the transition to quiescent state concludes by P14. Therefore, we have checked the number of Sox2+ cells at P14 as well (Figure 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-E). In P14 DGs, we found that the number of Sox2+ cells was significantly reduced in the SGZ of Sufu KO mice. We included this new data in Figures 2, 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><p>We also appreciate the helpful comments about Figure 7. We agree that Figure 7 did not comport well the data in the original Figure 2 and 3. So, we have now modified Figure 7, in which Sufu-KO mice have equal amount of total NSCs (quiescent and dividing combined) and less number of dividing NSCs at P7, whereas the number of total NSCs are less at P14 and Adult.</p><p>We also understand the reviewers’ concerns about SmoM2 mice. We further analyzed the lack of major increases in the absolute number of Sox2+ NSCs in SmoM2 DG at P7. As shown in Figure 2, there is an increase in proliferating cells as labeled by Ki67 at this stage, in contrast to Sufu-KO mice. Simultaneously, we also found increased cell death as indicated by the expression of cleaved caspase 3+ cells in the DGs of SmoM2 mice at P7 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Thus, despite the drastic increase in proliferating NSCs, many of these cells do not survive and this leads to the comparable numbers of Sox2+ NSCs in control and SmoM2 DG. We have now added this information in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors show in Figure 5G, H that Sufu KO causes reduced proliferation of NSCs in the dorsal but not ventral dentate gyrus at P3. However, in Figure 1C it appears as though most of the Shh-responsive cells are in the posterior/ventral dentate gyrus at P7, which is presumably true for P3 as well. Can the authors explain this discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these comments because they point out the difficulty of visualizing the ventral DG in coronal sections. To help clarify specific DG regions, we have corrected the figures in this revised manuscript to include the areas we designated as posterior/ventral dentate gyrus (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Figure 1C of the original manuscript showed coronal sections, which unfortunately did not show images that included the ventral DG. We have now added images that include the entire DG and marked dorsal and ventral DG regions in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. In this figure we showed a higher number of Gli1-LacZ+ cells localized in the dorsal DG compared with the ventral DGs of Sufu<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup> mice. This supports our findings that there is a specific reduction in proliferating NSCs in the dorsal but not ventral DG.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors show in Supplementary Figure 1 that Gli1 deletion has no effect on the number or proliferation of NSCs at P7 in the dentate gyrus and conclude that &quot;Gli1 is largely dispensable [for forebrain development]&quot;. If this is true, then can the authors comment on why they think that a Gli1-lacZ reporter line is a good reporter of the level of Shh signaling required for development of the dentate gyrus (Figure 1)? In light of the fact that Sufu KO unexpectedly decreases Gli1-lacZ reporter expression, is there another way to confirm that Sufu KO decreases Shh signaling in the developing dentate gyrus? Related to this, the interpretation of the data on the regulation and function of Gli genes in wildtype and Sufu KO mice in Figure 3G is somewhat confusing and need to be clarified (subsection “In the absence of Sufu, Gli1 function becomes responsible for proper 275 proliferation of NSCs during DG development”).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for helpful comments about function of Gli1 and Gli1-lacZ mice. We realized that we didn’t adequately discuss Gli1 function in activating Shh signaling and also why the Gli1 promoter has been utilized to reliably detect Shh signaling activity. Gli1 functions to support Gli2 transcription activator function, but is compensated for extensively by Gli2 (Bai et al., 2002; Park et al., 2000). In the absence of Gli1, other Gli activators such as Gli2 are able to compensate and activate Shh signaling target gene expression (Park et al., 2000). Therefore, deletion of Gli1 alone does not cause developmental defects. Instead, it produces severe developmental defects when combined with reduced Gli2 expression (Bai et al., 2002; Park et al., 2000). Nevertheless, Gli1 is a reliable and direct transcriptional target of Gli2. Thus, Gli1 expression is strictly induced upon Shh stimulation (Bai et al., 2002; Lee et al., 1997), making Gli1-LacZ mice a useful readout for Shh signaling activity (Ahn and Joyner, 2005; Balordi and Fishell, 2007; Ihrie et al., 2011; Machold et al., 2003). We also confirmed by in situ hybridization thatexpression of <italic>Ptch1</italic>, a downstream target of Shh signaling, is detected where LacZ+ cells are localized in Gli1-LacZ mice in the developing DG (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> below). We have added further explanation of the Gli1 reporter mice and the relationship of Gli1 and Gli2 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>To further support our Gli1-LacZ findings and confirm that Shh signaling is reduced in Sufu-KO mice, we conducted qPCR to determine the expression levels of Shh signaling target genes. We tested the expression of Shh signaling target genes (<italic>Ptch1, N-Myc, CyclinD1 and Cxcr4</italic>) in P3 DGs. We found in Sufu-KO mice, significant reductions were observed in two Shh targets: <italic>CyclinD1</italic> and <italic>Cxcr4</italic> expression. On the other hand, in the Sufu-KO;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup> mice, significant reductions in the expression of <italic>Ptch1, N-Myc, CyclinD1</italic> and <italic>Cxcr4</italic> were observed (Figure 3—figure supplement 1H). Thus, the reduction in Gli1-LacZ activity in Sufu-KO;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup> simultaneously and accurately reflected a decrease in Shh signaling activity. We have now added new qPCR data in Figure 3G and Figure 3—figure supplement 2H of the revised manuscript.</p><p>In this study, although we could not address the exact mechanism, we believe that reduced expression of both Gli activators (Gli1 and Gli2) may partially explain the greater reductions of Shh signaling target genes expression and profound phenotypes in Sufu-KO;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup> mice. Indeed, it is demonstrated that reducing Gli2 level in Gli1 homozygous null mice (which develop normally), leads to multiple developmental defects and death soon after birth (Bai et al., 2002; Park et al., 2000). We have included this interpretation in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42918.032</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-42918-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Important for the interpretation of the data is the assumption that DG development is not affected until the first postnatal week. The authors show that total Sox2+ cell numbers are unchanged. However, this appears to be a rather superficial read out and should be expanded by other measures (e.g., estimates of total neuronal and glial populations). If Sufu deletion affects the formation of the DG, all effects could be at least be partially explained by secondary effects. Using a conditional Cre line to test later stages of Sufu deletion (e.g., early postnatal) would be one way to address this concern. Related to this, the study focuses on the proliferation and quiescence of NSCs, yet much of the analysis is done by quantifying Sox2+ cells, which include both NSCs and the larger population of IPCs. Shh/Sufu might regulate the proliferation of IPCs as well as NSCs and it is unclear how much the changes in cell proliferation observed in loss and gain of function mutants concern specifically NSCs. The authors should use a more specific NSC marker or reassess their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern that Sufu deletion by hGFAP-Cre may impair DG development before postnatal stages. In the revised manuscript, we show that there is no difference in the proliferation of NSCs at P0 (Figure 5E and Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and B). Therefore, we believe that prenatal DG development is not impaired by deletion of Sufu. We also have tested the effect of <italic>Sufu</italic> deletion temporally using Gli1<sup>CreER/+</sup> mice by specifically inducing Sufu deletion at E17.5 (Gli1<sup>CreER/+</sup>;Sufu-KO; Ai14). In this mouse, Cre recombination (indicated by expression of Ai14) is induced in NSCs in the ventral hippocampus, which later migrate to the DG and become adult NSCs as we showed in Figure 5. Thus, we believe that Sufu deletion is induced specifically in NSCs in this mouse model. This would minimize the secondary effects and potential developmental abnormalities at prenatal stages. We analyzed these mice at P7 and found that the number of Sox2+/Ai14+ cells and Sox2+/Ki67+/Ai14+cells were significantly reduced in Gli1<sup>CreER/+</sup>;Sufu<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Ai14 mice compared with Gli1<sup>CreER/+</sup>;Sufu<sup>fl/+</sup>;Ai14. These findings are consistent with the phenotypes observed in the hGFAP-Cre mice. We have now added these data to Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we investigated the effects of <italic>Sufu</italic> deletion on IPC production and proliferation in Sufu-KO mice. We found that the number of Tbr2+ IPCs was significantly reduced in Sufu-KO mice (Figure 3E, F and Figure 3—figure supplement 2D-G). Further assessments showed that the reduction in Tbr2+ cells in Sufu-KO mice is not due to impaired or reduced proliferation of IPCs since we found no differences in the Ki67+ proliferating cell population in Tbr2+ IPCs between control and Sufu-KO mice Figure 3—figure supplement 2F. These data suggest that deletion of <italic>Sufu</italic> does not affect the proliferation of IPC. Rather, our analyses show that deficits in IPC numbers were due to the failure of NSCs to generate this cell population. Thus, we believe that reduction of the proliferating cell population in Sox2+ in Sufu-KO mice reflects reduction of NSC proliferation. We have added these results in Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 4, the authors analysed neurogenesis in the adult DG and found reduced numbers of radial glia-like NSCs and reduced rate of neuron production, however it is unclear whether NSC proliferation is altered (percentage of NSCs that are Ki67+) and whether the total number of DCX+ cells produced decreases in adult Sufu KO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for helpful suggestions.

As the reviewers point out, there is no direct evidence that Sufu regulates the timing. Additionally, we have included in the Discussion other factors previously reported to play a role in regulating the production and timing of qNSCs in the DG. Whether or not Sufu functions in concert with these factors is not yet known and could be an interesting future direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Why did the authors choose to do their analysis at P7 in Figure 2 and 3?

P7 is not necessarily the optimal timing to test the effects of <italic>Sufu</italic> deletion since it is such a transitional time in dentate formation; to get a more full picture it would be helpful to examine a slightly more advanced stage.

At this time point, we found that Sox2+ cells were significantly reduced in the DGs of Sufu-KO mice. Thus, P14 is an appropriate time to detect any defects arising from impaired expansion of the NSC pool. We have added these P14 data in the revised manuscript (Figure 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Overall, the dual thymidine analog experiment is difficult to interpret, because proliferation levels are different between genotypes at P0, 3, and 7, and the proliferation rates at 8 weeks are not presented (see comment #6).
