Here, we reported that intermittent fasting promoted interleukin-22 (IL-22) production by type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor (IL-22R) attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells and macrophages. These results establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue, suggesting that ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Obesity refers to a condition where a person has excessive fat accumulation, which can have negative impacts on their health. Managing obesity has typically relied on reducing energy intake and increasing energy use through diets and exercise.</p><p>For example, intermittent fasting is a diet strategy involving periods of time in a day or week where a person does not eat any food. Research has shown that intermittent fasting may improve the metabolism and increase energy use by enhancing a process known as “beigeing” of white fat tissue.</p><p>In this process, white fat cells or their precursor cells differentiate into beige fat cells, which can consume excess energy by burning fat. Consequently, understanding how beigeing of white fat cells is activated in intermittent fasting may reveal a promising strategy for tackling obesity and metabolic diseases.</p><p>Immune cells found in the gut known as innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) may play a role in the metabolic benefits from intermittent fasting. However, the roles of ILCs are complex: some types of ILCs can promote obesity, while others show metabolic benefits through their release of proteins like IL-17 and IL-22, which can help the body to metabolise glucose.</p><p>To find out if these immune cells play a role in intermittent fasting, Chen, Sun et al. used diet-induced obese mice that had to fast every other day. Intermittent fasting was found to cause a form of ILCs (ILC3s) to release IL-22, which resulted in beigeing of white fat cells in obese mice. Single-cell sequencing techniques of gut immune cells further revealed that intermittent fasting increased forms of signalling in ILC3s and caused ILC3s to interact with other immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages.</p><p>The findings demonstrate how intermittent fasting causes beigeing of white adipose tissue through ILC3s, revealing mechanisms underpinning the metabolic benefits found from intermittent fasting. More research into this process may help identify new targets for treating obesity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>adipose tissue</kwd><kwd>adipocytes</kwd><kwd>immune</kwd><kwd>intestine</kwd><kwd>innate lymphoid cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81930015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Weizhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81730020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Weizhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82070592</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yin</surname><given-names>Yue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82270610</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yin</surname><given-names>Yue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK112755</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Weizhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01DK129360</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Weizhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Intermittent fasting affects intestinal immunity through new interactions between macrophages and ILC3s, increasing ILC3 secretion of IL-22 and thus promoting white adipose tissue beigeing, and improving metabolism.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity is defined as an epidemic metabolic disease characterized by excessive fat accumulation as the consequence of long-term energy surplus. Thus, therapeutic management of obesity has been focused on the restoration of energy balance, either by decreasing energy intake or by increasing energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Among these strategies, intermittent fasting is becoming a popular dietary approach. All intermittent fasting schemes including alternate day fasting, 5:2 intermittent fasting, and daily time-restricted feeding have shown the health benefits such as delaying aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mattison et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mattison et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ulgherait et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stekovic et al., 2019</xref>), improving metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Cabo and Mattson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hepler et al., 2022</xref>), and enhancing cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mattson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mattson and Arumugam, 2018</xref>). The mechanism underlying metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Its metabolic benefit was initially attributed to limitation of energy intake. Recent studies have indicated an alternative mechanism involving beigeing of white adipose tissue, which accounts for the major plasticity of energy expenditure. Studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2017</xref><italic>,</italic> have shown that intermittent fasting induces white adipose beigeing via stimulation of angiogenesis and macrophage M2 polarization. On the other hand, studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2017</xref>, have indicated that alternate day fasting induces white adipose tissue beigeing by shaping the gut microbiota and elevating the fermentation products acetate and lactate. Although gut microbiota is closely related to immune response, it remains unclear whether intestinal immune cells contribute to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting.</p><p>Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a group of natural immune cells lacking antigen-specific receptors expressed on T cells and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gasteiger et al., 2015</xref>). Based on developmental trajectories, ILCs are divided into five groups: natural killer cells, type 1 ILCs, type 2 ILCs, type 3 ILCs (ILC3s), and lymphoid tissue-inducing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vivier et al., 2018</xref>). Adipose-resident type 1 ILCs can promote adipose tissue fibrosis and obesity-associated insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">O’Sullivan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) while type 2 ILCs promote beiging of white adipose tissue and limit obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brestoff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2021b</xref>). However, the contribution of ILC3s on adipocytes and obesity are less clear. ILC3s can produce interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interleukin-22 (IL-22) in response to extracellular bacteria and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sanos et al., 2009</xref>). ILC3s-derived IL-22 can enhance the intestinal mucosal barrier function, reduce endotoxemia and inflammation, ameliorate insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hasnain et al., 2014</xref>), and improve the metabolic disorder of polycystic ovary syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Qi et al., 2019</xref>). However, ILC3s are also reported to be involved in the induction of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sasaki et al., 2019</xref>), contributing to the metabolic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sasaki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Upadhyay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kawano et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, the role of ILC3s in metabolic disease seems complex and the role of ILC3s in intermittent fasting and beigeing of adipose tissue is not known.</p><p>Here, we showed that alternate day fasting promoted the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s. Further, adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased thermogenesis in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. Exogenous IL-22 induced the beigeing of white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor attenuated the beigeing of white adipose tissue induced by intermittent fasting. Our study demonstrates that intestinal ILC3-IL-22-IL-22R axis is actively involved in the regulation of adipose tissue beigeing. Our findings thus reveal a novel pathway in the dialog between the gut and adipose tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intermittent fasting enhances IL-22 production by intestinal ILC3s</title><p>To explore the effect of intermittent fasting on intestinal immune cells, we applied alternate day fasting to mice fed normal chow diet (NCD-IF group) or high-fat diet (HFD-IF group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Consistently, plasma concentration of IL-22 detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results suggest that intermittent fasting increases levels of IL-22 in the intestine and plasma. Since ILC3s are the main source of IL-22 in the small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Seillet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Victor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gronke et al., 2019</xref>), we detected the proportion of ILC3s in the lamina propria of small intestine using flow cytometry. In mice fed NCD, intermittent fasting significantly increased proportion of IL-22 positive ILC3s in the small intestine lamina propria (siLP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), while demonstrating no effect on the percentile of total ILC3s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, intermittent fasting did not influence the secretion of IL-22 of T cells marked as lineage<sup>+</sup> Rorγt<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Besides, intermittent fasting didn’t alter the levels of ILC3s and IL-22 in mouse adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Similar to NCD mice, intermittent fasting significantly increased mRNA levels of IL-22 in the intestine of HFD mice while didn’t influence the secretion of IL-22 by T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). Furthermore, mice fed HFD showed an obvious reduction in the plasma IL-22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>) and percentage of total and IL-22 positive ILC3s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Further, the decrement of plasma IL-22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>) as well as IL-22 positive ILCs in intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>) was attenuated by 30 days’ intermittent fasting.</p><p>In order to explain the chronological relationship between ILC3s secreting IL-22 and beigeing of white adipose tissue, the mice were exposed to one cycle of intermittent fasting for 2 days. At this time, the body weight of mice didn’t change and beige adipocytes haven’t been induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>). However, significant increase in proportion of IL-22 positive ILC3s was induced by intermittent fasting for 2 days whereas total percentile of ILC3s remained unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). These results indicate that the beiging of white adipose tissue are subsequent to its effect on ILC3s secreting IL-22.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Intestinal ILC3s promote beigeing of white adipose tissue</title><p>Next, we examined whether adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s can increase beigeing of white adipose tissue in DIO mice.

Previous researches report that intestinal ILC3s specifically express gut homing receptors CCR7, CCR9, and α4β7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mackley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2021</xref>), which may explain transplantation of intestinal ILC3s can migrate mainly to the intestine instead of adipose tissue. Plasma concentration of IL-22 also increased significantly relevant to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Relevant to PBS control, adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s decreased body weight and weight of sWAT (subcutaneous white adipose tissue) slightly, while had no impact on food intake and the liver weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). In addition, ILC3s from CD45.1 mouse intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes were adoptively transferred into recipient mice, and CD45.1 positive immune cells were significantly increased in intestine but not in adipose tissue in mice transferred with ILC3s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), indicating the feasibility of ILC3s adoptive transfer. Notably, DIO mice transferred with intestinal ILC3s showed improved glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and decreased levels of random blood glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

This conclusion is supported by following observations. First, intermittent fasting stimulates the secretion of IL-22 by intestinal ILC3s in either lean mice fed NCD, obese mice fed HFD, or mice with metabolic dysfunction induced by HFCD diet. Second, a comprehensive set of in vivo and in vitro experiments shows that intermittent fasting promotes adipose tissue beigeing through the intestinal ILC3-IL-22-IL-22R axis.</p><p>The role of ILC3s in metabolism remains largely unknown. Our studies provide evidence supporting the metabolic benefit of intestinal ILC3s in intermittent fasting. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s isolated from lean mice was sufficient to improve the metabolic dysfunctions in DIO mice, including increase of white adipose tissue beigeing and glucose tolerance. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of ILC3s significantly increased their number only in intestine. Further, alternate day fasting did not alter the ILC3s in adipose tissue. These observations indicate that ILC3s in intestine rather than in adipose tissue account for the metabolic benefit. In addition to directly promoting the beigeing of white adipose tissue through IL-22, intestinal ILC3s may enhance the intestinal mucosal barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ibiza et al., 2016</xref>), reducing serum LPS and peptidoglycan, thus reducing the inhibitory effect of LPS and peptidoglycan on the beigeing of white adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">O’Sullivan et al., 2016</xref>, have reported that ILC3s are negligible in white adipose tissue of either lean or obese mice. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sasaki et al., 2019</xref>, have demonstrated that transplanting bone marrow cells from Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (lack of T cells, B cells) into Il2rg<sup>-/-</sup> Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (lack of T cells, B cells, ILC cells) could not increase the number of ILC3s in the adipose tissue of recipient mice. However, it is worth noting that ILC3s have been detected in adipose tissue by other report. Using the marker lineage<sup>-</sup>KLRG1<sup>-</sup>Il-7rα<sup>+</sup>Thy-1<sup>+</sup>, ILC3s cells have been reported to account for approximately 20% of lineage<sup>-</sup>KLRG1<sup>-</sup>Il-7rα<sup>+</sup> cells in adipose tissue. In our study, we also detected ILC3s defined as CD127<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>-</sup>RORγt<sup>+</sup> in adipose tissue. These ILC3s accounted for approximately 10% of CD127<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>-</sup> cells. ILC3s have also been shown to be present in human adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hildreth et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, the proportion and density of ILC3s in white adipose tissue of people with obesity increase relevant to healthy people, and positively correlate with BMI in obese patients. Thus, the existence and function of ILC3s in mouse and human adipose tissue deserve further investigation.</p><p>Communication between intestine and metabolic organs is currently under active investigation. Our studies identify ILC3s-IL-22-IL-22R as a novel pathway mediating the crosstalk between intestine and adipose tissue. Evidence supporting this conclusion are five folds. (1) Intermittent fasting reverses the reduction of intestinal ILC3s and IL-22 in DIO mice. (2) Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s enhances beigeing of white adipose tissue. (3) Co-culture of intestinal ILC3s with SVF cells increases their differentiation into beige cells. (4) Exogenous IL-22 mimics the effect of intermittent fasting on beigeing of white adipose tissue. (5) Deficiency of IL-22R blocks the IF-induced beigeing of white adipose tissue. In lines with our observation, a series of recent studies have suggested that cytokines can act directly on adipocytes to regulate thermogenesis. For example, γδ T cells regulate heat production by secreting IL-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hu et al., 2020</xref>). Deficiency of IL-10 increases energy consumption and renders mice resistant to DIO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). IL-27-IL-27Rα signaling promotes thermogenesis, prevents DIO, and improves insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2021a</xref>). IL-33 induces the beigeing of white adipose tissue by activating ILC2s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brestoff et al., 2015</xref>). Our studies extend the effect of cytokines on thermogenesis to IL-22. IL-22 promotes heat production, renders mice resistant to reduction of body temperature induced by cold exposure, and reduces obesity induced by HFD. Together with previous report showing that IL-22 increases the lipolysis of adipocytes, our studies suggest that IL-22 can directly act on adipocytes to alter the adipose tissue homeostasis. IL-22 activates IL-22 receptor, which then regulates the expression of downstream inflammatory factors, tissue repair molecules, chemokines, antimicrobial peptides, and other molecules via Jak-1- and Tyk-2-dependent phosphorylation of STAT3. Our studies suggest that IL-22 may promote the expression of downstream thermogenic genes in adipose tissue through IL-22R. Deficiency of IL-22R blocks the upregulation of thermogenic genes induced by intermittent fasting. SVF cells lacking IL-22R demonstrate no response to the upregulation of thermogenic genes induced by intestinal ILC3. Thus, our results provide novel evidence supporting the concept that intestinal ILC3s modulate beigeing of adipose tissue via IL-22-IL-22R pathway.</p><p>The physiological mechanism underlying the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s remains largely unknown. Our studies reveal the distinct secretion pattern of IL-22 induced by intermittent fasting. Consistently, previous studies have shown that secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s changes between active and quiescent periods throughout the day which is regulated by the cycle patterns of food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brooks et al., 2021</xref>). These suggest that secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s is altered by feeding rhythm. It is currently unclear how feeding influences the physiological function of ILC3s. Previous studies indicate a mechanism involving neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which is able to stimulate the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Seillet et al., 2020</xref>). Consistently, our single-cell RNA-seq data also showed that VIPR2 is highly expressed in intestinal ILC3s and intermittent fasting activates VIPR2 signaling pathway. Since release of VIP is stimulated by food intake, these observations indicate that VIP-VIPR signaling may coordinate with food intake to drive the production of IL-22. However, conflicting result exists. Studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Talbot et al., 2020</xref> have shown that VIP inhibits ILC3 secretion of IL-22. Reasons accounting for this difference remains unknown but may be context dependent. Alternatively, we found that intermittent fasting may promote ILC3s secreting IL-22 though activating AhR signaling. In addition, feeding may decrease the levels of antimicrobial peptides secreted by epithelial cells, while increasing the expression of lipid-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Talbot et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, segmented filamentous bacteria may account for the effect of feeding on the secretion of IL-22 by intestinal ILC3s by periodically attaching to the epithelial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brooks et al., 2021</xref>). These alterations may substantially influence the immune networks in intestine, leading to subsequent change in the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s. In support of this concept, our single-cell RNA-seq analysis shows a significant change in the intestinal immune cell network involving DCs, macrophages, and ILC3s. Further examination should focus on dissecting the novel molecular mechanism by which intestinal DCs and macrophages interact with ILC3s and its consequence on the IL-22 production.</p><p>In conclusion, our studies suggest that intermittent fasting can promote the secretion of IL-22 by intestinal ILC3s. IL-22 promotes beigeing of white adipose tissue through IL-22R. Intestinal ILC3s thus may serve as a potential target for the intervention of metabolic disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

By employing complementary mouse models, the authors provided compelling evidence to support a mechanism through ILC3/IL-22/IL22R pathway. They further performed comprehensive single-cell sequencing analyses of intestinal immune cells from lean, obese, obese undergone intermittent fasting mice and revealed altered interactome in intestinal myeloid cells and ILC3s by intermittent fasting via activating AhR. Overall, this is a very interesting and timely study uncovering a novel connection between intestine and adipose tissue in the context of executing metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting.</p><p>(1) The authors showed increased plasma IL-22 and its expression in intestine. Are intestinal ILC3s the main source of plasma IL-22?</p><p>(2) The authors transplanted intestinal ILC3s from NCD mice to DIO mice and showed significant metabolic improvements. However, in Fig. 1, intermittent fasting increased IL-22-positive ILC3s proportion rather than changing the total number. Please clarify whether this transplantation is due to increasing ILC3s number or introducing more IL-22 positive ILC3s (which are decreased in DIO). Are these transplanted ILC3s by default homing to intestine rather than to other tissues?</p><p>(3) The authors adopted cold challenge at 4 degree for 6 hours to assess beiging in subcutaneous WAT and showed difference in core temperature. However, thermogenesis in this acute cold challenge is mainly by brown adipose tissue. Beiging is a chronic and adaptive response. Based on the data in WAT, there is a beiging phenotype, but the core body temperature in acute cold challenge is not an accurate readout. It would be a missed opportunity by not evaluating thermogenic activity in BAT.</p><p>More browning genes should be included to strengthen the beiging phenotype of WAT. Moreover, inflammation in WAT can be examined to provide a whole picture of adipose tissue remodeling through this pathway.</p><p>(4) For the SVF beige adipocyte differentiation, 100 ng/mL IL-22 was used.

Please be aware that these increases are likely due to boosted adipogenesis as told by the morphology. Please examine more adipogenic markers to confirm. Is this higher adipogenesis caused by the high concentration of IL-22?</p><p>In line 201, the authors drew the conclusion that IL-22 increased SVF beige differentiation. To fully support this conclusion, the authors should assure adipogenesis at the same baseline and then compare beiging, or examine the effect of IL-22 on normal adipogenesis to compare with beige differentiation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91060.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This study aims to investigate the mediatory role of intestinal ILC3-derived IL-22 in intermittent fasting-elicited metabolic benefits.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The observation of induction of IL-22 production by intestinal ILC3 is significant, and the scRNAseq provides new information into intestine-resident immune cell profiling in response to repeated fasting and refeeding.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The experimental design for some studies needs to be improved to enhance the rigor of overall study.

The browning effect induced by IF may involve constitutive activation of lipolysis, which was not considered.</p><p>Majority of weaknesses have been addressed in the revision. Based on the analysis of thermogenic genes in addition to Ucp1 (Fig. 4D and S6F), the alteration on thermogenesis induced by IL-22 is dependent on UCP1 but not other markers such as PGC1a, PPARg, and Cidea.

They demonstrate that intermittent fasting causes increased IL22+ILC3 in small intestines of mice. Adoptive transfer of purified intestinal ILC3 or administration of exogenous IL-22 can lead to increases in UCP1 gene expression and energy expenditure as well as improved glucose metabolism. Importantly, the above metabolic benefits caused by intermittent fasting are abolished in IL-22R-/- mice. Using an in vitro experiment, the authors show that ILC3-derived IL-22 may directly act on adipocytes to promote SVF beige differentiation. Finally, by performing sc-RNA-seq analysis of intestinal immune cells from mice with different treatments, the authors indicate a possible way of intestinal ILC3 being activated by intermittent fasting. Overall, this study provides a new mechanistic explanation for the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting and reveals the role of intestinal ILC3 in the enhancement of the whole-body energy expenditure and glucose metabolism likely via IL-22-induced beige adipogenesis.</p><p>Although this study presents some interesting findings, particularly IL-22 derived from intestinal ILC3 could induce beiging of WAT by directly acting on adipocytes, the experimental data are not sufficient to support the key claims in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91060.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Hong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Lijun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Peking</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Xue</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yunhua Zhang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhai</surname><given-names>Wenbo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zehe</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mulholland</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Michigan</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Weizhen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Peking</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yin</surname><given-names>Yue</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Peking</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 1: The authors showed increased plasma IL-22 and its expression in the intestine. Are intestinal ILC3s the main source of plasma IL-22?</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: ILC3s are the main source of IL-22 as reported previously (PMID: 30700914). In the small intestine, ILC3s account for about 62% of IL22+ cells. Other IL22+ cells include γδ T, Foxp3+T and CD4+T cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2: The authors transplanted intestinal ILC3s from NCD mice to DIO mice and showed significant metabolic improvements. However, in Fig. 1, intermittent fasting increased IL-22positive ILC3s proportion rather than changing the total number. Please clarify whether this transplantation is due to increasing ILC3s number or introducing more IL-22 positive ILC3s (which are decreased in DIO). Are these transplanted ILC3s by default homing to the intestine rather than to other tissues?</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We believe that the transplantation increases ILC3s number, leading to the increment in IL22 levels. The transplanted ILC3s by default are homing to the intestine rather than to other tissues because ILC3s express several homing receptors such as CCR7, CCR9, and α4β7, which modulate their capacity to migrate to the gut (PMID: 26141583; PMID: 26708278; PMID: 25575242; PMID: 34625492). Our observation that ILC3s in adipose tissue remained unchanged by ILC3 cell transplantation (Supplementary Figure 5F) also supports this concept.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3: Thermogenesis in this acute cold challenge is mainly by brown adipose tissue. Beiging is a chronic and adaptive response. Based on the data in WAT, there is a beiging phenotype, but the core body temperature in acute cold challenge is not an accurate readout. It would be a missed opportunity by not evaluating thermogenic activity in BAT. More browning genes should be included to strengthen the beiging phenotype of WAT. Moreover, inflammation in WAT can be examined to provide a whole picture of adipose tissue remodeling through this pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Per suggestion, we performed additional experiments to measure levels of inflammation genes such as Il4, Il1b, Il6, Il22, Il23, Il17a. As shown in supplemental figure 2D, these inflammation relevant genes were not altered.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4: For the SVF beige adipocyte differentiation, 100 ng/mL IL-22 was used. This is highly above the physiological concentration at ~5 pg/mL. Please justify this high concentration used.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We agree with the reviewer that the dose of IL-22 used is high. However, the efficient dose at 100 ng/ml used in our studies is consistent with the literatures. Previous reports have shown that IL-22 directly activates Stat3 in adipose tissue and primary adipocytes, and promotes the expression of genes involved in triglyceride lipolysis (Lipe and Pnpla2) and fatty-acid β-oxidation (Acox1) at the dose of 100 ng/ml (Wang X, Ota N, et al. Nature. 2014). Consistently, other studies have reported that IL-22 at 100 ng/ml significantly reversed the enhanced expression of CCL2, CCL20 and IL1B mRNAs in granulosa cells in vitro (Qi X, et al. Nat Med. 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5: The authors showed increased Ucp1 and Cidea expression by IL-22 treatment in SVFs.

There is a lack of direct evidence showing that the metabolically beneficial effects of IF are mediated by intestinal ILC3 and their derived IL-22.

Because we cannot find a similar immune cell without any effect on adipocytes, we designed this experiment based on other studies in which saline or PBS are used as ILC transfer experiment controls (Sasaki T, et al.

They demonstrate that intermittent fasting causes increased IL22+ILC3 in small intestines of mice. Adoptive transfer of purified intestinal ILC3 or administration of exogenous IL-22 can lead to increases in UCP1 gene expression and energy expenditure as well as improved glucose metabolism. Importantly, the above metabolic benefits caused by intermittent fasting are abolished in IL-22R-/- mice. Using an in vitro experiment, the authors show that ILC3derived IL-22 may directly act on adipocytes to promote SVF beige differentiation. Finally, by performing sc-RNA-seq analysis of intestinal immune cells from mice with different treatments, the authors indicate a possible way of intestinal ILC3 being activated by intermittent fasting. Overall, this study provides a new mechanistic explanation for the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting and reveals the role of intestinal ILC3 in the enhancement of the whole-body energy expenditure and glucose metabolism likely via IL-22-induced beige adipogenesis.</p><p>Although this study presents some interesting findings, particularly IL-22 derived from intestinal ILC3 could induce beiging of WAT by directly acting on adipocytes, the experimental data are not sufficient to support the key claims in the manuscript.</p><p>Comment 1: Only increased UCP1 expression on mRNA level is not enough to support the beiging of WAT. More methods such as western blotting and immunostaining of UCP1 in WAT are needed to confirm the enhanced beige adipogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Additional experiments have been performed to measure the UCP1 protein by Western blot. The data is included in Figure 4I and Supplementary Figure 2E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2: IL-22 is known to modulate metabolic pathways via multiple downstream functions. The use of whole-body knockout of IL-22R could not exclude the indirect effect on the promotion of beiging of WAT. Specific deletion of IL-22R in adipose tissues is therefore needed to confirm the direct effect of IL-22 on adipocytes which is suggested by the in vitro study.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We agreed with the reviewer that specific deletion of IL-22R in adipose tissues is critical to confirm the direct effect of IL-22 on adipocytes. We will generate the AdioQ-IL-22R-/- mice to test this concept further in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3: The authors failed to show the cellular distribution of IL-22R in adipose tissues. This is important because the mechanism that explains the increased beige adipogenesis could be different based on the expression of IL-22R in adipose progenitor cells or mature adipocytes. So it is not appropriate to conclude that &quot;IL-22 then directly activates IL-22R on adipocytes, leading to subsequent induction of beiging of white adipose tissue&quot; in line 407. Additionally, Oil red O staining is needed for Fig 4G and Fig 5J, and protein levels of UCP1 and adipogenesis-related markers are needed to evaluate beige fat differentiation and the whole adipogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Per suggestion, we have added the expression of IL-22R in adipose progenitor cells or mature adipocytes (Supplementary Figure 6E). In addition, protein levels of UCP1 and adipogenesis-related markers to evaluate the whole adipogenesis (Figure 4I, Supplementary figure 6F) are now included. We have also addressed this issue in lines 207-215, page 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4: Although the authors provided some hypothesis about how intermittent fasting increases IL-22+ILC3 in small intestines by sc-RNA-seq analysis, some functional assays are needed to identify the factors, for example, how about the levels of macrophage-derived IL-23 or AHR ligands in small intestines and whether they contribute to increased percentages of intestinal IL-22+ILC3 following intermittent fasting.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We used flow cytometry sorting of macrophages combined with qPCR experiments to preliminarily demonstrate that intermittent fasting increases the expression of molecules such as Cd44 and CCl4 (Supplementary Figure 10B), which may contribute to the increase in the proportion of IL-22+ ILC3s in the intestine under intermittent fasting. Our observation that IL-23 mRNA levels were not changed indicates that this molecule may not the major contributor for the communication between macrophage and ILC3s. Other potential molecules such as AHR ligands remain to be explored.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5: What are the differences between adipose ILC3 and intestinal ILC3? Why do transferred ILC3 only migrate to the small intestine but not WAT of recipient mice? It would be better to examine or at least discuss whether other factors from intestinal ILC3 may also contribute to beiging of WAT following intermittent fasting.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Intestinal ILC3s specifically express gut homing receptors CCR7, CCR9, and α4β7 (PMID: 26141583; PMID: 26708278; PMID: 25575242; PMID: 34625492). This may explain transplantation of intestinal ILC3s can migrate mainly to the intestine instead of adipose tissue (PMID: 34625492). The proportion of ILC3s in adipose tissue of mice is very small. Their functions have not been clarified yet. We have addressed this issue in lines 156-158, page 8.</p><p>There are some other factors from intestinal ILC3 which may also contribute to beiging of WAT following intermittent fasting. By secreting IL-22, ILC3 enhanced the intestinal mucosal barrier, leading to reduction of the influx of LPS and PGN into the bloodstream under high-fat diet conditions, and subsequent increase in the beiging of white adipose tissue (Chen H, et al. Acta Pharm Sin B. 2022). We have addressed this potential mechanism in lines 344-347, page 16.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 6: The sensitivity of the IL-22 ELISA kit used in the manuscript was 8.2 pg/mL, according to the information from the methods, however, in Fig. 1J and Fig. 2B, the IL-22 levels in mouse plasma were lower than 6 pg/mL, which was below the sensitivity of the ELISA kit and also the assay range.
