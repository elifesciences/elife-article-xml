In particular, the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of nucleobases are readily modified by alkylating agents. RNA is more susceptible to chemical insults than DNA, in part due to its exposed Watson-Crick (WC) hydrogen-bonding interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hofer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wyatt and Pittman, 2006</xref>). Notably, the integrity of the WC face is paramount during codon recognition of the tRNA selection process, during which the three nucleotides of the codon base pair with those of the anticodon of the tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zaher and Green, 2009a</xref>). Changes that disrupt the ability of the mRNA to properly base pair with the cognate tRNA are then highly likely to reduce translational speed and fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Simms et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hudson and Zaher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thomas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoernes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoernes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">You et al., 2017</xref>). To this end, several alkylative damage adducts have either been predicted or shown to be detrimental to the decoding process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hudson and Zaher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoernes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">You et al., 2017</xref>). For example, our group has previously shown that O6-methylguanosine (m<sup>6</sup>G), which is highly mutagenic during DNA replication, interferes with the speed and accuracy of decoding when present in mRNA. Interestingly, the effect of m<sup>6</sup>G on translation was found to depend on its position within the codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hudson and Zaher, 2015</xref>). These observations suggest that given the nature of the decoding process, during which three nucleotides are read simultaneously, modifications to the mRNA can have complex effects on tRNA selection that cannot be solely predicted by their effect on base pairing.</p><p>N1-methyladenosine (m<sup>1</sup>A) is an interesting modification because it has been the focus of several recent studies as a potential regulatory modification on mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang and Jia, 2018</xref>). However, a functional role for m<sup>1</sup>A in RNA metabolism is not without controversy. Depending on the m<sup>1</sup>A-seq technique used, m<sup>1</sup>A has been found on as much as 20% of the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dominissini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016</xref>), and as low as nine sites only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Safra et al., 2017</xref>). Still, regardless of the method used to map the modification, over half of the identified m<sup>1</sup>A adducts have been mapped to the coding region of transcripts, suggesting that modification is likely to affect ribosome function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dominissini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, a specific regulatory role of this modification during translation has not been convincingly identified. On the contrary, studies generally support the hypothesis that m<sup>1</sup>A exists primarily as a damage adduct that disrupts the decoding process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">You et al., 2017</xref>). This idea is supported by studies conducted using <italic>E. coli</italic> translation extracts, for which the presence of m<sup>1</sup>A at any of the three positions within the codon significantly decreased protein-synthesis yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">You et al., 2017</xref>). This effect on translation is not unexpected, considering the structure of m<sup>1</sup>A; the addition of the methyl group to the N1 atom changes the hydrogen-bond donation and acceptance of the nucleobase. Furthermore, the modification introduces a resonance structure with a positive charge to the nucleobase. Consistent with these ideas, the presence of m<sup>1</sup>A has been shown to cause local duplex melting in RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>), and hence would likely occur during codon recognition of tRNA selection.</p><p>No known methyltransferase that specifically adds m<sup>1</sup>A to mRNA has been identified. Instead, m<sup>1</sup>A and several other adducts have been hypothesized to primarily result from reactions between RNA and endogenous and exogenous chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yan and Zaher, 2019a</xref>). In yeast, for example, the addition of alkylating compounds was found to significantly increase the levels of m<sup>1</sup>A within mRNA, among several other adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yan et al., 2019b</xref>). Interestingly, these compounds were also observed to activate eukaryotic-quality-control pathways known to be responsible for ribosome rescue, suggesting that alkylation stress causes ribosome stalling presumably due to its damaging effect on mRNA. These quality-control processes include the mRNA-surveillance pathway of no-go decay (NGD) and ribosome-quality-control (RQC) pathway responsible for the degradation of the associated incomplete nascent peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simms et al., 2017a</xref>). Briefly, in eukaryotes, ribosome stalling results in ribosome pileup and eventual collisions. Collided ribosomes are recognized by an E3 ligase (Hel2 in yeast and ZNF598 in mammals), which adds K63-linked ubiquitin chains to ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsuo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simms et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yan and Zaher, 2019c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikeuchi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Juszkiewicz and Hegde, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Juszkiewicz et al., 2018</xref>). The ubiquitination is used as a signal to recruit downstream factors involved in mRNA degradation and ribosome splitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsuo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikeuchi et al., 2019</xref>). The dissociated large-ribosome subunit, still bound to the peptidyl tRNA, is recognized by another E3 ligase (Ltn1 in yeast and listerin in mammals), which adds K48-linked ubiquitin to the nascent peptide, acting as a signal for its degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DefenouillÃ¨re et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lyumkis et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Bacteria appear to have evolved entirely distinct mechanisms to deal with stalled ribosomes. This distinction between the two domains of life has been hypothesized to be the result of the divergent mechanisms utilized to terminate protein synthesis and recycle the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simms et al., 2017a</xref>). In bacteria, at least four discrete rescue mechanisms have been identified. These include <italic>trans</italic> translation by the tmRNA as well as several other mechanisms that recruit alternative rescue factors (Arf proteins), which alone or in complex with release factors terminate protein synthesis in the absence of stop codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gagnon et al., 2012</xref>). Of these, the tmRNA system appears to be the most widely utilized and conserved rescue pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keiler, 2015</xref>). tmRNA or <underline>t</underline>ransfer-<underline>m</underline>essenger <underline>RNA</underline> is a unique molecule in that it contains a transfer RNA segment, which is aminoacylated by Ala-tRNA synthetase; and a messenger mRNA segment, which is used to switch the mRNA template from the defective mRNA to the molecule itself, and hence the name <italic>trans</italic> translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keiler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moore and Sauer, 2007</xref>). Upon ribosome stalling, tmRNA binds the A site of the ribosome in a quaternary complex with elongation factor Tu (EFTu), its partner protein SmpB and GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Valle et al., 2003</xref>). Following peptidyl transfer to tmRNA, the original defective mRNA exits the ribosome, which then begins <italic>trans</italic> translation whereby the ribosome switches template to the mRNA part of tmRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moore and Sauer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gottesman et al., 1998</xref>). This mRNA encodes a peptide-degradation signal followed by a stop codon, ensuring that the incomplete peptide is degraded by the ClpXP protease system following canonical termination and recycling of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keiler and Sauer, 1996</xref>).</p><p>We note that the tmRNA system has been extensively studied in the context of truncated mRNAs, which result from a myriad of conditions including ribosome stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moore and Sauer, 2007</xref>), but whether the process is also activated in response to chemical insults that modify RNA is unknown. Here we explored the impact of alkylation damage on translation and investigated its effect on tmRNA activity in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We first demonstrated that treating <italic>E. coli</italic> with common alkylating agents increases the levels of several potentially disruptive alkylative adducts, including m<sup>1</sup>A. To quantify the effect of m<sup>1</sup>A on decoding, we used a well-defined in vitro translation system to measure observed rates of peptideÂ bond formation in the absence and presence of the modification in mRNA. The modification reduced the rate of peptideÂ bond formation by almost three orders of magnitude. The decrease in peptideÂ bond formation was also accompanied by a reduction in the endpoint of the peptidyl-transfer reaction, suggesting that the modification affects the proofreading phase of tRNA selection. Highlighting the disruptive effect of m<sup>1</sup>A on tRNA selection was the observation that aminoglycosides, which increase peptideÂ bond formation on mismatched-codon-anticodon interactions, had no effect on reactions with m<sup>1</sup>A-programmed mRNAs. These findings suggest that alkylation stress, which increases the levels of disruptive adducts such as m<sup>1</sup>A, causes widespread stalling in bacterial cells and activates rescue pathways. In complete agreement with these ideas, we documented robust activation of tmRNA in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells treated with alkylating agents, even when transcription was inhibited. Interestingly, DNA damage was also found to trigger tmRNA activation, but this activation was significantly suppressed when transcription was inhibited. Hence, alkylation stress is likely to significantly impact translation through its effect on mRNA and rescue pathways such as <italic>trans</italic> translation are responsible for dealing with its consequences. Consistent with these proposals, <italic>E. coli</italic> strains lacking functional tmRNA were found to be sensitive to alkylating agents and exhibited delayed recovery compared to wild-type (WT) cells. Collectively our data suggest chemical damage to mRNA is highly detrimental to cellular homeostasis, even in organisms where mRNA is highly transient.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Treatment of <italic>E. coli</italic> with MMS or MNNG causes significant increases in alkylative damage of RNA</title><p>As an initial step to explore the impact of alkylative damage on translation in bacteria, we sought to establish methods that allowed us to robustly induce RNA alkylation in <italic>E. coli.</italic> We have recently shown that theÂ addition of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) to growing yeast cultures leads to theÂ accumulation of alkylation adducts in RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yan et al., 2019b</xref>). As a result, we expected the compound to similarly modify RNA in bacteria. To ensure that any effect we observe on translation is a general response to RNA alkylation, we also chose to study the impact of methylnitronitrosoguanidine (MNNG) on RNA metabolism and translation. MMS and MNNG work through different nucleophilic-substitution mechanisms to alkylate nucleic acids. MMS alkylates its target through an SN<sub>2</sub>-type mechanism, while MNNG reacts through an SN<sub>1</sub>-type one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wyatt and Pittman, 2006</xref>); therefore, we expected to observe differences in the types and levels of adduct that each agent generated. To identify and determine the abundance of each modification, total RNA was isolated from mid-log growing <italic>E. coli</italic> cells that had been mock treated (DMSO) or treated with MMS (0.1%) or MNNG (5 Î¼g/mL) for 20 min. RNA was consequently digested to nucleotide monophosphates by incubating it with P1 nuclease. Nucleosides were generated by incubating the P1-reaction products with calf-intestinal phosphatase (CIP); and analyzed by liquid chromatography â mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We generated standard curves for each of the unmodified nucleosides, as well as for N1-methyladenosine (m<sup>1</sup>A), N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A), N1-methylguanosine (m<sup>1</sup>G), O6-methylguanosine (m<sup>6</sup>G), and N3-methylcytidine (m<sup>3</sup>C) in order to directly quantify the modified nucleosides within each treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To confirm whether our LC-MS methods are relatively accurate, we measured the ratio of m<sup>6</sup>A/A levels in untreated cells, which has been estimated to be 0.3% in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al., 2015</xref>). In agreement with these earlier studies, we measure a ratio of 0.6% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Also as expected, we did not detect an increase in m<sup>6</sup>A levels after treatment with either alkylating agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as neither MMS nor MNNG alkylate the N6 position of adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wyatt and Pittman, 2006</xref>). Additionally, MMS and MNNG have been shown to react with N1 of G, albeit it with reduced efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wyatt and Pittman, 2006</xref>); but we did not observe significant increases in m<sup>1</sup>G levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These observations can be rationalized by the fact that m<sup>1</sup>G is a natural modification of <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA and rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Machnicka et al., 2013</xref>), which significantly increases the background levels of the modification. Indeed, the base level of m<sup>1</sup>G is at least 200-fold higher than that of m<sup>1</sup>A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Similarly, since m<sup>7</sup>G is a natural modification in rRNA and tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Machnicka et al., 2013</xref>), we observe no significant change to its levels upon MMS and MNNG additions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Treatment of <italic>E.Â coli</italic> with MMS and MNNG results in significant accumulation of alkylative-damage adducts in RNA.</title><p>(<bold>AâE</bold>) Bar graphs showing the amount of the indicated modified nucleotides relative to their unmodified parent in untreated (white bars), MMS-treated (black bars), and MNNG-treated (gray bars) cells.

In particular, we focused on modifications whose levels significantly increase in the presence of alkylation stress and have been documented to disrupt theÂ base-pairing properties of the nucleobase.

Since m<sup>3</sup>C phosphoramidite was not commercially available, we opted to study the effects of m<sup>1</sup>A on translation in our system.

The resulting dipeptide was resolved from unreacted fMet using an electrophoretic thin-layer chromatography (TLC) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Youngman et al., 2004</xref>). The relative amount of dipeptide was quantified using phosphorimaging and fitted to a single-exponential to determine the observed rate of peptideÂ bond formation. As expected, m<sup>1</sup>A was found to severely inhibit peptideÂ bond formation. The observed rate of 0.15 s<sup>â1</sup> for the G<sup>m1</sup>AA complex was measured to be more than 250-fold slower relative to the observed rate of 58 s<sup>â1</sup> for the unmodified GAA complex. Furthermore, the endpoint of the m<sup>1</sup>A reaction, which reports on the efficiency of proofreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pape et al., 1999</xref>), was found to beÂ ~tenfold lower relative to the unmodified one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results demonstrate that m<sup>1</sup>A is highly detrimental to the tRNA selection process and is highly likely to stall ribosomes in vivo.</p><p>Next, we wondered whether the m<sup>1</sup>A:U base pair between the codon and the anticodon of the tRNA is recognized by the ribosome as a simple mismatch or is more disruptive than that. During tRNA selection, aa-tRNAs that have only one mismatch between their anticodon and the A-site codon are termed near-cognate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gromadski and Rodnina, 2004a</xref>). Although the ribosome efficiently discriminates against theÂ incorporation of near-cognate aa-tRNAs, the addition of certain aminoglycosides alters the selection process and allows for their misincorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pape et al., 2000</xref>). For instance, paromomycin binds the decoding center of the ribosome, which leads to local conformational changes that lower the energy barrier required to shift the ribosome into a âclosedâ conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fourmy et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ogle et al., 2002</xref>). This conformation typically occurs in the presence of cognate aa-tRNAs and is a prerequisite for their accommodation into the active site of the ribosome for peptidyl transfer to take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ogle et al., 2002</xref>). By contrast, theÂ addition of aminoglycosides to reactions containing non-cognate aa-tRNAs, which harbor more than one mismatch between their anticodon and the A-site codon, has little to no effect on peptideÂ bond formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pape et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gromadski and Rodnina, 2004b</xref>). As a result, the effect of aminoglycosides on peptidyl transfer can be used as a diagnostic for the sort of interactions taking place in the decoding center and how modifications alter them. For instance, we recently showed that theÂ addition of paromomycin and streptomycin de-represses the effects of the oxidative adduct 8-oxoguanosine (8-oxoG) on peptideÂ bond formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thomas et al., 2019</xref>). These findings suggest that the ribosome recognizes this modification as a simple mismatch when paired with its partner nucleotide. Interestingly and in contrast to 8-oxoG, in the presence of m<sup>1</sup>A, we found the addition of paromomycin to have little to no effect on the observed rate of peptideÂ bond formation. In particular, we measured observed rates of 0.15 s<sup>â1</sup> and 0.2 s<sup>â1</sup> in the absence and presence of anÂ antibiotic, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Additionally, the endpoints of the very same reactions were 0.10 and 0.11, respectively. These findings suggest that not only is m<sup>1</sup>A unable to base pair with U in the decoding center but that the modification significantly distorts the codon-anticodon helix. This distortion results in the aa-tRNA, that is otherwise cognate, to be recognized as a non-cognate one by the ribosome.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Paromomycin does not rescue the effect of m<sup>1</sup>A on peptideÂ bond formation.</title><p>Representative time-courses of peptideÂ bond-formation reactions between initiation complexes programmed with m<sup>1</sup>A mRNA and Glu-tRNA<sup>GluÂ </sup>ternary complexes in the absence (blue) and presence (red) of paromomycin.</p><p> <supplementary-material id="fig3sdata1"><label>Figure 3âsource data 1.</label><caption><title>Paromomycin kinetics source data.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-61984-fig3-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material> </p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61984-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>To provide further insights into how an m<sup>1</sup>A modification within the codon changes the base-pairing properties of the nucleotide, we investigated how it alters miscoding in the presence of all near- and non-cognate tRNAs.

As a result, we predicted the addition of these compounds to stall translation in vivo and to activate rescue pathways such as <italic>trans</italic> translation by tmRNA.

In particular, substituting the sequence for one that encodes a His-tag has been successfully used to identify tmRNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roche and Sauer, 2001</xref>). We took advantage of this tmRNA variant to assess its relative activity in response to alkylation stress by probing with theÂ anti-His antibody.

Indeed, previous reports have shown the deletion of Î<italic>clpP</italic>, <italic>clpX</italic>, and <italic>lon</italic> genes to result in increased accumulation of His-tagged products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moore and Sauer, 2005</xref>). These observations suggest that the amount of His-tagging that we detect in the presence of MMS and MNNG is likely an underestimate of the tmRNA-activation levels. To obtain a more accurate measure of <italic>trans</italic> translation in response to alkylation stress, we treated <italic>E. coli</italic> null mutants of <italic>clpP</italic>, <italic>clpX</italic>, and <italic>lon</italic> with MMS and MNNG. As expected, the levels of His-tagging triggered by theÂ addition of alkylation compounds increased by more than twofold in the absence of these proteases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In agreement with previous studies that suggested Ada isÂ subject to proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sedgwick, 1989</xref>), in <italic>clpP</italic>, <italic>clpX</italic>, and <italic>lon</italic> cells, the factor was observed to accumulate even in the absence of alkylation stress.</p><p>As has been noted in a previous study, the His-tagging patterns between each of the samples appear almost identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moore and Sauer, 2005</xref>). This was a surprising observation, as we expected the alkylative damage to be randomly located throughout the transcriptome, thereby resulting in a more uniform streak of his-tagging or banding patterns that varied from sample to sample. A plausible explanation for this banding pattern is that the antibody we used displays aÂ preference for certain peptide sequences. We tested this idea by probing with antibodies from three different manufacturers and compared the observed pattern. Interestingly, each antibody displayed a unique pattern, with some recognizing only a small subset of potential peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, the observed consistent His-tagging pattern is likely due to an artifact of the His antibodies rather than a particular subset of proteins that are preferentially His-tagged at certain locations.</p><p>The accumulation of His-tagged peptide products suggests that alkylative damage of RNA is stalling ribosomes in vivo and activating tmRNA. However, the alkylative damage from MMS and MNNG damages DNA as well as RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wyatt and Pittman, 2006</xref>). This is supported by the increase in RecA that we observe upon treatment with alkylating agents, which is a protein that is essential for the maintenance and repair of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cox, 1991</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Therefore, it is also possible that the resulting increase in His-tagging was primarily due to the production of truncated transcripts that are produced by stalled RNA polymerase on damaged DNA. As most of these truncated transcripts lack a stop codon, they represent the classical targets of tmRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moore and Sauer, 2007</xref>). To ensure that the observed His-tagging was due to RNA damage rather than truncated RNA produced from damaged DNA, we pre-treated cells with rifampicin approximately 40 s before treating with damaging agents. Rifampicin is an inhibitor of RNA polymerase initiation; therefore, the pretreatment with rifampicin halts transcriptional initiation and allows us to separate the effects of DNA damage from RNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wehrli, 1983</xref>). In addition to MMS and MNNG, we also treated cells with ciprofloxacin and mitomycin C. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic that inhibits the ligation activity of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV but not the cleavage activity, thereby causing the topoisomerases to create double-stranded breaks in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">LeBel, 1988</xref>). Mitomycin C causes intra- and inter-strand DNA crosslinks that can block the activities of DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verweij and Pinedo, 1990</xref>). We predicted that these two agents, which specifically cause DNA damage, would produce truncated transcripts and result in His-tagging by tmRNA. For these two drugs, however, the pretreatment with rifampicin is expected to inhibit the accumulation of His-tagged products. In agreement with our model, pretreatment with rifampicin only slightly decreased the amount of His-tagging induced by MMS and MNNG (10â20%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that the majority of the observed tmRNA activity is due to direct damage to the mRNA. In contrast, the same rifampicin pretreatment combined with ciprofloxacin treatment decreased the amount of His-tagging by almost twofold. Interestingly, for the mitomycin C treatment, we did not observe any His-tagging even though we could infer that significant DNA damage had occurred as assessed by the increase in RecA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Regardless of this last observation, we conclude that while truncated transcripts produced from damaged DNA do activate tmRNA, the predominant trigger of tmRNA activation in MMS- and MNNG-treated samples is alkylative damage of RNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Addition of MMS-treated mRNA to <italic>E. coli</italic> extracts results in trans translation</title><p>To add further support for our model that mRNA modification by alkylation agents activates tmRNA, we prepared S30 extracts from the protease-deficient <italic>E. coli</italic> strain that harbors His-tagged tmRNA and assessed the translation of chemically damaged mRNAs in a cell-free system.

We note that analogous studies by our group conducted in yeast took advantage of the polyA tail of mRNAs in eukaryotes in order to purify them before modification analysis by LC-MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yan et al., 2019b</xref>). Unfortunately, owing to the lack of a similar feature in bacterial mRNAs, a similar strategy for <italic>E. coli</italic> cannot be used. Nonetheless, we were able to use an indirect approach to qualitatively assess the levels of m<sup>1</sup>A modification in mRNAs. In this approach, total RNA is resolved on denaturing agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies specific to the nucleoside of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>). In our hands, antibodies raised against m<sup>1</sup>A did not produce a signal even with positive standards. By contrast, we were able to obtain a robust signal with an anti m<sup>6</sup>A antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Since m<sup>1</sup>A can readily isomerize to m<sup>6</sup>A through Dimroth rearrangement by base treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Macon and Wolfenden, 1968</xref>), immunoblotting of base-treated RNAs with this antibody can be used to assess the levels of m<sup>1</sup>A. As expected, and in agreement with our LC-MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), without base treatment immunoblotting with m<sup>6</sup>A antibody showed that MMS addition to cells leads to a slight decrease in the signal, suggesting that the treatment does not alter the levels of this modification significantly. By contrast, base treatment of the gel before transfer revealed that treating cells with MMS causes a significant increase in the signal for RNA species that co-migrated between rRNA and tRNA species, which we attribute to mRNA species having m<sup>1</sup>A modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). More important was the observation that the MMS-induced signal was much higher in the Î<italic>ssrA</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

Collectively, our findings suggest that cells employ <italic>trans</italic> translation to rescue ribosomes stalled on damaged mRNA to quickly recover from alkylation stress.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Ribosome rescue by tmRNA is important for cellular recovery after treatment with alkylating agents.</title><p>(<bold>AâC</bold>) Growth curves, as measured by change in OD<sub>600nm</sub> as a function of time, for the indicated cells following a treatment with the denoted compound.

Among these modifications, m<sup>6</sup>A is arguably one of the most significant ones and appears to play important roles in the regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Pseudouridine (Î¨), due to its high abundance in mRNA, has recently emerged as another potentially important modification. Interestingly, pseudouridine-modified (and derivatives of Î¨) mRNAs have been shown to be effective for biotechnological purposes as they are less immunogenic and produce significantly higher levels of functional proteins than their unmodified counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">KarikÃ³ et al., 2008</xref>). Although much has been revealed about the role the so-called intentional modifications serve in regulating various aspects of mRNA metabolism, most chemical modifications of mRNA are disruptive damage adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Simms and Zaher, 2016</xref>). Previous work had shown that several alkylative damage adducts, including m<sup>1</sup>A and m<sup>6</sup>G, drastically slow translation and increase miscoding in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hudson and Zaher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">You et al., 2017</xref>). However, little is known about how alkylative damage of mRNA elicits cellular responses in vivo, and especially in bacteria. Additionally, the quantitative effects of m<sup>1</sup>A on the speed and accuracy of translation are not fully understood. Here we used compounds that alkylate nucleic acids to introduce damage adducts to bacterial RNA and assessed cellular responses to potential defects to translation. A priori, we hypothesized that the main ribosome rescue system in bacteria, the <italic>trans</italic>-translation pathway, works to release ribosomes stalled on damaged mRNA. Indeed, we find that upon treatment of <italic>E. coli</italic> with alkylating agents, <italic>trans</italic>-translation activity significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, we show that cells lacking tmRNA display prolonged recovery from alkylation stress relative to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>This response to alkylation-mediated changes to translation is likely to be general, as it was nearly identical regardless of the specific compound used to elicit the damage. We used two alkylating agents, MMS and MNNG, which work through an SN<sub>2</sub>- and SN<sub>1</sub>-type nucleophilic substitution mechanism, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wyatt and Pittman, 2006</xref>). Indeed, LC-MS analysis revealed that the addition of the compounds results in different signatures of RNA modification. For instance, theÂ addition of MNNG leads to aÂ more than tenfold increase in m<sup>6</sup>G levels, whereas that of MMS leads to a modestÂ &lt;1.5-fold increase for the same modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This is consistent with studies showing that MNNG produces a greater percentage of O-methyl adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wyatt and Pittman, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our group had previously utilized an in vitro reconstituted bacterial translation system to investigate the impact of m<sup>6</sup>G on decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hudson and Zaher, 2015</xref>); however, we had not analyzed the effects of m<sup>1</sup>A. We hypothesized that the positively charged resonance structure of m<sup>1</sup>A would disrupt its ability to base pair. During decoding on the ribosome, the first and second position of the codon-anticodon helix are closely monitored by rRNA nucleotides as well as ribosomal-protein amino acids, ensuring that only Watson-Crick base pairs are accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ogle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wimberly et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carter et al., 2001</xref>). We chose to analyze m<sup>1</sup>A in the second position of the codon rather than the first because we wanted to avoid possibly altering the interaction between the initiator tRNA and the P-site codon. As expected, the modification severely inhibited tRNA selection by the ribosome as reflected by the three orders of magnitude drop in the observed rate of peptideÂ bond formation and the tenfold decrease in the endpoint of the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This is consistent with a previous study showing that m<sup>1</sup>A in mRNA significantly decreased protein-synthesis yield in S30 extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">You et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, while the observation that m<sup>1</sup>A severely inhibits decoding is expected, our finding that the addition of paromomycin does not suppress this effect at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is unanticipated. Since paromomycin allows the incorporation of near-cognate aa-tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pape et al., 2000</xref>; i.e. those that have one mismatch between their anticodon and the A-site codon), this observation suggests that the modification is so disruptive that it affects base-pairing between the neighboring nucleotides. Consequently, all aa-tRNAs are recognized as non cognates, or as having more than one mismatch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Having confirmed that m<sup>1</sup>A-modified mRNAs are highly inhibitory to tRNA selection in vitro, we then sought to investigate how bacterial cells deal with alkylated RNA, which includes m<sup>1</sup>A-modified ones, in vivo. We hypothesized that <italic>trans</italic> translation is likely to be activated in response to stalls caused by alkylation damage to mRNA. To add support for this hypothesis, we used <italic>E. coli</italic> strains harboring a modified <italic>ssrA</italic> gene (encoding tmRNA), for which the encoded ssrA-degradation tag is altered to one that codes for a His tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moore and Sauer, 2005</xref>). In these strains, the addition of His tags, as evaluated by westernÂ blot analysis, can be used to assess tmRNA activation. In complete agreement with our model, we observe a significant increase in His-tagging and hence increased <italic>trans</italic>-translation activity upon cellular treatment with alkylating agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We also showed that this activity is independent of active transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and hence is likely to be initiated as a result of direct damage to mature mRNAs. Future experiments aimed at characterizing the identity of the tagged peptides, using mass-spectrometry approaches, for example, are likely to reveal important insights into the specificity of tmRNA tagging as well as that of the antibody recognition of tagged products. Since MMS is known to modify A and C, at least in a way that affects their Watson-Crick-base pairing properties, we expect tagging to occur preferentially on codons enriched for these two nucleotides.</p><p>Notably, because bacterial mRNAs do not contain poly-A tails like their eukaryotic counterparts, it is difficult to purify mRNA away from rRNA and tRNA; therefore, we cannot be certain that the observed effects on translation are exclusively due to mRNA damage. However, there exist several compelling reasons to support the hypothesis that the tmRNA response is primarily due to mRNA damage. For one, <italic>trans</italic> translation has been studied almost exclusively in the context of defective mRNAs. It is difficult to imagine how a defective ribosome would still be capable of performing peptidyl transfer only with tmRNA. Second, the folding of rRNA as well as its association with ribosomal proteins is thought to make it a poor target for alkylative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Simms and Zaher, 2016</xref>). Specifically, the rRNA residues responsible for monitoring the base pairing in the decoding center are not exposed; therefore, it is unlikely that they are damaged by the agents at a high incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clemons et al., 1999</xref>). Additionally, tRNAs are susceptible to alkylative damage, but only 3 out of an average of 76 nucleotides directly participate in base pairing with the codon. This reduces the probability that damaged nucleotides in tRNA cause the observed ribosomal stalling. Furthermore, unless the P-site tRNA is damaged, tmRNA is unlikely to be able to sense defects to the tRNA pool. Finally, the CCA-adding enzyme in <italic>E. coli</italic> has been shown to discriminate against tRNA backbone damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hou, 2010</xref>); without CCA ends these tRNAs are not aminoacylated and cannot participate inÂ peptidyl transfer.</p><p>Several studies have shown that bacteria lacking a functional <italic>trans</italic>-translation pathway do not recover as efficiently after cellular stress, including metabolic and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nishikawa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karzai et al., 1999</xref>). We observe that alkylative stress also causes a delayed recovery period in cells lacking tmRNA, likely because they are unable to efficiently rescue stalled ribosomes and resume growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The <italic>âssrA</italic> cells are likely able to eventually resume growth after alkylative damage because of the existence of several alternative ribosome-rescue factors. One factor, known as alternative ribosome-rescue factor A (ArfA) works by recruiting RF2 to hydrolyze the peptidyl-tRNA and release the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shimizu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chadani et al., 2012</xref>). This factor acts as a backup for <italic>trans</italic>-translation, as its expression increases when tmRNA activity is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garza-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chadani et al., 2011a</xref>). Another factor that can release stalled ribosomes is ArfB, although it does not appear to function solely as a backup for tmRNA and its physiological function remains to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chadani et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Handa et al., 2011</xref>). Regardless, these alternative ribosome rescue factors in <italic>E. coli</italic> are likely responsible for the eventual recovery we observe, and future studies should be aimed at exploring their role in theÂ alkylation-stress response.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper reveals that alkylation of mRNA, which impairs the speed and accuracy of protein synthesis, activates the bacterial transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) ribosome rescue pathway. This is an exciting finding because traditionally tmRNA has been known to work on truncated transcripts (lacking a stop codon); this work thus reveals a new expanded role for ribosome rescue on chemically damaged mRNAs.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Alkylative damage of mRNA leads to ribosome stalling and rescue by trans translation in bacteria&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at this point.</p><p>We expect that the experiments needed to address the reviewer concerns, see below, will take longer than the typical two-month period provided by the journal. That being said, we hope that you will consider the comments below and in the full reviews, and that you will consider re-submitting this work to <italic>eLife</italic> if you can address the key concerns.</p><p>In their consultation and in the reviews appended below, all three reviewers commented positively on the novelty and interest of the work, and on the use of both in vivo and in vitro experiments to assess the impact of RNA alkylation. The kinetic analyses show convincingly that alkylation of the second base of a codon significantly impaired decoding, resulting in reduced rates and yields of protein synthesis. The most intriguing finding is the potential role of the ribosome rescue factor tmRNA, which typically works on truncated mRNAs, in rescuing ribosomes from the damaged mRNAs.</p><p>Despite their enthusiasm toward these findings, the reviewers expressed several concerns; most notably in trying to link the in vitro and in vivo data. They felt that stronger evidence is needed linking tmRNA to rescue of ribosomes on alkylated mRNAs in cells. Additional evidence is needed to rule out the possibility that the tmRNA is targeting truncated mRNAs transcribed from damaged DNA rather than targeting alkylated mRNAs in the cell. For example, by assessing the role of tmRNA on electroporated unmodified or alkylated mRNAs. Relatedly, examination of turnover of the alkylated mRNAs is needed to assess the relative importance of tmRNA versus other ribosome rescue factors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper from the Zaher lab describes studies examining the impact on translation caused by alkylation of mRNA caused by MMS or MNNG treatments. in vitro, m1A modification of the middle base of an A site codon, substantially impaired the rate and extent of peptide formation. Based on this defect in peptide bond formation, the researchers examined whether the stalled translation product was a substrate for rescue by the tmRNA system. First, they found that the m1A modification did not substantially impair trans-translation in vitro. Next, using a tagged tmRNA, they found that alkylative damage enhanced tagging of many cellular proteins in vivo, suggesting that alkylative damage generates tmRNA substrates in the cell. Finally, the authors found that disabling the trans-translation rescue pathway sensitized <italic>E. coli</italic> cells to alkylation of mRNAs.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting story and complements previous work showing that alkylative mRNA damage in eukaryotes triggers ribosome quality control (RQC) pathways including degradation of the stalled nascent peptide. The work in this paper indicates that a parallel quality control pathway is functional in bacteria to eliminate the stalled translation products caused by mRNA alkylation.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) In Figure 1A, why do the levels m6A decrease in the presence of MMS and MNNG?</p><p>2) In the last sentence of Results paragraph two, it is stated that the base level of m1G is at least 200-fold higher than that of m1A. However, this is not obvious based on Figures 1A and 1B and the different Y-axes used; in fact, it looks like m1A levels are 4-5-fold higher than m1G.</p><p>3) Results, third paragraph: the citations to different panels in Figure 1 are incorrect. Second line should refer to Figure 1D and 1E; third line to Figure 1F and panel C (m7G) is never cited in the text.</p><p>4) Figure 3: there is no positive control to show that the antibiotic was functional in these experiments</p><p>5) Figure 4 is described as testing the 20 possible ternary complexes. However, the number of possible ternary complexes is not dictated by the amino acid, but by the tRNAs (around 46 different tRNAs). Since the experiment was examining the ability of different tRNAs to decode the modified codon, the number of possible tRNAs (with distinct anticodons) is more relevant than the different amino acids.</p><p>6) Are the modified (alkylated) mRNAs turned over? Do the levels of modified nucleotides increase in the â-ssrA cells treated with MMS?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Zaher and co-workers describes the effect of alkylation agents on protein synthesis in <italic>E. coli</italic>. First they characterize which bases in total RNA are modified by the alkylating agents MMS and MNNG. An earlier report using in vitro extracts (You, Dai and Wang, 2017) showed that m1A and other modifications in mRNA severely reduce protein synthesis in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Here the authors use purified components and pre-steady state kinetic methods to demonstrate that the rate and overall yield of peptide bond formation is dramatically reduced when m1A is found at the second position of the A-site codon. There is a severe decoding defect as evidenced by the fact that addition of antibiotics known to induce miscoding with near-cognate (but not non-cognate) tRNAs do not improve decoding of a codon with an alkylated base.

There is a severe decoding defect as evidenced by the fact that addition of antibiotics known to induce miscoding with near-cognate (but not non-cognate) tRNAs do not improve decoding of a codon with an alkylated base. Based on this defect in peptide bond formation, the researchers examined whether the stalled translation product was a substrate for rescue by the tmRNA system. First, they found that the m1A modification did not substantially impair trans-translation in vitro. Next, using a tagged tmRNA, they found that alkylative damage enhanced tagging of many cellular proteins in vivo, suggesting that alkylative damage generates tmRNA substrates in the cell. Finally, the authors found that disabling the trans-translation rescue pathway sensitized <italic>E. coli</italic> cells to alkylation of mRNAs. This is an exciting finding because traditionally tmRNA has been known to work on truncated transcripts (lacking a stop codon); a role for ribosome rescue on chemically damaged mRNAs is new and opens questions of other modifications and their potential in quality control.</p><p>In this re-submission, the authors address concerns raised regarding their original submission. Of note, they present in vitro data in new Figure 7 showing that MMS-treated mRNA is not as well translated as the untreated mRNA. Moreover, the MMS-treated mRNA produces more tma-tagged products indicating that the damaged mRNA is in fact a tma substrate. In addition, in new Figure 6âfigure supplement 1 they provide evidence of increased levels of modified mRNAs in cells lacking ssrA. This latter result is consistent with their hypothesis that the damaged mRNAs are turned over following tma tagging of the translation product.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) It is striking that the pattern of tma-tagged products is not altered upon MMA treatment. This is noted in vivo in Figure 6 where the level abundance of tagged products are increased in MMS-treated versus untreated cells, but the pattern of products on the gel are not changed. The new data in Figure 7 shows the same result in vitro. The untreated and treated mRNAs yield the same pattern of tma-tagged products. The authors propose that this is due to the specificity of the antibody and they show that different antibodies reveal different patterns. While the authors' hypothesis seems reasonable at this time, and no additional experiments are requested, we feel that this unexpected result is commented on in this review.</p><p>2) Is it appropriate to refer to Figure 2 as testing &quot;all 20 possible aa-tRNA isoacceptors&quot;? While perhaps formally correct, they did test one isoacceptor for each amino acid, the relevant tRNA attribute in the assay is the anticodon. I would be more comfortable if they stated that they tested 20 different tRNAs with unique anticodons. Later in the paragraph, they state that &quot;no significant dipeptide accumulation occurred in the presence of any aa-tRNA&quot;. I think this should read &quot;no significant dipeptide accumulation occurred in the presence of any of the tested aa-tRNAs&quot;</p><p>3) One concern is that transcription from damaged DNA could make truncated messages that increase tmRNA tagging, meaning that the signal may not come from ribosome stalling on damaged mRNAs. The authors try to use rifampicin to block transcription, but it doesn't fully work. To get around this limitation, they measure tmRNA activity in S30 extracts with a reporter mRNA. They show that chemically damaged mRNA leads to higher levels of tmRNA tagging of reporter protein than untreated mRNA. The data in Figure 7 convincingly tie tagging to mRNA damage (and not rRNA or tRNA damage) and rule out concerns about premature transcriptional termination making non-stop mRNAs. This is a significant improvement in the paper.</p><p>4) A nice feature of the Zaher lab's earlier paper in 2018 (Nat. Comm.) about nucleotide damage and ribosome rescue in yeast was the link to RNA decay. To more conclusively show that tmRNA is acting on messages with alkylated damage, the authors could perform a pulse chase experiment, first labeling mRNA (the pulse) and then during the chase period, adding a short alkylation treatment, then observing the rates of turnover of labeled mRNA.</p><p>The authors addressed this concern by adding Figure 6âfigure supplement 1 using antibodies to detect modified nucleotides in RNAs. The presentation of these data is confusing, but I take it that there are three samples, untreated, MMS treated, and a 10 min chase after MMS treatment. It requires an additional base treatment to see the isomerization required to detect m1A using an m6A antibody (a clever trick of nucleoside chemistry). The authors argue that after 10 min of chase, the signal drops in the WT more than in the ssrA knockout. But the signal in the 0 and 10 lanes of the WT look pretty similar to me, as do the 0 and 10 lanes of the ssrA knockout (except that there is more signal in the ssrA lanes). I am not fully convinced that these data tell a compelling story about mRNA decay. But they could be used to show that there are higher levels of m1A in mRNAs in ssrA knockout cells. In the future, the authors might consider separating mRNA from rRNA and tRNA and performing LC/MS to measure m1A levels. There are very efficient methods of removing rRNA from samples for sequencing (e.g. Illumina Ribo-Zero plus) that can likely be helpful.</p><p>We feel that the authors should soften their conclusion and not claim a change in rate of turnover based on the data in Figure 6âfigure supplement 1; however, they can claim increased levels of modified mRNAs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61984.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Our new immuno-blotting data in Figure 6âfigure supplement 1 are in agreement with these observations. We note that these changes appear to be statistically insignificant, but that does not mean it is biologically insignificant too. A model that can explain these observations is that alkylative stress activates decay processes that target m<sup>6</sup>A-modified mRNAs. As this is all conjecture, and would distract from our discussion of the m1A effect, we decided not to elaborate on it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the last sentence of Results paragraph two, it is stated that the base level of m1G is at least 200-fold higher than that of m1A. However, this is not obvious based on Figures 1A and 1B and the different Y-axes used; in fact, it looks like m1A levels are 4-5-fold higher than m1G.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize about the confusion, which we believe stems from referencing the wrong figure panels in the text (see next point). The m1A data is presented in Figure 1D and not Figure 1A. In the absence of MMS or MNNG, m1A levels are less than 20 pmole/mmole, whereas m1G levels are &gt; 1000 pmole/mmole.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Results, third paragraph: the citations to different panels in Figure 1 are incorrect.

The control for these experiments is to add antibiotics to the unmodified complex, but since this a matched one, paromomycin has no effect. We opted not to include data showing the antibiotics work because these complexes would be irrelevant to the one shown in Figure 3. We also note that these experiments were all conducted at the same time as assays that we conducted on mismatched complexes published last year in Nucleic Acids Research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4 is described as testing the 20 possible ternary complexes. However, the number of possible ternary complexes is not dictated by the amino acid, but by the tRNAs (around 46 different tRNAs). Since the experiment was examining the ability of different tRNAs to decode the modified codon, the number of possible tRNAs (with distinct anticodons) is more relevant than the different amino acids.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. The revised manuscript now states that we reacted the initiation complexes with âall 20 aa-tRNA isoacceptorsâ instead.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Are the modified (alkylated) mRNAs turned over? Do the levels of modified nucleotides increase in the â-ssrA cells treated with MMS?</p></disp-quote><p>This was a great suggestion, and ideally we would have liked to use LC-MS to conduct these experiments. Notably, our published experiments in yeast relied on the polyA tail to enrich for mRNAs before they were analyzed for modifications. Obviously, this approach cannot be used in bacteria. Electroporating modified mRNAs into wild-type and DssrA cells to follow their decay would have been a good alternative. However, these experiments were also difficult to conduct in bacteria. Given these limitations, we ended up using immuno-blotting of gel-separated RNAs to look at the levels of modified nucleotides in wild-type and DssrA cells following an MMS challenge. These experiments allowed us to infer the level of modifications in mRNAs based on their migrations on the gel. These data are presented in Figure 6âfigure supplement 1 and show that m1A-modified mRNAs appear to decay slower in the absence of tmRNA. We concede that these experiments are not ideal, but more direct experiments are nearly impossible to conduct in bacteria. Furthermore, in the context of all of the experiments presented in the manuscript, our data provide a compelling evidence for a role of tmRNA in damaged-mRNA quality control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript by Zaher and co-workers describes the effect of alkylation agents on protein synthesis in E. coli. First they characterize which bases in total RNA are modified by the alkylating agents MMS and MNNG. An earlier report using in vitro extracts (You, Dai and Wang, 2017) showed that m1A and other modifications in mRNA severely reduce protein synthesis in E. coli. Here the authors use purified components and pre-steady state kinetic methods to demonstrate that the rate and overall yield of peptide bond formation is dramatically reduced when m1A is found at the second position of the A-site codon. There is a severe decoding defect as evidenced by the fact that addition of antibiotics known to induce miscoding with near-cognate (but not non-cognate) tRNAs do not improve decoding of a codon with an alkylated base.

An hour-long delay for the DssrA would effectively dilute them about eightfold every time they are subjected to alkylative stress in a competitive environment where wild-type cells exist.

As the reviewer alluded to, mRNA electroporation in bacteria is not easy. Nevertheless, we attempted these experiments multiple times using different conditions and different types of mRNAs and failed to observe any protein production. We even used phage mRNAs, hoping their increased stability will allow them to be translated efficiently after electroporation. The reviewer also suggested that if these experiments were difficult to conduct, S30-type experiments can be used as an alternative. This is exactly what we ended up doing, and the results are now shown in Figure 7. Briefly, the new data convincingly show that MMS-treated mRNA leads to tmRNA tagging in the extracts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One of the nice features of the Zaher lab's earlier paper in 2018 (Nat.
