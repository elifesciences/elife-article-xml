basal hematopoiesis to combat infection. Little is known about how during development, this switch is achieved to take care of the insult. Here, we show that the hematopoietic niche of the larval lymph gland of <italic>Drosophila</italic> senses immune challenge and reacts to it quickly through the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), Relish, a component of the immune deficiency (Imd) pathway. During development, Relish is triggered by ecdysone signaling in the hematopoietic niche to maintain the blood progenitors. Loss of Relish causes an alteration in the cytoskeletal architecture of the niche cells in a Jun Kinase-dependent manner, resulting in the trapping of Hh implicated in progenitor maintenance. Notably, during infection, downregulation of Relish in the niche tilts the maintenance program toward precocious differentiation, thereby bolstering the cellular arm of the immune response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lymph gland</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>relish</kwd><kwd>ecdysone</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009053</institution-id><institution>The Wellcome Trust DBT India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA/S/17/503100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mandal</surname><given-names>Lolitika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ecdysone-mediated regulation of Relish expression and activation in the hematopoietic niche is essential for progenitor maintenance in <italic>the Drosophila</italic> Lymph gland.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The larval blood-forming organ, the lymph gland, is the site for definitive hematopoiesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Evans et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mandal et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, there are noticeable similarities between the molecular mechanisms that regulate the lymph gland and those essential for progenitor-based hematopoiesis in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Evans et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gold and Brückner, 2014</xref>). The lymph gland is formed in embryonic stages, and through various larval stages, it grows in size. The mature third-instar larval lymph gland is a multi-lobed structure with well-characterized anterior lobe/primary lobes with three distinct zones. The heterogeneous progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldeosingh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cho et al., 2020</xref>) are medially located and define the medullary zone (MZ), while the differentiated hemocytes populate the peripheral zone or cortical zone of the primary lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jung et al., 2005</xref>). The innermost core progenitors are maintained by the adjacent cardiac cells that serve as niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Destalminil-Letourneau et al., 2021</xref>), while the bulk of primed progenitors are maintained by the posterior signaling center (PSC) or the niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldeosingh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>). Except for one study that claims otherwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benmimoun et al., 2015</xref>), several studies demonstrate that PSC/niche maintains the homeostasis of the entire organ by positively regulating the maintenance of these progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kaur et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mondal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>). During development, this organ is the site of proliferation, maintenance, and differentiation of hemocytes. Only with the onset of pupation do the lymph glands rupture to disperse the blood cells into circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Grigorian et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Relish expression and its function in hematopoietic niche of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval lymph gland.</title><p>Genotypes are mentioned in relevant panels.

Interestingly, during infection, the lymph gland releases the differentiated hemocytes into circulation in larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Khadilkar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Louradour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sorrentino et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The three <italic>Drosophila</italic> NF-κB factors – Dorsal, Dorsal-related immunity factor (DIF), and Relish – regulate the insect humoral immunity pathway that gets activated during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Govind, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hetru and Hoffmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Louradour et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> NF-κB signaling pathways show conspicuous similarity with vertebrates. The NF-κB family consists of five members – RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105, and p52/p100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ganesan et al., 2010</xref>). In vertebrates, these factors are critical for producing cytokines, regulating cell death, and controlling cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gilmore, 2006</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Dorsal and Dif activation happens during embryogenesis as well as during gram-positive bacterial and fungal infections. In both cases, it is triggered by the activation of the Toll pathway by cleaved cytokine Spatzle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Valanne et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, gram-negative bacterial infections activate the Imd pathway. The diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-type peptidoglycan from the cell wall of the bacteria directly binds to the peptidoglycan recognition protein-LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gottar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kaneko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rämet et al., 2002</xref>) or peptidoglycan recognition protein-LE (PGRP-LC or PGRP-LE). This binding initiates a signaling cascade that elicits the cleavage, activation, and nuclear translocation of Relish with the subsequent transcription of antimicrobial peptide genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hedengren et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>IMD pathway has been studied intensively in the context of immunity and inflammation, but far less is understood about the developmental function of this pathway. Accumulating evidence from studies, however, suggests that the IMD pathway may also have distinct roles in development. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Relish and its target genes are activated during neurodegeneration and overexpression of Relish during development causes apoptosis in wing disc cells, neurons, photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chinchore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Katzenberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tavignot et al., 2017</xref>) and autophagy in salivary gland cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Nandy et al., 2018</xref>). These studies point out to diverse developmental requirements of Relish beyond immunity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Since IMD is an evolutionarily conserved signaling cascade, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, therefore, turns out to be a great model to explore the diverse function of the components of this pathway.</p><p>Expression of Relish in the hematopoietic niche of the lymph gland during non-infectious conditions prompted us to investigate its role in developmental hematopoiesis. We found that Relish acts as an inhibitor of c-Jun Kinase Signaling (<italic>JNK</italic>) in the hematopoietic niche. During infection, Relish inhibits JNK signaling through <italic>tak1</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Park et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, we found similar crosstalk being adopted during development in the hematopoietic niche. Activation of JNK signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is associated with alteration of the cytoskeletal architecture of cells during various developmental scenarios, including cell migration, dorsal closure, etc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Homsy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jacinto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kaltschmidt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kockel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rudrapatna et al., 2014</xref>). We found that upon Relish loss, JNK activation causes upregulation of actin remodelers, Enabled and Singed in the niche. The actin cytoskeletal remodeling, in turn, affects the formation of cytoneme-like filopodial projections leading to precocious differentiation at the expense of progenitors. These filopodial projections are proposed to facilitate the transporting of Hh from the niche to the adjoining progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). We further show that perturbation in filopodial extensions via downregulation of Diaphanous affects Hh delivery and disrupts the communication between niche and progenitors. The hematopoietic niche maintains the delicate balance between the number of progenitors and differentiated cells of the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldeosingh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>). During development, this organ accumulates hemocytes for post-larval requirements. However, during wasp infestation, this organ precociously releases the content into circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>) due to the activation of the Toll pathway in the PSC/hematopoietic niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Louradour et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, a switch is essential to enable the transition from basal hematopoiesis toward the emergency mode to enable the organism to combat infection. The pathway identified in this study, critical for niche maintenance and developmental hematopoiesis, is also exploited during the immune challenge. The circuit engaged in niche maintenance and, therefore, crucial for developmental hematopoiesis gets disrupted during bacterial infection.

We show that to reinforce the cellular arm of the innate immune response, Relish needs to be downregulated in the niche during infection.

Compared to the control, wherein the number of cells in the hematopoietic niche ranges from 40 to 45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–F'' and K</xref>), a niche-specific downregulation of Relish results in a fourfold increase in the cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–G'' and K</xref>).

The co-localization of Rel with validated markers of progenitors like TepIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Irving et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kroeger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Shim et al., 2013</xref>) and Ance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benmimoun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>) further endorsed Rel’s progenitor-specific expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F-F''</xref>). On the other hand, co-labeling with Pxn-YFP, a differentiated cell marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nelson et al., 1994</xref>), reveals that Rel is downregulated from CZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G-G'</xref>). Therefore, we traced back to post second-instar stages to get a better insight into the phenotype caused by Relish loss from the niche. At 54–64 hr AEH, compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–A'', C–C'', and I</xref>), downregulation of Rel by <italic>Antp-Gal4</italic> results in an increase in EdU incorporation in the niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–B'', D–D'', and I</xref>). In context to the niche, a definite proliferation pattern is observable during development. Compared to the rest of the lymph gland, niche cell proliferation decreases by 86 hr AEH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–E'' and I</xref>). Beyond this time point, EdU incorporation rarely occurs in the niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–G'' and I</xref>). In sharp contrast to this, upon niche-specific downregulation of Relish, there is a failure in attaining the steady-state proliferative pattern by 86 hr AEH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–F'' and I</xref>). Quite strikingly, EdU incorporation continues even at 96 hr when the control niche cells have stopped proliferating (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–G''</xref> with H–H'' and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). These proliferating niche cells are indeed mitotically active is evident by the increase in phospho histone H3 (PH3) incorporation compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–K'' and L</xref>). In addition to these snapshot techniques, in vivo cell proliferation assay of the niche was done employing the FUCCI system (fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zielke and Edgar, 2015</xref>). Fly-FUCCI relies on fluorochrome-tagged probes where the first one is a GFP fused to E2F protein, which is degraded at the S phase by Cdt2 (thus GFP marks cells in G2, M, and G1 phases). The second probe is an mRFP tagged to the CycB protein, which undergoes anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome-mediated degradation during mid-mitosis (thereby marking cells in S, G2, and M phases). While in control by 96 hr AEH, niche cells are mostly in G2-M (yellow), and in G1 state (green), in loss of Relish, abundance in S phase can be seen at the expense of G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H-I'''' and J</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Loss of Relish from the niche causes niche cell hyperplasia.

This result is in sync with the observation that Rel loss from the niche leads to the reduction in the levels of Ci<sup>155</sup> in the progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L–M'</xref>), suggesting that Hh produced by the niche is not sensed by the progenitors resulting in their precocious differentiation.</p><p>The alteration in extracellular Hh and decline in Ci<sup>155</sup> level in the progenitors prompted us to speculate that loss of Relish from niche might have interfered with Hh delivery to the progenitor cells. Several reports in diverse tissues across model organisms have demonstrated filopodia mediated Hh delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">González-Méndez et al., 2019</xref>). Although the filopodial extension has been documented in the case hematopoietic niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>), its role in Hh delivery is yet to be demonstrated. To check this possibility, we assayed the status of these actin-based cellular extensions emanating from the niche cells in freshly dissected unfixed tissue of control as well experimental. For this purpose, <italic>UAS-GMA</italic> (also known as <italic>UAS-moesin-GFP</italic>) that marks F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kiehart et al., 2000</xref>) was expressed in a niche-specific manner. Multiple cellular processes with variable length are detectable in control, while upon Relish knockdown, filopodial extensions are highly compromised (arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–I'</xref>). Quantitative analyses of the data reveal that both length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>) and number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>) are altered upon Rel loss from the niche. Intrigued with this finding, we independently downregulated Diaphanous (<italic>dia</italic>), an actin polymerase known to be important in filopodial formation, elongation and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Homem and Peifer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nowotarski et al., 2014</xref>), from the niche. As expected, compared to control niches, <italic>dia</italic> loss resulted in compromised filopodial length and number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B and C-D</xref>). Quite similar to <italic>Rel</italic> loss from the niche, these defects in filopodial in turn affected Hh delivery from the niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E–F' and G</xref>). As a consequence, there was a decline in the number of progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H–I and L</xref>) and a concomitant increase in the differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J–K and M</xref>) compared to control.</p><p>Additionally, compared to the control, F-actin (visualized by rhodamine-phalloidin) expression is significantly increased in the cell cortex upon Relish loss from the niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–B'' and C</xref>). This accumulation of cortical F-actin intrigued us to further probe into F-actin associated proteins' status, Singed and Enabled in the niche cells upon loss of Relish. While Singed is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of Fascin and is involved in cross-linking actin filaments and actin-bundling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cant et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tilney et al., 2000</xref>), Enabled is a cytoskeletal adaptor protein involved in actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gates et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lin et al., 2009</xref>). In comparison to the control, where there is a basal level of Singed or lack of Ena expression in the niche, a significant increase in the level of both of these actin-associated proteins occurs upon downregulation of Relish function (Singed: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D–E'' and F</xref> and Ena: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G–H'' and I</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, co-expressing the RNAi construct of Ena and Rel in the niche partially rescued the defects in progenitor maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–C and D</xref>) and differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E–G and H</xref>), which is otherwise seen upon Rel loss. This rescue in the phenotype can be attributed to the resurrection of the transport defects of Hh seen upon Rel loss from the niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3I–K' and L-N</xref>).</p><p>These results demonstrate that loss of Relish from the niche induces cytoskeletal rearrangement, which disrupts the proper delivery of Hedgehog to the adjoining progenitors.

Studies across the taxa have shown mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) as a major regulator of cellular cytoskeleton dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Densham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pichon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Reszka et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Šamaj et al., 2004</xref>). The c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) or so-called stress-activated protein kinases, which belong to the MAPK superfamily, are one such key modulator of actin dynamics in a cell. Whether the cytoskeletal remodeling of the niche in the absence of Relish is an outcome of JNK activation was next explored. Compared to the control where there is a negligible level of activation of JNK signaling in the niche, visualized by TRE-GFP: a transcriptional reporter of JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chatterjee and Bohmann, 2012</xref>), a robust increase in the expression occurs in the niche where the function of Relish is abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B' and C</xref>).

Several in vitro and in vivo studies in vertebrates have shown the inhibitory role of NF-κB signaling over JNK during various developmental and immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clark and Coopersmith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nakano, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Volk et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mammalian MAP3 kinase homolog TAK1 activates both the JNK and NF-κB pathways following immune stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boutros et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kaneko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Vidal et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, during bacterial infection, Relish, once activated, leads to proteasomal degradation of TAK1, thereby limiting JNK signaling to prevent hyper-immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Park et al., 2004</xref>). It is intriguing to speculate that a similar circuit is engaged in the niche to curtail JNK signaling during development. If this is the case, then the loss of <italic>tak1</italic> should restore the elevated TRE-GFP expression in a niche where Relish is downregulated. Indeed, upon genetic removal of one copy of <italic>tak1</italic> in conjunction with Relish loss from the niche, a drastic decrease in TRE-GFP expression is noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>).

These phenotypes show a remarkable similarity to the ones seen on the loss of Relish from the niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–P</xref>).

Hemocytes present in the lymph gland are not actively involved in immune surveillance under healthy conditions. Within this organ, the hemocytes proliferate to create a pool of progenitors and differentiated cells. However, with its content, this organ takes care of all post-larval hematopoiesis and therefore is not precociously engaged. Our study illustrates how the hematopoietic niche recruits neuroendocrine-immunity (Ecdysone–Relish) axis to maintain the progenitors of the lymph gland during larval development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2M</xref>). The loss of Ecdysone/Relish, therefore, results in precocious maturation of the progenitors. The mechanism underlying the control of niche state and function by Relish involves repression of the Jun Kinase signaling. Interestingly, Relish during infection is known to inhibit JNK activation in response to gram-negative bacterial infection in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Park et al., 2004</xref>). We found that this antagonistic relation of Relish and JNK, essential for innate immunity, is also relevant during development to facilitate the functioning of the hematopoietic niche. Our results suggest that two independent events occur in the niche if JNK is activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2M</xref>). Firstly, the activation of JNK leads to supernumerary niche cells due to an increase in Wingless expression. Secondly, the JNK pathway negatively regulates the actin-based cytoskeletal architecture essential for the release of Hh from the niche cells.</p><p>Though perceived as a pro-apoptotic signal, a large body of work has evidenced the role of the JNK pathway to induce proliferation in diverse developmental scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kaur et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ohsawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pérez-Garijo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pinal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). The JNK pathway is also known for its ability to release proliferative signals that can stimulate the growth of the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pinal et al., 2019</xref>). For instance, during compensatory proliferation in the developing larval wing disc, JNK triggers wingless to stimulate the proliferation of the non-dead cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ryoo et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, wingless signaling has been reported as a mitogenic signal for stem cells in diverse contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deb et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Song and Xie, 2003</xref>), and aberrant activation of this pathway contributes to various blood cell disorders and cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grainger and Willert, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Klaus and Birchmeier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lento et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Reya and Clevers, 2005</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoietic niche is known to positively rely upon wingless (Wg) signaling for its proliferation during larval development. Downregulation of the signaling by expressing a dominant-negative form of its receptor Frizzled results in a reduction in niche cell numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sinenko et al., 2009</xref>). We believe, to prevent hyperproliferation of the niche cells, Relish is reining in Wingless by inhibiting JNK signaling during development.</p><p>Several studies have shown that actin-based cellular extensions or cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">González-Méndez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gradilla et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Portela et al., 2019</xref>) play a crucial role in transporting Hh from the source to several cell diameter distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rojas-Ríos et al., 2012</xref>), thereby contributing in the establishment of Hh gradient. Coincidently, <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoietic niche cells are also known to emanate cytoneme-like filopodial projections to the nearby progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Tokusumi et al., 2011</xref>). We demonstrate that perturbation of this filopodial extension disrupts the transportation of Hh from the niche. The current study is in sync with the understanding that these cellular extensions are required to maintain the undifferentiated cell population by facilitating the crosstalk between niche and hematopoietic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Tokusumi et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we show that upon Relish loss from the niche, filopodial formation gets impaired in a JNK- dependent manner. Ectopic activation of JNK signaling leads to altered expression of cytoskeletal elements that disrupt the process of filopodial formation. Consequently, the morphogen Hh gets trapped within the niche cells, thereby hamper the proper communication between the niche and the progenitor cells of the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that activation of Relish leads to the disruption of cytoskeletal architecture in S2 cells to bring about the necessary changes associated with cell shapes for the proper immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Foley and O'Farrell, 2004</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism of the modulation of cytoskeletal elements by Relish was not evident. Here we provide in vivo genetic evidence for the process by which Relish loss causes alteration of the cytoskeletal elements of the niche cells by ectopic JNK activation.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Developmental requirement of Relish in the niche for progenitor maintenance.</title><p>Scheme describing how loss of Relish from the niche alters cytoskeletal elements of the cells.

The underlying reasons for this hormonal control on Relish seem to be intriguing. The need for this regulatory network during development may be related to the various microbial threats commonly confronted and dealt with by the circulating hemocytes of the larvae. While the circulating hemocytes cater to this need, the blood cells in the lymph gland proliferate and undergo maturation, creating a reservoir of hemocytes dedicated to deal with the post-larval requirements. Therefore, to safeguard the reserve population from responding to all of the common threats faced during development, the niche employs the ecdysone–Relish axis to prevent the disruption in definitive hematopoiesis. However, during a high infection load, the lymph gland ruptures, suggesting a break in this circuit. This notion gets endorsed when the niche is analyzed post-infection. A previous study demonstrated that the septate junction in the niche is dismantled during infection, leading to the disbursing of differentiation signals that facilitated the maturation of the hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Khadilkar et al., 2017</xref>). We demonstrate that bacterial infection results in downregulation of Rel from the niche, which alters cytoskeletal architecture and traps the maintenance signal. As a consequence, precocious differentiation sets in the lymph gland, while in the case of the earlier study, seeping out of too many differentiation signals leads to ectopic differentiation underlining the fact that maintenance and differentiation are both sides of the same coin.</p><p>Quite intriguingly, the downregulation of Relish in the niche during bacterial infection and the response of the lymph gland mimic the genetic loss of Relish from the niche. These observations confirm that the developmental pathway gets tweaked in the hematopoietic niche to combat high bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>During bacterial infection, the activation of Relish by ecdysone signaling in the fat body results in the production of antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rus et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to this, we show that upon infection, Relish needs to be downregulated in the niche to bolster the cellular immune response. This downregulation of Relish facilitates the release of a large pool of macrophages from the lymph gland to augment the circulating hemocytes to combat infection. The lymph gland hemocytes do not participate in immune surveillance during development. However, during wasp infection, activation of the Toll/NF-κB signaling occurs in the niche to recruit lymph gland hemocytes to encapsulate wasp eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Louradour et al., 2017</xref>). We show that during bacterial infections, Relish, another member of the NF-κB pathway, is downregulated in the niche to disperse the lymph gland hemocytes into circulation. It is intriguing to see that the contrasting regulation of NF-κB components by the hematopoietic niche is essential for mounting an adequate immune response.</p><p>Interestingly, de novo production of neutrophils occurs in the bone marrow in response to systemic bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zhao and Baltimore, 2015</xref>). In mouse, ‘emergency granulopoiesis’ demands the activation of the TLR (Toll-like receptors)/NF-κB pathway via TLR4 in the vascular niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boettcher et al., 2014</xref>). It will be important to investigate whether this differential regulation on NF-κB members is evident in vertebrate bone marrow niches during infection.</p><p>For an organism to combat an infection successfully, a quick shift of the ongoing hematopoiesis toward emergency mode is absolutely necessary. We show that the hematopoietic niche is the sensor that gauges the physiological state of the animal and diverts the basal hematopoiesis toward the emergency hematopoiesis.</p><p>In conclusion, the present work reveals an unexpected role of Relish in developmental hematopoiesis. Furthermore, it unravels the systemic regulation of the hematopoietic niche by the neuroendocrine system. Also, it sheds light on how, during infection, this pathway gets suppressed to reinforce the cellular arm of the innate immune response.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Larval tissue was quickly pulled out in 1× PBS on ice (dissection time not more than 25 min and fat body and salivary gland needs to be cleared from the tissue of interest). Incubation of the dissected tissue was done in EdU solution, Component A (1:1000) in 1× PBS on shaker at room temperature for 30–35 min followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (prepared in 1× PBS). Post-fixation tissues were washed with 0.3% PBS-Triton four times at 10 min interval followed by 30–35 min of blocking in 10% NGS in 0.3% PBS-Triton. EdU staining solution as per manufacturer’s instruction (for 50 μl staining solution, 43 μl 1× EdU buffer, 2 μl CuSO<sub>4</sub> solution, 5 μl 1× EdU buffer additive, 0.12 μl Alexa solution) was used to stain the sample for 30 min at room temperature. Two quick washes with 0.3% PBS-Triton was followed by a quick wash in 1× PBS.

Subsequent processing of the samples was the same as mentioned above in the Immunohistochemistry section, except that no detergent was used.</p><p>Protocol described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayers et al., 2010</xref> was used as a reference to perform quantitation. A rectangle (500 × 150 pixels) was drawn, spanning from the niche to the cortical zone diagonally with the medullary zone in the middle, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. An extracellular Hedgehog profile was made using the ‘Plot Profile’ tool of ImageJ. The Plot profile tool displays a ‘column average plot’, wherein the x-axis represents the horizontal distance through the selection and the y-axis the vertically averaged pixel intensity, which in this analysis is formed by extracellular Hedgehog staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Filopodial detection and quantitation</title><p><italic>UAS-GMA</italic> was used to label the filopodia using a niche-specific driver, <italic>Antp-GAL4</italic>.

These tissues were then mounted and imaged directly under the confocal microscope.</p><p>The intact PSC cells are often scattered when we carry out a live analysis. This is mainly due to imaging requirements that demand a coverslip to be placed on the sample. The coverslip creates a pressure on the unfixed/live sample leading to the scattering of the cells.</p><p>Filopodial quantitation was done using ImageJ. The number of filopodia emanating from the niche in all the Z-stacks was counted manually per sample. The average number of filopodia emanating per sample was plotted using GraphPad Prism for different biological replicates. For filopodial lengths, the ‘Freehand line’ tool was used to mark the entire filopodial lengths, and the ‘Measure’ tool was employed to get values in µM. Filopodial lengths in all samples were then plotted collectively as individual points in GraphPad Prism.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Phalloidin staining</title><p>Lymph glands dissected were fixed and incubated in rhodamine-phalloidin (1:100 in PBS) (Molecular Probes) for 1 hr.

This study identified how Relish in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval hematopoietic niche contributes to hematopoiesis during normal growing conditions and how it achieves a switch to immune responses upon bacterial infections. The primary claims are well–supported, and this study will highly contribute to insect hematopoiesis and immunity.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Nevetherless, you still has the possibility to re–submit a revised version but this will be considered as a new submission.</p><p>The two reviewers were quite enthusiast about the manuscript but they also find that there are too many issues to solve before acceptation that cannot be addressed in the two month time frame. Note that you still have the opportunity to re–submit a revised manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic> that will be considered as a new submission and likely be reviewed by the same reviewers. Unfortunately, we did not get answer from a third reviewer. In the eventually of a resubmission, we will contact an additional reviewer. At this stage you should decide if you wish to submit a revised manuscript that address the point or move your paper to another journal.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Mandal and colleagues identified a novel role for Relish in the hematopoietic niche development and its coordinative function with immune responses. The authors found that Relish is enriched in the PSC and loss of which causes a dramatic reduction of hematopoietic progenitors. Interestingly, the loss of Relish in the PSC causes the proliferation of PSC cells through activation of Wg and alters the actin cytoskeletal structure of the PSC, in turn trapping Hh in the PSC. The authors also observed that these phenotypes are led by ectopic activation of <italic>JNK</italic> through <italic>TAK1</italic>. The authors moved on to find the developmental and physiological relevance of this phenomenon and discovered that EcR signaling activates Rel in the PSC during normal development while innate immunity attenuates the Rel expression in the PSC.</p><p>This study first describes the novel role of Relish in blood development and its association with ecdysone signaling as well as with innate immunity.

They establish that relish is expressed in PSC cells and that reducing its expression in these cells (by expressing relish RNAi with a PSC–gal4 driver) leads to an enlarged PSC, increased plasmatocyte differentiation, no effect on crystal cell numbers, and fewer progenitors in the medullary zone (MZ). In the PSC, Relish controls Wingless levels that in turn control PSC cell proliferation and thus PSC size. This study also establishes that the knock down of relish in the PSC leads to increased levels of several actin binding proteins, reduced filopodia formation in PSC cells and a decrease in Hh (HhExt) release from the PSC. In addition, relish knock–down in the PSC leads to the activation of the <italic>JNK</italic> pathway in the PSC.

This reference should be cited in the manuscript. Whether the bacteria–induced decrease of Relish in the PSC is involved in the LG stress hematopoiesis is not established here since there are many discrepancies between LG phenotypes in PSC&gt;rel RNAi larvae and in response to bacterial infection and rescue experiments are lacking. While in both cases there is an increase in plasmatocyte differentiation, there is no difference in PSC size in response to bacterial infection (which differs from PSC&gt;rel RNAi LGs), and there is no LG disruption in PSC&gt;rel RNAi larvae (which differs from bacterial infection). Furthermore, the LG disruption in response to bacterial infection is a novel data, but unfortunately it is not properly documented in this manuscript.

That an increase in blood cell differentiation occurs in the LG in response to bacterial infection has already been described (Khadilkar et al;, 2017). This reference should be cited in the manuscript. Whether the bacteria–induced decrease of Relish in the PSC is involved in the LG stress hematopoiesis is not established here since there are many discrepancies between LG phenotypes in PSC&gt;rel RNAi larvae and in response to bacterial infection and rescue experiments are lacking. While in both cases there is an increase in plasmatocyte differentiation, there is no difference in PSC size in response to bacterial infection (which differs from PSC&gt;rel RNAi LGs), and there is no LG disruption in PSC&gt;rel RNAi larvae (which differs from bacterial infection). Furthermore, the LG disruption in response to bacterial infection is a novel data, but unfortunately it is not properly documented in this manuscript. Finally, in bacterial infection experiments, no data relative to a role of Hh or JNK pathway in PSC cells have ever been described so far.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your inputs.
