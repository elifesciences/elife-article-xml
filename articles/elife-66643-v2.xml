Cellular mechanical properties, especially stiffness, are essential to regulate cell functions. However, T cell stiffness at a subcellular level at the IS still remains largely elusive. In this work, we established an atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based elasticity mapping method on whole T cells to obtain an overview of the stiffness with a resolution of ~60 nm. Using primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we show that when T cells form IS with stimulating antibody-coated surfaces, the lamellipodia are stiffer than the cell body. Upon IS formation, T cell stiffness is enhanced both at the lamellipodia and on the cell body. Chelation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> abolishes IS-induced stiffening at the lamellipodia but has no influence on cell-body-stiffening, suggesting different regulatory mechanisms of IS-induced stiffening at the lamellipodia and the cell body.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>stiffness</kwd><kwd>immunological synapse</kwd><kwd>lamellipodia</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>primary CD4+ T cells</kwd><kwd>Jurkat T-cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1027 A2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qu</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1027 B2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bischoff</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP1782 ID79/2-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iden</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001664</institution-id><institution>Leibniz-Gemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INM Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qu</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1027 A12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iden</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Upon activation of T cell receptors at the contact site, T cells were substantially stiffened at the cell body as well as at the lamellipodia, which is mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>T cells are activated by the engagement of T-cell receptors (TCRs) with the matching antigen on the target cells. Consequently, CD3 molecules, one key component of the TCR complex, transduce the signal to activate downstream pathways leading to formation of a tight contact between T cells and target cells termed the immunological synapse (IS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bromley et al., 2001</xref>). During IS formation, the adhesion molecule LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1) binds its ligand ICAM1 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1) on the target cells to seal and stabilize the IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bromley et al., 2001</xref>). Upon T cell activation, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is drastically enhanced via Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Ca<sup>2+</sup> serves as an essential second messenger in T cells to regulate their activation, proliferation, and effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trebak and Kinet, 2019</xref>). Artificial IS can be also induced between T cells and functionalized surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de la Zerda et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Recently, it has been revealed that mechanical properties play a significant role in modulation of T cell functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harrison et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rossy et al., 2018</xref>). Cytotoxic T cells optimize their killing function via applying mechanical forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2016</xref>), where the mechanic output is coordinated with release of cytotoxic granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tamzalit et al., 2019</xref>). Force generation of T cells requires a sustained elevation of intracellular calcium and integrity of a functional F-actin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, even when the actin-cytoskeleton is perturbed, application of periodical mechanical forces linked to TCRs can still induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, responsiveness of T cells to stimuli is elevated on stiffer substrates (40–50 kPa) relative to their softer counterparts (&lt; 12 kPa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Majedi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Recent findings indicate that LFA-1 engagement plays an essential role in regulating T cell responsiveness to substrate stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wahl et al., 2019</xref>). However, how the stiffness of T cells per se is regulated upon IS formation is still not well understood.</p><p>Various methodologies have been developed to investigate cell stiffness, for example micropipette aspiration, microplate-based rheometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Desprat et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hochmuth, 2000</xref>), high-throughput real-time deformation cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fregin et al., 2019</xref>), optical tweezers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Killian et al., 2018</xref>), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The differences of these methods were discussed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). AFM uses a mechanical probe (also called cantilever) to measure stiffness at defined regions, which is also applicable on living cells. For this purpose, the cantilever is usually brought into oscillation in close proximity to the cell surface to allow periodical contacts between the cantilever and the surface. This setting enables the measurement of local interacting forces at each point of a defined scanning grid, allowing the examination of height profiles, and to measure mechanical properties with nanometer spatial and pN force resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thewes et al., 2015</xref>). These features enable a precise determination of local stiffness at the site of interest, which is pivotal for characterization of mechanic properties at the IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de la Zerda et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we established an AFM-based method to simultaneously determine the surface profile and stiffness of live T cells. Human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were immobilized on glass coverslips via adhesion molecule LFA-1 with or without CD3/CD28 activation. We found at the lamellipodia, the stiffness was significantly higher than that at the cell body. Remarkably, upon formation of IS induced by CD3/CD28 stimulation, T cells were substantially stiffened at the cell body as well as at the lamellipodia. By chelating intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> with EGTA-AM, we identified that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is involved in regulation of this IS formation-induced T cell stiffening at the lamellipodia but not at the cell body.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>T cells are stiffened upon IS formation</title><p>To examine the stiffness of T cells upon IS formation, we established a method to investigate living T cells on functionalized coverslips by AFM based Peak Force Quantitative Nanoscale Mechanical Characterization (Peak Force QNM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berquand et al., 2010</xref>). We first functionalized polyornithine-coated coverslips with anti-LFA-1, anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. CD28 is a co-stimulatory molecule, essential for sustained T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Esensten et al., 2016</xref>). Without anti-LFA-1 antibody T cells did not attach to the surface, which is a prerequisite to determine cell stiffness by AFM. We first settled Jurkat T cells, which present features of effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Weiss, 2004</xref>), on the functionalized coverslip for 15 min. Subsequently, a quarter of each cell was investigated by Peak Force QNM at a resolution of ~60 nm between measurements to create a high-density map of local elastic moduli (Young’s moduli determined by Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov fit). We observed that after making contact with antibody-coated coverslips, Jurkat T cells formed flattened spreading structures (hereinafter referred to as lamellipodia), which dynamically changed over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similar dynamic changes were also observed with primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with the same experimental setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This morphology of lamellipodia detected by AFM resembles findings made by scanning electron microscopy and immunostaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saitakis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schoppmeyer et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, complete height profiles were obtained, showing that T cells were flattened on the functionalized surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting a functional artificial IS was formed as observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pattu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Qu et al., 2011</xref>). To simplify, the artificial IS formed between T cells and functionalized surface is referred to as IS in this work.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Representative time points of lamellipodial dynamics at the IS.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Dynamic changes of the lamellipodium of a Jurkat T cell (<bold>A</bold>) or a human primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell (<bold>B</bold>) during IS formation on a αLFA-1+αCD3+αCD28 antibody-coated coverslip.

The latter condition induces only T cell attachment to the surface. Our results show that on the full antibody set-decorated surfaces, primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibited a significantly enhanced stiffness at both the lamellipodial regions and the cell body relative to their counterparts on control surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), with a fold change of 2,5-fold and twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>), respectively.

Notably, cytoskeleton serves as scaffolds at the protrusions such as actin filaments or microtubules. The diameters of these filamentous structures (~ 5–25 nm) is, however, far below the resolution (~ 60 nm) of our experimental setting. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that along these cytoskeletal filaments the elasticity may differ from the neighboring structures.</p><p>We further examined whether the stiffness of lamellipodia measured by this method could be influenced by stiffness of the substrate rigidity. In order to address this, we first used Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates with a stiffness of 2.5 MPa. The stiffness of the lamellipodia of primary T cells was characterized on a full body-functionalized PDMS surface using the same settings as for glass coverslips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). No significant difference in stiffness was observed between glass and PDMS surface for the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) or at the lamellipodium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). On the PDMS surface, stiffness of lamellipodia was significantly higher than that of cell body and the fold change was very similar to that on glass coverslips (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Next, we used even softer PDMS substrates with an elasticity of ~400 kPa, on which the IS could be formed and lamellipodial regions could be analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Notably, no significant changes were identified in the Young's moduli of the lamellipodia of T cells formed on the full antibody-functionalized softer PDMS substrates (400 kPa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), compared to the ones measured on full antibody-functionalized glass or stiffer PDMS substrates (2.5 MPa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). These findings indicate that the Young’s moduli determined for the lamellipodial regions in the range of hundreds of kPa were not markedly influenced by the stiffness of the substrates used. In addition, to further reduce the risk of a potential influence of the backing material stiffness on our measurements, we applied a peak force threshold of 700 pN during elasticity mapping, which caused an indentation of 21 ± 2.2 nm into the cell body and 17 ± 4.7 nm into the lamellipodia, respectively. Since the lamellipodia displayed a mean height of 144 ± 69.7 nm we can largely exclude an impact of the substrates on the Young’s moduli examined for the lamellipodia.</p><p>During our analyses, we noticed that the stiffness on cell-free functionalized glass coverslips was in a range of several hundred kPa to several MPa, which is much lower than the expected stiffness of glass (which lies in the range of GPa). To elucidate the reason for this, we first examined the stiffness of uncoated glass coverslips. Since the expected Young’s moduli are in the range of GPa, we used a stiffer cantilever with a spring constant of 0.8 N/m and experimental settings suitable to characterize hard substrates (For further details please see Materials and methods). Young’s moduli of uncoated glass coverslips were around 1 GPa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), verifying that with these experimental conditions our system is able to detect the stiffness in the GPa range. Next, we determined the Young’s moduli of uncoated substrates with a soft cantilever and the experimental settings applied to characterize the stiffness of T cells. The average Young’s moduli of uncoated glass coverslips were around 18 MPa with the highest values around 20 MPa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), which is clearly below the stiffness values determined with the stiffer cantilever and suggestively the upper limit of the Young’s moduli that can be determined by these experimental conditions optimized for determination of T cell stiffness. Nevertheless, the Young’s moduli of uncoated PDMS substrates (2.5 MPa and 400 kPa) were in the expected range, indicating that up to 2.5 MPa the stiffness can be precisely determined by the corresponding experimental conditions. Next, we analyzed the substrate rigidity for each value of our existing datasets from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. We found that the functionalization of stiffer substrates (i.e. glass and 2.5 MPa PDMS) with αLFA-1 or αLFA-1+αCD3+αCD28 created surfaces with drastically reduced Young’s moduli of around 600–700 kPa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), while the stiffness of the αLFA-1+αCD3+αCD28 functionalized softer PDMS (~400 kPa) was comparable to the uncoated PDMS (400 kPa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This indicates that antibody-functionalization substantially decreases the apparent stiffness of the cantilever-accessible upmost surface layer of stiff substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>T cell stiffening is regulated by calcium</title><p>We next sought for the underlying mechanism regulating T cell stiffening triggered by TCR-activation. Since the cytoskeleton plays an important role in maintaining cell stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gavara and Chadwick, 2016</xref>), we first targeted the actin-cytoskeleton with latrunculin-A (actin polymerization inhibitor) as well as the microtubule-network with nocodazole (a microtubule depolymerizing agent). Not surprisingly, with the disassembly of the cytoskeleton, T cells failed to attach to the functionalized surface firmly enough for AFM measurements. Next, we turned our focus to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We chelated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> with EGTA-AM (dissolved in DMSO) and found that the lamellipodia formed by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-chelated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibited a substantially lower stiffness compared to their vehicle (DMSO)-treated counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Notably, the stiffness of the cell body was not affected by Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In both DMSO and EGTA-treated conditions, the stiffness of lammellipodia was higher than that of the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). These results indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is involved in regulating stiffening of the lamellipodia but not of the cell body upon IS formation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Activation-induced T cell stiffening is regulated by intracellular calcium.</title><p>Primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were treated with either EGTA-AM or DMSO at room temperature for 30 min.

However, such a transient and moderate elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> would substantially inhibit the release of cytotoxic granules as shown in very low extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> condition (3 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, our observation that chelation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> reduced the stiffness only at the lamellipodia but not the cell body suggests that sustained or higher levels of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> might be required to stiffen lamellipodia, and the stiffened lamellipodia could be important for vesicle fusion at the IS. We postulate that local rearrangement of cytoskeleton might contribute to a large extent to this Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent stiffening at lamellipodia induced by IS formation. On one hand, integrity of actin-cytoskeleton is essential in T cells to generate mechanical forces at the IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fritzsche et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, fast growth of microtubules in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at the contact site between anti-CD3 antibody-coated coverslip is observed, and the traction stresses at the IS generated by actomyosin contractility is increased after disassembly of the microtubule-network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hui and Upadhyaya, 2017</xref>). In addition, cytoskeleton-regulatory proteins such as ROCK and cofilin might be involved in this Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent local stiffening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thauland et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In our work, the range of the determined Young’s moduli is considerably higher than some of the previously reported ones, which were in a range of tens to hundreds of Pa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butcher et al., 2009</xref>). However, it is important to note that the studies discussed in the aforementioned review used nanoindentation experiments to determine the Young’s moduli. Compelling evidence in recent years shows that AFM experiments are influenced by a multitude of parameters, such as the subsurface material, the choice of the cantilever, the contact model applied, environmental conditions, and the measurement mode. In our work, the Peak Force QNM mode, also known as Peak Force Tapping mode, was applied, which has the advantage to dynamically modulate the <italic>z</italic> piezo below the cantilever resonance frequency, allowing detailed mapping of cells in a reduced amount of time. Unfortunately, the direct comparability of Young’s moduli obtained with this method to elasticity data obtained with classical nanoindentation methods, which reported Young’s moduli in the Pa range, seems to be mostly lost. However, the Young’s moduli reported here for T cells are in good agreement to other elasticity data published for different human cell types with the Peak Force QNM mode. For instance, a work investigated the glyphosate induced stiffening of human keratinocytes (HaCaT) by applying the Peak Force QNM mode. Here, Young’s moduli of approximately 50–300 kPa in HaCaT were determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heu et al., 2012</xref>). Another study utilized the Peak Force QNM mode to address the role of cholesterol assemblies on the mechanical behavior of mammalian breast cancer cells (MCF10), and observed Young’s moduli of approximately 5–44 kPa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dumitru et al., 2020</xref>). Calzado-Martin et al. studied the effect of actin organization on the stiffness of breast cancer cells lines by Peak Force QNM mode, which revealed Young's moduli of approximately 50–150 kPa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calzado-Martín et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the reduction of the Peak Force QNM modulation frequency from 250 Hz to 1 Hz resulted in a tremendous decrease in the absolute values of Young’s moduli of more than 2 orders of magnitude, which further emphasizes the impact of varying measurement parameters during elasticity mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calzado-Martín et al., 2016</xref>). A recent review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2021</xref> emphasizes the technical improvements and advantages of the Peak Force QNM mode and specifically recommends this AFM mode for immunological applications.</p><p>Previous approaches to study the stiffness of T cells utilized among others microplate and micromanipulation techniques, and reported Young’s moduli of around 100 Pa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bufi et al., 2015</xref>) and 50 kPa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Du et al., 2017</xref>), respectively. For the microplate approach, the contact area between the flexible microplate and the T-cell is considerably large, close to the diameter of the whole cell. Earlier AFM approaches carried out to determine the stiffness of immune cells utilized a glass or silicon sphere (diameter around 1–5 µm) attached to the cantilever to measure cell stiffness, and reported Young’s moduli in the range of a few hundred Pa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sadoun et al., 2021</xref>) to several thousand Pa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blumenthal et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, we used cantilevers with a pyramidal, rounded tip (diameter: ~ 60 nm). Considering that microbead pillows are very soft but microbeads per se are stiff, cell stiffness measured from a larger scale could differ from its local microscale stiffness. Of note, the methods used to measure cell stiffness in a larger scale is not suitable to determine stiffness of lamellipodial regions.</p><p>When scanning the vicinities of the attached T cells, we noticed that some points on glass coverslips were particularly soft (around 100–400 kPa). Thus, we carefully compared the elasticity mapping and the height profiles, and found that most soft points from the elasticity mapping overlap with small ‘bumps’ in the height profiles, which seem to be connected to the lamellipodia with thin fibers (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). These small bumps might be cell debris left on the surface after retraction of lamellipodia as shown in lamellipodial dynamics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (compare 40 min to 20 min).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jurkat E6.1 cell line</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC Cat# TIB-152, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0367">CVCL_0367</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Primary human CD4+ T cells</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from healthy donors provided by Institute of Clinical Hemostaseology and Transfusion Medicine.

compared to tissue-cells that are now relatively well known. This excellent work will undoubtedly be of interest to immunologists and scientists interested in cell mechanics.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;T cell stiffness is enhanced upon formation of immunological synapse&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alphee Michelot (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The elasticity maps scale in MPa range. The values for the Young's moduli are surprisingly high in the range of hundreds of kPa, suggesting that the underlying glass surface might have influenced the absolute values.</p><p>The authors should provide compelling arguments to prove that the observed stiffening of the lamellipodium and cell body of T cells is free of influence from the glass surface.</p><p>Ideally, the authors should confirm their claims by repeating the measurements on antibody functionalised hydrogels (in the MPa range to limit the effects of mechanosensation) for resting and activating Jurkat or primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (or any other means in the spirit of the hydrogel to exclude the influence of the substrate).</p><p>2. The manuscript often lacks details. Figure Legends are too succinct. A clear Legend for each panel of each Figure is necessary.</p><p>Also, could the authors please provide additional information in the statistics statement in the method section? Information about the number of cells and independent experiments performed are hard to find. The precise number of measurements, experiments and biological replicates need to be reported for each data set. Representative force curves and histograms of all values as supplementary data should be included. The choice of the two kinds of statistical tests should be briefly elaborated.</p><p>3. The authors should make full use of the spatial high resolution of the stiffness maps in space (instead of quantifying only small 500µm x 500 µm regions). It might be very helpful to understand how the mechanical environment influences locally the T cell stiffness upon activation. Zooms into the stiffness maps and correlations to the cell protrusions may uncover further detail, and thus strengthen the breadth of the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this paper, the authors investigate T cell stiffness changes upon CD3/CD28 activation. Jurkat T cells or Primary T cells are plated on surfaces coated with the adhesion molecule LFA-1, in the presence or in the absence of CD3/CD28. Cell shape and stiffness are probed with AFM.</p><p>Results indicate a clear stiffening of these cells upon CD3/CD28 activation. Interestingly, calcium chelation reduces stiffening of lamellipodia but not of the cell body, suggesting different regulatory mechanisms.</p><p>The observations seem interesting and solid, though additional experimental support would make the paper stronger.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The mechanics of lymphocytes, such as T cells, remains relatively less explored as compared to tissue-cells that are now relatively well know. The authors use AFM to map the elasticity of whole T cells at sub-micron scales, using both Jurkat and primary cells. They relate the cell-stiffness to the activation state of the cell. They find a calcium dependent stiffening response upon spreading of the cell to form an immune synapse.</p><p>These results will be of great interest to both immunologists and the cell mechanics community.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Jung et al. employ AFM measurements to quantify cellular architectures of Jurkat and primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during antibody-mediated activation. The authors report changes in the stiffness of the cells, which are abolished in the absence of intra-cellular calcium release.</p><p>While the study on the influence of the mechanical environment on T-cell activation is important and timely, in my view, the authors do not provide convincing enough evidence for their claims, and thus the findings appear problematic without further controls. The present study reports high values for the stiffness of resting and activated Jurkat and primary T cells compared to other cell types (Ahmad et al., Micro and Nano Systems Letters 2014, Mandriota et al., Nature Methods 2019), highlighting the need for appropriate controls.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;T cell stiffness is enhanced upon formation of immunological synapse&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>We discussed with the Reviewers and agree that your manuscript has been improved.

In Figure 2M, please write the cell type as you did in the other panels and specify the PDMS stiffness.</p><p>2. Your statements line 233/234 that &quot;Apart from these particularly soft spots, the general Young's moduli measured on the glass coverslips are in the range of several to 10Mpa&quot; and line 241/242 &quot;Noticeably, on the functionalized PDMS surface, Young's moduli ranged from a few hundred kPa to 2.16 Mpa, similar to our observations made on the functionalized glass coverslips&quot; seem contradictory. It is obvious from many images (e.g. Figure 2G) that Young moduli measured on functionalized glass coverslips is sometimes well below 1 MPa. Does your statement line 233/234 correspond to experiments with cells on non-functionalized surfaces that are not present in this manuscript?</p><p>It is clear that surface coating can very well influence the apparent rigidity of the surface and it is necessary to quantify this point unambiguously. I say that because Figure 2, for example, gives a visual impression that glass surfaces with αLFA-1 are generally softer than surface with αLFA-1+αCD3+αCD28 (which is probably wrong, but impossible to determine from the images of Supplementary Figure 2 which are plotted with different color scales). As substrate rigidity has been a matter of debate in this review, could you please provide dotplots of measured substrate rigidities (from your exisiting data) for the different conditions (glass, PDMS 2.5 MPa and 400 kPa, non-functionalized or functionalized with αLFA or αLFA-1+αCD3+αCD28)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66643.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We agree that the stiffness of underlying materials might influence the results of AFM-based elasticity mapping. To address this concern, we followed the reviewer’s advice and used PDMS substrates with a stiffness of 2.5 MPa (rev. Figure 2M). The stiffness of primary T cells was characterized on a full antibody set (αLFA-1+αCD3+αCD28)-functionalized PDMS substrate using the same settings as for glass substrates. As shown in figure 2, no significant difference was observed between glass and PDMS for the cell body or at the lamellipodium (rev. Figure 2N,O). It indicates that the Young's moduli in the range of hundreds of kPa after activation is not due to the influence from glass substrates. This conclusion is further supported by our observation shown in rev. Figure 2 (A-D) in the manuscript, that at lamellipodia or cell body, the Young's moduli are in the range of tens of kPa in the control condition (αLFA-1).</p><p>This can be explained by the ratio between the thickness of the biomaterial layer and the indentation depth during elasticity mapping. We measured the mean thickness of the lamellipodium and the cell body which is 144 ± 69.7 nm and up to several µm, respectively. During elasticity mapping a peak force threshold of 700 pN was applied which caused a comparably small indentation of 17 nm (± 4.7) into the material of the lamellipodium and 21 nm (± 2.2) into the cell body. This is less than 12 % (lamellipodium) and 0.8 % (cell body) of the biomaterial layer. We can therefore largely exclude an impact of the underlying surface on the measured T cell stiffness. This information is part of the Results and Discussion section of the revised version of the manuscript (revised Figure 2M-O, text on Page 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

As suggested, the information about the number of cells/measurements and biological replicates have been added to the figure legends. Concerning force curves, the single Force Distance Curves were not saved in PeakForce QNM for the datasets in the original submission. However, since the reviewer pointed out, for the new experiments done for αLFA-1+αCD3+αCD28 functionalized-PDMS surface, we saved the curves and representative force curves are provided in Figure2—figure supplement 6. Elasticity maps for each cell are provided in Figure 2—figure supplement 2-5 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1-2. The choice of the statistical tests is explained in the Materials and methods section as follows:</p><p>“The differences between two groups were analyzed by either the Mann-Whitney test (<italic>unpaired test, not assuming Gaussian distribution</italic>) or the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (<italic>paired test, not assuming Gaussian distribution</italic>) as indicated in the figure legends.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors should make full use of the spatial high resolution of the stiffness maps in space (instead of quantifying only small 500µm x 500 µm regions). It might be very helpful to understand how the mechanical environment influences locally the T cell stiffness upon activation. Zooms into the stiffness maps and correlations to the cell protrusions may uncover further detail, and thus strengthen the breadth of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the reviewer’s advice and analyzed a bigger selection of individual spots on the lamellipodia, especially at tips/edges, close to the cell body, and in between (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, Young’s moduli are given individually). Here, we observed very similar Young’s moduli for these regions from the same cell, with (αLFA-1+αCD3+αCD28, the right column) or without (αLFA-1, the right column) the IS. This finding indicates that the elasticity within the lamellipodia is rather a universal property, which is not affected by the topology or the position of the micro-structures with an area of a few hundred nm<sup>2</sup>. Notably, cytoskeleton serves as scaffolds at the protrusions such as actin filaments or microtubules. The diameters of these filamentous structures (~ 5-25 nm) are, however, far below the resolution (~ 60 nm) of our method. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that along these cytoskeletal filaments the elasticity differs from the neighboring structures.

To further investigate the possibility of Young’s moduli being influenced by the stiffness of the underlying glass coverslip, we conducted as suggested additional experiments with primary T cells on αLFA-1+αCD3+αCD28 functionalized PDMS substrates with an elasticity of ~400 kPa. Even on this considerably softer substrate, no significant changes were identified in the Young`s moduli of the lamellipodia of T cells, compared to the ones measured on glass or on stiffer PDMS substrates (~2.5 MPa).

For nanoindentation experiments, the work from Butcher <italic>et al.</italic> can still serve as an excellent orienting scale to classify elastic moduli of living cells.</p><p>Remarkably, compelling evidence in recent years show that AFM experiments are influenced by a multitude of parameters, such as the subsurface material, the choice of the cantilever, the contact model applied, environmental conditions, and the measurement mode. Here, the Peak Force Tapping mode, initially introduced in 2010 and applied in our work, has the advantage to dynamically modulate the z piezo below the cantilever resonance frequency, which allows detailed mapping of cells in a reduced amount of time. However, the comparability to classical nanoindentation data seems to be mostly lost, as shown in the other studies. For instance, a work investigated the Glyphosate induced stiffening of human keratinocytes (HaCaT) by applying the Peak Force Tapping mode. Here, Young`s moduli of approximately 50 to 300 kPa in HaCaT were determined (Heu, Berquand et al., 2012). Another study utilized the Peak Force Tapping mode to address the role of cholesterol assemblies on the mechanical behavior of mammalian breast cancer cells (MCF10), and observed Young`s moduli of approximately 5 to 44 kPa (Dumitru, Mohammed et al., 2020). Calzado-Martin <italic>et al.</italic> studied the effect of actin organization on the stiffness of breast cancer cells lines by Peak Force Tapping, which revealed Young`s moduli of approx. 50 kPa to 150 kPa (Calzado-Martin, Encinar et al., 2016). Interestingly, the reduction of the Peak Force Tapping modulation frequency from 250 Hz to 1Hz resulted in a tremendous decrease in the absolute values of Young`s moduli of more than 2 orders of magnitude, which further emphasizes the impact of varying measurement parameters during elasticity mapping (Calzado-Martin et al., 2016). With all limitations in comparability, the Young’s moduli presented in our study are in a comparable range as described in the studies mentioned above, where the Peak Force Tapping mode was utilized. Therefore, we believe that a comparability between AFM results is only given, if very similar methodologies were applied, and even then the variation of single measurement parameters may have a tremendous impact on the Young`s moduli obtained. Of note, a recent review published in early 2021 by Li <italic>et.al.</italic> emphasizes the technical improvements and advantages of the Peak Force Tapping mode and specifically recommends this AFM mode for immunological applications (Li, Liu et al., 2021). Previous approaches to study the stiffness of T cells had utilized microplate and micromanipulation techniques, with Young’s moduli of around 100 Pa (Bufi, Saitakis et al., 2015) and 50 kPa (Du, Kalia et al., 2017), respectively. For the microplate approach, the contact area between the flexible microplate and the T-cell is considerably large, close to the diameter of the whole cell. For AFM approaches, in some studies a glass or silicon sphere (diameter around 1-5 µm) was attached to the cantilever to measure immune cell stiffness, with Young’s moduli in the range of a few hundred Pa (Sadoun, BiarnesPelicot et al., 2021) to several thousand Pa (Blumenthal, Chandra et al., 2020). In contrast, we used cantilevers with a pyramidal, rounded tip (diameter: 60 nm). Considering that microbead pillows are very soft but microbeads per se are stiff, cell stiffness measured from a larger scale could differ from its local micro-scale stiffness.</p><p>Taken together, we are convinced that the values reported here are reliably determined by the state-ofthe-art AFM approach with a high resolution (~60 nm). This high resolution is especially required for determination of lamellipodial stiffness, which cannot be measured by AFM with bigger sphere-shaped tips (1-5 µm) or the microplate technique. Therefore, our findings presented here will be of great interest for the scientific community.</p><p>Given the importance of this point, we have included it in Discussion section in Page 9-10.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below.

To address it, we firstly examined the stiffness of uncoated glass coverslips. Since the expected Young’s moduli are in the range of GPa, we used a stiffer cantilever with a spring constant of 0.8 N/m and experimental settings suitable to characterize hard substrates (Further details please see Methods). As shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2(A), Young’s moduli of uncoated glass coverslips were around 1 GPa, verifying that with these experimental conditions our system is able to detect the stiffness in the GPa range. Next, we determined the Young’s moduli of uncoated substrates with a soft cantilever and the experimental settings applied to characterize the stiffness of T cells. The average Young’s moduli of uncoated glass coverslips were around 18 MPa with the highest values around 20 MPa (B), which is clearly below the stiffness values determined with the stiffer cantilever and suggestively the upper limit of the Young’s moduli that can be determined by these experimental conditions optimized for determination of T cell stiffness. Nevertheless, the Young’s moduli of uncoated PDMS substrates (2.5 MPa and 400 kPa) were in the expected range, indicating that up to 2.5 MPa the stiffness can be precisely determined by the corresponding experimental conditions. Then as suggested, we analyzed the substrate rigidity for each value of our existing datasets. Concerning the datasets for primary T cells, the functionalization of stiffer substrates (i.e. glass and 2.5 MPa PDMS) with αLFA-1 or αLFA-1+αCD3+αCD28 created surfaces with drastically reduced Young’s moduli of around 600-700 kPa (B), while the stiffness of the αLFA-1+αCD3+αCD28 functionalized softer PDMS (400 kPa) was comparable to the uncoated PDMS (400 kPa) (B). This indicates that antibody-functionalization substantially decreases the apparent stiffness of the cantilever-accessible upmost surface layer of stiff substrates. These new data are included in the manuscript as revised Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and the corresponding text in Page 8-9.</p><p>For the dynamics of lamellipodia, we performed additional experiments with primary T cells. Dynamic changes of lamellipodia were also observed. We have included these new datasets as revised Figure 1B. Furthermore, the elasticity maps shown in the Supplemental Figures were revised to share the same data scale.</p></body></sub-article></article>
