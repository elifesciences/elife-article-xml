In response, governments have implemented travel restrictions and nonpharmaceutical interventions in order to limit introductions and reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brauner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chinazzi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flaxman et al., 2020</xref>). However, high levels of global infections have led to the evolution and emergence of variants of concern (VOCs) that are more transmissible, some of which encode putative mutations that evade immunity acquired from previous infection or vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harvey et al., 2021</xref>). These VOCs have led to resurging SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, hampering efforts to contain and control the pandemic worldwide. Of note, four such VOCs arose into global prominence in late 2020, including Alpha (Nextclade 20I; PANGO lineage B.1.1.7), Beta (20 H; B.1.351), Gamma (20 J; P.1), and Delta (21 J; B.1.617.2), causing substantial levels of transmission worldwide, with Alpha and Delta being the most common VOCs globally in 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campbell et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The Alpha VOC was first reported in the United Kingdom (U.K.) during the fall of 2020 and found to be 43‚Äì90% more transmissible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Volz et al., 2021</xref>) with greater mortality risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grint et al., 2021</xref>) than previously existing variants. Of the 17 amino acids mutations found in Alpha, N501Y in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein was predicted to increase binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Starr et al., 2020</xref>). This is also a common mutation found in Beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tegally et al., 2021</xref>) and Gamma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faria et al., 2021</xref>). On the other hand, the Delta VOC, first identified in India in October 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cherian et al., 2021</xref>), encodes P681R mutation in the furin cleavage site in spike protein and R203M mutation in the nucleocapsid protein that improves infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Syed et al., 2021</xref>). Delta has also been linked to increased disease severity, as well as greater and longer viral shedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ong et al., 2021</xref>). In the U.K., where the VOC was first detected in April 2021, epidemiological modelling estimated the VOC to be 40‚Äì80% more transmissible than Alpha.</p><p>The four aforementioned VOCs were also introduced into the Netherlands, with the Alpha and Delta VOCs subsequently dominating infections in the country in 2021. In a bid to deter introductions and slow down the spread of VOCs, the Dutch government implemented targeted flight restrictions on countries where these VOCs had first emerged. Various non-pharmaceutical interventions were also implemented as the country experienced multiple waves of infections between 2020 and 2021. Since the end of 2020, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment scaled up its sequencing efforts under a random national surveillance program. This detailed surveillance program allows the monitoring of the introduction and spread of novel variants or specific mutations. Here, SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were randomly collected across the country and 39,844 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes were sequenced between 22 September 2020 and 31 August 2021 (48 calendar weeks). We analyzed these sequences alongside epidemiological data to identify importation risks of novel variants into the Netherlands and characterize their subsequent patterns of spread within the country.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Whole genome sequencing</title><p>A total of 39,844 nasopharyngeal samples were randomly collected across all 25 GGD municipal health services across all municipalities in the Netherlands and were sequenced for whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

For samples analyzed by the laboratory of the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment (38,260 samples; 96% of all samples analyzed), total nucleic acid was extracted using MagNApure 96 (MP96) with total nucleic acid kit small volume (Roche). RT-qPCR was performed on 5 Œºl total nucleic acid using TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Thermo Fisher) on Roche LC480 II thermal cycler with SARS-like beta coronavirus (Sarbeco) specific E-gene primers and probe and EAV as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scheltinga et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Amplicon-based SARS-CoV-2 sequencing for was performed using the Nanopore protocol ‚ÄòPCR tiling of COVID-19 virus (Version: PTC_9096_v109_revE_06FEB2020)‚Äô which is based on the ARTIC v3 amplicon sequencing protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artic Network, 2020</xref>).

As proportions of cases for each VOC lineage are unknown for most countries, we subsampled global sequences downloaded from GISAID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org">https://www.gisaid.org</ext-link>; dataset up to 6 October 2021) by the proportion of COVID-19 cases reported per week for each country using data from the Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">http://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19</ext-link>). We aimed to sample 100 sequences each week. To ensure that countries that are underreporting cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gill et al., 2022</xref>) were included in our analyses, at least one representative sequence was included for each country with reported cases that week. The actual number of sequences sampled each week for each variant may differ because of sequence availability and the requirement to have at least one sequence from each country each week. For sequences from the Netherlands, we also subsampled Dutch sequences by randomly subsampling the number of sequences in each GGD region each week to the corresponding relative number of reported cases in the same week for that GGD region. As there may be certain weeks when our aforementioned strategy sampled less non-Netherlands sequences than Netherlands sequences, we would resample a larger number of non-Netherlands sequences accordingly such that there are at least twice as many non-Netherlands sequences as Netherlands sequences each week. The subsampling procedure yielded 6,365 (2,369), 1,531 (90), 1,274 (102) and 6,929 (1,035) Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta global (Dutch) sequences, respectively.</p><p>All sequences were aligned to hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 (WIV-04; EPI_ISL_402124) using MAFFT v7.427 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>).

This further reduced the number of sequences to a representative set of 3671, 496 and 575 and 2180 sequences for Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta VOCs respectively. We then reconstructed an ML phylogenetic tree again under the HKY +G nucleotide substitution model using IQ-TREE after removing any molecular clock outlying sequences identified by treetime. Here, however, we included the WIV-04 reference genome in the phylogeny reconstruction which was used as an outgroup for tree rooting. We then time-scaled these ML phylogenies using treetime, which were then used as fixed tree topologies in BEAST v.1.10.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Suchard et al., 2018</xref>) to perform Bayesian discrete phylogeographical analyses at the continental level.

Owing to rising case numbers, non-pharmaceutical interventions closing restaurants and nightlife establishments were implemented on 14 October 2020.

A curfew was also imposed later on 23 January 2021. A sharp drop in cases was observed after the implementation of the full lockdown. Alpha then displaced 20 A and 20E (EU1) over time to become the dominant circulating virus lineage by 16 February 2021 (week 6) for the rest of the lockdown period. Other VOCs such as Beta (N=422 sequences; first sequence was collected on 22 December 2020) and Gamma (N=350 sequences; first sequence was collected on 27 January 2021) were also detected by random surveillance in The Netherlands around the turn of the year but did not circulate to the levels of Alpha.</p><p>Alpha caused a rebound in cases around mid-March 2021, after which case numbers stabilized and eventually began to decline at the end of April 2021. The Dutch government began taking steps to relax restrictions around the same time, starting with the end of curfew and resumption of higher education during the week of 27 April 2021.

One of the reasons behind widespread transmission among young adults then was super-spreading linked to nightlife venues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koopsen et al., 2022</xref>). In response, the government shut nightlife establishments down again on 10 July 2021 (week 27). Case numbers fell promptly after but remained at over 30,000 new cases per week for the rest of the study period. The Delta VOC had in principle completely displaced Alpha by then with over 99% of randomly surveilled genomes sampled from August 2021 onwards.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Overseas introduction of variants of concern</title><p>To deter the introductions of novel VOCs into the Netherlands, travel restrictions were imposed on countries where the VOCs first emerged, including the United Kingdom between December 2020 and March 2021 due to the emergence of Alpha; South Africa and Brazil between January and June 2021 due to Beta and Gamma respectively; and India from April to June 2021 due to Delta.

On the other hand, travel within parts of the Schengen Area in Europe, which includes the Netherlands, remained largely possible during this period. To identify likely where and when VOCs were actually introduced into the country, we subsampled a representative set of Dutch and overseas sequences collected over the same time period. We then reconstructed time-scaled, maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies and used these fixed trees to perform discrete trait analyses using a Bayesian approach to infer likely overseas introductions at the continental level. This was done by identifying subtrees subtending Dutch sequences with ancestral states that were attributed to an overseas origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Given disparities in global sequencing efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brito et al., 2021</xref>), the random surveillance strategy used in local sample collection, and low genetic diversity among SARS-CoV-2 genomes used to reconstruct ancestral states, we are unable to fully and reliably quantify the number of introductions attributed to different geographical regions. However, many of the estimated regions for these ancestral states were in Europe (Alpha, 71% of all estimated overseas introduction events; Beta, 29%; Gamma, 71%; Delta, 79%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, these European introductions continue to occur during the targeted travel ban period. Inspecting the nearest phylogenetic ancestral taxon to the aforementioned subtrees, we found that many of these nearest overseas neighboring tips were detected in Belgium, Germany, France and Denmark where borders between the Netherlands remained open as well as other countries (e.g. Spain, U.K., Poland, U.S.) where no targeted travel restrictions were set in place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref>).

For the first four weeks since the initial detection of both VOCs within the country, introductions and phylogenetic branch movements were mostly concentrated in the more populous regions of the country, including North and South Holland, Utrecht and North-Brabant, forming a core of early dominant locations. During this period, dispersal events to regions outside of these GGD regions occurred as well but are relatively less frequent. However, as local infections were seeded in these areas, bidirectional exchanges in phylogenetic branches between different regions emerged throughout the country. These bidirectional exchanges continued to increase as prevalence of the VOC grew over time, even amidst a strict lockdown in the case of Alpha (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In particular for the Delta VOC, we observed a rapid spike in inter-regional spread upon the week of 22‚Äì28 June 2021, with &gt;400% estimated increase in total phylogenetic branch movements by 6 July 2021 (week 26).

As such, this regional vulnerability is not unique to the Netherlands and has been reported in other European countries as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lemey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Michaelsen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Osnes et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, regional introductions of novel lineages often drive new waves of infections in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lemey et al., 2021</xref>). Prior to September 2020, the dominant variant lineages (i.e. 20 A and 20E (EU1)) that circulated the Netherlands were already seeded by imports from its European neighbours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hodcroft et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nadeau et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oude Munnink et al., 2020</xref>). In fact, the initial introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands in February 2020 were attributed to travelers who visited Northern Italy where the earliest sustained European SARS-CoV-2 transmission network was seeded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oude Munnink et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Worobey et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we showed that all four VOC lineages detected in the country up to August 2021 also originated mainly from its European neighbors. Importantly, regional importation risks persisted throughout the period these VOCs circulated the country and overlapped with periods where targeted flight restrictions were imposed on countries where these VOCs first emerged. The emergence of the Omicron VOC in southern Africa in November 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Viana et al., 2022</xref>) again led to reactionary targeted flight restrictions by several countries in the Global North, including the Netherlands which was still amidst a surging Delta infection wave. However, the Omicron VOC was already detected in samples collected one week before the imposed flight restriction and did not prevent it to rapidly become the dominant VOC circulating in the Netherlands by the end of 2021 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19/virus/varianten/omikronvariant">https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19/virus/varianten/omikronvariant</ext-link>). Previous studies showed that travel restrictions are only useful if restrictions barred arrivals from most countries provided that local incidence is low in the first place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Russell et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Due to disparities in global genomic surveillance efforts and the lack of travel history information among the sampled Dutch individuals, we could not make more precise and accurate phylogeographic inferences on overseas introduction of VOCs into the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lemey et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, there were countries that are underrepresented or missing in our subsampling of non-Netherlands sequences. While we ensured that at least one sequence from each country with confirmed cases and genomic data was included in our analyses (see Methods), there may be overseas introductions that we could not account for. We repeated our overseas phylogeographic analyses with an independent bootstrap subsample of sequence data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplements 2</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>).

However, our conclusions that there were multiple introductions from other European countries before and after travel restrictions were imposed on countries where VOCs first emerged remain evident in the bootstrap analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We also found that early introductions of VOCs, specifically the Alpha and Delta VOCs, are more likely found in populous regions of the Netherlands, including Utrecht, North, and South Holland where larger cities are located that are also international and regional travel hubs. These areas constitute a core cluster of dominant source locations that also exported infections to the rest of the country during first few weeks after the VOC‚Äôs introduction into the Netherlands. As the number of infections in areas outside of these dominant source locations increase over time, bidirectional exchanges would also become more frequent. This type of asymmetric spatial spread dynamics had been previously shown in the U.K. as well and was found to enhance the intrinsic transmissibility of Alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kraemer et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, enhanced mobility has also been previously linked to the resurgence of outbreaks across Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hodcroft et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lemey et al., 2021</xref>). Recent work also showed that increased mobility and population mixing drove the rapid dissemination of Delta in the U.K. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McCrone et al., 2021</xref>). While our analyses do not provide a causal relationship between the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions and frequency of export events, the asymmetric exportation frequencies from dominant source locations, increased human mobility in weeks 25‚Äì27 across the country as well as the intrinsic higher transmissibility of Delta relative to Alpha likely all contributed to the widespread spike in cases in the Netherlands.</p><p>Novel and fitter variants of SARS-CoV-2 will likely continue to emerge in the future. Our results, along with others, show that unless well-coordinated actions are taken across Europe to mitigate importation risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ruktanonchai et al., 2020</xref>), targeted travel restrictions implemented by individual European countries will neither prevent nor slow down the introduction of novel variants. Our work also shows that early within-country spread of VOCs may be taken into future consideration in future genomic surveillance strategies, especially as countries are gradually considering scaling down SARS-CoV-2 surveillance efforts. Both the Alpha and Delta VOCs were first detected in the early dominant source locations, usually those that are more populous with greater international connections, and circulated mostly within these areas during the initial period after introduction. As such, a robust level of surveillance efforts should still be maintained in these dominant source locations to provide timely actionable information on novel variant detection as well as infection control. These surveillance efforts should encompass a minimal level of clinical diagnostic testing capacity be maintained to ensure clinical genomic surveillance remains sensitive enough for early detection of novel variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2022</xref>). Wastewater surveillance could also be included to facilitate early variant detection and identify cryptic transmissions amid falling testing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karthikeyan et al., 2022</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data availability</title><p>All sequencing data have been deposited in the GISAID database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org">https://www.gisaid.org</ext-link>) under the accession codes listed in .

All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Accession codes of all Dutch sequencing data that have been deposited in the GISAID database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org">https://www.gisaid.org</ext-link>).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-78770-supp1-v1.txt" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Acknowledgement table of authors of global genome sequence data deposited in the GISAID database that were used in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-78770-supp2-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-78770-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="repstand1"><label>Reporting standard 1.</label><caption><title>SRQR Checklist.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-78770-repstand1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All sequencing data have been deposited in the GISAID database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org">https://www.gisaid.org</ext-link>) under the accession codes listed in Supplementary File 1.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Regional importation and asymmetric within-country spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in the Netherlands&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Miles Davenport as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please streamline the narrative arc and logic of the paper. The reviewers questioned (including in the consultation session) what the estimation of variant growth rates adds to the analysis. It seems important to emphasize that the qualitatively estimated impacts of flight bans are if anything underestimated here, given other concurrent NPIs; please clarify which restrictions were in place. Please also see Reviewer 2's comment on the role of nightclubs.</p><p>2) There were technical concerns about the soundness of the results. It appears as though only one chain was used; several are traditional and safer. Biases might be introduced by the use of a strict vs. relaxed clock. A discrete phylogeographic model would be more appropriate. These improvements would lend greater confidence to the results. There should also be some treatment (at least in the Discussion) of the potential impact of sampling biases (inside and outside The Netherlands) on the results.</p><p>3) The reviewers found many of the figures confusing or unhelpful. Please revise them in light of the suggestions below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I realize this is pretty foundational to phylogeographic methods (and welcome being referred to a textbook or classic paper I have missed), but how sensitive are the results ‚Äì e.g., estimates of importation from ground travel/various areas---to sampling biases? For this question, I'm mostly thinking about deliberate subsampling biases (e.g., 2:1 Netherlands to non-Netherlands).</p><p>2. I'm curious about the potential magnitude of these effects due to biases in case ascertainment that might be poorly understood. In the U.S., there were many-fold differences in populations' access to testing and probability of being reported as a case, conditional on infection. These differences had strong socioeconomic and spatial associations. It seems deeply misleading to me to describe the sequencing as &quot;random.&quot; It's not, unless case identification was random, which it wasn't. Maybe you could say something like &quot;sequences were collected from a random sample of cases.&quot; But it would be good in the Methods and maybe the main text to describe exactly what is known about case ascertainment biases in The Netherlands over the study period, and the potential impacts of case ascertainment biases within The Netherlands and between countries on the estimated flows.</p><p>3. There's one mention of flight bans but otherwise &quot;restrictions&quot; is used. It would be useful to describe the restriction/ban on air travel precisely for people less familiar with the policies.</p><p>4. The github repo needs better documentation and structure to ensure reproducibility.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have found the manuscript in need of several improvements:</p><p>1. The focus of the manuscript is somewhat diffuse and at times misguided, where for example the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 introductions into the Netherlands seems fine, others are questionable like using continuous instead of discrete phylogeography, and the analysis of VOC growth rate differences feeling a bit pointless, especially in light of the narrative the authors seem to push regarding the role of nightclubs in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The authors should rethink the structure of the manuscript and what they want to say with it. If it's finding that travel restrictions do not achieve their goals ‚Äì perfect! But adding analyses to beef up the manuscript afterward doesn't add much to the story.</p><p>2. There are a couple of technical issues that should be addressed. Firstly, all Bayesian MCMC analyses describe a single chain which is not standard. Ideally, at least two independent runs are expected for any MCMC analysis. Secondly, some of the figures don't seem like they convey much information, e.g. Figure 1C, Figure 3, and the bottom panel in Figure 4, and their use should therefore be reconsidered.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript has potential but requires substantial effort to improve, starting with its scope.</p><p>As stated in the public review part I think the authors should reframe, and refocus their manuscript. I think a study on the ineffectiveness of targeted flight cancellations is worthwhile but I don't see the added value (or good justification) of using continuous (instead of discrete) phylogeography or the logistic regressions.</p><p>I should also say that the narrative being pushed about nightclub reopenings is very flimsy and potentially confounded with the Netherlands having an age-tiered vaccination programme with age groups being given access around June 2021. This is not mentioned at all in the text and offers an alternative hypothesis for the distribution of cases across age groups during the reopening. I understand the authors are officially not claiming that there is strong evidence for it but when it comes up more than once in the text and is part of the discussion I personally would like it to be backed up with more evidence and all caveats addressed properly.</p><p>Line 76 &quot;The four aforementioned VOCs also emerged in the Netherlands&quot; ‚Äì 'emerged' is often understood as 'originated', better to say 'arrived to' or 'dominated' here.</p><p>Figure 1A ‚Äì Middle panel should say &quot;Lineage proportions&quot; for clarity, consider labelling each dominant area with the lineage that it represents since the legend in Figure 1C contains too many colours.</p><p>Figure 1A ‚Äì The bottom panel should say &quot;Mobility change (percent)&quot; to make it intuitive.</p><p>Figure 1B ‚Äì I have a personal preference for neatly-delineated colour maps and it's up to the authors if they want to change the limits between incidence and sequences so they're, for example, multiples of 20s and 500s, respectively.</p><p>Figure 1C ‚Äì Not sure the tree is adding much here.</p><p>Line 143 &quot;and continued to accumulate in frequencies&quot; ‚Äì change to 'frequency'.</p><p>Figure 2 ‚Äì Worth shading European states with good sequencing programmes with a similar hue? Are those countries not flying passengers in?</p><p>Figure 3 ‚Äì This figure is so messy perhaps it's not worth using? If the authors are dead-set on having some representation of migrations maybe there are better ways of doing it rather than a mess that says &quot;there's a lot of movement&quot;?</p><p>Figure 4 ‚Äì Panel B is not labelled.</p><p>Geographic diffusion analyses indicate that more populous regions in the Netherlands play a large role in virus introduction and dissemination but surely this is entirely expected, given that such areas host transportation hubs for introductions and have more hosts to seed other areas.</p><p>Line 278 &quot;locatthed&quot; -&gt; &quot;located&quot;.</p><p>Paragraph 2 of the discussion contains passages that are more suitable for the Results section.</p><p>A very large dataset is analysed in BEAST so why did the authors decide to not use a relaxed clock and infer the rate naively? I find it very hard to believe that a dataset spanning close to a year would not have a temporal signal to inform the rate.</p><p>In all MCMC analyses, only one MCMC chain is mentioned. I'm sure the authors are aware that most studies are expected to run at least two independent ones, particularly with complex data like these.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Line 53: &quot;Coronavirus<sup>-1</sup>9 disease&quot; should be &quot;coronavirus disease 2019&quot;.</p><p>2. Line 88: samples were randomly selected for sequencing, not genomes.</p><p>3. Variants of concern (VOC), variants, and genotypes are used interchangeably. It would help to just pick of these and use them consistently.</p><p>4. I have a few suggestions regarding the visualization of Figure 1:</p><p>4.1. I would suggest using the Pangolin lineages as labels in panel C, and only list variants that are the focus of the study (all other lineages can be listed as &quot;other&quot;).</p><p>4.2. The colors for 20D, 20I, 21A, 21I, and 21J are very similar (same in Figure 4). I would suggest using more distinctive colors to make it easier to see which color represents each of the variants.</p><p>4.3. It would be helpful to indicate the first detection of Œë, Œí, Œì, and Œî in Figure 1a.</p><p>5. Line 129. Did S Gene Target Failure (SGTF) influence the first detection of Œë?</p><p>6. Figure 3. Panels B and D are hard to read, and may not be necessary to include. The advantage of only showing panels A and C is that their size can be increased.</p><p>7. Discussion. It would be helpful to start the discussion with a summary of the main findings. As raised before, I am not sure if the effect of international travel restrictions can really be distinguished from other interventions. Moreover, as Omicron was not part of the current study, I would refrain from speculating on the impact of those targeted flight restrictions as it is outside of the scope of the current study.</p><p>8. Limitations of the study are missing in the discussion.</p><p>9. Line 278: &quot;locathed&quot; should be &quot;located&quot;.</p><p>10. Line 310. Methods lack a description of the used nucleic acid extraction method and diagnostic assay. Methods should also include a description of the used bioinformatics pipeline with specifics for how consensus genomes were generated (e.g. minimum depth and minimum frequency threshold to call consensus).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78770.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Instead, the number of sequences sampled per country per week is proportional to the number of reported cases that week. We ensured that we have at least one sequence from each country in each week. We aimed to sample around 100 sequences each week (the number may differ because of available sequences and the requirement to have at least one sequence from each country each week). As our sampling strategy may result in less non-Netherlands sequences than Netherlands sequences for some VOCs each week, we would then resample the non-Netherlands sequences again with a larger sample size, ensuring that we have at least twice as many non-Netherlands as Netherlands sequence that week.</p><p>Overall, we aim to be as comprehensive as possible to have all countries represented each week in our sampling strategy. We have now made this clearer in our methods:</p><p>Line 464: ‚ÄúAs proportions of cases for each VOC lineage are unknown for most countries, we subsampled global sequences downloaded from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org; dataset up to 6 October 2021) by the proportion of COVID-19 cases reported per week for each country using data from the Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) (http://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). We aimed to sample 100 sequences each week. To ensure that countries that are underreporting cases (Gill et al., 2022) were included in our analyses, at least one representative sequence was included for each country with reported cases that week. The actual number of sequences sampled each week for each variant may differ because of sequence availability and the requirement to have at least one sequence from each country each week. We also subsampled Dutch sequences based on the weekly number of cases in different GGD regions as described above. As there may be certain weeks when our aforementioned strategy sampled less non-Netherlands sequences than Netherlands sequences, we would resample a larger number of non-Netherlands sequences accordingly such that there are at least twice as many non-Netherlands sequences as Netherlands sequences each week. The subsampling procedure yielded 6,365 (2,369), 1,531 (90), 1,274 (102) and 6,929 (1,035) Œë, Œí, Œì and Œî global (Dutch) sequences respectively.‚Äù</p><p>To check if our results are robust to sampling, we repeated our analyses with an independent sample bootstrap and found similar results as before:</p><p>Line 360: ‚ÄúWe repeated our overseas phylogeographic analyses with an independent bootstrap subsample of sequence data (Figure 2 ‚Äîfigure supplements 2-3). There are differences in the estimated distributions of countries with nearest overseas neighboring sequences to Dutch subtrees (Figure 2 ‚Äîfigure supplement 1 and 3). However, our conclusions that there were multiple introductions from other European countries before and after travel restrictions were imposed on countries where VOCs first emerged remain evident in the bootstrap analysis (Figure 2 ‚Äîfigure supplement 2).‚Äù</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Maybe you could say something like &quot;sequences were collected from a random sample of cases.&quot; But it would be good in the Methods and maybe the main text to describe exactly what is known about case ascertainment biases in The Netherlands over the study period, and the potential impacts of case ascertainment biases within The Netherlands and between countries on the estimated flows.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included further details in the Methods on the sources of the samples and how they were sampled for analyses:</p><p>Line 426: ‚ÄúThese samples were collected through nationwide community testing programs including at test buses and health facilities (https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19/onderzoek/kiemsurveillance). Test-positive samples were randomly subsampled each week in each municipality to minimize case ascertainment bias. Only specimens with cycle threshold (Ct) values &lt; 30 were selected for whole genome sequencing.‚Äù</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

These travel restrictions include a ban on all incoming passenger flights except for those carrying cargo and medical personnel, on top of an entry ban for all non-European Union residents (Government of the Netherlands, 2021). On the other hand, travel within the Schengen Area of the European Union, which includes the Netherlands, remained possible during this period.‚Äù</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The focus of the manuscript is somewhat diffuse and at times misguided, where for example the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 introductions into the Netherlands seems fine, others are questionable like using continuous instead of discrete phylogeography, and the analysis of VOC growth rate differences feeling a bit pointless, especially in light of the narrative the authors seem to push regarding the role of nightclubs in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The authors should rethink the structure of the manuscript and what they want to say with it. If it's finding that travel restrictions do not achieve their goals ‚Äì perfect! But adding analyses to beef up the manuscript afterward doesn't add much to the story.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in the Introduction, this work aims to identify where novel SARS-CoV-2 VOCs are likely introduced into the Netherlands and then characterize the spread of these VOCs in the country after their introduction. We selected different methods for our phylogeographic analyses based on the resolution of data available. We opted to perform discrete phylogeography to identify where likely overseas importation events were occurring from since only country/regional-level of geographic data was available to us. On the other hand, as postcodes of sampled Dutch individuals were available to us and since within-country spread can be assumed to occur mostly in a geographically homogenous way across the country, we employed continuous phylogeography to characterize the within-country spread of the novel variants. Continuous phylogeography methods have also been used to characterize within-country SARS-CoV-2 spread dynamics in several countries, including the United Kingdom (Kraemer et al., Science 2021; McCrone et al., medRxiv 2022), Rwanda (Butera et al., Nat Comm 2021) and Belgium (Bollen et al., Nat Sci Rep 2021).</p><p>We have removed the logistic regression analyses on VOC growth rate differences as we agree it adds little to the narrative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. There are a couple of technical issues that should be addressed. Firstly, all Bayesian MCMC analyses describe a single chain which is not standard. Ideally, at least two independent runs are expected for any MCMC analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We had performed two independent Bayesian MCMC chains for our BEAST analyses. The maximum clade credibility trees were generated by combining the posterior distribution of trees from both chains. This is now explicitly stated in the Methods:</p><p>Line 592: ‚ÄúWe performed two independent chains, each with 300 million MCMC generations for each variant analysis, sampling every 50,000 steps. The first 100 million steps were discarded as burn-in. Assessment of convergence (effective sample size &gt; 200) for each chain was performed using Tracer v1.71 (Rambaut et al., 2018). The posterior distribution of trees from both chains were combined and resampled at every 100,000 steps to generate the maximum clade credibility tree.‚Äù</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, some of the figures don't seem like they convey much information, e.g. Figure 1C, Figure 3, and the bottom panel in Figure 4, and their use should therefore be reconsidered.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed Figure 1C and the bottom panel for Figure 4. We have revised and simplified Figure 3 to show the early within-country source-sink dynamics of Œë and Œî during the first four weeks after their initial detection in the Netherlands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the manuscript has potential but requires substantial effort to improve, starting with its scope.</p><p>As stated in the public review part I think the authors should reframe, and refocus their manuscript. I think a study on the ineffectiveness of targeted flight cancellations is worthwhile but I don't see the added value (or good justification) of using continuous (instead of discrete) phylogeography or the logistic regressions.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to comment 1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I should also say that the narrative being pushed about nightclub reopenings is very flimsy and potentially confounded with the Netherlands having an age-tiered vaccination programme with age groups being given access around June 2021. This is not mentioned at all in the text and offers an alternative hypothesis for the distribution of cases across age groups during the reopening. I understand the authors are officially not claiming that there is strong evidence for it but when it comes up more than once in the text and is part of the discussion I personally would like it to be backed up with more evidence and all caveats addressed properly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have removed all sections suggestive of nightlife reopening as the main driving force behind the spike in Œî transmissions in the Netherlands during July 2021.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 76 &quot;The four aforementioned VOCs also emerged in the Netherlands&quot; ‚Äì 'emerged' is often understood as 'originated', better to say 'arrived to' or 'dominated' here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now rephrased to: ‚ÄúThe four aforementioned VOCs were also introduced into the Netherlands‚Ä¶‚Äù.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1A ‚Äì Middle panel should say &quot;Lineage proportions&quot; for clarity, consider labelling each dominant area with the lineage that it represents since the legend in Figure 1C contains too many colours.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the y-label of the middle panel to ‚Äú<italic>Lineage proportions</italic>‚Äù.

Furthermore, there were countries that are underrepresented or missing in our subsampling of non-Netherlands sequences. While we ensured that at least one sequence from each country with confirmed cases and genomic data was included in our analyses (see Methods), there may be overseas introductions that we could not account for. We repeated our overseas phylogeographic analyses with an independent bootstrap subsample of sequence data (Figure 2 ‚Äîfigure supplements 2-3). There are differences in the estimated distributions of countries with nearest overseas neighboring sequences to Dutch subtrees (Figure 2 ‚Äîfigure supplement 1 and 3).
