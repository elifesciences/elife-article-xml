(LDs) and the endoplasmic reticulum. HepG2 cells and fibroblasts of patients lacking TANGO2 exhibit enlarged LDs. Quantitative lipidomics revealed a marked increase in lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and a concomitant decrease in its biosynthetic precursor phosphatidic acid (PA). These changes were exacerbated in nutrient-starved cells. Based on our data, we suggest that TANGO2 function is linked to acyl-CoA metabolism, which is necessary for the acylation of LPA to generate PA. The defect in acyl-CoA availability impacts the metabolism of many other fatty acids, generates high levels of reactive oxygen species, and promotes lipid peroxidation. We suggest that the increased size of LDs is a combination of enrichment in peroxidized lipids and a defect in their catabolism. Our findings help explain the physiological consequence of mutations in TANGO2 that induce acute metabolic crises, including rhabdomyolysis, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrhythmias, often leading to fatality upon starvation and stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TANGO2</kwd><kwd>lipid droplet</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>acyl-CoA</kwd><kwd>lysophosphatidic acid</kwd><kwd>lipid peroxidation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010198</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Asuntos EconÃ³micos y TransformaciÃ³n Digital, Gobierno de EspaÃ±a</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2019-105518GB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malhotra</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2020-SyG-Proposal No. 951146</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malhotra</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMBO ALTF 659-2021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lujan</surname><given-names>Agustin Leonardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H2020-MSCA-IF-2019-894115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wojnacki</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovaciÃ³n</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RYC-2016-20919</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Foresti</surname><given-names>Ombretta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TANGO2 emerges as a key regulator of fatty acid metabolism by likely affecting acyl-CoA production and utilization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 2006, we reported a collection of new genes required for transport and organization of the Golgi complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bard et al., 2006</xref>).â  These genes, monikered TANGO, include TANGO1, a transmembrane protein required for the organization of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites where it collects bulky molecules like collagens and stabilizes transient inter-organelle tunnels for their export to the next compartment of the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Raote and Malhotra, 2021</xref>).</p><p>TANGO2, a gene unrelated to TANGO1, lacks a transmembrane domain and is reported to be cytosolic and also localized to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jennions et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Milev et al., 2021</xref>). TANGO2 affects ER-to-Golgi transport and mitochondria physiology; however, its precise role in these compartments is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mingirulli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">BÃ©rat et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Milev et al., 2021</xref>)â .

What is the physiological role of TANGO2, and how do mutations in TANGO2 lead to fatality in conditions of starvation?</p><p>We show here that TANGO2 in mammalian cells localizes predominantly to mitochondria, but also partially to sites where the ER and lipid droplets (LDs) are juxtaposed to mitochondria. Knockdown of TANGO2 increased the size of LDs and elevated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Mass spectrometric quantification of cellular lipids revealed that TANGO2-deficient cells exhibited markedly high lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and low levels of phosphatidic acid (PA). These cells were also highly reduced in cardiolipin (CL), which is ordinarily produced from PA. Moreover, changes in these cellular properties were further exacerbated in cells cultured in low-nutrient media. Many of these features match properties in cells derived from patients with mutations in TANGO2. Based on our data, we propose that TANGO2 functions in lipid homeostasis at the level of acyl-CoA metabolism, and defects in lipid metabolism are the main cause of starvation-induced acute rhabdomyolysis, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrhythmias.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TANGO2 localizes predominantly to the mitochondria and transiently to LDs and ER</title><p>In humans, six isoforms of TANGO2 are produced by alternative splicing.

It is important to note that the anti-Tango2 antibody we have used here recognizes both isoforms in human cells, and tagged versions of both isoforms show the same intracellular location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As shown in the following sections, siRNA-based depletion affects all isoforms. Therefore, the effect of TANGO2 depletion on cell physiology is a result of reduction in the levels of all isoforms.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TANGO2 orthologs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In silico sequence alignment of TANGO2 orthologs in human (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>), zebrafish (<italic>D. rerio</italic>), fruit fly (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>), worm (<italic>C. elegans</italic>), and yeast (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) using T-COFFEE software.

Unfortunately, the commercially anti-TANGO2 antibodies are not suitable for immunofluorescence analysis. Therefore, we monitored the location of TANGO2 distribution dynamically in living cells. We generated C-terminally tagged version of Tango2 by in frame fusion with either mScarlet (TANGO2.Iso1-mScarlet) or EGFP (TANGO2.Iso1-EGFP). By transient transfections in HepG2 cells, we co-expressed these forms of TANGO2 with fluorescent markers of various subcellular organelles including, mitochondria (Mito-mTurquoise), ER (ER-mTurquoise), peroxisomes (Peroxisome-mTurquoise), and LDs (GPAT4-mNeonGreen). All images were acquired by live-cell confocal time-lapse microscopy to avoid fixation artefacts. We observed high colocalization (Pearson coefficient, <italic>r</italic> = 0.88) between TANGO2 and the mitochondria marker. TANGO2 was also enriched at sites of mitochondria closely juxtaposed to ER and LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

This procedure analyzes the radiation energy transfer from an excited fluorescent molecule (called the donor) to an acceptor molecule; this occurs when both molecules are within a range of 1â10 nm from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broussard et al., 2013</xref>). To explore the proximity of TANGO2 toTom20, HepG2 cells were transfected with TANGO2.mScarlet (red), fixed, and stained with anti-Tom20 antibody (green) followed by Alexa 633 secondary antibody. After photobleaching (white square) of Alexa 633 we observed a significant increase (p=0.0002) in mScarlet-fluorescence intensity compared to an unbleached region (yellow square), confirming an FRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâD</xref>).</p><p>To avoid potential artefacts from an uneven or abnormal protein expression by transient transfection, we generated stable cell lines expressing low levels of the C-terminally EGFP-tagged TANGO2 using lentiviral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tandon et al., 2018</xref>)â . Live imaging of stable cell lines revealed that TANGO2-GFP localizes predominantly to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). We also observed a diffuse cytosolic staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). To check whether TANGO2-EGFP is cleaved in our experimental conditions giving rise to different forms, we verified the size of expressed construct by sodium dodecyl sulfateâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSâPAGE) followed by western blotting with anti-GFP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). This revealed a single band that matches the expected molecular weight of EGFP-tagged TANGO2.</p><p>It is therefore reasonable to conclude that despite lacking a transmembrane domain, TANGO2 is attached predominantly to the mitochondrial outer membrane and at sites of mitochondria that are juxtaposed to the ER and the LDs. TANGO2 likely cycles between the cytoplasm and the membrane. The mechanism of how TANGO2 is recruited to the membrane is not known.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TANGO2-lacking cells contain larger LDs</title><p>As shown above, TANGO2 frequently appears at sites that are marked by LDs. This prompted us to test whether cells lacking TANGO2 are affected in any aspect of LDs. We silenced TANGO2 (siTANGO2) by standard siRNA-based procedures. A control was generated with non-targeting siRNA and described henceforth as Mock. The silencing procedure reduced TANGO2 levels by ~45% after one round of siRNA transfection. However, after two sequential rounds of transfection, a ~75% reduction in TANGO2 levels was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). We have used double sequential transfections to reduce TANGO2 levels in all experiments that follow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Mock HepG2 cells and TANGO2-depleted cells were cultured in medium (Dulbeccoâs Modified Eagleâs Medium, DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (DMEM complete) or OptiMEM without FBS (starvation) for 4 hr. Cells were then incubated with membrane permeant neutral lipid marker HCS LipidTOX Deep Red (red) and the DNA marker Hoechst-33342 (blue) for 30 min at 37Â°C followed by live-cell imaging. LDs were consistently larger in TANGO2-depleted cells compared to mock cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel). Moreover, nutrient-deprived TANGO2-depleted cells (Starvation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel) had even larger LDs. To confirm that these structures are indeed LDs, TANGO2-depleted HepG2 cells were fixed and visualized with an antibody to the LD-resident protein ADRP (red). Nuclear DNA in these cells was labeled with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; blue). There was indeed an increase in the size of ADRP-containing LDs upon depletion of TANGO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We developed a macro for ImageJ Software, to quantify this increased retention of neutral lipids upon depletion of TANGO2. This procedure analyzes <italic>z</italic>-stack images to determine the number and volume of each LipidTOX-positive particle. Five samples were used for each condition, with a total of 67 Mock cells and 75 TANGO2-depleted cells, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, total volume of LDs per cell (panel C) and the volume of each LD (panel D) were significantly higher in TANGO2 depleted compared to the Mock cells (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.002, respectively). However, the number of LDs in each cell remains the same regardless of the TANGO2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Therefore, the increase in size is not caused by fusion of smaller LDs under these experimental conditions. To further analyze the effect of TANGO2 on LDs size, we added 120 nM Oleic acid (OA), which is known to potentiate LD formation, at 37Â°C for 6 hr to TANGO2 transiently depleted HepG2 cells (Mock vs. siTANGO2) and fibroblasts from TANGO2 deficiency disorder (TDD) donors (WT vs. TAN043). Changes in the total volume of LDs were evaluated by fluorescence intensity (FI) of allophycocyanin (APC) corresponding to HCS LipidTOX with flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Three independent experiments were analyzed for each condition in triplicate. The loss of TANGO2 revealed a significant increase in total LDs volume compared to Mock HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) or wild-type fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). To reveal the cause for increased volume of LDs we analyzed their metabolism. To explore LD biogenesis in WT and TAN043 fibroblast, we generated three independent medium conditions of DMEM complete (control), adding 120 nM OA at 37Â°C for 6 hr in DMEM complete (+OA), or adding 120 nM OA at 37Â°C for 6 hr with the lipolysis inhibitor diethylumbelliferyl phosphate (DEUP) in DMEM complete (+OA + DEUP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). The inhibition of lipolysis in complete-medium conditions revealed a greater increase of LipidTOX marker in TANGO2-depleted fibroblasts compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). This result suggests a more prominent activation of the LD biogenesis in TANGO2-lacking fibroblasts. To test the effect on LD consumption, we added 240 nM OA at 37Â°C for 12 hr in DMEM complete medium. We then changed the supplemented OA medium with fresh-complete medium including DEUP to synchronize lipolysis initiation (+OA + DEUP), nutrient-free medium to activate starvation (+OA + Starvation) or nutrient-free medium with DEUP to block lipolysis (+OA + Starvation + DEUP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E</xref>).

PA has a central role as precursor of all components synthesized in the phospholipid biosynthetic pathway. In short, the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPATs) located in the ER (GPAT3/4) and OMM (GPAT1/2) membranes, catalyze the conversion of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) to LPA, by transferring a saturated fatty acid from Acyl-CoA. Then, the family of 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (AGPATs), with lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT) enzymatic activity, promote addition of an unsaturated fatty acid from acyl-CoA to LPA to form PA. Once formed, PA can generate diacylglycerol (DAG) after dephosphorylation by PA phosphatase enzymes (LPINs), or can reconvert to LPA by the action of phospholipase A2 (PLA2).</p><p>The expression of 13 enzymes involved in the phospholipid biosynthetic pathway was measured in three independent experiments by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).

The significance of these changes to TANGO2 function in physiology and pathology follows.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>LPA is acylated to generate PA by lipid-modifying enzymes. The fact that LPA increases and PA decreases suggests that acylation of LPA is defective in TANGO2-lacking cells. The enzymes (LPAATs) involved in these acylation reactions are transmembrane proteins and acyl-CoA produced in the cytosol has to be imported into the lumen by membrane-embedded transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonzalez-Baro and Coleman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu and Claypool, 2015</xref>). TANGO2 lacks a transmembrane domain and cannot therefore function as an enzyme to catalyze these reactions in the lumen or the membrane of the ER or mitochondria. We suggest TANGO2 likely functions on the cytoplasmic face of mitochondria and the ER in the synthesis of acyl-CoA, or a carrier protein for acyl-CoA collection, or its metabolism. Our data show that although predominantly located to mitochondria, there is an enrichment of TANGO2 at sites juxtaposed to ER. This could be the site of LPA to PA conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonzalez-Baro and Coleman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu and Claypool, 2015</xref>). We suggest that without TANGO2, acyl-CoA is unavailable for the synthesis of PA from LPA. As a result, LPA levels rise with a concomitant drop in PA. This effect is exacerbated in nutrient-starved TANGO2-depleted cells. We noticed an increase in the expression of GPAT and AGPAT in cells depleted of TANGO2. This suggests that cells sense a reduction in the levels of PA and upregulated these enzymes that convert G3P to LPA and LPA to PA. Why do not we see restoration of PA levels in TANGO2-depleted cells. There are two possibilities: (1) TANGO2 is necessary to collect acyl-CoA at the membrane and in its absence the cells do not have the pool of acyl-CoA available for producing PA. (2) In cells lacking TANGO2, there is an increase in ROS production, which modifies unsaturated fatty acids, which cannot be incorporated into PA. These possibilities remain untested.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A reduction in CL at the inner mitochondria membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Falabella et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paradies et al., 2019</xref>) is likely due to reduced LPA acylation because PA is a precursor to CL.

The authors showed that recombinant TANGO2 has low affinity binding to ferrous and ferric haem and adding recombinant TANGO2 to mitochondria enriched membrane fractions in vitro stimulated haem transfer to apo-myoglobin. They have concluded that haem is exported from the lumen into the cytoplasm by transmembrane transporters where it is captured by TANGO2 and subsequently transferred to specific clients. Surprisingly, this was observed even in trypsinized mitochondria and the authors concluded that cytoplasmic facing domains of transmembrane proteins or attached proteins are not required in TANGO2-mediated haem transfer. Why do TANGO2-depleted cells accumulate haem in mitochondria (or LROs)? If TANGO2 captures haem post its export from mitochondria, as is reported even in trypsinized mitochondria, then haem should be distributed into the cytoplasm and not retained in mitochondria or LROs. The data also do not explain the aggravated effects of TANGO2 depletion linked to human pathologies, including a lack of any obvious sign of anaemia as would be evident for defects in haem physiology. A plausible explanation for the data is that amphipathic haem is retained in mitochondria because of altered membrane lipid composition upon TANGO2 depletion.

A defect in PA levels impacts the synthesis of mitochondria CL, and to balance this deficiency, the cells use other potential substrates, such as the PG, to produce CL. The net effect is an imbalance in lipid composition or homeostasis that, we suggest, also increases ROS levels and promotes lipid peroxidation. The acyl-CoA pathway is also used for the synthesis of numerous fatty acids, and a defect in its production would change the form and function of LDs to influence cellular lipid homeostasis. Sacher et al. have reconstituted many features of TANGO2 mutations in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asadi et al., 2022</xref>)â . Interestingly, most of the aberrations in fly physiology are corrected, and an ER-to-Golgi transport defect in human cells by vitamin B5 supplement, which is used for the synthesis of CoA. In other words, loss of TANGO2 function is restored by replenishing or overdosing events leading to lipid neogenesis. CoA is used for acyl-CoA production, which is then used to acylate LPA to form PA. It has recently been shown that B-complex and multivitamins might prevent metabolic crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asadi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miyake et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sandkuhler et al., 2023</xref>). However, why do multivitamins ameliorate metabolic crises in TANGO2 patients? Based on our results, we suggest that it is likely a combined effect of multivitamins on their antioxidant properties and in stimulating new lipids biosynthesis. The starving cells rely heavily on lipids for ATP production, and TANGO2 depleted are therefore further stressed. Our findings thus reveal the physiological role of TANGO2 and provide a handle to understand how its functional loss triggers a variety of cardiac, muscular, and neurological pathologies leading to fatalities upon conditions of starvation and stress.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HepG2 cells (ATCC, Cat# HB-8065) were cultured in DMEM (Lonza, Cat# SH30243.01) cell culture media supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco, Cat# 10270-106) (DMEM complete), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin (Gibco), at 37Â°C in a humidified incubator supplied with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

The cells were then washed several times to remove the conditioned medium and incubated with the appropriate reagent (Hoechst-33342, HCS LipiTOX Deep Red, MitoTracker Green). Finally, after several washes, cells were used to perform the experiments described in the paper. Samples were analyzed at 37Â°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. High-resolution and time-lapse images were acquired in an inverted Leica STELLARIS confocal microscope equipped with photomultipliers and hybrid detectors. Images were processed using ImageJ software. For co-localization analysis, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>) of confocal images with the coloc2 plugin in ImageJ software. To quantify the volume of LDs in confocal images, we developed a macro to identify each voxel (pixel<sup>3</sup>) stained by the lipophilic marker LipidTOX in <italic>z</italic>-stacks. We then selected five <italic>z</italic>-stacks from each condition. This macro automatically identified and distinguished the positive from the negative particles on each slide and generated a data set with the volume of each particle, the number of particles, and the total volume of positive particles. This method reduced the chances in counting errors or biases.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Flow cytometry assays</title><p>To examine the total LDs volume, HepG2 cells (2 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well) were seeded in 24-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The cells were then washed several times to remove the conditioned medium and incubated with the appropriate reagent (CellROX Deep Red, Lipid Peroxidation Red/Green, HCS LipidTOX Deep Red, MitoTracker Green, Calcein AM, DAPI). Cells were gently detached using trypsin and washed several times before flow cytometry analyses. Flow cytometry assays were performed by technical triplicates of at least 10,000 cells per condition each time in three independent experiments.

TANGO2, a poorly characterized gene product but relevant to neurological and muscular disorders. The authors present solid data indicating that TANGO2 associates with membrane-bound organelles, mainly mitochondria, impacting lipid metabolism and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85345.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Pfeffer</surname><given-names>Suzanne R</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00f54p054</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.11.05.515282">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.05.515282v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. If possible, please analyze the localization of endogenous TANGO2 by immunofluorescence using the antibody described in Figure S2. The idea that TANGO2 localizes to membrane contact sites between mitochondria and the ER and LDs would also be strengthened by experiments including multiple organelle markers and/or methods to enhance the detection of membrane contact sites [https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1910854117].</p><p>2. Please display the absolute levels of all lipids in the various conditions.</p><p>3. RNAi-depletion of Tango2 causes LD accumulation, but it is unclear whether this is due to decreased LD lipolysis, increased LD biogenesis, or some combination of both. Pulse-chase 14C-palmitate experiments (or heavy label palmitate with mass spec) would substantially help the work and would also help determine if rates of acyl-CoA incorporation/turnover into phospholipids are defective in tango2-RNAi cells.</p><p>4.

Strengths include good use of cell biology and lipidomic analysis to profile tango2-depleted cells. A general concern is that while changes to lyso-lipids are observed, there is not yet a mechanistic understanding of these changes in tango2-depleted cells. Several intriguing models are proposed, but additional experiments are necessary to test these ideas. As noted below, there are also several sections that overstate their conclusions based on present data. Additional experiments should be conducted, or the conclusions toned down. Specific suggestions are below:</p><p>1. The authors note that the EGFP-tagged Tango2 localizes to both mitochondrial and the cytoplasm. Western blotting indicates the construct is not degraded, so they state &quot;it is reasonable to conclude that the transmembrane-domain lacking TANGO2 is attached predominantly to the mitochondrial outer membraneâ¦&quot; This is an over-interpretation. The construct is being stable over-expressed, and the partial cytoplasmic localization may simply be due to overwhelming the mitochondrial import machinery. Further, investigate the topology of Tango 2 and/or tone down the conclusion.</p><p>2. RNAi-depletion of Tango2 causes LD accumulation, but it is unclear whether this is due to decreased LD lipolysis, increased LD biogenesis, or some combination of both. A possibility is the LD accumulation is due to enhanced conversion of PA to DAG, which can be used to make TAG in LDs. Lipidomics suggests a decrease in PA and accumulation of its precursor LPA, as well as changes/decreases in several other mature di-acyl lipids like ceramide. The overall model presented is that LPA and LPG are shunted into cardiolipin synthesis for mitochondrial, resulting in reduced steady-state PA levels. This is an intriguing model, but the data presented are not sufficient to demonstrate it. Additional radio-label or similar approaches to track lipogenesis and PA synthesis/turnover would substantially enhance this study. Since the study suggests a defect in fatty acyl-CoA metabolism, pulse-chase 14C-palmitate experiments would substantially help the work. 14C-palmitate tracking would also help determine if rates of acyl-CoA incorporation/turnover into phospholipids are defective in tango2-RNAi cells.</p><p>3. In overall model suggests lyso-lipids and enriched due to a defect in their acylation. This is done by LPAAT enzymes. Some work to examine whether Tango2 loss impacts LPAAT enzyme levels and/or transcription would help this study.</p><p>4. Similar to the above, the reduced PA levels in Tango2-depleted cells could be due to enhanced Lipin-mediated PA turnover into DAG. This DAG pool would then make TAG and more LDs, as observed. Examining Lipin expression/activity in Tango2-depleted cells would test this. Likewise, Lipin depletion may actually rescue some of the pathology of Tango2-depleted cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85345.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.
