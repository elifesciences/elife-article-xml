tissues constitute a viscoelastic medium, implying that any deformation depends not only on the currently applied force, but also on the recent loading history. The extent to which this physical memory influences the signaling of first-order tactile neurons during natural hand use is not well understood. Here, we examined the effect of past loading on the responses of fast-adapting (FA-1) and slowly-adapting (SA-1 and SA-2) first-order tactile neurons innervating the human fingertip to loadings applied in different directions representative of object manipulation tasks. We found that variation in the preceding loading affected neurons’ overall signaling of force direction. Some neurons kept signaling the current direction, while others signaled both the current and preceding direction, or even primarily the preceding direction. In addition, ongoing impulse activity in SA-2 neurons between loadings signaled information related to the fingertip’s viscoelastic deformation state. We conclude that tactile neurons at the population level signal continuous information about the fingertip’s viscoelastic deformation state, which is shaped by both its recent history and current loading. Such information might be sufficient for the brain to correctly interpret current force loading and help in computing accurate motor commands for interactions with objects in manipulation and haptic tasks.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>somatosensation</kwd><kwd>skin mechanics</kwd><kwd>sensory afferent</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RPG-2022-031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saal</surname><given-names>Hannes P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>08667</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johansson</surname><given-names>Roland S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fingertip tactile neurons collectively encode the skin's viscoelastic state alongside current touch, potentially enabling the brain to better interpret forces during manipulation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To enable successful skilled object manipulation and haptic object exploration, the brain must have access to information related to the forces acting on the fingertips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johansson and Westling, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Westling and Johansson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robles-De-La-Torre and Hayward, 2001</xref>). Experimental evidence indicates that populations of first-order tactile neurons with end-organs distributed throughout the fingertip skin provide sensory information about the distribution, magnitude, and direction of such fingertip forces (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johansson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johansson and Flanagan, 2009</xref>, for reviews). However, these neurons do not signal contact forces per se, but local tissue deformations at the site of their receptor organs. This means that the relationship between fingertip forces and neuronal signaling can be very complex, since the deformation patterns resulting from a force applied to the fingertip depend on its geometry and its non-linear, viscoelastic, and anisotropic material properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Serina et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pawluk and Howe, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakazawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jindrich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pataky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang and Hayward, 2007</xref>). Concerning the viscoelastic properties in particular, the recent loading history of the fingertip might influence a neuron’s response to a given contact force. That is, since tissue viscoelasticity causes deformation changes to lag force changes, residual deformations from previous loadings will affect how the fingertip reacts mechanically under a given loading, and thus affect the deformation changes to which neurons’ receptor organs are exposed.</p><p>Despite indications in early animal studies that stimulation history via tissue viscoelasticity may indeed affect the responsiveness of first-order tactile neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lindblom, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Werner and Mountcastle, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beitel et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pubols, 1982</xref>), the issue has subsequently received little attention in studies of tactile mechanisms. Because the viscoelasticity of human fingertips exhibits time constants of up to several seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D’Angelo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pawluk and Howe, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2003</xref>), we hypothesized that loading history would interfere with the signaling of first-order tactile neurons to rapidly fluctuating fingertip forces on a similar time scale to those experienced naturally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kunesch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morley et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>Here, we tested the effect of loading history on neural information transmission in human first-order tactile neurons about the direction of fingertip forces during repetitive loadings that mimic those occurring during natural object manipulation. We examined information conveyed in the three types of neurons: fast-adapting type I (FA-1), slowly adapting type I (SA-1), and slowly adapting type II (SA-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Birznieks et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johansson and Birznieks, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birznieks et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saal et al., 2009</xref>). These neuron types most likely supply Meissner corpuscles, Merkel cell neurite complexes, and Ruffini-like end-organs, respectively. For neurons of all three types, we show that variations in loading history not only affect fingertip deformation but also reduce information about the force direction in the prevailing loading. Although most neurons of each type continued to preferentially signal information about the current force direction, a minority signaled more information about the preceding force direction than the current one. For those SA-2 neurons that exhibit ongoing activity without external stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birznieks et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johansson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knibestöl, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers et al., 1972</xref>), we found that they could signal information about the viscoelastic state of the fingertip even when unloaded.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We recorded action potentials in the median nerve of individual low-threshold A-beta myelinated first-order human tactile neurons innervating the glabrous skin of the fingertip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vallbo and Hagbarth, 1968</xref>). Sixty of the neurons were fast adapting type I (FA-1), 73 were slowly adapting type I (SA-1), and 41 were slowly adapting type II (SA-2) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vallbo and Johansson, 1984</xref>). The receptive fields of the neurons within each class were widely distributed over the glabrous skin of the distal phalanx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The fourth type of tactile neurons in the human glabrous skin, fast-adapting type II neurons (FA-2) supplied by Pacinian corpuscles, were not considered because our stimuli did not contain mechanical events with frequency components high enough to reliably excite them. Fingertip forces were applied in five different directions with a flat surface (referred to as the contactor), which was always oriented parallel to the skin surface at the primary site of object contact in dexterous tasks, that is in the middle of the flat portion of the volar surface of the fingertip. Because forces were applied to a standardized site, the neurons could vary widely in their responsiveness depending on where in the mechanically complex fingertip their transduction sites were located. Forces were applied normal (N) to the skin and at 20 degrees to the normal direction in the radial (R), distal (D), ulnar (U), or proximal (P) direction, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). All force stimuli consisted of a force protraction phase (125ms), a plateau phase at 4 N normal force (250ms), and a force retraction phase (125ms); interstimulus periods were 250ms.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental setup.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Receptive field center locations shown on a standardized fingertip for all first-order tactile neurons included in the study, categorized by neuron type.

The stimulus maintained contact with the skin at a force of 0.2 N in intertrial periods. Force stimuli were superimposed on this background contact force and were delivered in the normal direction (N) and at an angle of 20 degrees to the normal with tangential components in the distal (D), radial (R), proximal (P), and ulnar (U) directions, as indicated by the five arrows in the lower panel.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89616-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Each neuron was subject to two different sequences of force stimuli, first the ‘regular sequence’ and then the ‘irregular sequence’. As stimuli were force controlled, the contactor’s movement and position producing identical reactive force may differ depending on stimulation history, due to the viscoelastic properties of the fingertip tissue. In the regular sequence, the five force directions were repeatedly presented in a fixed relative order (R, D, U, P, N), such that each loading in each direction received the same immediate stimulation history (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Differences in the path of the contactor between different force directions were clearly visible in the tangential plane, where the changes in the force stimulation took place between trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the regular sequence, the contactor path was practically identical across the five test trials in each direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that the fingertip deformed similarly during the repetitions. However, the contactor path deviated from the direction of the force due to anisotropic mechanical properties of the fingertip, and, importantly, it differed between force protraction and retraction due to the viscoelasticity of the fingertip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Likewise, the viscoelastic properties were reflected as a pronounced hysteresis between the force and the contactor position, creep during the force plateaus, and creep recovery during the interstimulus periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Stimulation sequence exposes fingertip viscoelasticity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Trial order for the entire regular sequence, which repeats fingertip loadings in five different force directions in a fixed order, implying that loadings in each direction received the same stimulation history.

As in the regular sequence, the contactor moved broadly in the direction of the force regardless of the previous loading direction, but its precise path differed markedly depending on the previous loading direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This variability was most evident during the protraction phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) but could be discerned throughout the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Hence, deduced from the contactor’s behavior, these observations indicated that variations in the immediate loading history caused a greater intertrial variation in the fingertip deformation than an unchanging loading history. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, which shows the contactor path for both regular and irregular sequences from a single participant for five test trials in the distal direction as well as the corresponding preceding trials.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Influence of preceding loading direction on fingertip deformation and neural responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Contactor position along the x, y, and z axes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) as a function of time superimposed for all five trials with loading in the distal direction (’test trial’) as well as the respective previous loading (’preceding trial’) in the regular (left column) and the irregular (right column) sequence.

Indeed, we observed greater intertrial variability in the firing rate profiles of the neurons in the irregular compared to the regular sequence during test trials (see examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). This increased variability was most evident during the force protraction phase, where most neurons exhibited the most intense responses.</p><p>Increased variability was also observed in instances where the dynamic response to force stimulation involved a decrease in the firing rate (lower panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This phenomenon was observed in SA-2 neurons that maintained an ongoing discharge during intertrial periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In these cases, the response to a force stimulus constituted a modulation of the firing rate around the background discharge, signifying that a force stimulus could either decrease or increase the firing rate depending on the prevailing stimulus direction. For SA-1 and SA-2 neurons, which typically generated nerve impulses also during the force plateau, and for FA-1 neurons, which often responded during force retraction, we noted a tendency for greater variability in the intensity of these responses as well. Finally, the variation in previous loading direction during the irregular sequence could also modify impulse activity in SA-2 neurons generated during interstimulus periods, the implications of which will be further addressed below.</p><p>We quantified the effect of the stimulation history on a neuron’s response by first calculating for each stimulation sequence the time-varying standard deviation of the instantaneous firing rate during the test trials in each of the five force directions. Averaged across neurons and loading directions, firing rate variability during the force protraction phase was just over twofold higher for FA-1s in the irregular sequence compared to the regular sequence, almost twofold higher for SA-1 and about 70% higher for SA-2 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition to the protraction phase, variability was elevated in the irregular sequence for both SA types during the plateau phase and for FA-1 neurons during the retraction phase (all <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>&lt;=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft1">\begin{document}$p_{corrected} \lt =0.001$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>, paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests). FA-1 neurons did not respond during the plateau phase (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), while both SA types responded only weakly during the retraction phase with no apparent difference between the sequences (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft2">\begin{document}$p \gt =0.3$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>). Thus, in all phases where neurons responded reliably, their response variability in test trials increased when the force direction in the preceding trial varied. Notably, neurons’ overall firing rates did not differ between the regular and irregular sequence when averaged over test trials in all force directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) other than for SA-1s during the protraction phase (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.002</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft3">\begin{document}$p_{corrected}=0.002$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>), where the difference in firing rate was less than 1 imp/s.

As results were similar across the different test directions, we then averaged these data to arrive at a single variability measure per neuron. Importantly, the variability in contactor position was markedly higher in the irregular than in the regular sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, solid vs. dashed lines). The variability in the irregular sequence decreased over time and did so especially rapidly during the force protraction phase.

Interactions between normal position (Pz) and each velocity component were also frequently observed, while interactions involving tangential position and velocity components were less common. Interactions among velocity components were relatively well represented, followed by interactions limited to position components. Position signals were generally less represented, except for normal position (Pz) in slowly adapting neurons, where it appeared in 50% of SA-1 and 68% of SA-2 neurons. Despite these broad trends, important predictors varied widely across ranks even within a given neuron class (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), and even the most frequent variables appeared in only a subset of cases, suggesting broad variability in sensitivity across neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Information transmission about past and present loading</title><p>To assess how the increased firing rate variability observed in the irregular sequence as well as the variation in sensitivity to different aspects of contactor movement affected neural information transmission, we calculated a lower bound on the mutual information transmitted about both the current and the preceding force direction based on the neural spiking responses of individual neurons (see Materials and methods).

Consistent with this idea, such information was present, albeit at a relatively low level. Averaged across all neurons of each type, information about the preceding force direction increased for about 60–70ms into the protraction phase, after which it appeared to plateau or decrease (yellow traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; p &lt; 0.001 for each type, Wilcoxon one-sample signed rank tests based on information values halfway through the protraction phase compared against zero information).

Additionally, differences in the specific aspects of local strain to which individual neurons respond could further contribute to this heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Neural responses in the interstimulus period</title><p>SA-2 neurons can exhibit ongoing activity without external stimulation and sense tension states in collagenous fiber strands in dermal and subdermal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knibestöl, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birznieks et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johansson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers et al., 1972</xref>). Since the deformation of the fingertip by the force stimuli was mostly absorbed by such tissues, we hypothesized that SA-2 neurons active during the interstimulus periods might convey ongoing information about the viscoelastic state of the fingertip during the recovery from the recurrently applied loadings. A subset of SA-2 neurons (20 out of 41) exhibited such activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> for three examples). Calculation of mutual information indicated that some individual neurons were highly informative about the preceding stimulus direction, but the time of maximal information transmission could occur at different points (see examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). On average, SA-2 neurons provided low but continuous information about the preceding force direction throughout the interstimulus period, which was highest at the start of the interstimulus period and tended to decrease slightly over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, yellow trace). This decrease was likely driven by the gradual relaxation of the fingertip.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>SA-2 neurons signal information about previous forces in the interstimulus period.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spike raster plots for three SA-2 neurons recorded during the interstimulus periods of the irregular sequence.

We calculated a low-dimensional representation of the SA-2 population activity to compare with the fingertip deformation at three different time points: in the middle and at the end of the interstimulus period, and again at the end of the protraction phase. Specifically, based on activity recorded during the irregular sequence, we calculated pairwise spike distances across all 25 trials (5 force directions ×5 trials) for each neuron, providing a measure for how distinct the activity of this neuron was across different trials. This process yielded a matrix, which was averaged across all active SA-2 neurons. We then used multi-dimensional scaling to place each of the 25 types of trials into a two-dimensional space. Using Procrustes analysis, finally, we rotated and scaled the responses to match the recorded tangential contactor positions, which were calculated for the same 25 types of trial at the corresponding time points and averaged across fingertips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Notably, there was a good match between the neural representation and the fingertip deformation. For both measures, different trial types were clustered according to the force direction of the preceding loading throughout the interstimulus period, but cluster separation decreased as time progressed. Then trial types diverged during the protraction phase, and at the end of the phase, they were clustered according to the current force direction. To quantify the similarity of the two representations, for each we calculated two measures. The ’total variance’ across all 25 trial types indicates the general level of variability (see black dashed ellipse in the top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The ’direction variance’, which was calculated over trials representing the same preceding force direction and then averaged, indicates variability within clusters of trials with the same preceding direction (see dashed orange ellipse in the top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Skin positions and SA-2 population activity displayed a similar variance pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). During the interstimulus period, the total variance was much larger than the direction variance, signifying a marked clustering according to the preceding force direction, but this difference tended to decrease with time. In contrast, both variances were large and roughly equal at the end of the protraction phase, indicating little clustering based on the preceding force direction. Taken together, these results suggest that SA-2 neurons can continuously signal the mechanical state of the fingertip even in the absence of externally applied stimulation.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Continuous representation of fingertip viscoelastic state in the SA-2 population.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Colored dots indicate tangential contactor positions (top) and their representation in the SA-2 population signal (bottom) at three different times: the middle of the interstimulus period (–0.125 s), the end of the interstimulus period (0 s), and the end of the subsequent protraction phase (0.125 s). The colors of the markers denote the force direction in the directly preceding trial. Contactor position is the two-dimensional position in the tangential plane.

Such tasks involve applying forces of different magnitudes and directions in rapid succession, such as during grasping and transporting objects, handicraft, cooking, cleaning, and food gathering. The neurons’ signaling of force direction was significantly influenced by the direction of the preceding loading, even if it varied by only 20 degrees relative to the perpendicular direction. This effect was most prominent during the force protraction phase, which is when neurons typically signal the most information about force direction. However, there was heterogeneity in how individual neurons behaved. Some neurons primarily signaled information about the current direction, while others signaled both the current and previous direction, or even primarily the preceding direction. Our results also indicate that neurons can signal information related to the fingertip’s viscoelastic deformation state even between loadings: SA-2 neurons’ ongoing impulse activity between loadings was influenced by the previous loading direction. This diversity suggests that, at the population level, first-order neurons carry information about the fingertip’s current viscoelastic state, which within it contains a memory of past stimulation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Origins of neural heterogeneity</title><p>The observed heterogeneity between neurons of the same type is expected, given that their transduction sites were distributed widely within the fingertip skin and they are sensitive to the local stresses and strains at their transduction site, rather than the global deformation of the fingertip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Birznieks et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saal et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the viscoelastic memory of the preceding loading would have modulated the pattern of strain changes in the fingertip differently depending on where their receptor organs are situated in the fingertip.</p><p>In addition to the receptor organ locations, the variation in sensitivity among neurons to fingertip deformations in response to both previous and current loadings would stem from the fingertip’s geometry and its complex composite material properties. Possible inherent directional preferences of the receptor organs, attributed to their microanatomy, could also be significant. However, mechanical anisotropy, particularly within the viscoelastic subcutaneous tissue of the fingertip induced by intricately oriented collagen fiber strands forming fat columns in the pulp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hauck et al., 2004</xref>), is likely to play a crucial role. This anisotropy would shape the dynamic pattern of strain changes at neurons’ receptor sites, intricately influencing a neuron’s sensitivity not only to current but also to preceding loadings. Indeed, recent modeling efforts suggest that such mechanical anisotropy strongly influences the spatiotemporal distribution of stresses and strains across the fingertip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duprez et al., 2024</xref>). The resulting diversity in the sensitivities of neurons might enhance the overall information collected and relayed to the brain by the neuronal population, facilitating the discrimination between tactile stimuli or mechanical states of the fingertip (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rongala et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corniani et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tummala et al., 2023</xref>, for more extensive explorations of this idea).</p><p>Our regression analysis, which examined how well different aspects of contactor behavior could predict the time-varying firing rates of individual neurons, highlights the complexity of neural responses to fingertip mechanics. This conclusion is supported by three key findings. First, models incorporating interactions between contactor position and velocity outperformed simpler models. Second, the importance of independent variables varied among neurons of the same type, reflecting differences in sensitivity to contactor position, velocity, and their interactions. Third, prediction accuracy varied significantly across neurons of the same type. The limited accuracy of the two-way interaction model in replicating detailed firing rate profiles of individual neurons underscores the intricate relationship between fingertip events and neural activity. Although a three-way interaction model was evaluated, it provided only marginal improvements in variance explained (data not shown).</p><p>Predictors that showed consistently high importance across neurons were position-velocity interactions, revealed by the two-way interaction model. This finding suggests that neuronal responses to fingertip deformation changes (reflected by contactor velocity) are significantly influenced by the fingertip’s current deformation state (indicated by contactor position), modulated by previous fingertip loading through viscoelastic effects. Direct observations support this conclusion. First, variation in neuronal response to force protraction, depending on previous loading direction, paralleled changes in contactor position and path, whereas contactor velocity, the primary driver of the neuronal response, remained generally aligned with the force direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). Second, FA-1 neurons, which displayed minimal sensitivity to contactor position alone, exhibited greatly improved prediction accuracy when position and velocity variables interacted, demonstrating that the fingertip’s deformation state modulates the neurons’ dynamic responses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Differences between neuron types in sensitivity to viscoelasticity</title><p>We also observed some differences between neuron types regarding how variation in the preceding force direction affected their signaling during the current loading. The impact of stimulation history during the force protraction phase was more pronounced in FA-1 and SA-1, compared to SA-2 neurons. It is possible that the neurons’ response properties accounted for this difference: type I neurons are primarily sensitive to deformation of the fingerprint ridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sukumar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jarocka et al., 2021</xref>), while SA-2 neurons primarily signal tension states in deeper dermal and subdermal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knibestöl, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birznieks et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johansson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers et al., 1972</xref>). The fingertip deformation changes during the loadings can be seen as twofold. First, the force applied by the contactor induced bulk deformation changes of the fingertip that depended on the force direction. As pressure increases in the pulp, the pulp tissue bulges at the end and sides of the fingertip. Simultaneously, the tangential force component amplifies the bulging in the direction of the force while stretching the skin on the opposite side. This effect is attributed to the fact that the friction between the stimulation surface and the skin was high enough to prevent it from sliding over the fingertip. Bulk deformation changes are closely linked to widespread alterations in stress and strain distribution in deeper tissues, making the SA-2 neuron population the preferred signaling source for such changes. For example, it has been demonstrated that experimentally induced compliance changes of the finger pulp using venous occlusion readily influenced activity of SA-2, but not SA-1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hudson et al., 2015</xref>). However, concurrent with the bulk deformation changes, the fingertip skin would undergo direction-dependent surface deformation changes involving planar tensile strain changes and partial slippage peripherally within the contact surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delhaye et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delhaye et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Willemet et al., 2021</xref>). Changes in planar tensile strain per se might excite neurons of either type, given that even neurons terminating outside the contact area can respond to fingertip loadings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bisley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Birznieks et al., 2001</xref>). However, partial slippages occurring during fingertip loadings, where some parts of the fingertip-object interface slip while others remain stuck, excite SA-1 and especially FA-1 neurons most intensely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johansson and Westling, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Srinivasan et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khamis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delhaye et al., 2021</xref>). A substantial part of the sensitivity of FA-1 and SA-1 neurons to stimulation history could therefore be attributed to the preceding force direction affecting the location and timing of partial slips. That is, due to the viscoelastic memory of the fingertip, previous loadings in different directions could result in different patterns of planar tensile stress changes under a given loading condition, which would affect how and where the local partial slips occur. The responsiveness of type I neurons to partial slippage might also explain their apparently higher sensitivity to stimulation history compared to SA-2s. In sum, we believe that both bulk and superficial deformation changes play a role in the activation of the tactile neurons during the fingertip loadings.</p><p>Our regression analysis of contactor behavior and time-varying firing rates corroborates that the different neuron types exhibit varying sensitivities to mechanical fingertip events during fingertip loadings. The observation that predictions were most accurate for SA-2 neurons aligns with the understanding that contactor behavior during loading primarily reflects bulk deformation changes, best signaled by SA-2 neurons. The lower prediction accuracy for SA-1 and, particularly, FA-1 neurons suggests that these are influenced by additional factors that are less effectively or not represented in the behavior of the contactor, specifically, direction-dependent planar tensile strain changes in the skin and partial slippages, which likely predominantly affect FA-1 neurons (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delhaye et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Continuous signaling of viscoelastic state by SA-2 neurons</title><p>That SA-2 neurons signaled the viscoelastic state of the fingertip in periods between loadings is consistent with previous ideas that SA-2 neurons continuously measure stresses in collagen fiber strands that run within and between dermal and subdermal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vallbo and Johansson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birznieks et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, their relatively low dynamic sensitivity to externally applied loads and the well-sustained response to maintained loadings suggest that SA-2 neurons are tailored to encode slow viscoelastic and quasistatic events occurring in dermal and subdermal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Westling and Johansson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Birznieks et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birznieks et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, even in the absence of externally applied stimulation, they can exhibit ongoing impulsive activity, which suggests they are capable of monitoring inherent mechanical tension patterns in dermal and subdermal tissues in the skin in the unloaded state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knibestöl, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johansson, 1978</xref>). In particular, changes in the tension patterns via finger and hand movement without external stimulation can also modulate this activity. We believe that by constantly transmitting information related to tissues’ viscoelastic state, SA-2 neurons could help keep the brain updated about the current mechanical state of body parts. In agreement with this view, peripheral nerve blocks affect the perceived image of body parts such as the arm and fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walsh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Melzack and Bromage, 1973</xref>). Likewise, although sensations elicited by electrical stimulation of single SA-2 neurons innervating the hand have been elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kunesch et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ochoa and Torebjörk, 1983</xref>), a recent study indicates that they can give rise to distinct sensations that include the experience of diffuse skin deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watkins et al., 2022</xref>). By continuously informing about the viscoelastic state of the fingertips, SA-2 neurons could help the brain in computing accurate motor commands for interactions with objects in manipulation and haptic tasks by updating reference frames for interpreting information signaled by type I neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Consequences for haptic performance and perception</title><p>Although tactile information in general is crucial for planning and executing motor actions in such tasks, to our knowledge, a possible influence of fingertip viscoelasticity on task performance has not been systematically investigated. Similarly, there is a lack of systematic investigation of potential effects of fingertip viscoelasticity on performance in tactile psychophysical tasks conducted during passive touch. Therefore, it is unclear whether viscoelasticity limits performance or if it is compensated for in some way. Our findings indicate that the population of tactile neurons that innervate a fingertip encode continuous information about the fingertip’s viscoelastic deformation state. This information could potentially aid the brain in managing the effects of viscoelasticity on tactile coding and fingertip actions. For instance, the brain could intermittently use this information to estimate the state of the fingertip during planning and evaluation of tactile-based actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johansson and Flanagan, 2009</xref>). It is also conceivable that the brain continuously represents the current deformation state of the fingertips using online population information. However, such processing might require considerable computational resources. In any case, the viscoelastic deformability of the fingertips plays a pivotal role in supporting the diverse functions of the fingers. For example, it allows for cushioned contact with objects featuring hard surfaces and allows the skin to conform to object shapes, enabling the extraction of tactile information about objects’ 3D shapes and fine surface properties. Moreover, deformability is essential for the effective grasping and manipulation of objects. This is achieved, among other benefits, by expanding the contact surface, thereby reducing local pressure on the skin under stronger forces and enabling tactile signaling of friction conditions within the contact surface for control of grasp stability. Throughout, continuous acquisition of information about various aspects of the current state of the fingertip and its skin by tactile neurons is essential for the functional interaction between the brain and the fingers. In light of this, the viscoelastic memory effect on tactile signaling of fingertip forces can be perceived as a by-product of an overall optimization process within prevailing biological constraints.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>General procedure and study participants</title><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, apart from pre-registration in a database.

The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee at Umeå University (Item 175/02, registration number 02–148). The general experimental methodology, procedure, and apparatus have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Birznieks et al., 2001</xref>), as well as other aspects of the same experimental data than those analyzed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Birznieks et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jenmalm et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johansson and Birznieks, 2004</xref>). Briefly, action potentials (spikes) in axons of single first-order tactile neurons that terminated in the distal segment of the index, middle or ring finger were recorded with tungsten needle electrodes inserted into the median nerve at the level of the upper arm 0.5–0.6 m from the fingertips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vallbo and Hagbarth, 1968</xref>). For neurons with cutaneous receptive fields on the distal segment of a finger, force stimuli were applied to its fingertip in five different directions by means of a custom-built robot. The fingertip was stabilized by gluing the nail to a firmly fixed metal plate. Force was transferred through a circular plane (30 mm diameter) that was centered on the midpoint of a line extending in the proximal-distal direction from the papillary whorl to the distal end of the finger. The stimulating surface was oriented parallel to the skin at this primary contact site (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which was located approximately at the center of the flat part of the fingertip’s volar surface and serves as a primary target for object contact in fine manipulation tasks engaging ’tip-to-tip’ precision grips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christel et al., 1998</xref>). To ensure that friction between the contactor and the skin was sufficiently high to prevent slips, the surface was coated with silicon carbide grains (50–100 µm), approximating the finish of smooth sandpaper.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Force stimuli</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Force parameters</title><p>One of the five directions of force stimulation was normal (N) to the skin surface at the primary contact site, and the other four were angled 20° to the normal direction in the radial (R), distal (D), ulnar (U), and proximal (P) directions, respectively. All force stimuli were superimposed on 0.2 N background force normal to the skin and consisted of a force protraction phase (125ms), a plateau phase at 4 N normal force (250ms), and a force retraction phase (125ms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In the four trials with a tangential force component, the tangential force was 1.4 N at the force plateau. The time course of the force changes followed a half-sinusoid (sine wave frequency of 4 Hz). The position and orientation of the stimulation surface in relation to the primary contact site were maintained when the loading contained tangential force components. That is, the friction between the stimulation surface and the skin was high enough to prevent frictional slips. The interval between successive fingertip loadings was 250ms. Thus, the frequency of recurrent fingertip loadings (1.3 Hz) was representative of the frequency at which tactile events follow each other during dexterous object manipulation tasks (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Draper, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kunesch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teulings and Maarse, 1984</xref>).

Briefly, FA afferents respond only to changes in skin deformation, whereas SA afferents show an ongoing response during periods of static skin deformation. Type I afferents (FA-1 and SA-1) possess small and well-delineated receptive fields if probed by light, pointed skin indentations, while the receptive fields of type II afferents (FA-2 and SA-2) are often large and poorly defined (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vallbo and Johansson, 1984</xref>, for further details). The present analysis included 60 FA-1, 73 SA-1, and 41 SA-2 neurons terminating in the glabrous skin of the terminal segment of digits II, III, or IV. Other functional aspects of these neurons have been explored in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Birznieks et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jenmalm et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johansson and Birznieks, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saal et al., 2009</xref>). To ensure a reasonably balanced representation of the three neuron types in the sample, given the lower density of slowly adapting neuron types in fingertip compared with FA-1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johansson and Vallbo, 1979</xref>), slowly adapting neuron types were intentionally prioritized during prerecording search for unitary action potentials. Initially, 10 FA-2 neurons were also included in the analysis. But their responsiveness during the experiment was remarkably low, and unlike the other neuron types, their responses were rarely affected by force stimuli. Specifically, only one of the observed FA-2 neurons responded during the force protraction phases. Due to the lack of clear stimulus-driven responses, FA-2 neurons were subsequently excluded from further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analysis</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Quantifying mechanical and neural response variability</title><p>We assessed the variability in displacements and velocities by calculating the standard deviation of the displacement and velocity signals at each time point over the two-dimensional tangential plane across repeated trials of the same force direction, using Euclidean distance as the metric.

We used metric space analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Victor and Purpura, 1997</xref>), which employs a classifier on the neural response data to distinguish different force directions, calculates a confusion matrix from several runs of the classifier, and finally computes a lower bound on the mutual information from the confusion matrix. Details of the specific implementation used in the present study have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saal et al., 2009</xref>). In short, we first sorted the trial data either by the force direction in the current trial (to assess coding of current force direction) or by the force direction in the previous trial (to assess whether neurons responded to the viscoelastic ‘memory’ of the previous trial). We then computed spike distances between all pairs of spike trains according to a spike-timing based distance metric that assesses the ’cost’ for transforming the first spike train in the pair into the second, by adding or removing individual spikes, or shifting existing ones in time. For analyses of the protraction phase, this spike distance was computed at a temporal resolution of 8ms, as this was determined in a previous study to be close to the optimum for maximal information transmission for the present experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saal et al., 2009</xref>). For the analysis of SA-2 responses during the interstimulus period, we used a lower temporal resolution of 32ms instead, to adjust for the lower firing rates of these neurons in the absence of externally applied stimulation. Each individual trial was then classified as originating from the force direction to which its average distance was lowest. In this way, a confusion matrix was generated for each neuron, with each entry denoting the number of times a neural response from a given force direction was classified as having originated from that direction or another one. Finally, we used the confusion matrix to compute a lower bound of the mutual information. To quantify the bias of this estimate, we reassigned neural responses from individual trials to random conditions and recalculated the mutual information. The bias term was set as the average of the outcome of 10 such random assignments and subtracted from the estimate of the mutual information. This analysis was run on successively longer time windows starting at stimulus onset (when calculating information during the protraction phase) or at the start of the interstimulus period (when calculating information for this period), respectively, and extending until the end of the considered time window in 5ms increments. In this way, it could be assessed how neural coding of force direction evolved over time. The whole analysis was run twice on the irregular sequence data: once with stimuli grouped according to the current force direction (to assess the information conveyed about the stimulus), and a second time with stimuli grouped according to the preceding trial (to assess information conveyed in the neural responses about the past stimulus). The analysis was also run on the regular sequence; because effects due to previous and current stimulation cannot be distinguished in this data set due to the fixed trial order, this analysis yielded a single information value that represents the total amount of information available when past loading is held constant.</p><p>For the analysis covering the protraction phase, we also assigned each neuron to one of three groups, based on their information curves: those that primarily conveyed information about the current force direction (‘current’), those that conveyed information about the preceding force direction (‘previous’), and those that conveyed different types of information at different times during the protraction phase (‘mixed’). To do this, we first excluded neurons that responded too weakly or erratically, as assessed by whether they conveyed information (above 0) about either past or present force direction for at least 10 different time windows during the protraction phase. This left 53 FA-1, 67 SA-1, and 35 SA-2 neurons. For each time window containing non-zero information, we then measured whether more information was conveyed about the present or the past force direction. Neurons that conveyed information about the current force direction in 70% or more of time windows were classed as ‘current’; neurons with 30% or less were classed as ‘previous’; and all other neurons were classed as ‘mixed’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Analysis of SA-2 population responses</title><p>To derive a representation of the SA-2 population response, we took the spike train distances (see above) calculated at three different time points (in the middle and at the end of the interstimulus period at –0.125 s and 0 s relative to protraction onset, and at the end of the protraction phase at 0.125 s) for the irregular sequence and summed these distances across all 20 SA-2 neurons that were tonically active during the interstimulus period. This yielded a 25-by-25 matrix, with each entry denoting how dissimilar a given trial in the irregular sequence was from another one on the population level. We then employed multidimensional scaling, which aims to embed data points in a high-dimensional space such that their Euclidean distances adhere to those in the original distance matrix as closely as possible. We retained the first two dimensions of this space, resulting in each trial now occupying a position in a two-dimensional space. Finally, using Procrustes analysis, we rotated and scaled this representation to match it to the two-dimensional skin deformations in the plane tangential to the fingertip surface at the three different time points. The main idea behind this analysis is that if time-varying skin deformations are encoded at the SA-2 population level, then more dissimilar skin deformations should lead to more dissimilar neural responses. The analysis tests the extent to which this idea is true.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Statistics</title><p>As mechanical and neural measures were generally not normally distributed, we used non-parametric tests for all statistical analyses on these variables.

The evidence presented in the analyses indicate there is a clear effect of viscoelasticity on the imposed skin movements from a force-controlled stimulus. Both skin mechanics and evoked afferent firing were affected based on prior stimulation, which has not previously been thoroughly explored. This study outlines that viscoelastic effects have an important impact on encoding in the tactile system, which should be considered in the design and interpretation of future studies. Viscoelasticity was shown to affect the mechanical skin deflections and stresses/strains imposed by previous and current interaction force, and also the resultant neuronal signalling. The result of this was an impaired coding of contact forces based upon previous stimulation. The authors may be able to strengthen their findings, by using the existing data to further explore the link between skin mechanics and neural signalling, giving a clearer picture than demonstrating shared variability. This is not a critical addition, but I believe would strengthen the work and make it more generally applicable.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>-Elegant design of the study. Direct measurements have been made from the tactile sensory neurons to give detailed information on touch encoding. Experiments have been well designed and the forces/displacements have been thoroughly controlled and measured to give accurate measurements of global skin mechanics during a set of controlled mechanical stimuli.</p><p>-Analytical techniques used. Analysis of fundamental information coding and information representation in the sensory afferents reveals dynamic coding properties to develop putative models of the neural representation of force. This advanced analysis method has been applied to a large dataset to study neural encoding of force, the temporal dynamics of this, and the variability in this.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>-Lack of exploration of the variation in neural responses. Although there is a viscoelastic effect which produces variability in the stimulus effects based on prior stimulation, it is a shame that the variability in neural firing and force induced skin displacements have been presented, and are similarly variable, but there has been no investigation of a link between the two. I believe with these data the authors can go beyond demonstrating shared variability. The force per se is clearly not faithfully represented in the neural signal, being masked by stimulation history, and it is of interest if the underlying resultant contact mechanics are.</p><p>Validity of conclusions:</p><p>The authors have succeeded in demonstrating skin viscoelasticity has an impact on skin contact mechanics with a given force and that this impacts on the resultant neural coding of force. Their study has been well designed and the results support their conclusions. The importance and scope of the work is adequately outlined for readers to interpret the results and significance.</p><p>Impact:</p><p>This study will have important implications for future studies performing tactile stimulation and evaluating tactile feedback during motor control tasks. In detailed studies of tactile function, it illustrates the necessity to measure skin contact dynamics to properly understand the effects of a force stimulus on the skin and mechanoreceptors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89616.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Saal</surname><given-names>Hannes P</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Sheffield</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Sheffield</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Birznieks</surname><given-names>Ingvars</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>UNSW Sydney</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Sydney</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Johansson</surname><given-names>Roland S</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Umeå University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Umeå</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors investigate how the viscoelasticity of the fingertip skin can affect the firing of mechanoreceptive afferents and they find a clear effect of recent physical skin state (memory), which is different between afferents. The manuscript is extremely well-written and well-presented.

This impact of the previous dynamics of the skin affecting the current state can be explored further in so many ways and may help us to better understand skin aging and the effects of anatomical changes of the skin.</p><p>At the beginning of the Results, it states that FA-2s were not considered as stimuli did not contain mechanical events with frequency components high enough to reliably excite them. Was this really the case, did the authors test any of the FA-2s from the larger dataset? If FA-2s were not at all activated, this is also relevant information for the brain to signal that it is not a relevant Pacinian stimulus (as they respond to everything). Further, afferent receptive fields that were more distant to the stimulus were included, which likely fired very little, like the FA-2s, so why not consider them even if their contribution was low?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this up, we have now clarified in the text that while FA-2s did respond at a low rate during the experiment, their responses were not reliably driven by the force stimuli. In the Methods section we have included the following text:</p><p>“Initially, 10 FA-2 neurons were also included in the analysis. But their responsiveness during the experiment was remarkably low, and unlike the other neuron types, their responses were rarely affected by force stimuli. Specifically, only one of the observed FA-2 neurons responded during the force protraction phases. Due to the lack of clear stimulus-driven responses, FA-2 neurons were subsequently excluded from further analysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One question that I wondered throughout was whether you have looked at further past history in stimulation, i.e. not just the preceding stimulus, but 2 or 3 stimuli back? It would be interesting to know if there is any ongoing change that can be related back further. I do not think you would see anything as such here, but it would be interesting to test and/or explore in future work (e.g. especially with sticky, forceful, or sharp indentation touch). However, even here, it could be that certain directions gave more effects.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question! A discernible effect from the previous stimulus could persist at the end of the current stimulation (see Figure 4C), potentially influencing the next one—a 2-stimuli-back effect. Unfortunately, our experimental design did not allow for rigorous testing of this effect. While all possible pairs of stimulus directions were included in immediately consecutive trials, this was not the case for pairs separated by additional trials. Hence, the combination of a likely weak effect and limited variation in history precluded a thorough analysis of a 2-stimuli-back effect. Future work should delve into the time course of the viscoelastic effect in greater detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did the authors analyze or take into account the difference between receptive field locations? For example, did afferents more on the sides have lower responses and a lesser effect of history?</p></disp-quote><p>An investigation into the potential impact of the relationship between the receptive field location on the fingertip skin and the primary contact site of the stimulus surface revealed no discernible influence for SA-1 and SA-2 neurons. In contrast, FA-1 neurons, particularly those predominantly sensitive to the previous stimulation or displaying mixed sensitivity, exhibited a tendency to terminate near the primary stimulation site. We have added these observations to the text:</p><p>“We found no straightforward relationship between a neuron's sensitivity to current and previous stimulation and its termination site in fingertip skin. Specifically, there was no statistically significant effect of the distance between a neuron's receptive field center and the primary contact site of the stimulus surface on whether neurons signaled current, prior, or mixed information for SA-1 (Kruskal-Wallis test H(2)=3.86, p = 0.15) or SA-2 neurons (H(2)=0.75, p=0.69). However, a significant difference emerged for FA-1 neurons (H(2)=8.66, p=0.01), indicating that neurons terminating closer to the stimulation site on the flat part of the fingertip were more likely to signal past or mixed information.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Was there anything different in the firing patterns between the spontaneous and non-spontaneously active SA-2s? For example, did the non-spontaneous show more dynamic responses?</p></disp-quote><p>The firing patterns of both spontaneously and non-spontaneously active SA-2 neurons shared similarities in terms of adaptation and range of firing rate modulation in response to force stimuli, i.e., ‘dynamic response’. The distinction lay in the pattern of modulation of the firing rate associated with stimulus presentations. For spontaneously active SA-2 neurons, this modulation occurred around a significant background discharge, implying that a force stimulus could either decrease or increase the firing rate, depending on how it deformed the fingertip. This characteristic is well illustrated by the firing pattern of the neuron depicted in the lower panels of Figure 3D. Conversely, in non-spontaneously active SA-2 neurons, a force stimulus could only induce an increase in the firing rate or no change. Although the neuron depicted in the upper panels of Figure 3D exhibited some background activity, it serves to exemplify this characteristic. In the text, we have elucidated the dynamics of the SA-2 neuron response by highlighting that force stimulation can either decrease or increase the firing rate in neurons with spontaneous activity through the following addition/change:</p><p>“This increased variability was most evident during the force protraction phase where most neurons exhibited the most intense responses. Increased variability was also observed in instances where the dynamic response to force stimulation involved a decrease in the firing rate (lower panels of Figure 3D). This phenomenon was observed in SA-2 neurons that maintained an ongoing discharge during intertrial periods (cf. Fig. 2A). In these cases, the response to a force stimulus constituted a modulation of the firing rate around the background discharge, signifying that a force stimulus could either decrease or increase the firing rate depending on the prevailing stimulus direction.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were the spontaneously active SA-2 afferents firing all the time or did they have periods of rest - and did this relate to recent stimulation? Were the spontaneously active SA-2s located in a certain part of the finger (e.g. nail) or were they randomly spread throughout the fingertip? Any distribution differences could indicate a more complicated role in skin sensing.</p></disp-quote><p>SA-2 neurons, in general, are well-known for undergoing significant post-stimulation depression (e.g., Knibestöl and Vallbo, 1970; Chambers et al., 1972; Burgess and Perl, 1973). In our force stimulations, this post-excitatory depression manifested as a reduced or absent response during the latter part of the stimulus retraction period for stimuli in directions that markedly excited the neuron. The excitability recovered when the fingertip relaxed during the subsequent intertrial period, and for &quot;spontaneously active&quot; neurons, the firing resumed (see examples in Figure 7A). Furthermore, some “spontaneously active” neurons could be silenced or exhibit a near-silent period during force stimulation for certain force directions, while the spontaneous firing returned during the upcoming intertrial period when the fingertip shape recovered (for example, see responses to stimulation in the proximal and especially ulnar directions in the top panel in Figure 7A).</p><p>Regarding the location of the receptive field centres of spontaneously active and non-spontaneously active SA-2 neurons on the fingertip we did not observe any obvious spatial segregation. To illustrate this, we have revised Figure 1A by color-marking SA-2 neurons that exhibited ongoing activity in intertrial periods, and the figure caption has been modified accordingly:</p><p>“Figure 1. Experimental setup. A. Receptive field center locations shown on a standardized fingertip for all first-order tactile neurons included in the study, categorized by neuron type. Purple symbols denote spontaneously active SA-2 neurons exhibiting ongoing activity without external stimulation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did the authors look to see if the spontaneous firing in SA-2s between trials could predict the extent to which the type 1 afferents encode the proceeding stimulus? Basically, does the SA-2 state relate to how the type 1 units fire?</p></disp-quote><p>We found no clear indications that the responses of FA-1 and SA-1 could be readily anticipated based on the firing patterns of SA-2 neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion, it is stated that &quot;the viscoelastic memory of the preceding loading would have modulated the pattern of strain changes in the fingertip differently depending on where their receptor organs are situated in the fingertip&quot;. Can the authors expand on this or make any predictions about the size of the memory effect and the distance from the point of stimulation?</p></disp-quote><p>We have explored this topic further in the text, referring to recent studies modeling essential aspects of fingertip mechanics. However, in our view, current models lack the capability to predict the specific nature sought by the reviewer. These models should include a detailed understanding of the intricate networks of collagen fibers anchoring the pulp tissue at the distal phalangeal bone and the nail. They should also consider potential inherent directional preferences of the receptor organs, attributed to their microanatomy. The text modifications are as follows:</p><p>“In addition to the receptor organ locations, the variation in sensitivity among neurons to fingertip deformations in response to both previous and current loadings would stem from the fingertip’s geometry and its complex composite material properties. Possible inherent directional preferences of the receptor organs, attributed to their microanatomy, could also be significant. However, mechanical anisotropy, particularly within the viscoelastic subcutaneous tissue of the fingertip induced by intricately oriented collagen fiber strands forming fat columns in the pulp (Hauck et al., 2004), are likely to play a crucial role. This anisotropy would shape the dynamic pattern of strain changes at neurons' receptor sites, intricately influencing a neuron's sensitivity not only to current but also to preceding loadings. Indeed, recent modeling efforts suggest that such mechanical anisotropy strongly influences the spatiotemporal distribution of stresses and strains across the fingertip (Duprez et al., 2024).”</p><p>Relatedly, we have included additional text to provide a more comprehensive explanation of the “bulk deformation” of the fingertip that occurs during the loadings:</p><p>“As pressure increases in the pulp, the pulp tissue bulges at the end and sides of the fingertip. Simultaneously, the tangential force component amplifies the bulging in the direction of the force while stretching the skin on the opposite side.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion, it would be good if the authors could briefly comment more on the diversity of the mechanoreceptive afferent firing and why this may be useful to the system.</p></disp-quote><p>The diversity in responses among neurons is instrumental in enhancing the information transmitted to the brain by averting redundancy in information acquisition. This diversity thereby contributes to an overall increase in information. We've included a brief statement, along with several references, underscoring this concept:</p><p>&quot;The resulting diversity in the sensitivities of neurons might enhance the overall information collected and relayed to the brain by the neuronal population, facilitating the discrimination between tactile stimuli or mechanical states of the fingertip (see Rongala et al., 2024; Corniani et al., 2022; Tummala et al., 2023, for more extensive explorations of this idea).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the authors could briefly discuss why this memory (or recency) effect occurs - is it useful, does it serve a purpose, or it is just a by-product of our skin structure? There are examples of memory in the other senses where comparisons could be drawn. Is it like stimulus adaptation effects in the other senses (e.g. aftereffects of visual motion)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the concluding paragraph of the discussion, specifically delving into the question of whether the mechanical memory effect serves a deliberate purpose or is simply an incidental byproduct of our skin structure:</p><p>“In any case, the viscoelastic deformability of the fingertips plays a pivotal role in supporting the diverse functions of the fingers. For example, it allows for cushioned contact with objects featuring hard surfaces and allows the skin to conform to object shapes, enabling the extraction of tactile information about objects' 3D shapes and fine surface properties. Moreover, deformability is essential for the effective grasping and manipulation of objects. This is achieved, among other benefits, by expanding the contact surface, thereby reducing local pressure on the skin under stronger forces and enabling tactile signaling of friction conditions within the contact surface for control of grasp stability. Throughout, continuous acquisition of information about various aspects of the current state of the fingertip and its skin by tactile neurons is essential for the functional interaction between the brain and the fingers. In light of this, the viscoelastic memory effect on tactile signaling of fingertip forces can be perceived as a by-product of an overall optimization process within prevailing biological constraints.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One point that would be nice to add to the discussion is the implications of the work for skin sensing. What would you predict for the time constant of relaxation of fingertip skin, how long could these skin memory effects last? Two main points to address here may be how the hydration of the skin and anatomical skin changes related to aging affect the results. If the skin is less viscoelastic, what would be the implications for the firing of mechanoreceptors?</p></disp-quote><p>It is likely that the time constant depends to some extent on mechanical factors of the skin, which will likely change due to age or environmental factors. However, while these questions are intriguing, they fall outside the scope of the current study and we are not aware of studies that have addressed these issues directly in experiments either.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How long does it take for the effect to end? Again, this will likely depend on the skin's viscoelasticity. However, could the authors use it in a psychophysical paradigm to predict whether participants would be more or less sensitive to future stimuli? In this way, it would be possible to test whether the direction modifies touch perception.</p></disp-quote><p>Time constants for tissue viscoelasticity have been estimated to extend up to several seconds (see citations in the introduction). While direct perceptual effects could indeed be explored through psychophysical experimental paradigms, we are currently unaware of any studies specifically addressing the type of effect described in this study.

The evidence presented in the analyses indicates there is a clear effect of viscoelasticity on the imposed skin movements from a force-controlled stimulus. Both skin mechanics and evoked afferent firing were affected based on prior stimulation, which has not previously been thoroughly explored. This study outlines that viscoelastic effects have an important impact on encoding in the tactile system, which should be considered in the design and interpretation of future studies. Viscoelasticity was shown to affect the mechanical skin deflections and stresses/strains imposed by previous and current interaction force, and also the resultant neuronal signalling. The result of this was an impaired coding of contact forces based on previous stimulation. The authors may be able to strengthen their findings, by using the existing data to further explore the link between skin mechanics and neural signalling, giving a clearer picture than demonstrating shared variability. This is not a critical addition, but I believe would strengthen the work and make it more generally applicable.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- Elegant design of the study. Direct measurements have been made from the tactile sensory neurons to give detailed information on touch encoding. Experiments have been well designed and the forces/displacements have been thoroughly controlled and measured to give accurate measurements of global skin mechanics during a set of controlled mechanical stimuli.</p><p>- Analytical techniques used. Analysis of fundamental information coding and information representation in the sensory afferents reveals dynamic coding properties to develop putative models of the neural representation of force. This advanced analysis method has been applied to a large dataset to study neural encoding of force, the temporal dynamics of this, and the variability in this.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- Lack of exploration of the variation in neural responses. Although there is a viscoelastic effect that produces variability in the stimulus effects based on prior stimulation, it is a shame that the variability in neural firing and force-induced skin displacements have been presented, and are similarly variable, but there has been no investigation of a link between the two. I believe with these data the authors can go beyond demonstrating shared variability. The force per se is clearly not faithfully represented in the neural signal, being masked by stimulation history, and it is of interest if the underlying resultant contact mechanics are.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.

Although generally written that there are four types of afferent in the glabrous skin, it would be better to state that these are low-threshold A-beta myelinated mechanoreceptive afferents, at least one time, as there are other types of afferent in the glabrous skin that respond to mechanical stimulation (e.g. low and high threshold C-fibers).</p></disp-quote><p>This is now clarified at the start of the Results section:</p><p>“We recorded action potentials in the median nerve of individual low-threshold A-beta myelinated first-order human tactile neurons innervating the glabrous skin of the fingertip…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Fig. 3: Could you add '(N)' as the measurement of force for Fig. 3A for Fz, Fy, and Fz?

These vectors have been demonstrated to systematically change with the condition in the irregular series (Figure 2E) and will thus significantly act on the dynamics of induced mechanical changes in the skin with a given interaction force. Thus, it could be examined how the neurons code the magnitude of displacements as well as their direction. An evaluation of the extent to which the imposed displacement magnitudes are encoded in the neural responses would be a useful addition in explaining the signalling of the force events and how the central nervous system decodes these. Evaluating an alternative displacement encoding for comparison to pure force encoding may reveal more about how contact events are represented in the tactile system, which must decode these variable afferent signals to reconstruct a percept of the interaction. It could then be explored how the central nervous system may then scale the dynamic afferent responses based on the background viscoelastic state likely to be present in the SA-II afferent signals (Figure 7) for a context in which to evaluate the dynamic contact forces. This may of course be a complex relationship for the type-I afferents, where the underlying mechanical events evoking the firing (microslips not represented in global forces) have not been measured here. Such a model could be more widely applicable, as the skin viscoelasticity and displacement magnitudes are a straightforward measurement metric and could perhaps be used as a better proxy for neural signalling. This would allow the investigation of a wider variety of forces, and the study of the timing of the viscoelastic effect, both of which have been fixed here. This would give the work a broader impact, rather than just highlighting that this effect produces variability, it could reveal if this mechanical feature is structured in the neural representation. The categorical encoding/decoding tested here is specific to the stimuli used (magnitudes, intervals), but there is the possibility that this may be more generally applicable (within the bounds of forces/speeds) if the underlying basis of the variability in the signalling produced by the viscoelasticity is identified. Since the time course of the viscoelasticity has not been measured here (fixed forces and intervals), further study is required to fully understand the implications this has for a wider variety of situations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a better understanding of how the mechanical deformations are reflected in the resulting spike trains would be valuable. While ultimately a full understanding will need precise measurements of skin deformation across the whole fingertip to account for mechanical propagation to mechanoreceptor locations, relating the deformations at the contact location with neural firing patterns directly can provide useful hints into which aspects of deformation are encoded and how. To this end, we ran a new analysis that aimed to predict the time-varying neural responses directly from the recorded mechanical movements of the contactor.</p><p>Below we have reproduced the new results and methods text along with the additional figures for this analysis. Note that we have also added text in the Discussion to interpret these findings in the context of our other results.</p><p>New section in Results titled Predicting neural responses from contactor movements: “The similarity in the history-dependent variation in neural firing and fingertip deformation at a given force stimulus suggests that neuronal firing is determined by how the fingertip deforms rather than the applied force itself. However, this similarity does not clarify the relationship between fingertip deformation dynamics and neural signaling. To investigate further, we fit cross-validated multiple linear regression models to evaluate how well distinct aspects of contactor movement could predict the time-varying firing rates of individual neurons during the protraction phases of the irregular sequence. The models used predictors based on (1) the three-dimensional position of the contactor, (2) its three-dimensional velocity, (3) a combination of position and velocity signals, and, finally, (4) position and velocity signals along with all possible two-way interactions between them, capturing potentially complex relationship between fingertip deformations and neural signaling.</p><p>Comparing the variance explained (R<sup>2</sup>) by each regression model for each neuron type revealed clear differences between the models (Figure 5A). A two-way mixed design ANOVA, with regression model as within-group effects and neuron type as a between-group effect revealed a main effect of model on variance explained (F(3,462) = 815.5, p &lt; 0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.84). Model prediction accuracy overall increased with the number of predictors, with the two-way interaction model outperforming all others (p &lt; 0.001 for all comparisons, Tukey’s HSD). Additionally, a significant main effect of neuron type (F(2,154) = 29.8, p &lt; 0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.28) and a significant interaction between regression model and neuron type were observed (F(6,462) = 50.8, p &lt; 0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.40).</p><p>For neuron type, model predictions were most accurate for SA-2 neurons, followed by SA-1 neurons, with FA-1 neurons showing the lowest accuracy (p &lt; 0.003 for all comparisons, Tukey’s HSD). The interaction between model and neuron type revealed distinct patterns. For SA-1 and SA-2 neurons, position-only and velocity-only models had similar prediction accuracy (p ≥ 0.996, Tukey’s HSD) with no significant differences between these neuron types (p ≥ 0.552, Tukey’s HSD). FA-1 neurons performed poorly with the position-only model but showed higher accuracy with the velocity-only model (p &lt; 0.001, Tukey’s HSD) and better than SA-1 neurons (p = 0.006, Tukey’s HSD). Models combining position and velocity predictors (without interactions) surpassed both position-only and velocity-only models for SA-1 and SA-2 neurons (p &lt; 0.001, Tukey’s HSD). Overall, the differences between neuron types broadly match their tuning to static and dynamic stimulus properties.</p><p>The two-way interaction model, accounting for most variance in neural responses, produced mean R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.75 for FA-1, 0.88 for SA-1, and 0.91 for SA-2 neurons (Figure 5A). To evaluate the contribution of the different predictors, we ranked them using the permutation feature importance method, focusing on the six most important ones. Regression analyses using only these variables explained almost all of the variance explained by the full model, with a median R<sup>2</sup> reduction of just 0.055 across all neurons. Across all neuron types, at least half included all three velocity components (dPx, dPy, dPz) among the top six, with FA-1 neurons showing the highest prevalence (Figure 5B). Interactions between normal position (Pz) and each velocity component were also frequently observed, while interactions involving tangential position and velocity components were less common. Interactions among velocity components were relatively well represented, followed by interactions limited to position components. Position signals were generally less represented, except for normal position (Pz) in slowly adapting neurons, where it appeared in 50% of SA-1 and 68% of SA-2 neurons. Despite these broad trends, important predictors varied widely across ranks even within a given neuron class (see Figure 5-figure supplement 1), and even the most frequent variables appeared in only a subset of cases, suggesting broad variability in sensitivity across neurons.”</p><p>New methods paragraph titled Predicting time-varying firing rates from skin deformations:</p><p>“This analysis was conducted in Python (v3.13) with pandas for data handling, numpy for numerical operations, and scikit-learn for model fitting and evaluation.</p><p>To assess how well individual neurons' time-varying firing rates could be predicted from simultaneous contactor movements, we fitted multiple linear regression models (see Khamis et al., 2015, for a similar approach). This analysis focused on the force protraction phase of the irregular sequence, where neurons were most responsive and sensitive to stimulation history. Data from 100 ms before to 100 ms after the protraction phase (between -0.100 s and 0.225 s relative to protraction onset) were included for each trial. Neurons were included if they fired at least two action potentials during the force protraction phase and the following 100 ms in at least five of the 25 trials. This ensured sufficient variability in firing rates for meaningful regression analysis, resulting in 68 SA-1, 38 SA-2, and 51 FA-1 neurons being included.</p><p>Contractor position signals digitized at 400 Hz were linearly interpolated to 1000 Hz. Instantaneous firing rates, derived from action potentials sampled at 12.8 kHz, were resampled at 1000 Hz to align with position signals. A Gaussian filter (σ = 10 ms, cutoff ~16 Hz) was applied to the firing rate as well as to the position signals before differentiation. To account for axonal conduction (8–15 ms) and sensory transduction delays (1–5 ms), firing rates were advanced by 15 ms to align approximately with independent variables.</p><p>Regressions were performed using scikit-learn's Ridge and RidgeCV regressors, which apply L2 regularization to mitigate overfitting. Hyperparameter tuning for the regularization parameter (alpha) was performed using GridSearchCV with a predefined range (0.001–1000.0), incorporating five-fold cross-validation to select the best value. To minimize overfitting risks, model performance was further validated with independent five-fold cross-validation (KFold), and R<sup>2</sup> scores were computed using cross_val_score.</p><p>We constructed four linear regression models with increasing complexity: (1) Position-only, using three-dimensional contactor positions (Px, Py, Pz); (2) Velocity-only, using three-dimensional velocities (dPx, dPy, dPz); (3) Combined, including all position and velocity signals (6 predictors); and (4) Interaction, including all signals and their two-way interactions (21 predictors). All features were standardized using StandardScaler to improve regularization and model convergence. PolynomialFeatures generated second-order interaction terms for the interaction model. Feature importance was evaluated with permutation_importance, and simpler models were built using the most important features. These models were validated through cross-validation to assess retained explanatory power.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor:</p><p>- It would be useful to add a brief description of the material aspects of the contactor tip to the methods (as per Birznieks 2001).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following statement:</p><p>“To ensure that friction between the contactor and the skin was sufficiently high to prevent slips, the surface was coated with silicon carbide grains (50–100 μm), approximating the finish of smooth sandpaper.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The axes labelling on Figure 3A and legend description is ambiguous, probably placing the Px, Py, and Pz labels on the far left axes and the Fx, Fy, and Fz on the right side of the far right axes would make this clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>Label placement has been improved along with some other minor fixes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- For the quasi-static phase analysis, the phrase &quot;absence of loading&quot; used in reference to the interstimulus period and SA-II afferents does not seem to be a correct description.
