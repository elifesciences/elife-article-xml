AZ proteins play multiple roles such as recruitment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels as well as synaptic vesicle docking, priming, and fusion. However, the precise role of each AZ protein type remains unknown. In order to dissect the role of RIM-BP2 at mammalian cortical synapses having low release probability, we applied direct electrophysiological recording and super-resolution imaging to hippocampal mossy fiber terminals of RIM-BP2 knockout (KO) mice. By using direct presynaptic recording, we found the reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents. The measurements of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and presynaptic capacitance suggested that the initial release probability was lowered because of the reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and impaired fusion competence in RIM-BP2 KO. Nevertheless, larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx restored release partially. Consistent with presynaptic recording, STED microscopy suggested less abundance of P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at AZs deficient in RIM-BP2. Our results suggest that the RIM-BP2 regulates both Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel abundance and transmitter release at mossy fiber synapses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>presynaptic</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>transmitter release</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI JP20J20550</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miyano</surname><given-names>Rinako</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JSPS Core-to-Core Program A.

Synaptic vesicle fusion occurs at a specialized region of the presynaptic membrane called the active zone (AZ), where Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters and vesicle fusion sites are accommodated via AZ scaffold proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">SÃ¼dhof, 2012</xref>). For rapid transmission, accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, co-localization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and fusion sites, and molecular priming of synaptic vesicles for fusion are required, and the differences among these factors might provide a basis for synaptic diversity. However, it remains unknown how these factors are regulated by AZ-scaffold proteins.</p><p>Rab3-interacting molecule-binding proteins (RIM-BPs) represent one principal, conserved family of AZ proteins and bind to RIMs and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hibino et al., 2002</xref>). RIM-BP family includes RIM-BP1, RIM-BP2, and RIM-BP3 in mammals, but RIM-BP3 expression is low in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mittelstaedt and Schoch, 2007</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), loss of RIM-BPs decreases Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel density and reduces release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, RIM-BP in <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs is necessary for tight coupling of synaptic vesicles to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and replenishment of high release probability vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MÃ¼ller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Petzoldt et al., 2020</xref>). In mammalian synapses, the observations from KO mice are diverse. In RIM-BP1,2 DKO mice, the coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles becomes loose, and action potential-evoked neurotransmitter release is reduced at the calyx of Held synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acuna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butola et al., 2021</xref>). At hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses, RIM-BP2 deletion alters Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel localization at the AZs without altering total Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Besides, RIM-BP1,2 DKO has no additional effect, indicating that RIM-BP2 dominates the function of RIM-BP isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grauel et al., 2016</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krinner et al., 2021</xref>). Tight coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and vesicles is crucial for rapid and efficient transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wadel et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synapses are characterized by low release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</xref>). At hippocampal mossy fiber synapses, gSTED imaging suggests that RIM-BP2 KO alters the Munc13-1 cluster number and distribution. In addition, RIM-BP2 deletion decreases the number of docked vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brockmann et al., 2019</xref>). However, because of technical difficulty, direct and quantitative measurements of exocytosis in RIM-BP2 KO terminals have not been performed so far.</p><p>To quantify the RIM-BP2 function in mossy fiber-CA3 synapses, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from WT and RIM-BP2 KO hippocampal mossy fiber boutons. From electrophysiological recordings, we found that the reductions of Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes in RIM-BP2 KO terminals. The EPSC and capacitance measurements suggested that the reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents was responsible, in part, for that of transmitter release. In addition, they suggested that fusion competence was impaired, which could be overcome by larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the terminal. Using STED imaging, we found the abundance of P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in terminals to be reduced in RIM-BP2 KO. We suggest that RIM-BP2 regulates the number of P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the AZ and is critical for transmitter release at hippocampal mossy fiber terminals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RIM-BP2 KO reduces presynaptic calcium currents at hippocampal mossy fiber boutons</title><p>To investigate the roles of RIM-BP2 in synaptic transmission, we examined the kinetics of exocytosis and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in WT and RIM-BP2 KO synapses using presynaptic whole-cell capacitance measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). When the terminal was depolarized from â80 mV to +10 mV for 10 ms, Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and membrane capacitance were recorded as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. During the depolarizing pulse, capacitance was not measured due to large conductance changes, and the increase was used for measuring synaptic vesicle exocytosis. To determine the size of the RRP and the time course of exocytosis, we measured capacitance changes (ÎC<sub>m</sub>) in response to various durations of depolarization. Here, the length of the depolarizing pulse was varied between 5 ms and 100 ms, and ÎC<sub>m</sub> was plotted against pulse duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, bottom). ÎC<sub>m</sub> became larger as the duration of pulse was prolonged, but the increase started to be saturated at a 100 ms pulse in WT terminals, suggesting depletion of the RRP. ÎC<sub>m</sub> in response to a 100 ms pulse was 52 Â± 8.1 fF (n = 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The amplitude corresponds to the fusion of about 500â600 synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hallermann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Midorikawa and Sakaba, 2017</xref>). The time course of ÎC<sub>m</sub> could be fitted by a single exponential with a time constant of 59 Â± 12 ms. In RIM-BP2 KO terminals, ÎC<sub>m</sub> in response to a 100 ms pulse was somewhat smaller (41 Â± 5.9 fF, n = 8) than that of WT terminals, and the release time constant was somewhat slower (64 Â± 14 ms) than in WT terminals. We should note that the time constant is not necessarily reliable because the ÎC<sub>m</sub> values do not reach a plateau value at 100 ms pulse in some terminals. Although the capacitance jumps of KO may be smaller for shorter pulses, capacitance measurements are not sensitive enough to detect small changes (&lt;5 fF, 50 vesicles, see Figures 5 and 6). Nevertheless, the differences in the time course of capacitance were not significantly different between WT and KO (p=0.23 from ANOVA) and the effects on release examined by strong pulses depleting the RRP were relatively minor. The amplitudes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were smaller in RIM-BP2 KO terminals compared to WT terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, top, p&lt;0.02 from ANOVA). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> current in response to a 100 ms pulse was reduced by ~30% in RIM-BP2 KO terminals (27 Â± 3.9 pA, n = 8) compared to WT terminals (44 Â± 5.4 pA, n = 9) (p=0.0248, <italic>t</italic>-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, the results show that RIM-BP2 deletion reduces presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, but effects on the RRP size and the time course of release measured by capacitance measurements are relatively minor.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Presynaptic calcium currents and synaptic vesicle release in RIM-BP2 KO mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The terminal was depolarized from â80 mV to +10 mV in WT (black) and RIM-BP2 KO (gray) hippocampal mossy fiber boutons.

When the physical coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles is tight, EGTA (slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator) has less effect on release probability, but EGTA is effective when the coupling is loose. Previous experiments have suggested that RIM-BPs regulated the channelâvesicle coupling at the calyx of Held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acuna et al., 2015</xref>). If this observation also applies to the mossy fiber synapse, EGTA sensitivity of release should be higher in RIM-BP2 KO terminals. To investigate the coupling at mossy fiber boutons in RIM-BP2 KO, we changed the concentration of EGTA in the patch pipette. In the presence of 5 mM EGTA, we depolarized the terminal from â80 mV to +10 mV for 5 ms and recorded Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and membrane capacitance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

We compared the effect of EGTA on average amplitudes of peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in response to a 20 ms pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Therefore, we changed [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> from 2 mM to 1 mM and adjusted Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes of WT to the RIM-BP2 KO level. The capacitance increase and the amplitudes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents became similar to those of RIM-BP2 KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). These results indicated that WT and RIM-BP2 KO terminals had similar sensitivity of neurotransmitter release to EGTA. Thus, it is unlikely that changes in the coupling distance are responsible for the reduced exocytosis of the mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Smaller AP-evoked EPSCs in KO could not be explained entirely by the reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx</title><p>While Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes were clearly reduced in KO, capacitance jumps were reduced little. Capacitance measurements could only detect large amounts of exocytosis (~5 fF, 50 vesicles), and the changes relevant for the AP-evoked release (&lt;10 vesicles per AP per synapse) could not be detected. Moreover, large Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx used for the stimulation protocol of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> could overcome the deficits of RIM-BP2 KO. In order to detect the changes related to physiological conditions, we measured the AMPA-EPSCs evoked by electrical mossy fiber stimulation at CA3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref> , the EPSCs were evoked by dual stimulation of mossy fibers. The mossy fiber-evoked responses were confirmed by the relatively faster EPSC kinetics and sensitivity to DCG-IV (1 Î¼M), an mGluR2 agonist (remaining response of &lt;30%, 0.23 Â± 0.01 for WT [n = 5], 0.29 Â± 0.02 for KO [n = 5]). Because multiple fibers were stimulated, we could not estimate the number of vesicles released per one synapse. Nevertheless, when fibers were stimulated similarly, the EPSC amplitudes of KO were much smaller (893 Â± 202 pA in WT, n = 7; 189 Â± 73 pA in KO, n = 7) (p=0.011). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, presynaptic recordings indicated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes of KO at 4 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> became similar to those of WT at 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The EPSCs became larger when the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> was raised from 2 mM to 4 mM in KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, top, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and became more similar to those of WT. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, presynaptic recording showed that I<sub>Ca</sub>s of WT at 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> were similar to those of KO at 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>. However, the WT EPSCs at 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> seemed larger than KO at 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, bottom, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Changing the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> from 1.5 mM to 2 mM in WT and from 2 mM to 4 mM in KO should have the same potentiation effect on the EPSCs if the reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes are the only mechanism for reduced EPSCs in KO. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, we calculated two types of potentiation ratios: in WT, the ratio of the EPSC response in 2 mM to that in 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> was calculated in each cell. In KO, the ratio of the EPSC response in 4 mM to that in 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> was calculated in each cell. When these two values were compared, the ratios were much larger in KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, p&lt;0.01, <italic>t</italic>-test). Pr is more sensitive to the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> in the low end of the doseâresponse curve because of the third to fourth power dependence of release on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> at the low end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dodge and Rahamimoff, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneggenburger and Neher, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bollmann et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, the result suggests lower release probability in KO even when the amounts of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx were adjusted to be similar. When the paired pulse ratios were compared, all four conditions (WT in 1.5 mM and 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>, KO in 2 mM and 4 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>) provided similar values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The paired pulse ratio should be inversely correlated to Pr, in principle. However, paired pulse facilitation in mossy fiber synapses could be mediated by multiple effects, including Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent broadening of AP waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geiger and Jonas, 2000</xref>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer saturation, which is more pronounced and increases the paired-pulse ratios at higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blatow et al., 2003</xref>).

Thus, we identified AZs using Munc13-1 STED images and quantified the signal intensity of Cav2.1 or Cav2.2 only at AZs clustered in large VGLUT1-positive terminals in the CA3 stratum lucidum, allowing us to confine the analysis to large mossy fiber terminals innervating onto CA3 pyramidal cells.

Furthermore, we found that the number of Cav2.1 clusters within the AZ identified by STED deconvolution analysis was not altered (2.5 Â± 0.11 in WT, n = 4 animals; 2.3 Â± 0.02 in KO, n = 4 animals) (p=0.114). These data are consistent with the idea that RIM-BP2 KO reduces the abundance of P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels per cluster. To optically estimate physical distances between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and release sites, we next analyzed the nearest-neighboring distance between Cav2.1 and Munc13-1 clusters.

However, the resolution of STED microscopy cannot allow detection of small differences of the cluster number and the distance between WT and KO. From these results together with presynaptic recordings, we suggest that decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in RIM-BP2 KO hippocampal mossy fiber terminals is caused by less abundance of P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the AZ.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the AZ, and efficient vesicle docking and priming are essential factors for fast synaptic vesicle exocytosis.

RIM-BPs have been implicated in recruitment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to the AZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaeser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2011</xref>) by interacting with RIMs and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hibino et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, RIM-BPs, like RIM1/2, recruit Munc-13 and accelerate synaptic vesicle priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brockmann et al., 2020</xref>). At murine central synapses, RIM-BPs-deficient synapses demonstrate overall a rather mild decrease in the amounts of transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acuna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grauel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krinner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brockmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butola et al., 2021</xref>). Most studies so far have been mainly focused on synapses with high release probability (phasic synapses) such as the calyx of Held and CA3-CA1 synapses. That said, at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses, KO of RIM-BPs has a strong influence on synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brockmann et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses, release probability is relatively low (tonic synapses). It was unknown whether the reduction of transmitter release at RIM-BP2 KO mossy fiber synapses was due to impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel recruitment and/or impaired vesicle docking or priming. Using STED microscopy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brockmann et al., 2019</xref> suggested that the physical recruitment of Munc13-1 might be an important function of RIM-BP2, though functional demonstration had been lacking.</p><p>By using direct presynaptic patch-clamp recordings, we here observed a decrease of Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes (~30%) in RIM-BP2 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Our STED imaging did not detect differences in Munc13-1 cluster number at the AZ between WT and RIM-BP2 KO mice. Notably, we analyzed the number of Cav2.1, Cav2.2, and Munc13-1 clusters only within AZs showing direct co-localization with VGLUT1 and PSD-95, which mainly reflects the AZs facing CA3 pyramidal cells rather than the synapses onto interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AcsÃ¡dy et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rollenhagen et al., 2007</xref>). Such a difference in areas analyzed between previous and our study might explain the difference. In addition, some developmental variability/compensation could still occur in the range we studied and be relevant for the discrepancy between Munc13-1 results between <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brockmann et al., 2019</xref> and this study. Also, the spatial resolution of our study is limited and we cannot rigidly measure the signals only from large mossy fiber terminals. It is important to state that our results do not exclude roles of RIM-BP2 in synaptic vesicle priming. Indeed, we have shown that the reduction of the EPSC amplitudes could not be fully explained by the reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Because the differences in the RRP size measured from capacitance measurements were relatively minor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), the fusion competence was likely to be impaired by RIM-BP2 KO, but this could be overcome by large Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Consistently, the EPSCs responses of KO became larger and comparable to those of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>) during repetitive AP stimulation, at least qualitatively.</p><p>Recent studies have reported that RIM-BPs deletion altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel localization and loosened the coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles at mammalian synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acuna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grauel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butola et al., 2021</xref>). We investigated the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channelâvesicle coupling at hippocampal mossy fiber terminals. The sensitivity of release to Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator EGTA was not changed between WT and RIM-BP2 KO mice. We also indicated RIM-BP2 KO did not alter the coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to release sites by using STED microscopy, though spatial resolution of STED microscopy in this study could not allow to detect small changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>At some mammalian synapses, deletion of RIM-BP2 affects physical distance between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acuna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grauel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butola et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, at hippocampal mossy fiber terminals having low release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</xref>), RIM-BP2 KO decreased the abundance of P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, thereby reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and neurotransmitter release. We hypothesize the specific molecularâarchitectural and biochemical contributions by RIM-BPs might be of different relevance among different types of synapses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brockmann et al., 2020</xref> proposed that RIM-BP2 controlled Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel recruitment and vesicle priming by profound interaction with RIMs and Munc13s. These results have been obtained by studying hippocampal cultures dominated by phasic synapses. It seems possible that the interaction among three protein types is tight at some types of phasic synapses, simply because of the high density of these proteins at AZs. Alternatively, one might speculate about additional proteins, different interaction surfaces taken, and transsynaptic columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Deletion of RIM-BP2 does not lead to loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels themselves and/or vesicle priming due to remaining RIMs, Munc13, and other proteins, which can regulate recruitment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicle priming without RIM-BP2. Instead, fine-tuning of release such as synchronization is compromised. We hypothesize that AZ scaffold might be differently built, leading to different consequences when eliminating one component. Hence deletion of RIM-BP2 leads to immediate loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and vesicle priming. This is in line with the proposal that at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses, synaptic vesicles are only loosely coupled with Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</xref>) and vesicles are de-primed under resting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>). Future research along this line may lead to an understanding of how fine molecular differences in the AZ scaffolds might orchestrate synaptic diversity.</p><p>Although this study reveals reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and reduced fusion competence in RIM-BP2 KO mossy fiber synapses, it has some limitation. Most importantly, with conventional knockouts the observed changes could reflect compensatory developmental changes and not direct outcomes of the RIM-BP2 knockout.

The patch pipettes were filled with the intracellular solution containing (in mM) 135 Cs-gluconate, 20 TEA-Cl, 10 HEPES, 5 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, 4 MgATP, 0.3 GTP, and 0.5 EGTA (pH = 7.2 adjusted with CsOH). In some experiments, the concentration of EGTA was changed to 5 mM. Presynaptic patch pipettes (BF150-86-10, Sutter Instrument) had a resistance of 15â20 MÎ© and series resistance (R<sub>s</sub>) was 30â70 MÎ©. R<sub>s</sub> was compensated so that residual resistance was 30â35 MÎ©. For postsynaptic recordings, the same internal solution was used, except that EGTA concentration was raised to 5 mM. Postsynaptic patch pipettes (BF150-86-10, Sutter Instrument) had a resistance of 3â7 MÎ© and series resistance (R<sub>s</sub>) was 5â20 MÎ©, which was compensated by 50â80%.</p><p>Patch-clamp recordings were performed using an EPC10/3 or EPC10/2 amplifier (HEKA) in voltage-clamp mode, controlled by Patchmaster software (HEKA). Membrane currents were low-pass filtered at 2.9 kHz and sampled at 20 or 50 kHz.</p><p>Membrane capacitance measurements were performed using an EPC10/3 amplifier in the sine + DC configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lindau and Neher, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gillis, 2000</xref>) using Patchmaster software (HEKA). A sine wave (30 mV in amplitude, 1000 Hz in frequency) was superimposed on the holding potential of â80 mV. The terminal was depolarized from â80 mV to +10 mV for 5â100 ms. The IV of presynaptic Ca currents were measured by sequential depolarized for 5 ms, with 2 s intervals from â80 mV to +70 mV by 10 mV steps.</p><p>For the EPSC measurements, postsynaptic cells (CA3 pyramidal cells) were voltage clamped at â60 to â80 mV. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, the data were corrected for the different holding potential (re-calculated to the value at â70 mV assuming the reversal potential of 0 mV, which may have the correction effect of ~15%). At the end of the experiments, DCG-IV was applied to confirm mossy fiber synaptic responses, whenever possible. The mossy fibers were stimulated extracellularly using a glass electrode used for patch clamp containing the extracellular solution and the stimulation intensity was usually 10â60 V.</p><p>Data were obtained from at least three different WT and RIM-BP2 KO terminals in each set of experiments (biological replicate).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunostaining</title><p>Brains of WT and RIM-BP2 KO mice were quickly removed and transferred to cryomold (Sakura Finetek) filled with tissue freezing medium (Leica).

STED images were acquired using the Leica LAS-X software with an image format of 1024 Ã 1024 pixels, 16-bit sampling, 8-line accumulations, and 11.36-zoom factor, yielding a pixel size of 10 nm. HyD detectors were configured to counting mode with a gating from 0.5 to 6.5 ns. A 405 nm diode laser was used to excite DyLight405. Alexa488, Alexa594, and STAR635P were excited using WLL at 488 nm, 561 nm, and 633 nm, respectively. The 775 nm STED laser power was set to 75 and 100% of maximum power for depletion of STAR635P and Alexa594, respectively, and delay time was set to 300 ps.

Presynaptic calcium currents were measured at the peak amplitude during the depolarizing pulse. Capacitance jumps were measured between baseline (before the pulse) and ~10 ms after the pulse where the effect of tail currents became minor. To determine the time constant of release, an exponential fit was applied. Values are given as mean Â± SEM, and n indicates the number of recorded terminals or the number of animals used. Statistical method of sample size determination was not done, but our sample sizes are similar to those of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hallermann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Midorikawa and Sakaba, 2017</xref>).</p><p>For STED imaging, data were analyzed using custom-designed programs in Mathematica (Wolfram), values were processed using Igor Pro (WaveMetrics), and pictures were created with ImageJ (NIH). To determine the area of AZs, image masks were generated from STED images of Munc13-1 by unsharp masking and image binarization. Only AZs that show co-localization with VGLUT1 and PSD-95 immunofluorescence signals were included in the analysis. To confine the analysis to the large mossy fiber boutons, AZs in presynaptic terminals of small VGLUT1-positive area were excluded. Then, the background-subtracted integral of signal intensity of Cav2.1 or Cav2.2 was quantified using the image masks of AZs. The background signal intensity was estimated from non-AZ area in the same STED images. For quantification of Cav2.1 clusters in the AZs, STED images of Cav2.1 were deconvolved using a Gaussian kernel with a radius of 40 nm. Image masks of each Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel were generated from deconvolved STED images by unsharp masking and image binarization. Then, the total signal intensity, the size, and the number of Cav2.1 clusters at the AZs were quantified using the image masks of Cav2.1 clusters.

We agree that previous studies have sown reduced Ca influx at hair cells, and diverse function of RIM-BP2 in different central synapses have been proposed by Brockman et al. The new point of this study is we firmly and quantitatively show the reduced Ca currents using direct presynaptic recording, which has not been done in mossy fiber synapses or cortical synapses in general. Quantitative and time-resolved measurements of the presynaptic currents cannot be done by other methods, so far. In this revision, we point this out carefully.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The MS is overall carefully prepared and I have only a few minor comments to help with further improving the manuscript.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>I think the notion of different RBP function at tonic and phasic synapses is not so well founded. The reduced number of Ca2+ channels and their altered topography have been shown in multiple synapses that also include those with phasic release. Quantitative structural and functional analysis of presynaptic Ca2+ channels of RBP-2 and RBP1-2 DKO deficient AZs closely related to the present study has e.g. been provided for auditory synapses e.g. hair cells, endbulb/calyx of end synapses that provide both phasic and sustained release.</p></disp-quote><p>In abstract, we have omitted description of phasic vs tonic synapses, because it is not well founded as the reviewer pointed out. Specifically, in abstract (Line 13~):</p><p>âSynaptic vesicles dock and fuse at the presynaptic active zone (AZ), the specialized site for transmitter release. AZ proteins play multiple roles such as recruitment of Ca2+ channels as well as synaptic vesicle docking, priming and fusion. However, the precise role of each AZ protein type remains unknown. In order to dissect the role of RIM-BP2 at mammalian cortical synapses having low release probability, we applied direct electrophysiological recording and super-resolution imaging to hippocampal mossy fiber terminals of RIM-BP2 KO mice. By using direct presynaptic recording, we found the reduced Ca2+ currents. The measurements of EPSCs and presynaptic capacitance suggested that the initial release probability was lowered because of the reduced Ca2+ influx and impaired fusion competence in RIM-BP2 KO. Nevertheless, larger Ca2+ influx restored release partially. Consistent with presynaptic recording, STED microscopy suggested less abundance of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels at AZs deficient in RIM-BP2. Our results suggest that the RIM-BP2 regulates both Ca2+ channel abundance and transmitter release at mossy fiber synapses.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Intro:</p><p>Line 48: consider adding Butola et al., 2021 /endbuld of Held to reference which concurs on the notion made for Calyx.

(I) I recommend replacing density with abundance as the authors do not resolve single channels. (II) I appreciate the note of caution about the fact that STED nanoscopy due to the non-linear nature of the depletion process should/could not be easily used to quantify copy numbers based on immunofluorescence. I would recommend the authors perform 2D Gaussian fitting to at least the Cav2.1 immunofluorescent spots neighboring Munc13-1 spots and report the short and long axis estimates as well as potentially the area. Should the authors have confocal Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 immunofluorescent data co-acquired with STED of Munc13-1, this would be very valuable additional information, but I do not think the experiment is essential for the sake of publication if it was not done already, given the large body of high-quality physiology data.</p></disp-quote><p>I) We have changed the term from density to abundance as the reviewer suggested throughout the manuscript.</p><p>II) As the reviewer suggested, we have carried out 2D Gaussian fitting of Cav2.1 spots. The length, width, and area of Cav2.1 clusters in the AZ were not different between WT and RIM-BP2 KO terminals (Line 431-433, Figure 7-figure supplement 4). The spatial resolution of STED, especially at mossy fiber synapses in the tissue, and a small difference between WT and KO (~30 % expected from electrophysiology) could prevent detection of the difference, unlike ribbon synapses and fly NMJ where release sites and Ca channel clusters are well defined. We should also note that the intensity was calculated similar to previous studies (integral of signal intensity, Krinner et al., 2017), and not absolute peak intensity.</p><p>As the reviewer suggested, we have added confocal data (Line 434-436, Figure 7-figure supplement 5). We have determined the AZ area from the Munc13-1 STED data, and Munc13-1, Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 intensities were quantified. As shown in the figure, only Ca2.1 intensity was reduced in KO, consistent with the STED data.</p><p>Nevertheless, we should be cautious about interpretation of the intensity as the reviewer suggested, and are aware that the data are just consistent with electrophysiology.
