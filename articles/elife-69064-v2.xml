They can be derived from an expanding list of genomic contexts, such as processing from parental transcripts by RNase E. The role of RNase III in sRNA biogenesis is less well understood despite its well-known roles in rRNA processing, RNA decay, and cleavage of sRNA-mRNA duplexes. Here, we show that RNase III processes a pair of <italic>cis</italic>-encoded sRNAs (CJnc190 and CJnc180) of the food-borne pathogen <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>. While CJnc180 processing by RNase III requires CJnc190, RNase III processes CJnc190 independent of CJnc180 via cleavage of an intramolecular duplex. We also show that CJnc190 directly represses translation of the colonization factor PtmG by targeting a G-rich ribosome-binding site, and uncover that CJnc180 is a <italic>cis</italic>-acting antagonist of CJnc190, indirectly affecting <italic>ptmG</italic> regulation.

They are also intimately associated with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), such as RNA chaperones, as well as ribonucleases that are required for their maturation, stability, degradation, and/or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Holmqvist and Vogel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Quendera et al., 2020</xref>). While most of the first identified and characterized sRNAs in bacterial genomes are expressed as stand-alone, intergenically encoded transcripts, genome-wide RNA-seq based approaches have identified sRNAs hidden in unexpected genomic contexts, including in 5′/3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) and in coding regions of mRNAs, or even in housekeeping RNAs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Storz, 2020</xref>). These include members of the expanding class of 3’ UTR-derived sRNAs mainly studied in Gammaproteobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miyakoshi et al., 2015a</xref>). These can be transcribed from an independent promoter, such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MicL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Guo et al., 2014</xref>), or can be processed from mRNAs by the single-stranded RNA endonuclease RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chao and Vogel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Mets et al., 2019</xref>). Intergenically encoded, stand-alone sRNAs can also require maturation by RNase E to increase their stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chae et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Davis and Waldor, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hör et al., 2020</xref>), to expose their seed regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Papenfort et al., 2009</xref>), or even to create two different sRNAs with distinct regulons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Fröhlich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Papenfort et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite progress in defining mechanisms and regulatory consequences of complex sRNA biogenesis pathways in model Gammaproteobacteria, less is known about how such sRNAs are generated in bacteria lacking RNase E. RNase E has the most well-characterized role in bacterial sRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandyra and Luisi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miyakoshi et al., 2015a</xref>) but is absent in ~1/5 sequenced strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hui et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, bacteria almost universally encode RNase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Court et al., 2013</xref>). RNase III recognizes double-stranded RNA (11–20 base-pairs long) in a mostly sequence-independent manner, and cleaves both strands to generate characteristic 2–3 nucleotide (nt) 3’-overhangs. Single-strand nicking, especially at imperfect duplexes, can also occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altuvia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Court et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Le Rhun et al., 2017</xref>). Bacterial RNase III is mainly known for its role in rRNA processing, in maturation or decay of certain mRNAs, and in cleavage of sRNA-mRNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Court et al., 2013</xref>). While the RNase III domain-containing ribonucleases Dicer and Drosha play a central role in sRNA biogenesis in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009</xref>), the role of bacterial RNase III in sRNA biogenesis is less clear. In <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, RNase III generates RsaC sRNA from the 3′ UTR of <italic>mntABC</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lalaouna et al., 2019</xref>). Its expropriation for biogenesis of CRISPR RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Deltcheva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dugar et al., 2018</xref>), as well as genome-wide studies of the RNase III targetome that report sRNAs as potential targets in Gram-negative and Gram-positive species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altuvia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gordon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Le Rhun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lioliou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lioliou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lybecker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rath et al., 2017</xref>), indicate that RNase III might process sRNAs in diverse bacteria. However, most of these potential RNase III targets remain to be validated or studied.</p><p>In addition to an expanding genomic context of regulatory RNA sources, there is also emerging evidence for high complexity of bacterial post-transcriptional networks involving not only cross-talk with transcriptional control, but also RNA antagonists that can sequester and modulate RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dugar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Romeo and Babitzke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sterzenbach et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wassarman, 2018</xref>) or even regulate stability or function of other RNAs as so-called competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), RNA decoys/predators, or sponge RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Figueroa-Bossi and Bossi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Grüll and Massé, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kavita et al., 2018</xref>). Such RNA antagonists can be derived from diverse cellular transcripts, including mRNAs (UTRs and coding regions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Storz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Figueroa-Bossi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Miyakoshi et al., 2015b</xref>) and tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lalaouna et al., 2015</xref>), or can be stand-alone sRNAs encoded in the core genome or in prophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bronesky et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Melamed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tree et al., 2014</xref>). Unbiased global biochemical and genetic screens for sRNA expression and regulation have recently recovered several characterized examples of <italic>trans</italic>-acting sRNA antagonists in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bronesky et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Durand et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Melamed et al., 2020</xref>), including those affecting infection phenotypes via antagonism of central sRNA regulators of virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Le Huyen et al., 2021</xref>). Despite reports of extensive antisense transcription in diverse bacteria and the demonstrated role of <italic>cis</italic>-encoded antisense RNAs (asRNAs) in control of mRNA translation and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Thomason and Storz, 2010</xref>), less is known about whether RNAs encoded in <italic>cis</italic> to other sRNAs can act also as antagonists and how they might affect the biogenesis, stability, or function of their antisense sRNA partners.</p><p>The zoonotic pathogen <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> is currently the leading cause of bacterial food-borne gastroenteritis worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burnham and Hendrixson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Havelaar et al., 2015</xref>). How <italic>C. jejuni</italic> regulates its gene expression to adapt to different environments is so far unclear, as its genome encodes only three sigma factors and lacks homologs of certain global stress response regulators such as RpoS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Parkhill et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Young et al., 2007</xref>) as well as of the global RNA chaperones Hfq and ProQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pernitzsch and Sharma, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Quendera et al., 2020</xref>). Our comparative differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) analysis of multiple <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strains revealed many conserved and strain-specific sRNAs and asRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dugar et al., 2013</xref>). However, functions are still largely unknown for most of these. Besides so far not encoding a general sRNA chaperone, it is also unclear which RNases participate in sRNA biogenesis and function in <italic>C. jejuni</italic>. Although Epsilonproteobacteria such as <italic>C. jejuni</italic> and the related gastric pathogen <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> are Gram-negative, they surprisingly encode an RNase repertoire more similar to Gram-positives: for example, RNase Y and RNase J instead of RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Parkhill et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pernitzsch and Sharma, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tomb et al., 1997</xref>). <italic>C. jejuni</italic> also encodes an RNase III homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Haddad et al., 2013</xref>), which participates in the biogenesis of Type II-C CRISPR RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dugar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dugar et al., 2013</xref>). Beyond this and a role in rRNA biogenesis, the function of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> RNase III is unclear.</p><p>Here, we have characterized the biogenesis and mode of action of a conserved, processed pair of <italic>C. jejuni cis</italic>-encoded sRNAs, CJnc180/190. We previously reported that deletion of these sRNAs affects <italic>C. jejuni</italic> virulence in a three-dimensional tissue-engineered model of the human intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alzheimer et al., 2020</xref>). While this seemed to be mediated at least in part via repression of the flagellin modification factor PtmG, the molecular mechanisms underlying this, the roles of each of the two sRNAs in PtmG regulation, as well as how they are processed remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that both RNAs are processed by RNase III and that mature CJnc190 directly represses translation of <italic>ptmG</italic> mRNA by base-pairing with a G-rich sequence over its RBS. Surprisingly, although both RNAs are encoded antisense to each other and show perfect complementarity, suggesting they might be co-processed by RNase III, only CJnc180 requires its antisense partner for maturation. Instead, CJnc190 is transcribed as longer precursors which can fold into extended stem-loop structures that are processed by RNase III independently of CJnc180. Finally, we demonstrate that CJnc180 is a <italic>cis</italic>-acting antagonist of CJnc190. Overall, our characterization of CJnc180/190 demonstrates a role for RNase III in sRNA maturation and also reveals the potential for <italic>cis</italic>-encoded sRNA-sRNA targeting.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A product of the CJnc180/190 sRNA locus represses expression of <italic>ptmG</italic></title><p>Our comparative dRNA-seq study of multiple <italic>C. jejuni</italic> isolates revealed a conserved pair of antisense sRNAs, CJnc180 and CJnc190 (annotated as 99 and 216 nt, respectively, in strain NCTC11168) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dugar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Subsequent predictions of secondary structures and potential <italic>ptmG</italic> mRNA interactions with the mature sRNA sequences revealed a strong potential for a C/U-rich loop within CJnc190 to base-pair with the ribosome-binding site (RBS) and start codon of <italic>ptmG</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A less stable interaction was predicted between CJnc180 and the 3′ end of the <italic>ptmG</italic> coding region (ΔG = –6.4 kcal/mol compared to –16.9 kcal/mol for CJnc190:<italic>ptmG</italic>), suggesting that CJnc190, and not CJnc180, directly represses <italic>ptmG</italic> translation. To test this experimentally, we constructed Δ180/190 complementation strains expressing either mature CJnc180 or CJnc190 alone (hereafter C-180(Proc) or C-190(Proc)) from their annotated native promoters (P1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <italic>left</italic>) and measured rescue of <italic>ptmG</italic> repression.

Further northern blot analysis of total RNA from Rnc+ and Δ<italic>rnc</italic> strains with diverse probes showed that the 3′ end of CJnc180 is removed by RNase III processing, and that its 5′ end is RNase III-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).

One end matched the annotated primary TSS for CJnc190 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dugar et al., 2013</xref>), which has a putative –10 box (TAATAT) immediately upstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right). Inspection of the nucleotides upstream of the second detected 5′ end also revealed a near consensus –10 box (TAAAAT).

Analysis of CJnc180 in a Δ<italic>rnc</italic> background in the generated promoter mutant strains showed that disruption of the annotated CJnc180 promoter –10 box (strain C-190 only) fully abolished CJnc180 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lane 5), confirming its single TSS. CJnc180 promoter disruption reduced accumulation of some CJnc190 precursors but did not affect their 5′ ends, suggesting transcriptional interference might impact 3′ ends. Next, we inspected pre-CJnc190 expression in strains with disruptions in either CJnc190(P1) or CJnc190(P2) added to the C-190-only construct. In a strain with CJnc180 and CJnc190 P1 promoters inactivated, the two longest CJnc190 species of Δ<italic>rnc</italic> were absent, and detection of a shorter CJnc190 transcript supported the presence of a second promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lane 6). In the strain with only CJnc190 P1 intact, instead only a longer (~280 nt) transcript was detected (lane 7). Finally, disruption of all three putative promoters (C-3×mut) completely abolished expression of all CJnc180 and CJnc190 transcripts (lane 8). Primer extension analysis of RNA from the same promoter mutant strains validated that the two 5’ ends we detected were dependent on the upstream –10 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes 7–11). Overall, mapping of CJnc180 and CJnc190 precursors in Δ<italic>rnc</italic> suggested that mature CJnc180 is transcribed from a single promoter and derived from its precursor 5′ end, while mature CJnc190 is generated from the middle of transcripts with different 3′ end lengths arising from two promoters.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>CJnc180, but not CJnc190, requires its antisense partner for processing by RNase III</title><p>As the RNase III-dependent biosynthesis pathway of CJnc190 and CJnc180 makes them distinct from processed sRNAs characterized in Gammaproteobacteria, we next explored their maturation in more detail. Because of their extensive complementarity, we hypothesized that RNase III co-processes CJnc180:CJnc190 duplexes. To examine this, we repeated northern blot analysis of the CJnc180/190 promoter-inactivated allele strains, but this time in an RNase III + background. This surprisingly showed that the C-190-only strain (with the CJnc180 promoter disrupted) still expressed mature CJnc190 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We also found that CJnc190 precursors from either P1 or P2 could give rise to mature CJnc190, although when expressed from P1 or P2 alone, mature sRNA levels were approximately 60% of those detected in the WT, C-180/190, or C-190-only strains.

We therefore examined the effect of CJnc180 overexpression on PtmG levels. Overexpression of full-length CJnc180 or ‘pre-processed’ CJnc180(Proc) increased PtmG-3×FLAG to levels intermediate between Δ180/190 and WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

We determined the effect of CJnc180 absence/presence on PtmG-3×FLAG levels at different phases of growth (early exponential, mid-exponential, and early stationary). We compared PtmG-3×FLAG protein and mRNA levels in Δ180/190, C-190-only, and OE-180(Proc) strains to those in C-180/190 as a control. PtmG-3×FLAG protein levels were relatively similar in the C-180/190 complemented strain at all culture densities, and in Δ180/190 showed sustained upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In contrast, CJnc180 absence or overexpression differentially affected PtmG-3×FLAG levels depending on growth phase. For C-190-only (CJnc180 absent, CJnc190 P1 and P2 active), PtmG-3×FLAG levels were mildly decreased compared to C-180/190 - but only in early stationary. In contrast, overexpression of CJnc180 de-repressed PtmG-3×FLAG levels in mid-log, but had no significant effect in stationary phase.

Further analysis of CJnc190 expression from either promoter over growth did not reveal marked differences in expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>).

Our data establishes a role for RNase III in CJnc190 maturation, which in turn is required for <italic>ptmG</italic> regulation. However, it remains unclear why CJnc190 has this complex biogenesis pathway. Processing seems to generate a more stable form of CJnc190, but might also affect its activity. Surprisingly, CJnc190 processing was independent of its antisense RNA CJnc180. Instead, CJnc190 maturation involves co-processing on both sides of the mature sRNA by RNase III via a predicted long duplex region involving both ends of the precursor.</p><p>It remains unclear how cleavage of the long CJnc190 5′/3′ end duplex might give rise to the final mature sRNA. Additional RNases such as RNase J, Y, R, or PNPase might be involved in further processing or trimming to the mature 5′/3′ ends. For example, in <italic>E. coli</italic>, processing of ribosomal RNAs or prophage-encoded DicF is initiated by RNase III cleavage of a stem-loop, followed by additional cleavages by RNases such as RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Faubladier et al., 1990</xref>). RNase III cleavage is followed by RNase J1 trimming during processing of the SRP RNA component scRNA (small cytoplasmic RNA) in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yao et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to CJnc190, CJnc180 processing by RNase III required its <italic>cis</italic>-encoded partner to create a double-stranded substrate.

CJnc180 therefore appears to be a new <italic>cis</italic>-acting representative of RNAs that target other sRNAs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Denham, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Figueroa-Bossi and Bossi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Grüll and Massé, 2019</xref>). Such antagonists are mainly <italic>trans</italic>-encoded and can be derived from mRNAs, tRNA 3′ external transcribed spacers, or other sRNAs. In contrast to reported examples, CJnc180 antagonizes a <italic>cis</italic>-encoded sRNA. Additional candidate antagonizing RNAs are <italic>cis</italic>-encoded pairs that are differentially expressed under specific conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Denham, 2020</xref>).

An open question is whether the two sRNAs simply sequester each other, or play a role in each others’ turnover. CJnc180:CJnc190 co-processing would disrupt SL1 of CJnc190, which potentially protects the sRNA from RNase-mediated degradation. Antagonism could thus occur via cleavage and decay of CJnc190. Inspection of CJnc190 primer extension analysis for evidence of co-processing of the two sRNAs in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>) did not reveal an RNase III- and CJnc180-dependent CJnc190 5′ end that would be consistent with the 2 nt 3′-overhangs generated by RNase III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, bottom), although reduced stability might preclude its detection. Alternatively, only the CJnc180 strand of the duplex might be cleaved, as has been reported for some RNase III substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altuvia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Court et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Le Rhun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dunn, 1976</xref>).</p><p>Since overexpression of either ‘pre-processed’ or full-length CJnc180 affected <italic>ptmG</italic>, co-processing might not be the only mechanism by which CJnc180 influences CJnc190. The extensive complementarity remaining for the processed sRNAs means that even mature CJnc180 could sequester CJnc190 – and possibly also promote degradation by RNase III. Finally, transcriptional interference might be involved, in line with our observation that abolishing CJnc180 expression reduced levels of some CJnc190 precursors with shorter 3′ ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The CJnc190 3′ end position is immediately upstream of the CJnc180 promoter on the opposite strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). RNAs (including sRNAs, mRNAs, or derivatives of other cellular RNAs) that target sRNAs have commonly been termed ‘sponge’ RNAs or ceRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Denham, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Grüll and Massé, 2019</xref>). Ultimately, the impact of CJnc180 on CJnc190 (and vice versa) might be multifactorial and include sequestration from targets, transcriptional interference, or promotion of decay. This might depend on their relative levels and/or on levels of other cellular molecules such as mRNA targets and RNases, as post-transcripional regulation is inherently dependent on the overall cellular state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gottesman, 2004</xref>). We therefore propose terming CJnc180 (and also CJnc190) as RNA ‘antagonists’, and suggest reserving the term ‘sponge’ for those that purely sequester or compete with targets without promoting decay.</p><p>The potential for independent regulation of CJnc180 and CJnc190 makes an antagonistic relationship attractive. The mechanism by which CJnc180 affects CJnc190 appears to be dependent on the stoichiometry of the two sRNAs, as has been previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Denham, 2020</xref>) and recently demonstrated for the RNAIII antagonist SprY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Le Huyen et al., 2021</xref>). A similar variation in sponge and sRNA stoichiometry has been reported for the ChiX sRNA and its decoy, the <italic>chbBC</italic> intergenic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Figueroa-Bossi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Plumbridge et al., 2014</xref>). Presumably, CJnc180 could serve to buffer and/or set a threshold for CJnc190 levels to regulate targets, as for tRNA-derived sponge RNAs in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lalaouna et al., 2015</xref>). While we observed that the mature sRNAs show inverse expression levels during growth, it remains unknown how they are transcriptionally controlled and in response to which signals their levels change. While CJnc180 is transcribed from one promoter (P1), CJnc190 is transcribed from at least two promoters (P1 and P2). Precursors from both promoters are expressed during routine growth and give rise to the mature sRNA. The two promoters presumably increase the potential for environmental inputs into CJnc180/190, thereby increasing the complexity of the locus even further. Future work will reveal transcriptional regulators and conditions that regulate the CJnc180/190 promoters, and how transcriptional control intersects with RNase III processing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>CJnc190 directly represses <italic>ptmG</italic> by targeting a G-rich sequence and impacts virulence</title><p>Based on in vitro and in vivo analyses, we demonstrated that CJnc190 directly represses <italic>ptmG</italic> translation by base-pairing with the G-rich RBS of its mRNA using a C/U-rich loop. Thus, CJnc190 binding likely interferes with translation initiation, resembling the canonical mode of sRNA-mediated target repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Storz et al., 2011</xref>). The structure of mature CJnc190 is reminiscent of RepG sRNA from <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Svensson and Sharma, 2021</xref>), which uses a C/U-rich loop to target a phase-variable G-repeat in the 5’ UTR of a chemotaxis receptor mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pernitzsch et al., 2014</xref>). Although CJnc190 and RepG share C/U-rich loop regions, their biogenesis is strikingly different: while RepG is transcribed as a separate standing gene corresponding to the mature sRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pernitzsch et al., 2014</xref>), CJnc190 is transcribed opposite to another sRNA (CJnc180) and is processed into the mature form from diverse precursors in <italic>C. jejuni</italic> and related <italic>C. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Svensson and Sharma, 2021</xref>). It is interesting to imagine how CJnc190 (and CJnc180) might have arisen - de novo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Jose et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Updegrove et al., 2015</xref>), or from a degenerate type I toxin-antitoxin system as might be the case for the <italic>H. pylori</italic> sRNA NikS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Eisenbart et al., 2020</xref>). Also in more diverse species, several sRNAs with C/U-rich target interaction sites have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boisset et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bronesky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Heidrich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schmidtke et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that targeting of G-rich sequences might be a more widespread phenomenon.</p><p>A previous study of CJnc180/190 in our 3D model of the human intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alzheimer et al., 2020</xref>) showed that CJnc180/190 as well as <italic>ptmG,</italic> the target of CJnc190, are involved in infection. PtmG is part of a six-gene cluster in the flagellin glycosylation island of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> NCTC11168 that has been associated with livestock strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Champion et al., 2005</xref>) and is in the pathway generating legionaminic acid sugar precursors that decorate its flagellins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Howard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zebian et al., 2016</xref>). As PtmG is required for chicken colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Howard et al., 2009</xref>), CJnc190 might impact virulence phenotypes via <italic>ptmG</italic> regulation. However, as CJnc190 is also found in strains that lack PtmG, such as strain 81–176 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dugar et al., 2013</xref>), it likely has additional targets that remain to be identified that could account for its infection phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alzheimer et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, antagonist CJnc180, which indirectly affects <italic>ptmG</italic> levels, might have an additional function as a <italic>trans</italic>-acting sRNA that targets other mRNAs encoding factors affecting virulence. Future studies will reveal the complete regulon of each sRNA and the contribution of their direct targets to virulence phenotypes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Here, Sharma and coworkers demonstrate the complex pathway that leads to the maturation of two complementary regulatory RNAs and how one of the RNAs antagonizes the other to relieve repression of a virulence-related gene. The work is detailed and convincing, and provides a reference point for the roles of regulatory RNAs in <italic>C. jejuni</italic> as well as other bacteria. Future work will be needed to better understand when each of these RNAs is best expressed and processed into active form, and to fully support the idea that one RNA acts as an antagonist for the other.</p><p>1. As noted above, this is a complex paper with a lot going on. A model at the end or possibly the beginning would certainly help, even if it leaves some questions unanswered (processing beyond the RNAse III cutting, expression conditions). The initial part (Figure 1, 2; defining 190 for repression of ptmG) is reasonably easy going, but understanding the various precursors and processing data is more of a challenge.</p><p>2. The data at the end of the paper (Figure 6) on 180 antagonizing 190 could be strengthened. At the moment, the only real evidence is the OE data in 6D. Given that this is an important part of the paper, a bit more analysis would be useful. A few thoughts:</p><p>a. In the construct that is expressing 190 from only 1 promoter (so decreased amounts), does the presence or absence of 180 have an effect on PtmG-FLAG levels?</p><p>b. Do the P1 and P2 versions of 190 change expression during growth in the same fashion that the combined versions do? How does 180 precursor level change with growth stage when 190 is not available? Is there an explanation for why the OE construct works best at exponential (190 levels seem unchanged)?</p><p>c. Is it feasible to ask if processed 180 act to relieve processed 190 repression in an rnc mutant? Could that be better done with the PtmG-GFP reporter?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors describe the biogenesis and the mechanism of action of a pair of cis-encoded sRNAs: CJnc190 and CJnc180. Both RNAs are being processed by RNase III. 5' and 3' ends mapping together with in vitro and in vivo experiments using purified RNase III and rnc deletion mutant demonstrated that the processing of CJnc190 sRNA depended on the formation of an intramolecular duplex, while CJnc180 sRNA processing required the presence of the antisense CJnc190 sRNA. The mature CJnc190 and CJnc180 sRNA specious are 69 and 88 nt long respectively. They also show that mature CJnc190 sRNA represses translation of ptmG via base-pairing and CJnc180 sRNA antagonizes CJnc190 repression acting as a sponge, scavenging CJnc190 sRNA. In addition, they find that two promoters are responsible for the synthesis of CJnc190 sRNA and both transcripts are subject to RNase III processing.</p><p>The study represents an enormous amount of work. The data are solid and generally support the overall conclusions. Having said that the manuscript is overwhelming, loaded with too many details which make the reading difficult and in the absence of a bigger picture many times uninspiring.</p><p>I suggest:</p><p>1) Adding a schematic model figure (including the hybrid formed, the sites of processing etc.).</p><p>2) Transfer some nonessential details from the results to the discussion. For example, the characterization of the two transcripts, description of the 5' and 3' mapping- those and other characterizations can be briefly mentioned in the discussion.</p><p>3) Expand on the correlation to physiology for the benefit of the bigger picture.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69064.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Strengthen the claims of Figure 6 (on 180 antagonizing 190) given that this is a major claim of the study.</p><p>2) Revise the manuscript to improve clarity and presentation (all three of the reviewers comment on this).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editors and three reviewers for their positive assessment of our study and their constructive feedback. We have addressed these comments and suggestions in our enclosed, revised manuscript. We think the changes have overall improved the accessibility of the manuscript and also strengthened our claims regarding the CJnc180 sRNA antagonist.</p><p>Experimental additions to the manuscript have focused on Point 1 of the Essential Revisions (CJnc180 sRNA antagonizing CJnc190), as well as differential regulation of the two CJnc190 promoters. Data for this can be found in new Figures 7B, Figure 7 —figure supplement 1C, and Figure 7 —figure supplement 2B-D, as well as some panels within the point-to-point reply below. These data suggest that the antagonistic effect of CJnc180 is stronger when CJnc190 levels are lower (expressed from only a single promoter), supporting that it is the stoichiometry of the two sRNAs that determines the outcome of CJnc180/190 effects on <italic>ptmG</italic> regulation. Our investigations did not identify any conditions so far that specifically regulate any of the CJnc180/190 promoters, which thus remains an open question. Finally, our new data suggests that antagonism might be (in part) RNase III-independent, but does not rule out several mechanisms of competition, including RNase III-mediated decay and transcriptional interference.</p><p>For Point 2 (improve clarity and presentation), we have put extensive thought into improving the accessibility of this dense and complex story. We have made minor aesthetic changes throughout for clarity, moved some less important details to Supplementary Figure legends, added several schematics, and have provided a model at the end as requested by the three reviewers (Figure 8). Figure 5 is also now separated into two figures (new Figure 5 and Figure 6) and have removed previous Supplementary Figure 7 (alignment of CJnc180/190 regions from different <italic>Campylobacter</italic>), which is now part of our more extensive comparative analysis of the sRNAs in <italic>Campylobacter spp.</italic> (in revision, submitted version available upon request).

For example, much of the text from original Lines 141-152 (now at Lines 166-168) was moved to the legend of Figure 1 —figure supplement 4. We also simply reduced or condensed details in other places (e.g., information from original Lines 252-262 (now at Lines 281-293)).

Moreover, we do not yet know if CJnc190 might also regulate CJnc180 and its targets (if they exist). We have therefore opted to categorize CJnc180/190 more broadly as “antisense RNAs” or “antagonists”, rather than as sponges. We also more generally refer to all such RNAs with the general term “antagonist”. Examples of these changes can be seen at Lines 36-37, 99, and 508-513.</p><p>We do mention the several different names such RNAs have been referred to in the Introduction (Lines 85-86). This nomenclature could be formalized as more examples of antagonizing sRNAs are identified in bacteria and diverse mechanisms of antagonism are described. We are more than open to hearing the reviewer’s suggestions for how to precisely describe such RNAs.</p><p>“An open question is whether the two sRNAs simply sequester each other, or play a role in each others’ turnover. RNAs (including sRNAs, mRNAs, or derivatives of other cellular RNAs) that target sRNAs have commonly been termed “sponge” RNAs or competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) (Denham 2020, PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32475775/">32475775</ext-link>; Grül and Massé 2019, PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30761752/">30761752</ext-link>). Since the impact of CJnc180 and CJnc190 on each other might be multifactorial and include sequestration from targets, transcriptional interference, or promotion of decay, we suggest currently terming them RNA “antagonists”, and suggest reserving the term “sponge” for those that purely sequester or compete with targets without promoting decay.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Much of the discussion details (lines 435-475) belong in the introduction to provide the reader with clear knowledge of what is already known in the field.

This experiment showed that while absence of CJnc180 did not have a significant effect on <italic>ptmG</italic> mRNA or protein levels when CJnc190 was expressed from both P1 and P2, there was a significant increase in mRNA levels (P1 or P2) and protein levels (P2) when CJnc180 expression was abolished when CJnc190 was expressed from only a single promoter. This speaks to the importance of the stoichiometry of the two sRNAs on the outcome of regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Do the P1 and P2 versions of 190 change expression during growth in the same fashion that the combined versions do?</p></disp-quote><p>CJnc190 appears to be highly stable (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1C) and expressed at all growth phases in wild-type (Figure 7C). In contrast, CJnc180 is relatively unstable (data not shown) and (especially the precursor) decreases as cells enter stationary phase. We have now measured levels of mature CJnc190 in our promoter mutant strains to determine if the sRNA is differentially expressed when expressed from promoter P1 or P2 only (new Figure 7 —figure supplement 3A). This did not reveal any striking differences between CJnc190 expression from either promoter, and both contributed to CJnc190 levels at all growth phases analyzed. This analysis was also performed without CJnc180, but also did not reveal any striking differences (new Figure 7 —figure supplement 3B). These new observations are summarized in the text at Lines 450-451.</p><p>To complement this analysis, we also determined if there are marked differences in CJnc180/190 promoter activity at different growth phases. We generated transcriptional GFP reporter fusions to all three CJnc180/190 promoters and measured their expression at three growth phases (new Figure 7 —figure supplement 3C, described at Lines 452-454). While the stability of GFP might obscure downregulation of the promoters (e.g., in stationary phase), we did not observe marked differences in promoter activity between early exponential, mid exponential, and stationary phase, or between CJnc190 P1 or P2. This analysis did show that the CJnc180 promoter is much less active than either CJnc190 promoter under the analyzed growth conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How does 180 precursor level change with growth stage when 190 is not available? Is there an explanation for why the OE construct works best at exponential (190 levels seem unchanged)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now also analyzed CJnc180 levels alone at three growth phases (early exponential, exponential, and stationary, new Figure 7 —figure supplement 2B). Levels of the precursor were much higher than in WT in the presence of CJnc190, and only decreased in stationary phase. This does point to co-processing of CJnc180 together with CJnc190 reducing its stability, although the half-life of the sRNA in WT and Δ<italic>rnc</italic> is comparable (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1C). Therefore, transcriptional interference could also come into play.</p><p>Based on all of our data together, the relative levels of the two sRNAs appear to be critical in determining the outcome of <italic>ptmG</italic> regulation. The copy number of CJnc190 is much higher than CJnc180 in log phase, and likely even higher in stationary phase. At later stages of growth, the levels of CJnc180 might be at a point where a two-fold increase does not affect CJnc190.</p><p>In addition, post-transcriptional regulation is highly dependent on overall cellular conditions (Gottesman 2004, PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15487940/">15487940</ext-link>).. Since both sRNAs are processed by RNase III, and are also likely under transcriptional control and possibly regulated degradation by RNases, any growth-phase dependent changes in levels, activity, or availability of these proteins could presumably affect <italic>ptmG</italic> regulation. Specific levels of the target <italic>ptmG</italic> mRNA (or other RNA targets/antagonists) under these conditions could also come into play. This is now mentioned in the text at Lines 546-548.</p><p>As we do not have a robust inducible promoter system for <italic>C. jejuni</italic> in hand, and conditions/regulators controlling the sRNAs are still unknown, we examined their interplay in an available “natural” setting where their levels change: different growth phases. Because growth phase has broad effects on cellular physiology and gene expression, we have not made strong conclusions based on the experiment described in Figure 7D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Is it feasible to ask if processed 180 act to relieve processed 190 repression in an rnc mutant?

Therefore, we performed the most immediately feasible experiment with the potential to provide insight into this question. In a strain expressing only stable “pre-processed” CJnc190 (5’-end truncation, C-190(Proc)) from unrelated <italic>rdxA</italic>, we added CJnc180 to a second heterologous locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). This was performed in <italic>trans</italic> to specifically assess the post-transcriptional effect of CJnc180 on CJnc190. We then compared native <italic>ptmG</italic> mRNA levels (the number of available cassettes limited use of an epitope tag) in an RNase III+ or <italic>rnc</italic> deletion background for the strains, and -/+ CJnc180 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Antagonism of CJnc190 by CJnc180 in the presence and absence of RNase III.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CJnc190(Proc) was inserted at the Cj0046 pseudogene locus under control of its native P1 promoter.

However, since the “pre-processed” CJnc190 version is more abundant than CJnc190 in WT and over-represses <italic>ptmG</italic> (Figure 1E and Figure 1 —figure supplement 4A), this might obscure antagonism via sponging by CJnc180. Under native conditions, or if an inducible promoter for CJnc180 would be available, a stronger effect might be observed. Deletion of <italic>rnc</italic> in <italic>C. jejuni</italic> also markedly affects growth. We therefore have chosen to include this experiment only here, rather than as an additional supplementary figure. Future experiments will tease apart the contributions of co-processing and “catalytic” sponging to the antagonistic effect of CJnc180 on <italic>ptmG</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors describe the biogenesis and the mechanism of action of a pair of cis-encoded sRNAs: CJnc190 and CJnc180. Both RNAs are being processed by RNase III. 5' and 3' ends mapping together with in vitro and in vivo experiments using purified RNase III and rnc deletion mutant demonstrated that the processing of CJnc190 sRNA depended on the formation of an intramolecular duplex, while CJnc180 sRNA processing required the presence of the antisense CJnc190 sRNA. The mature CJnc190 and CJnc180 sRNA specious are 69 and 88 nt long respectively. They also show that mature CJnc190 sRNA represses translation of ptmG via base-pairing and CJnc180 sRNA antagonizes CJnc190 repression acting as a sponge, scavenging CJnc190 sRNA. In addition, they find that two promoters are responsible for the synthesis of CJnc190 sRNA and both transcripts are subject to RNase III processing.</p><p>The study represents an enormous amount of work. The data are solid and generally support the overall conclusions. Having said that the manuscript is overwhelming, loaded with too many details which make the reading difficult and in the absence of a bigger picture many times uninspiring.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for the overall positive feedback. We agree that this is a very complex story. As detailed in the responses to reviewers 1 and 3, we have made several revisions to the text and Figures and have moved details to the Supplementary Information.

We also simplified Figure 1A as a starting point, and we also have tried to include more small schematics throughout to aid the reader (<italic>e.g</italic>., top of Figures 4A and 4B). The hybrid formed between the two sRNAs is still part of Figure 6A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Transfer some nonessential details from the results to the discussion.

This did not reveal a strong candidate for direct transcriptional regulation of either sRNA. However, deletion of the gene encoding the RacR two-component response regulator consistently reduced CJnc190 levels by 50% in log phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>). RacR has been proposed to repress genes involved in fumarate utilization under low oxygen conditions when electron acceptors such as nitrate are present (Apel et al., 2012, PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22343300/">22343300</ext-link>; van der Stel et al., 2015, PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24707969/">24707969</ext-link>). However, CJnc180 and CJnc190 P2 promoters were only very mildly, if at all, affected by <italic>racR</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B</xref>). In addition, an obvious RacR binding motif (van der Stel et al., 2015, PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24707969/">24707969</ext-link>) does not appear to be present upstream of any of the CJnc180/190 promoters. Therefore, how <italic>racR</italic> deletion affects CJnc190, potentially post-transcriptionally and indirect, remains to be identified. We thus choose to not include these data into the current manuscript and only show it here for the reviewers information.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Deletion of the gene encoding the RacR two-component response regulator results in lower CJnc190 levels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Total RNA from sRNA WT or the indicated mutant strains growing in exponential phase was analyzed by northern blotting for sRNA expression.
