Long-term increased hospitalisation risk outweighs short-lived immunity in seronegatives. Independently of serostatus, transient immunity increases with age, and is highest against serotype 4.

An estimated 105 million infections and approximately 50 million symptomatic cases occur each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Stanaway et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cattarino et al., 2020</xref>). Dengue disease is caused by four distinct viruses, termed serotypes (DENV- 1–4). Infection confers lifelong immunity to a homologous serotype, but against a heterologous serotype protective immunity is only temporary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">St John and Rathore, 2019</xref>). Furthermore, secondary infection with a heterologous serotype drastically increases the likelihood of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">St John and Rathore, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Traditional vector control interventions have had little impact on dengue disease burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guzman et al., 2010</xref>) and no antiviral treatments yet exist. Several vaccine candidates are in development, but the only licensed vaccine is Sanofi-Pasteur’s CYD-TDV (marketed as <italic>Dengvaxia</italic>). CYD-TDV is a live attenuated tetravalent chimeric vaccine, where genes for the structural proteins (E and prM) are taken from the four DENV serotypes, while the other proteins are based on the yellow fever 17D vaccine strain. The vaccine has now been licensed in 21 countries and the EU. A phase two trial in 2012 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> number NCT00842530) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sabchareon et al., 2012</xref>) reported moderate efficacy of 30.2% (−13.4% to 56.6%) and showed the vaccine to be well tolerated and largely safe. Two large scale phase three trials followed: the CYD14 trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> number NCT01373281) in South East Asia of 10,275 children aged 2–14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Capeding et al., 2014</xref>), and the CYD15 trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> number NCT01374516) in Latin America of 20,869 children aged 9–16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Villar et al., 2015</xref>). After stratifying by age, participants were randomly assigned to vaccine or control arms in a 2:1 ratio, and vaccine doses were given at baseline then 6 and 12 months later. For a subset of participants (approximately 20% for CYD14% and 10% for CYD15), immunogenicity and prior dengue exposure was determined using baseline sera. Participants were actively surveilled by weekly phone calls for 25 months post-first dose (where any symptomatic disease was detected), after which surveillance was passive using routine hospital surveillance, (where only hospitalisations were detected). See (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Capeding et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Villar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hadinegoro et al., 2015</xref>) for further details of the trial design.</p><p>The CYD14 and CYD15 trials showed overall vaccine efficacies of 56.5% (43.8%–66.4%) and 60.8% (52.0%–68.0%) respectively, with efficacy varying significantly by serotype and prior exposure. However, in 2015, results from the first year of long-term follow up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hadinegoro et al., 2015</xref>) showed that while the vaccine remained beneficial overall, the number of hospitalisations among 2–5 year olds was significantly greater in vaccinees than in controls. A potential explanation for these results considered age as a proxy for serostatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguiar and Stollenwerk, 2018</xref>), and that the vaccine may act as a ‘silent’ disease-free infection that primes host immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferguson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flasche et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, a seronegative child, who would ordinarily experience their first and relatively low-risk natural infection, would after vaccination instead experience a ‘secondary-like’ infection that is more predisposed to clinically apparent disease. Conversely, a child with a single prior natural infection would have a lower risk of disease when exposed to dengue post-vaccination, normally associated with tertiary and quaternary infection [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Model Schematic 1: vaccine as silent infection.</title><p>Top row: unvaccinated individuals are naive, or infected with either: their first dengue infection with moderate disease risk; their second higher risk infection; or their third or fourth lower risk infection. Middle row: vaccinating seropositive individuals with a single prior infection lowers the disease risk associated with secondary infection to that associated with tertiary and quaternary infection. Bottom row: vaccinating naive (seronegative) individuals increases disease risk upon their first natural infection.

Further, it was not possible to retroactively expand the immunogenicity subset to determine prior dengue exposure, as <italic>Dengvaxia</italic> can elicit antibody responses that would test positive under a plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT). Therefore, and because the vaccine showed the greatest benefit in children aged nine or older, the vaccine was licensed for use above this age, independent of baseline serostatus.</p><p>An ELISA assay detecting anti-dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1) IgG antibodies then provided a novel approach to retrospectively assess the serostatus of trial participants prior to vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nascimento et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Dengvaxia</italic> expresses yellow fever NS1, not dengue NS1, and therefore this assay can distinguish between natural infection and exposure to the vaccine. Blood samples of trial participants who contracted virologically confirmed dengue during follow-up were analysed using the NS1 assay in the CYD14 and CYD15 trials. The results provided clear evidence of the enhanced risk of hospitalised or severe dengue disease in baseline seronegative vaccinees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sridhar et al., 2018</xref>) and these were in line with refined estimates of vaccine efficacy obtained with machine learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dorigatti et al., 2018</xref>). Subsequently, in November 2017, <italic>Dengvaxia</italic> was recommended only in persons with a confirmed prior dengue infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">WHO, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here we present a survival model with time and age varying hazards, which we fit to the individual level phase three CYD14 and CYD15 data, up to and including the first year of long-term follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hadinegoro et al., 2015</xref>). We characterize the efficacy profile and mode of action of the vaccine, which we find to be consistent with the ‘vaccine as silent infection’ hypothesis. We refine previous estimates, and examine the vaccine’s duration of protection and its efficacy against both febrile dengue disease and hospitalized disease. Our results provide a comprehensive characterization of CYD-TDV’s safety and efficacy, and demonstrate the need for long-term follow up in the phase three trials of other dengue vaccine candidates currently in development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Data</title><p>We use the individual-level trial data from the CYD14 and CYD15 trials, in both the active phase (25 months post first dose) and the 1<sup>st</sup> year of passive phase hospital follow-up. In the active phase, all symptomatic dengue disease is detected, but in the passive phase only hospitalisations were detected. All cases refer to virologically confirmed dengue. Infecting serotype is known for almost all cases (97.6% for CYD14, 95.8% for CYD15, 96.7% overall). Baseline serostatus is known for only a minority of subjects (19.3% for CYD14, 9.6% for CYD15, 12.7% overall). Model variants (including our main model) that consider serotype-specific effects omit all cases of unknown serotype. We right-censor after date of first case for each patient, and so do not consider multiple cases per patient.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Model</title><p>We divide trial participants by trial arm <italic>a</italic> and baseline serostatus <italic>b</italic> (0 = seronegative or 1 = seropositive at baseline), as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>. Disease risk is allowed to vary by the number of prior dengue exposures and by disease type (where disease type refers either to trial phase (active = 0; passive = 1) or disease severity (non-severe/non-hospitalised = 0, severe/hospitalised = 1)).

The probability of case detection depends on the degree of trial surveillance, and so by default we allow relative risks to differ between the active and passive trial phases. For example, <italic>K<sub>i = 2, D = 0</sub></italic> is the risk of clinically apparent disease (of any severity) in the active phase for those with two or more prior infection. Alternatively, when distinguishing between severe and non-severe disease (or equivalently between hospitalised and non-hospitalised disease), risk of disease does not differ between trial phases but between disease severities, for example, the risk of severe disease in seronegatives would be <italic>K<sub>i = 0, D = 1</sub></italic>. In practice, these two interpretations of the relative risk parameters are largely equivalent as non-hospitalised disease is detected exclusively by active surveillance and passive surveillance only detects hospitalised or severe disease. It does however change the calculation of survival probabilities. We allow relative risks of hospitalised disease to differ between CYD14 and CYD15 trials to account for the non-standardised hospitalisation criteria between Southeast Asia and Latin America. We do not do so when modelling severe disease since the trials used the WHO dengue severity criteria to ascribe disease severity in all trial sites.

We employ data augmentation, in which the baseline serostatus of each participant outside the immunogenicity subset is treated as a parameter, to infer the immunological status of each participant with missing baseline serostatus. This has the advantage that fitted parameters are less dependent on initial assignment of baseline serostatus and can be considered as marginal distributions over possible values of baseline immunity.

Parameters fitted include the relative risks, vaccine-induced transient immunities (by baseline serostatus, serotype and age) and their durations. For each country-specific baseline hazard, the logged knots of the spline are the fitted parameters, which explicitly determine all values of the baseline hazard. Prior distributions for parameters and augmented data were uniform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and proposal distributions were normal. Each model variant was run for 1,100,000 iterations with a burn-in period of 100,000, storing 1 in every 100 iterations as posterior samples. Convergence was assessed visually. The model was coded in C++ using OpenMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dagum and Menon, 1998</xref>), and results were analysed in R 3.6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">R Development Core Team, 2019</xref>).

Both trials show a clear benefit of vaccine across each age group for the active phase (25 months post-first dose), where surveillance could detect both hospitalised and non-hospitalised disease. In the passive phase (next 11 months following active phase), there are considerably fewer cases, owing to its shorter duration and detection of only hospitalised cases.

The decrease in hazard ratios over time in each age group reflects the greater benefit to seropositives against hospitalised/severe disease as only this disease outcome is measured in the passive phase.</p><p>For seronegative vaccinees, hazard ratios are neither significantly positive nor negative during the first year. Ratios rise dramatically afterwards, reflecting low and short-lived immunity, combined with an almost sixfold long-term increase in disease risk, in both trials and in all age groups. Because the passive phase trial surveillance detected only hospitalised disease, this increase in hazard ratios refers to an increase in risk of hospitalisation, consistent with the 2017 NS1 data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sridhar et al., 2018</xref>), to which our model was not fitted.</p><p>When unstratified by baseline serostatus, the vaccine is broadly beneficial, although hazard ratios rise over time, and are above 1 for 2–5 year olds in the first year of passive follow up. Decreasing hazard ratios with age reflect increasing seropositivity with age, and to a lesser extent the increase with age in transient immunity that we infer for seropositives. Low seroprevalence in 2–5 year olds is the driving factor of their increased risk, and this is consistent with the risk enhancement observed in the first year of long-term follow-up data. Hazard ratios are similar between trials for comparable age groups.</p><p>The estimated trends with age, serostatus and time hold when broken down by serotype <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">(Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), although net vaccine efficacy varies by serotype. Vaccination respectively offers the least and greatest benefit to serotypes 2 and 4. Hazard ratios are higher for serotype 2, although the vaccine remains beneficial in seropositives. For serotypes 3 and 4, hazard ratios are lower, and vaccination provides some initial protection even in seronegatives, although again these ratios rise over time. Risk enhancement of 2–5-year-old vaccinees is much higher for serotypes 1 and 2 than for 3 and 4.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> shows parameter estimates for our main model.

That is, among unvaccinated individuals, primary infection is 70% as likely, and tertiary/quaternary infection is 31% as likely, to cause symptomatic disease as secondary infection. However, considering vaccination as a silent infection, seronegative vaccinees increase their long-term risk of symptomatic disease by a factor of <italic>K<sub>1,0</sub></italic>/<italic>K<sub>0,0</sub></italic> = 1.5 (1.0–2.7), whereas vaccinees with a single prior infection multiply their long-term disease risk by a factor of <italic>K<sub>2,0</sub></italic>/<italic>K<sub>1,0</sub></italic> = 0.31 (0.14–0.63), transient immunity notwithstanding.</p><p>We estimate the proportions of symptomatic primary, secondary and tertiary/quaternary infections that require hospitalisation (i.e. parameters <italic>K<sub>0,1</sub></italic>, <italic>K<sub>1,1</sub></italic> and <italic>K<sub>2,1</sub></italic>) to be 0.053 (0.034–0.078), 0.21 (0.14–0.31) and 0.053 (0.034–0.078), respectively.

Instead we estimate positive values for transient immunity for each age group and serotype. Further, model fits that fix seropositive transient immunity at zero do not reproduce the trial data. Therefore, for seropositives, to the extent that transient immunity is long-lived, vaccination confers benefit beyond that of priming immunity and consequent reduction of disease risk to that associated with natural tertiary and quaternary infection. Hence individuals with pre-existing multitypic immunity are also predicted to benefit from vaccination, with the caveat that we were not able to test a model in which transient immunity only applied to those with monotypic immunity. Conversely, in seronegatives, any positive benefit that mitigates long-term increase in disease risk is short-lived.</p><p>We find that the age group-specific multiplier of the baseline hazard increases with age for 6–11 year olds (1.2, 0.91–1.5), but then decreases for the 12–16 age group (1.1, 0.79–1.5) to be no different from the 2–5-year-old age group in the mean posterior estimates. While both credible intervals encompass 1 (indicating no difference), model runs that omit this age-specific hazard multiplier give a noticeably inferior visual fit (Appendix 1). Regardless of vaccination, we find that seropositives are 0.77 (0.43–0.99) times as likely to be infected as seronegatives due to their immunity to at least one serotype.</p><p>Estimates of the serotype proportions by country are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, showing substantial heterogeneity between countries in their serotype distributions (e.g. Puerto Rico and Brazil’s cases are almost exclusively comprised of serotypes 1 and 4, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Model fits</title><p>Observed Kaplan–Meier curves demonstrate a clear overall benefit of vaccination.

However, here it is easier to distinguish between the vaccine’s temporal effects and its differing efficacy against hospitalised or severe disease. For seropositives, temporal effects are minimal, and vaccination confers high and long-lasting protection against disease, and more so against hospitalised disease. In seronegatives, against non-hospitalised disease, hazard ratios again show only minor (and sometimes non-significant) initial protection, but they do not rise to the same dramatic extent. However, against hospitalised disease there is immediate risk enhancement that substantially worsens over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In summary, the differences between seronegative and seropositive efficacy are greater against hospitalised disease than against febrile disease.</p><p>These trends hold when broken down by serotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>). Protection is greatest against serotype 4 and lowest against serotype 2. The rate at which vaccination enhances hospitalisation risk in seronegatives varies by serotype: against serotype 2, vaccination increases hospitalisation risk immediately after vaccination and only rises slowly during the following three years (to approximately sixfold); whereas for serotypes 3 and 4 the eventual risk enhancement is lower (approximately fourfold) but follows a delay <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">(Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Hazard ratios are almost identical when considering severe and non-severe disease.</p><p>Age-, serotype- and serostatus-specific transient immunity estimates are similar to our default interpretation when considering hospitalised or severe disease (not shown). We allow the proportions of symptomatic disease requiring hospitalisation to differ between trials to reflect non-standardised criteria between countries. Among secondary infection, proportions differ slightly between the CYD14 and CYD15 trials at 0.30 (0.23–0.33) and 0.16 (0.12–0.21), respectively (values for primary and tertiary/quaternary infection are determined by fixed ratios). Relative risks of severe disease are considerably lower than hospitalised disease at 0.012 (0.0087–0.016), 0.047 (0.035–0.063) and 0.012 (0.0087–0.016) for primary, secondary and tertiary/quaternary infection.</p><p>When distinguishing between severe and non-severe disease, we reproduce observed survival curves at trial level for non-severe disease, but fits are less good for severe disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is due firstly to limited data (non-severe cases outnumber severe cases by 1223 to 58), and secondly because we do not allow transient immunity to vary by disease severity. When we instead consider hospitalisation <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">(Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), fits to survival curves are good regardless of hospitalisation status. In both scenarios, model fits to ‘either’ disease severity (e.g. surviving both severe and non-severe disease) closely resemble those of our default interpretation, where disease severity is not considered. Attack rates in each disease category are relatively well fitted, although passive phase attack rates are less well fitted for severe or hospitalised disease (non-hospitalised febrile disease is not detected by passive surveillance) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Alternative model variants</title><p>We conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine whether more parsimonious models are sufficient to explain the complex trial data (Appendix 1).

Vaccine-induced protection against each serotype was higher in seropositive recipients than in seronegatives, and these findings were robust across model variants. The incorporation of serotype-specific transient immunity improved model fits to country breakdowns, but had little effect on fits to age breakdowns. Interestingly, transient immunity was found to increase with age in seropositives and to a lesser extent in seronegatives. While one mechanism of our model (change in relative risk through ‘silent infection’) separates seropositivity into monotypic and multitypic immunity, the other (conferral of transient immunity) does not, and so it is possible that the age trend in seropositives also reflects increasing transient immunity for multitypic immunes, although the slight age trend in seronegatives could not be explained this way. In general, heterogeneity between countries' Kaplan–Meier curves can be explained by serotype and seroprevalence, although these factors are insufficient to explain differences in vaccine efficacy by age, for which age-specific effects (independent of serostatus) are required.</p><p>In every model variant examined, vaccination substantially decreased disease risk in seropositives, but increased risk in seronegatives (particularly risk of hospitalised/severe disease). These findings are consistent with and largely predict the NS1 data and long-term follow-up data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sridhar et al., 2018</xref>). We further found larger differences in efficacy between seropositives and seronegatives when considering hospitalised disease: benefit to seropositives and risk enhancement in seronegatives is greater than against febrile disease. Our findings here may be affected by the data used: the passive surveillance in the first year of hospital follow-up does not detect non-hospitalised disease.</p><p>While our analysis demonstrates that serostatus is the dominant factor in efficacy, the data do not allow us to consider the order of infecting serotype, which recent work suggests affects disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguas et al., 2019</xref>) and therefore perhaps efficacy also. While we have analysed the vaccine’s effect against different serotypes and different severities of disease, we have not analysed efficacy against infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Olivera-Botello et al., 2016</xref>). It would be helpful to examine the degree to which efficacy is dependent upon antibody titres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Salje et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Katzelnick et al., 2017</xref>) as opposed to a binary serostatus. The latter may determine whether vaccine immune priming is age dependent.</p><p>Our model does not disaggregate seropositives into monotypic or multitypic immunity, and we were unable to test models whereby transient immunity applies only to multitypic seropositives. The use of antibody titres could be informative, although we are ultimately limited by the small size of the immunogenicity subset. Additionally, we do not model either serotype-specific natural immunity or transient immunity that arises from natural infection.</p><p>Our model estimates an enhancement of risk for seronegative vaccinees for every serotype (although more so for serotypes 1 and 2 than for serotypes 3 and 4), whereas previous work indicated the vaccine’s better performance against serotype 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sridhar et al., 2018</xref>). This is likely due to the fact that we do not consider serotype-specific relative risks (and therefore serotype-specific changes in relative risk induced by ‘silent infection’ vaccination). While we attempted previously to resolve this issue, there is insufficient power to resolve these parameters, particularly for the passive phase or hospitalised disease. Further, serotype-specific transient immunity durations would likely have diminished or altogether removed the predicted risk enhancement for serotype 4. Again though, there is insufficient power to resolve such serotype effects, particularly seeing as transient immunity durations by serostatus were not precisely inferred.</p><p>Current WHO guidance recommends serological testing of potential vaccine recipients before vaccination and only vaccinating seropositives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dengue vaccine, 2019</xref>). Age targeting of vaccination is therefore important: too young an age, and most of those tested will be seronegative, too old and most will have already experienced secondary dengue infection.</p><p>Distinguishing between monotypic and multitypic infection is not usually possible in clinical practice. However, our results suggest that all seropositives are likely to benefit from vaccination, and further that vaccinating them will be more beneficial than merely boosting their immunity to that of someone with two previous natural infections. Importantly, this means it may be more beneficial to vaccinate multitypic seropositives than other models have predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flasche et al., 2016</xref>), at least to the extent that seropositive transient immunity is long-lived and acts in both monotypic and multitypic seropositive vaccine recipients.</p><p>High-resolution maps of dengue seropositivity are now available, and alongside improved rapid diagnostic tests and ‘screen-then-vaccinate’ programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flasche and Smith, 2019</xref>), optimal deployment of the vaccine could reduce the increasing worldwide burden of dengue disease by as much as 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cattarino et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, targeting only seropositive recipients with this vaccine is an increasingly viable public health strategy.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>DJL, GNG, and NMF acknowledge grant funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (grant WPIA_P46908).

age is only considered alongside historical transmission intensity to determine the contributions of monotypic and multitypic infection to seropositive relative risks.</p><p>This reduced model fits observed Kaplan–Meier curves well at trial level, although age group breakdowns are more variable: vaccine efficacy is respectively overestimated and underestimated the 2–5 and 12–14 CYD-14 age groups <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">(Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This is likely due to an uneven age distribution in CYD-14: age groups 2–5 and 12–14 constitute 24.2% and 22.7% of CYD-14 (or 7.9% and 7.5% of combined CYD-14 and CYD-15 data), whereas 6–11 years olds comprise 53.2% of the CYD14 data (17.5% of combined data). CYD-15 age breakdowns are better <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">(Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), attributable to its larger size and narrower age range, although efficacy is still slightly underestimated in the highest age group.</p><p>Fits to individual countries are more variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Lower-quality fits in country and age group subsets are usually attributable to thinner data and specifically lower case numbers; however, this explanation is insufficient for Brazil, which has high case numbers, indicating country-specific effects that are not captured by reduced model. The estimates of serotype proportions <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">(Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) are instructive: Brazil and Mexico have vastly different serotype proportions (specifically serotypes with the highest and lowest vaccine-induced immunities, respectively), and therefore fits to these countries improve with the inclusion of serotype effects. In contrast, Indonesia, Thailand and Colombia have more equal serotype proportions, and thus their fits are not greatly improved. These results indicate that the effects of vaccination vary by age, independently of serostatus, and therefore that a more complex model is necessary to explain the trial data.</p><p>Relative risk parameters are lower but consistent with our main model, and initial seronegative transient immunity is 0.64 (0.34–0.74), whereas seropositive transient immunity is estimated to be 0.43 (0.041–0.73). Seronegative and seropositive durations are estimated at 4.9 (1.2–9.6) and 10 (1.4–20) years, respectively (and have similar posteriors to our main model), again indicating long-lasting benefit to seropositives beyond the effect of immune priming <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">(Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title>Model with age effects only</title><p>Adding age-specific transient immunity and force of infection <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">(Figure 2B</xref>) to the simplest model, we have the hazard</p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf36"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow/></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p><p>Fits in the CYD-14 2–5 and 12–14-year-old age groups are improved; however, fits to individual countries are largely the same as the simplest model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">(Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).

The paper includes relevant hypothesis and model schemes as well as figures that show differences between seropositive and seronegative vaccine recipients across a range of covariates. The authors demonstrate, in a clearer way than has been shown before, that CYD-TDV increases disease across all ages in both trials in seronegatives. The authors also show that the enhancing effect is stronger against hospitalized disease than febrile disease. Many of these results have already been presented previously in other papers analyzing the same data, but the modeling approach does provide a new perspective that adds to the story of the CYD-TDV vaccine.</p><p>Overall, the paper is clearly written and easy to follow, especially given the complexity of the model and subject matter. However, numerous claims are made in the abstract and the discussion that inaccurately reflect the results presented in this paper. In particular, major conclusions of the paper relate to the benefit of the vaccine for seropositive individuals (lines 18-19, 327-328) and an increasing effect of vaccination for seropositive individuals with age (lines 286-290, 329-330). There are potential issues with the modeling approach and how it relates to these conclusions. Further, a discussion about the long-term effects of the vaccine for seronegatives is speculative and problematic (311-320).</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1) Lines 18-19. &quot;Vaccinating seropositives gives greater long-lasting immunity than two natural infections.&quot; The claim that fixed-time immunity induced by vaccination of seropositives is maintained at a high level over time is not well supported. The authors assume in their models that immunity wanes in seronegatives (over 1 year) and is stable in seropositives (maintained over time). First, it is unclear why these assumptions were made. The reference for these model choices does not seem to cover immune kinetics over this period of time (Clapham et al. 2016 PLOS Comp Bio). Second, the authors actually tested different assumptions about waning immunity in supplement (lines 667 – 694), which are not described in the main text. In the supplement, the authors demonstrate waning immunity out to 4.5 years (with wide confidence intervals) in both seronegative and seropositive vaccinated individuals. In both cases, the duration of waning is outside of the observational period of the study, and the authors write: &quot;We conclude that three years of follow up data from each patient is insufficient to infer durations.&quot; Thus, the authors should adjust the statement &quot;vaccinating seropositives gives greater long-lasting immunity than two natural infections&quot; to reflect the fact that immunity in seropositives may also wane over time in a way that cannot be accurately measured with the current data.</p><p>2) Lines 329-330. &quot;Therefore it may be more beneficial to vaccinate multitypic seropositives than simpler models have predicted [11].&quot; How do the authors know it is the multitypics that benefit as opposed to those with primary immunity before vaccination? It would be helpful if the authors could further support this statement by discussing the results that relate to this point. This is especially important in relation to the discussion about dengue rapid diagnostic tests (e.g. lines 23-24), which have very low sensitivity for detecting monotypic DENV immunes.</p><p>3) Lines 286 -290. &quot;Interestingly, fixed-time immunity was found to increase with age in seropositives. In general, heterogeneity between countries' Kaplan-Meier curves can be explained by serotype and seroprevalence, although these factors are insufficient to explain differences in vaccine efficacy by age, for which age-specific effects (independent of serostatus) are required.&quot; The conclusion about the benefit of the vaccine even to multitypic immunes seems to be derived from the observation that fixed-effect immunity induced by the vaccine in seropositive individuals increases with age. The authors observe large age-specific fixed-time immunity differences by serostatus (Figure 5), although it is not clear there is much difference across age groups in vaccine efficacy (Figure 4). While the authors state that age specific effects are independent of serostatus, the age effects only occur in seropositives and thus are most plausibly related to more prior infections in children of older ages. It would be helpful if the authors further discussed age-effects and their relationship being multitypic immune.</p><p>4) Lines 311 – 315. &quot;In high transmission settings where children would ordinarily receive at least two natural infections, we predict that even seronegatives would eventually benefit from vaccination, as they would experience one high risk infection, and all subsequent infections would have a much lower risk, in contrast to unvaccinated individuals who would ordinarily experience one moderate and one high risk infection [Figure 1].&quot; The results of this manuscript do not support this claim. While the authors may expect this to be true based on the model scheme (referenced as Figure 1), the results, as currently described, do not prove this point. Further, the caveats provided afterward do not justify inclusion of this paragraph in the discussion (Lines 316-320): &quot;Important caveats include first that disease risk would increase in the short term. Second, and more seriously, a small subset of symptomatic infections are fatal, in which case vaccination could shorten life in seronegatives. Finally, while the eventual benefit to seronegatives is predicted by our model and the model fits well, this remains a prediction yet to be validated by empirical data.&quot;). This paragraph should be removed or significantly reworked because it is largely a question of medical ethics.</p><p>5) Figure 4. It is not clear why vaccine efficacy increases over time in the trial for vaccinated seropositives, even across all age groups. It does not seem to be explained by age effects, waning immunity, or serotype distributions. Is it related to differences in disease outcomes measured in the trial over time (e.g. Figure S8)?</p><p>6) It is surprising that the serotype effects are more similar than might be expected based on previous articles on these data, especially previous observations of greater efficacy against DENV4. Here the authors observe strong enhancement of DENV4 at later timepoints in the trial. Could the authors comment on whether this might relate to the way serotype effects are modeled, or whether this constitutes a major difference from what has been shown previously?</p><p>7) Table 1 and its explanation in the text are confusing. Instead of a traditional presentation of relative risk, which is described in the text, the table presents the probability of disease expected relative to secondary infections. One option would be to present relative risk estimates in table, and clearly indicate the reference groups in the table. Additionally, while KiD is clearly defined in the methods, it would be helpful to add one sentence to the main text to define KiD, given that the main text uses this notation in multiple paragraphs without explaining its interpretation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper uses individual trial participant data from two large phase 3 dengue vaccine randomised clinical trials to fit a Bayesian survival model of symptomatic dengue illness that is dependent on case-control status (vaccine vs placebo), baseline serostatus, age, and dengue serotype. The main finding is a detailed characterisation of how the relative risk of symptomatic illness changes as a function of time since vaccination and baseline serostatus. As previously reported, children who are seronegative at baseline have a drastically increased risk of symptomatic illness in years 2 and 3 of follow-up. Although this finding is not novel per se, having a precise characterisation of the time-varying risk is important for determining vaccine utility and optimal implementation strategies.</p><p>The survival model is fairly complex but this complexity reflects the complexity of the trial data and the inference problem at hand (multiple countries with different proportions of dengue serotypes, active and passive follow-up periods, age-varying effects). I particularly like the use of Gibbs sampling to treat the missing baseline serostatus as a latent variable in the model. This is an elegant method that allows for the analysis of the whole dataset and not restricted to just those with serostatus data (only 10% of participants).</p><p>My main comments are about clarity of the manuscript and reproducibility:</p><p>1. The Results section needs to explain the big K notation which is fairly complicated (but I can't see any easy way of simplifying it!)</p><p>2. The Methods section really needs a section on the data (this could be quite short). Otherwise it's hard to know exactly what sort of data are being used (eg right censoring after first illness is mentioned in the model bit)</p><p>3. The Methods section really needs a parameter table. Table 1 gives a summary of model outputs which is useful, but these are not parameters. What I would find useful is a table with all the main model parameters using the same notation as in the text (eg K<sub>0,0</sub>) and the associated prior distributions. This would emphasize that the model has a lot of parameters. This would also be useful to emphasize which parameters were fixed in the model (eg M<sub>b</sub>, sigma?).</p><p>4. It says all priors are uniform but this seems a bit odd. Maybe I am misunderstanding something, but the relative risk parameters can take values in (0, infinity) surely? A uniform prior is therefore improper. This is probably not the best choice (uniform priors are often not a good choice).</p><p>5. &quot;Model code is available from the authors&quot; and &quot;The model was coded in C++&quot; doesn't really meet <italic>eLife</italic> standards for reproducibility or inspire huge confidence. The paper is entirely based on the validity of the model fitting and this is a complex model that has been hand coded. I fully trust the competence of the authors, but I really think the code should be made available online (via a git repo for example) with a minimum working example for the fitting. If the authors can't make the full dataset openly accessible then a simulated dataset to test the model would be a good alternative.</p><p>6. Could you explain a bit more why the parameter M<sub>b</sub> is fixed at 0.7? It says: &quot;equal to 1 for seronegatives and 0.7 for seropositives, chosen to reflect seropositive participants' reduced disease risk due to their immunity to at least one serotype&quot;. I couldn't square this with fact that seropositives also can have increase risk as the secondary infection is more likely to be severe than the first? I get that you don't know how many infections a seropositive individual has had, but I can't really understand the justification for the 0.7.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65131.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>These revisions either reflect a need to temper some of the claims made in the paper or to improve clarity of the work.</p><p>1) The authors assume in their models that immunity wanes in seronegatives (over 1 year) and is stable in seropositives (maintained over time).

Under our model, vaccination has two mechanisms: (i) altering disease risk associated with natural infection (denoted by <italic>K<sub>i,D</sub></italic> values) and (ii) conferring transient immunity (denoted by the <italic>I<sub>bd</sub></italic> values). For multitypic seropositives, the first mechanism has no effect (as we consider the risk of disease from tertiary or quaternary infection to be equal, i.e. <italic>K<sub>2,D</sub> = K<sub>3,D</sub></italic> for either disease type <italic>D</italic>). However, the second mechanism is still predicted to have an effect, and furthermore our results indicate that seropositive transient immunity is long-lived (85% of posterior samples are above 5 years).</p><p>Additionally, the model could reject either of these mechanisms depending on the fitted parameter values. For example, seropositive transient immunity (<italic>I<sub>1d</sub>)</italic> values of zero (or alternatively a very short duration) would indicate that only monotypic seropositive vaccinees would benefit, whereas we find positive values for every serotype. Further, we previously ran a sensitivity check where seropositive transient immunity was fixed at zero to see if the data could be explained more parsimoniously, but it could not. However, we were not able to test a model where transient immunity applied only to monotypically immune patients. We have now discussed these points in the results (lines 435-447).</p><p>Nevertheless, our results indicate that monotypics will benefit more than multitypics, and benefit to multitypics is dependent on seropositive immunity being long-lived, and we have now included this caveat throughout the text in the abstract (lines 18-19), results (lines 414-417 and 427-447) and discussion (lines 614-621).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would be helpful if the authors further discussed age-effects and their relationship with being multitypic immune.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Reviewer 1’s point (3) below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please address reviewer 1's concern that the results of this manuscript do not support the claim on lines 311 – 315.

While in theory these could be unbounded (and therefore improper), in practice this is not a concern (for instance they could be reasonably limited to be less than 100).

The statement &quot;Model code is available from the authors&quot; does not meet eLife requirements: &quot;Regardless of whether authors use original data or are reusing data available from public repositories, they must provide program code, scripts for statistical packages, and other documentation sufficient to allow an informed researcher to precisely reproduce all published results.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>All model code is now available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/dlaydon/DengVaxSurvival">https://github.com/dlaydon/DengVaxSurvival</ext-link>, together with simulated data that the model can be fitted to. Simulated data was sampled using the parameter posteriors, and preserves comparable case numbers across trial arms, trial phases, age groups, countries, serotypes, disease severities and serostatus. We have also provided example parameter files and pre-compiled binary executables to make running and fitting the model easier.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Laydon et al. have conducted an elegant analysis that provides a clear and comprehensive guide to the mechanism of difference of CYD-TDV for dengue virus seropositive vs. seronegative vaccine recipients. The paper includes relevant hypothesis and model schemes as well as figures that show differences between seropositive and seronegative vaccine recipients across a range of covariates. The authors demonstrate, in a clearer way than has been shown before, that CYD-TDV increases disease across all ages in both trials in seronegatives. The authors also show that the enhancing effect is stronger against hospitalized disease than febrile disease. Many of these results have already been presented previously in other papers analyzing the same data, but the modeling approach does provide a new perspective that adds to the story of the CYD-TDV vaccine.</p><p>Overall, the paper is clearly written and easy to follow, especially given the complexity of the model and subject matter. However, numerous claims are made in the abstract and the discussion that inaccurately reflect the results presented in this paper. In particular, major conclusions of the paper relate to the benefit of the vaccine for seropositive individuals (lines 18-19, 327-328) and an increasing effect of vaccination for seropositive individuals with age (lines 286-290, 329-330). There are potential issues with the modeling approach and how it relates to these conclusions. Further, a discussion about the long-term effects of the vaccine for seronegatives is speculative and problematic (311-320).</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1) Lines 18-19. &quot;Vaccinating seropositives gives greater long-lasting immunity than two natural infections.&quot; The claim that fixed-time immunity induced by vaccination of seropositives is maintained at a high level over time is not well supported. The authors assume in their models that immunity wanes in seronegatives (over 1 year) and is stable in seropositives (maintained over time). First, it is unclear why these assumptions were made. The reference for these model choices does not seem to cover immune kinetics over this period of time (Clapham et al. 2016 PLOS Comp Bio). Second, the authors actually tested different assumptions about waning immunity in supplement (lines 667 – 694), which are not described in the main text. In the supplement, the authors demonstrate waning immunity out to 4.5 years (with wide confidence intervals) in both seronegative and seropositive vaccinated individuals. In both cases, the duration of waning is outside of the observational period of the study, and the authors write: &quot;We conclude that three years of follow up data from each patient is insufficient to infer durations.&quot; Thus, the authors should adjust the statement &quot;vaccinating seropositives gives greater long-lasting immunity than two natural infections&quot; to reflect the fact that immunity in seropositives may also wane over time in a way that cannot be accurately measured with the current data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and so have amended our analysis to fit these durations as opposed to fixing them. While we cannot precisely infer durations, this uncertainty is stated clearly in the results, and the overall picture is that of short-lived seronegative transient immunity and long-lived seropositive transient immunity (lines 427-434).</p><p>We also agree with the reviewer’s point that benefit to seropositives beyond two previous natural infections is valid to the extent that seropositive transient immunity is long-lived, and there is some evidence that it is. We have amended the text accordingly in several places to make this caveat explicit (lines 18-19, 414-417, 427-434, and 614-621).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Lines 329-330. &quot;Therefore it may be more beneficial to vaccinate multitypic seropositives than simpler models have predicted [11].&quot; How do the authors know it is the multitypics that benefit as opposed to those with primary immunity before vaccination? It would be helpful if the authors could further support this statement by discussing the results that relate to this point. This is especially important in relation to the discussion about dengue rapid diagnostic tests (e.g. lines 23-24), which have very low sensitivity for detecting monotypic DENV immunes.</p></disp-quote><p>While one mechanism of vaccine action (change in relative risk) would not affect multitypics, the other mechanism (conferral of transient immunity) would benefit multitypics, for as long as this immunity was present.</p><p>We have now made this point more prominent in the results (lines 414-417 and 427-447) and elsewhere. Benefit to multitypics is now supported by fitted parameter values, and not merely values that we had previously assumed.</p><p>While our fitted parameters do predict greater immunity to seropositive vaccinees than two previous natural infections, and also that multitypics would benefit, it is true that we were not able to test a model where transient immunity applied only to monotypics (now mentioned in lines 443-447 and 585-587). That said, we believe that potential benefit to multitypics, even though they would benefit less than monotypics, is an important consideration for this vaccine, and we would very much like to leave this consideration in our paper if possible. This is particularly true seeing as we agree with the reviewer that it is difficult to identify monotypic immunes – benefit to multitypics would render this less of an issue, as all seropositives would benefit (we mention this in the discussion in lines 614-627).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Lines 286 -290. &quot;Interestingly, fixed-time immunity was found to increase with age in seropositives. In general, heterogeneity between countries' Kaplan-Meier curves can be explained by serotype and seroprevalence, although these factors are insufficient to explain differences in vaccine efficacy by age, for which age-specific effects (independent of serostatus) are required.&quot; The conclusion about the benefit of the vaccine even to multitypic immunes seems to be derived from the observation that fixed-effect immunity induced by the vaccine in seropositive individuals increases with age. The authors observe large age-specific fixed-time immunity differences by serostatus (Figure 5), although it is not clear there is much difference across age groups in vaccine efficacy (Figure 4). While the authors state that age specific effects are independent of serostatus, the age effects only occur in seropositives and thus are most plausibly related to more prior infections in children of older ages. It would be helpful if the authors further discussed age-effects and their relationship being multitypic immune.</p></disp-quote><p>The predicted benefit to multitypics does not arise from the age-dependence in transient immunity (previously termed “fixed-time immunity”). Instead, it comes from the positive values and long durations of seropositive transient immunity – albeit with the significant caveat that we assumed transient immunity would affect monotypic and multitypic seropositives equally (now mentioned in lines 443-447 and 585-587). The “silent-infection” mechanism does not affect multitypics in our model, because we assume that disease risk from tertiary and quaternary infection is equal (i.e. <italic>K<sub>2,D</sub></italic> = <italic>K<sub>3,D</sub></italic>).</p><p>We have amended our analysis to allow seronegative transient immunity to be negative (which it is for seronegative 2-5-year-olds against serotype 2), which allows for better fitting of the 2-5-year-old Kaplan-Meier curves. There is now a slight age trend in seronegatives, in that values for 2-5-year-olds differ from older age groups.</p><p>Nevertheless, the reviewer’s comment is interesting, and we had not thought of this before. It is possible that the increased transient immunity we estimate for older ages for all seropositives also reflects greater transient immunity in multitypics, although the similar age trend in seronegatives would perhaps argue against this explanation.</p><p>Please let us know if we have misunderstood the reviewer’s point. In any case, we have included these points in the discussion (lines 555-561).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Lines 311 – 315. &quot;In high transmission settings where children would ordinarily receive at least two natural infections, we predict that even seronegatives would eventually benefit from vaccination, as they would experience one high risk infection, and all subsequent infections would have a much lower risk, in contrast to unvaccinated individuals who would ordinarily experience one moderate and one high risk infection [Figure 1].&quot; The results of this manuscript do not support this claim. While the authors may expect this to be true based on the model scheme (referenced as Figure 1), the results, as currently described, do not prove this point. Further, the caveats provided afterward do not justify inclusion of this paragraph in the discussion (Lines 316-320): &quot;Important caveats include first that disease risk would increase in the short term. Second, and more seriously, a small subset of symptomatic infections are fatal, in which case vaccination could shorten life in seronegatives. Finally, while the eventual benefit to seronegatives is predicted by our model and the model fits well, this remains a prediction yet to be validated by empirical data.&quot;). This paragraph should be removed or significantly reworked because it is largely a question of medical ethics.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point. We agree have removed the paragraph from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4. It is not clear why vaccine efficacy increases over time in the trial for vaccinated seropositives, even across all age groups. It does not seem to be explained by age effects, waning immunity, or serotype distributions. Is it related to differences in disease outcomes measured in the trial over time (e.g. Figure S8)?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct: the improvement in efficacy (the decline in hazard ratios) over time for seropositives reflect the better performance of the vaccine against hospitalised or severe disease (at least in as far as this can be inferred given relatively few passive phase case counts), as per what was Figure S8 (now Figure 4—figure supplement 2). We have updated the text accordingly to make this explicit (lines 369-371), and we thank the reviewer for drawing this to our attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is surprising that the serotype effects are more similar than might be expected based on previous articles on these data, especially previous observations of greater efficacy against DENV4. Here the authors observe strong enhancement of DENV4 at later timepoints in the trial. Could the authors comment on whether this might relate to the way serotype effects are modeled, or whether this constitutes a major difference from what has been shown previously?</p></disp-quote><p>There are some quite large differences in the transient immunity estimates by serotype for each serostatus. For example, in 2-5-year-old seronegatives, transient immunity is -11% (-72% – 46%) for serotype 2, but this rises to 54% (11%-85%) for serotype 4. In 12-16-year-old seropositives, transient immunity is 54% (22%-78%) for serotype 1 and 85% (56%-99%) for serotype 4.</p><p>Hazard ratios, particular at later times post first dose, are more similar between serotypes, and this may be due to the fact that we do not model serotype-specific relative risks (and therefore serotype-specific change in relative risk induced by “silent-infection” vaccination). We did attempt to resolve this previously, but the trial data was less well fitted, and there is insufficient power to resolve the parameters, particularly for the passive phase/hospitalised disease. Even here though, the risk enhancement in 2-5-year-old vaccinees is much larger for serotypes 1 and 2 than for serotypes 3 and 4 (either when considering seronegatives only or when considering both seronegatives and seropositives combined).</p><p>However, we agree with the reviewer that the greater efficacy previously observed for DENV4 are not as well captured by our analysis. If we had been able to model serotype specific durations of transient immunity, we think that this would have resulted in longer durations for seronegative transient immunity for DENV4, which would likely diminish the DENV4 risk enhancement our main model predicts. Unfortunately however, transient immunity durations that are not serotype-specific are already imprecisely inferred. We have added these limitations to the discussion of the main text in lines 582-598.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Table 1 and its explanation in the text are confusing. Instead of a traditional presentation of relative risk, which is described in the text, the table presents the probability of disease expected relative to secondary infections. One option would be to present relative risk estimates in table, and clearly indicate the reference groups in the table. Additionally, while KiD is clearly defined in the methods, it would be helpful to add one sentence to the main text to define KiD, given that the main text uses this notation in multiple paragraphs without explaining its interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the definition of <italic>K,<sub>iD</sub></italic> clear in the main text now, and have added in the baseline/reference groups to Table 1 for relative risks and age-specific multiplier of the hazard. That said, we are not sure we understand the reviewer as the relative risks presented in Table 1 are those given in the text. Please let us know if we have misunderstood or if further changes are required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper uses individual trial participant data from two large phase 3 dengue vaccine randomised clinical trials to fit a Bayesian survival model of symptomatic dengue illness that is dependent on case-control status (vaccine vs placebo), baseline serostatus, age, and dengue serotype. The main finding is a detailed characterisation of how the relative risk of symptomatic illness changes as a function of time since vaccination and baseline serostatus. As previously reported, children who are seronegative at baseline have a drastically increased risk of symptomatic illness in years 2 and 3 of follow-up. Although this finding is not novel per se, having a precise characterisation of the time-varying risk is important for determining vaccine utility and optimal implementation strategies.</p><p>The survival model is fairly complex but this complexity reflects the complexity of the trial data and the inference problem at hand (multiple countries with different proportions of dengue serotypes, active and passive follow-up periods, age-varying effects). I particularly like the use of Gibbs sampling to treat the missing baseline serostatus as a latent variable in the model. This is an elegant method that allows for the analysis of the whole dataset and not restricted to just those with serostatus data (only 10% of participants).</p><p>My main comments are about clarity of the manuscript and reproducibility:</p><p>1. The Results section needs to explain the big K notation which is fairly complicated (but I can't see any easy way of simplifying it!)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. We have now split up the <italic>K</italic> parameters, which previously denoted too many related but distinct quantities and concepts. As before, <italic>K<sub>i,D</sub></italic> refers to the relative risk of disease given <italic>i</italic> prior infections of case type <italic>D</italic> (by default active phase/passive phase, or alternatively hospitalised/non-hospitalised or severe/non-severe if considering disease severity). <italic>φ<sub>cD</sub>(α)</italic> refers to the seropositive disease risk where number of previous infections is unknown, and so is a weighted average of <italic>K<sub>1,D</sub></italic> and <italic>K<sub>2,D</sub></italic>, for subjects of age <italic>α</italic> in country <italic>c</italic>. Finally, <italic>R<sub>abcD</sub>(α)</italic> is the relative risk of disease of type <italic>D</italic> in stratum <italic>abc</italic>, which encompasses baseline serostatus, aggregate seropositive risk by age <italic>φ<sub>cD</sub>(α)</italic>, and the change in relative risk induced by vaccination (i.e. the vaccine-as-silent-infection model).</p><p>These definitions are given in the text and in the model glossary / parameter table. We think the manuscript is clearer as a result, but please let us know if additional changes are required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The Methods section really needs a section on the data (this could be quite short). Otherwise it's hard to know exactly what sort of data are being used (eg right censoring after first illness is mentioned in the model bit)</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a short data section at the start of the Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The Methods section really needs a parameter table. Table 1 gives a summary of model outputs which is useful, but these are not parameters. What I would find useful is a table with all the main model parameters using the same notation as in the text (eg K<sub>0,0</sub>) and the associated prior distributions. This would emphasize that the model has a lot of parameters. This would also be useful to emphasize which parameters were fixed in the model (eg M<sub>b</sub>, sigma?).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion and we have now added a model glossary (Table S1/Supplementary File 1). This contains fitted and fixed parameters, their prior distributions, as well as various quantities derived from the parameters that should make the methods more readable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It says all priors are uniform but this seems a bit odd. Maybe I am misunderstanding something, but the relative risk parameters can take values in (0, infinity) surely? A uniform prior is therefore improper. This is probably not the best choice (uniform priors are often not a good choice).</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that in theory relative risks could be very large (though not unbounded), in practice this does not align with dengue epidemiology. Since we choose risk of disease among subjects with a single prior infection as our baseline (i.e. <italic>K<sub>1,1</sub>:=1</italic>), relative risks can be expected to be lower than 1. We previously we did run fits where relative risks could vary between 0 and 100. This did not change results but did lead to considerably slower convergence. Further a prior of <italic>Unif</italic>(0,100) would mean that our prior belief considered disease risk in primary or tertiary/quaternary infection to be 99 times more likely to be greater than secondary infection, and this is obviously not the case.</p><p>In any case, the priors are not unbounded and are therefore integrable, and so they are not improper. Further, while the hard boundaries of uniform priors can lead to non-symmetrical proposals, we are careful in preserving proposal symmetry. Proposed parameter values that lie outside parameter ranges are “reflected” in the opposite boundary (unfortunately the only analogy I can think of is Pac-Man!).</p><p>Please let us know if we have misunderstood your point or if any changes are still required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. &quot;Model code is available from the authors&quot; and &quot;The model was coded in C++&quot; doesn't really meet eLife standards for reproducibility or inspire huge confidence. The paper is entirely based on the validity of the model fitting and this is a complex model that has been hand coded. I fully trust the competence of the authors, but I really think the code should be made available online (via a git repo for example) with a minimum working example for the fitting. If the authors can't make the full dataset openly accessible then a simulated dataset to test the model would be a good alternative.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. All model code, together with pre-compiled binaries and example parameter/batch files, is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/dlaydon/DengVaxSurvival">https://github.com/dlaydon/DengVaxSurvival</ext-link>. Unfortunately, the underlying trial data is at an individual level and owned by Sanofi Pasteur, and so we are not free to share it. However, as suggested we have provided simulated data, sampled from our parameter posteriors, that has comparable case numbers across serotypes, disease severities and various strata. When the model is fitted on run on this simulated data, it reproduces our results well, albeit with a little noise. We hope that this will be acceptable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Could you explain a bit more why the parameter M<sub>b</sub> is fixed at 0.7? It says: &quot;equal to 1 for seronegatives and 0.7 for seropositives, chosen to reflect seropositive participants' reduced disease risk due to their immunity to at least one serotype&quot;. I couldn't square this with fact that seropositives also can have increase risk as the secondary infection is more likely to be severe than the first? I get that you don't know how many infections a seropositive individual has had, but I can't really understand the justification for the 0.7.</p></disp-quote><p>This language was careless on our part, and we thank the reviewer for drawing it to our attention. A seronegative individual, while less likely to become symptomatic upon infection, is susceptible to more serotypes than a seropositive individual, because seropositives have acquired natural immunity to at least one serotype. This susceptibility to fewer serotypes is what the <italic>M<sub>b</sub></italic> parameter refers to, and we have therefore amended the description of this parameter on lines 130-132.</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer, and so we have updated all model runs so that the <italic>M<sub>b</sub></italic> parameter is fitted rather than fixed. Results are similar (exact values have been updated throughout the text), and the <italic>M<sub>b</sub></italic> parameter has a mean of 0.77 (0.43-0.99), slightly higher than we had previously assumed. We are grateful to the reviewer for raising this point and we think our manuscript is more robust as a result.</p></body></sub-article></article>
