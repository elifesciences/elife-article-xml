Regulation of initiation by a variety of DNA binding proteins is well established, while elongation is regulated by auxiliary transcription factors that interact with RNA polymerase (RNAP), including the elongation factors NusA and NusG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mondal et al., 2017</xref>). Transcription termination demarcates the 3’ ends of transcription units, and misregulation of this process can result in spurious sense and/or antisense transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roberts, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mondal et al., 2016</xref>). Termination in bacterial systems is known to proceed via two distinct mechanisms. One mechanism is Rho-dependent termination, which requires the activity of Rho, a hexameric ATP-dependent RNA translocase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roberts, 2019</xref>). The other mechanism is intrinsic termination, which is generally assumed to not require the activity of additional protein factors and as such is also frequently referred to as factor-independent termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roberts, 2019</xref>). An intrinsic terminator is composed of a GC-rich hairpin followed immediately by a U-rich tract, both of which define the point of termination (POT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roberts, 2019</xref>). Completion of the terminator hairpin can induce transcript release via hybrid shearing and/or hyper-translocation depending on the transcriptomic context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Komissarova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roberts, 2019</xref>).</p><p>NusA is a conserved bacterial transcription elongation factor that is essential for cellular viability in both <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. This protein factor binds to the flap-tip domain of the β subunit of RNAP via its N-terminal domain (NTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Once bound, NusA can directly interact with RNA using its S1, KH1, and KH2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the binding of these domains to RNA elements allows NusA in combination with several other Nus proteins to serve as an antitermination factor when transcribing rRNA or bacteriophage λ sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nodwell and Greenblatt, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vogel and Jensen, 1997</xref>). Also, the NTD of NusA can provide an additional set of positively charged residues outside of the RNA exit channel, extending this cavity while stabilizing the nucleation of RNA hairpins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the binding of NusA results in an allosteric widening of the RNA exit channel of RNAP, which can then more readily accommodate RNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). The ability of NusA to promote the nucleation and formation of hairpins within the RNA exit channel allows this factor to serve as both a pausing factor and a termination factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the antitermination activity of RNAP during transcription of rRNA operons involves suppression of NusA-stimulated pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>NusG, or SPT5 in archaeal and eukaryotic organisms, is the only universally conserved transcription factor. Bacterial NusG has two domains: the N-terminal NGN domain, which binds to the clamp helices of the β’ subunit of RNAP, and the KOW domain, which is connected to the NGN domain via a flexible linker and is free to interact with various regulatory partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu and Steitz, 2017</xref>). In <italic>E. coli,</italic> NusG is an anti-pausing factor and a core regulator of transcriptional polarity via the ability of its KOW domain to interact with either Rho or ribosomal protein S10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mooney et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tomar and Artsimovitch, 2013</xref>). Also, the KOW domain of <italic>E. coli</italic> NusG can interact with the S1 domain of NusA when coordinated by NusE and λN during bacteriophage λ antitermination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krupp et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> NusG is a sequence-specific pausing factor due to the ability of its NGN domain to make direct contacts with the non-template DNA (ntDNA) strand within the transcription bubble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yakhnin et al., 2016</xref>). This interaction results in a pause when the NGN domain encounters a stretch of T residues at critically conserved positions, as observed in 1600 NusG-dependent pause sites genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yakhnin et al., 2020</xref>). T residues in the ntDNA strand correspond to U residues in the nascent transcript. Although pausing is thought to be a fundamental prerequisite to termination, the role of NusG in intrinsic termination has not been investigated in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.</p><p>While intrinsic termination does not require additional auxiliary protein factors, it has been known for many years that NusA can stimulate intrinsic termination of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RNAP in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greenblatt et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schmidt and Chamberlin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bermúdez-Cruz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yakhnin and Babitzke, 2002</xref>). The ability of mycobacterial NusG to stimulate intrinsic termination in vitro has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Czyz et al., 2014</xref>). More recently it was determined that NusA stimulates intrinsic termination in vivo on a global level in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, with 232 intrinsic terminators classified as NusA-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mondal et al., 2016</xref>). In the current study we show that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> NusG also functions as an intrinsic termination factor in vivo, and that NusA and NusG cooperatively stimulate intrinsic termination on an unexpectedly large scale, with only 12% of all identified intrinsic terminators continuing to terminate efficiently in the absence of these two proteins. Our results suggest a model in which NusG-dependent pausing plays a vital role in NusG-dependent termination, and that the absence of NusG results in the misregulation of global gene expression and altered cellular physiology and behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NusG and NusA cooperatively stimulate intrinsic termination in vivo</title><p>For this study, we used a <italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub> strain in which NusA was solely generated exogenously from an IPTG-inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mondal et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, growth in the presence of IPTG results in wild-type (WT) levels of NusA, whereas growth in the absence of IPTG results in depletion of NusA to less than 2% of WT levels within four cell generations as shown via Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). By performing our studies with <italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub> and <italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub><italic>ΔnusG B. subtilis</italic> strains ± IPTG, we were able to mimic WT (<italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub>, +IPTG), NusA depletion (<italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub>, –IPTG), <italic>nusG</italic> deletion (<italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub> Δ<italic>nusG</italic>, +IPTG), and NusA depletion <italic>nusG</italic> deletion (<italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub> Δ<italic>nusG</italic>, –IPTG) conditions. To simplify the discussion, we will refer to these four conditions as WT, <italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub>, Δ<italic>nusG</italic>, and <italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub> Δ<italic>nusG</italic> strains.</p><p>Term-seq is a bulk functional genomics assay that allows for the identification of all 3’ ends within a transcriptome via the ligation of a unique RNA oligonucleotide to the 3’ end of all transcripts isolated from a bacterial culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mondal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dar et al., 2016</xref>). This ligation effectively preserves the authentic 3’ ends of all ligated transcripts, allowing for the computational identification of all authentic 3’ ends after sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mondal et al., 2016</xref>). To study the impact of NusA and NusG on intrinsic termination, we conducted Term-seq in duplicate in the WT, <italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub>, Δ<italic>nusG</italic>, and <italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub> Δ<italic>nusG</italic> strains. For each genomic region found to contain a transcript 3’ terminus, there were often multiple adjacent 3’ ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mondal et al., 2016</xref>). For our purposes, only the most abundant 3’ end within each region was included in the subsequent terminator analysis. Each 3’ end containing the core intrinsic terminator modules (RNA hairpin and U-rich tract) in the upstream sequence were categorized as potential intrinsic terminators, and a potential intrinsic terminator was confirmed to terminate in vivo only in cases where the termination efficiency (%T) at this nucleotide (nt) was ≥5 in the WT strain (see 'Materials and methods'). Using this system, we identified 4657 3’ ends in the WT strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), 1400 of which were categorized as intrinsic terminators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). To benchmark the results of our assay, we compared the locations of all intrinsic terminators identified in this study, to all intrinsic terminators identified previously by Term-seq in WT <italic>B. subtilis</italic> grown in Minimal-ACH media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mondal et al., 2016</xref>), and all intrinsic terminators identified by the in silico intrinsic terminator prediction tool TransTermHP applied to the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kingsford et al., 2007</xref>). This analysis showed a high level of overlap between these datasets, with 937 terminators being conserved in all three datasets and 1329 terminators being shared between our dataset and at least one other dataset. We also found 1123 intrinsic terminators shared between this study and a previous intrinsic terminator study conducted via Rend-Seq, a different 3’ end mapping strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lalanne et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The %T was calculated for each of the 1400 intrinsic terminators in each strain. Violin plots overlayed with box plots were constructed to view the distribution of these data, and the data collected from each strain was compared via Wilcoxon signed-rank testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). NusG stimulated intrinsic termination to a similar extent as NusA, with an ~ 22% drop in median %T in the <italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub> and Δ<italic>nusG</italic> strains when compared to the WT strain. Loss of both NusA and NusG in the <italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub> Δ<italic>nusG</italic> strain resulted in a drastic termination defect, with the median %T falling 55%. Change in %T upon the loss of NusA and/or NusG (Δ%T) was calculated for all intrinsic terminators in each mutant strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Based on our previously established categorization scheme, an intrinsic terminator was categorized as ‘dependent’ on NusA and/or NusG when the Δ%T ≥ 25, and ‘independent’ of NusA and/or NusG when 10 ≥ Δ%T ≥ −10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mondal et al., 2016</xref>). Remarkably, only 12% of all intrinsic terminators were categorized as independent in the <italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub> Δ<italic>nusG</italic> strain. To further assess the scope of the relationship between NusA and NusG on intrinsic termination, the overlap of intrinsic terminators categorized as dependent in each strain was organized into a Venn diagram and various intrinsic terminator subpopulations were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Terminators that were classified as dependent in only the <italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub> single mutant and <italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub> Δ<italic>nusG</italic> double mutant strains were categorized as requiring NusA (Req A), while terminators that were classified as dependent in only the Δ<italic>nusG</italic> single mutant and <italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub> Δ<italic>nusG</italic> double mutant strains were categorized as requiring NusG (Req G). Terminators that were categorized as dependent in all three strains were classified as requiring both NusA and NusG (Req A and G). A large number of terminators were only categorized as dependent in the double mutant strain, indicating they were able to terminate efficiently when either NusA or NusG was present in the cell, but not when both were absent. As such, this subpopulation was categorized as requiring either NusA or NusG (Req A or G). Intriguingly, 65% of all intrinsic terminators depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> are present in the Req A and G or in the Req A or G subpopulations, clearly illustrating a large functional overlap between NusA and NusG on intrinsic termination.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NusG is an intrinsic termination factor that works with NusA to stimulate suboptimal terminators.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Violin plots overlayed with box plots showing the distribution of termination efficiency (%T) in wild-type (WT), <italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub>, Δ<italic>nusG</italic>, and <italic>nusA</italic><sub>dep</sub> Δ<italic>nusG</italic> strains.

The data from each subpopulation was then compared via Mann-Whitney U testing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In parallel, sequence logos were generated from the 9 nt regions immediately downstream of the predicted hairpin for terminators within each subpopulation (i.e., the predicted U-rich tract) and each sequence logo was compared using DiffLogo, a tool that computes and displays the per-nucleotide Jensen-Shannon divergence for a set of sequence motifs in a pairwise fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nettling et al., 2015</xref>). Our terminator prediction system considered the hairpin to end before the first U residue and any contribution of A-U base pairing to terminator hairpin stability was not considered. It was found that terminators that require NusG in any fashion have weaker predicted hairpins than SI terminators, akin to Req A terminators, while terminators that require both NusA and NusG have the weakest hairpins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

This strong U enrichment is in line with the hypothesis that NusG stimulates intrinsic termination through its role in pausing (see below). Analyzing the distribution of predicted terminator hairpin stem lengths from each subpopulation with Fisher-Pitman permutation testing shows that SI terminators have longer hairpin stems than all subpopulations except Req A or G terminators, with a median of 10 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

To maintain a logical consistency between our in vivo and in vitro data, each in vivo condition is labeled to indicate the elongation factors that were present in the cell. Single-round termination assays were conducted with these two terminators ± NusA and/or ± NusG. Experiments were also performed with the WT NusG NGN domain, because this domain was found to be sufficient to recapitulate all features of NusG-dependent pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yakhnin et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, a mutant NGN domain in which the residues responsible for eliciting a pause were replaced with the corresponding <italic>E. coli</italic> residues (Y77H/N81S/T82V) was included in the analysis.

Our results with the <italic>ktrD</italic> terminator indicate that NusG can elicit a pause at two consecutive positions, but only one of these positions contains the requisite elements to induce transcript release. This distinction likely depends on the hairpin to 3’ end distance achieved at each position before readthrough. To test this possibility, we mutated the <italic>ktrD</italic> terminator by substituting C5 and A6 with U residues to reduce the length of the hairpin and to increase the hairpin to 3’ end distance by 2 nt while leaving the NusG-dependent pause motif intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These mutations altered the transcription profile of this template such that pausing still occurred at positions identical to the positions of Pause<sub>1</sub> and Pause<sub>2</sub> on the WT template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results indicate that the NusG-dependent pause motif upstream of the 3’ end is sufficient to elicit a pause and that the position of this pause is set by the motif. Calculating the half-life of both pauses on each template revealed that the duration of the pauses on the mutant template was shorter than the pauses on the WT template, implying that a NusG-dependent pause can be stabilized to different degrees by hairpins of different lengths and strengths. Interestingly, a fraction of RNAP at Pause<sub>1</sub> on the mutant template remained paused until at least 90 s, suggesting that NusG-dependent pausing at this position is long-lived. Termination no longer occurred on the mutant template, demonstrating that we successfully converted a NusG-dependent terminator into a NusG-dependent pause site by extending the hairpin to 3’ end distance by 2 nt.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NusG stimulates pausing at terminators with weak base pairs at the bottom of the hairpin stem and distal U-rich tract interruptions</title><p>Termination occurring 7–9 nt downstream of the hairpin is a biophysical constraint set by the length of the RNA-DNA hybrid when RNAP is in the post-translocated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ray-Soni et al., 2016</xref>).

Focusing on the revised terminators in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, we tabulated the number of terminators that contained ≥1 consecutive terminal A-U/G-U base pairs at the bottom of the revised hairpin stem vs. those that had 0 terminal A-U/G-U base pairs. For these revised terminators, the SI of NusG terminators were directly compared to the NusG-dependent terminators via a Fisher’s exact test, which revealed that NusG-dependent terminators were more likely to contain ≥1 consecutive terminal A-U/G-U base pairs than SI of NusG terminators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Generating sequence logos for the SI of NusG and NusG-dependent terminators from this updated pool and comparing these logos using DiffLogo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nettling et al., 2015</xref>) showed that NusG-dependent terminators exhibited a modest tendency to have distal U-rich tract interruptions compared to SI of NusG terminators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>While RNET-seq cannot by itself distinguish between pause sites that result in release vs. those that result in readthrough, by constraining the pause sites identified by RNET-seq to the positions of transcript release observed via Term-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), we were able to use RNET-seq to quantify pause strength at intrinsic terminators.

Interestingly, we found that strong NusG-dependent pausing could be found at both SI of NusG and NusG-dependent terminators. It should be noted that RNET-seq RNA isolation steps lead to a depletion of RNET-seq read coverage at intrinsic terminators. As such, we found that the intrinsic terminators identified by RNET-seq tended to have stronger RNA:DNA hybrids and stronger NusG-dependent pause signals compared to the total pool of intrinsic terminators, as these features stabilize RNAP at the POT. These findings complicated the direct comparison of RNET-seq data to Term-seq data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>NusG and NusA cooperatively coordinate global gene expression</title><p>Terminator readthrough can impact gene expression by increasing transcription of downstream genes oriented in the same direction, destabilizing transcripts from downstream convergent transcription units due to formation of dsRNA and/or changing the expression of global regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mondal et al., 2016</xref>).

We found that NusG stimulates termination at intrinsic terminators with suboptimal hairpins and strong NusG-dependent pause signals upstream of the 3’ end. We also found that NusG works in a cooperative fashion with NusA to regulate both intrinsic termination and global gene expression. This cooperativity during termination can be fully recapitulated by the NGN domain of NusG in vitro. While the AR2 domain of NusA and the NGN domain of NusG were found to physically interact in <italic>E. coli</italic> during elongation, this interaction is unlikely to be relevant to the regulation of elongation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> due to the absence of the AR2 domain in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> NusA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Strauß et al., 2016</xref>).

Only 12% of all intrinsic terminators identified in this study function independently of both NusA and NusG. Thus, our results establish that intrinsic (factor-independent) termination is primarily a factor-mediated process in <italic>B. subtilis.</italic> Thus, a new nomenclature system that divides intrinsic terminators based on their factor dependency profiles is warranted. We suggest NusA-dependent terminators, NusG-dependent terminators, NusA-NusG-dependent terminators, and factor-independent terminators.</p><p>In vitro experimentation was conducted on six terminators that were found to be stimulated by NusG in vivo, and it was generally found that NusA is the more potent termination factor in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Interestingly, these templates included terminators that were found to be more reliant on NusG than NusA in vivo. This discrepancy could be explained by the inability of the in vitro assay to fully mimic in vivo conditions and/or the participation of additional protein factors in vivo. It was recently found that RNAP pausing at intrinsic terminators can lead to RNAP collision at convergent transcription units and that these collisions can result in transcript release within <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ju et al., 2019</xref>). Knowing that pausing is involved in NusG-dependent intrinsic termination, we tested the effect of convergent transcription in vitro on terminators that were both identified to be NusG-dependent and at which convergent transcription occurs in vivo. However, convergent transcription had no impact on the effect of NusG on termination in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Compared to the position identified by Term-seq in vivo, we found that NusG stimulated termination at a position further downstream in three templates tested in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and E</xref>). This finding can be explained by the fact that NusG shifts RNAP to the post-translocation register in both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sevostyanova and Artsimovitch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yakhnin et al., 2020</xref>), and may thus function as a processivity factor in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> until encountering the consensus pause motif at these terminators. NusA has been reported to stimulate termination at a more upstream position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yakhnin and Babitzke, 2002</xref>). This phenomenon was only observed in vitro in reactions where NusG was absent, implying that the shifting of RNAP to the post-translocation register is a central feature of elongation complexes containing NusG. Moreover, NusA and NusG together stimulated termination in vitro at a position 1–3 nt further downstream than the 3’ end identified by Term-seq in vivo on all templates tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our RNET-seq analysis also showed that the 3’ ends of nascent transcripts are consistently downstream of the steady-state 3’ ends of released transcripts, although the RNET-seq 3’ ends did not always correspond precisely to the in vitro POT(s) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>).

A feature that distinguishes the <italic>ktrD</italic> NusG-dependent terminator from the <italic>ktrD</italic> hairpin-stabilized NusG-dependent pause is whether the hairpin can extend to within 7–9 nt of the RNA 3’ end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The NusG-dependent pause likely extends the time frame for terminator hairpin completion before readthrough occurs. This pause is sequence-specific and occurs when RNAP incorporates U residues into the nascent transcript at positions −12, −11, −8, −7, and −6 relative to the 3’ end at position −1. These U residues correspond to the TTNTTT consensus pause motif in the ntDNA strand of the paused transcription bubble that was identified previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yakhnin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yakhnin et al., 2020</xref>).

Displacement of these interactions requires major energetic expenditures, which may explain why certain bacterial species evolved a strong G-C preference at the base of the terminator hairpin to drive completion of its formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ray-Soni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peters et al., 2011</xref>). Weak RNA hairpins with several consecutive terminal A-U/G-U base pair and distal U-rich tract interruptions were a feature of all NusG-dependent terminators mapped in vitro, and our analysis of RNET-seq data showed that these characteristics are enriched across NusG-dependent terminators genome-wide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Model of NusA-dependent and NusG-dependent intrinsic termination</title><p>The precise mechanism of transcript release at Nus-dependent terminators is not currently understood. One potential mechanism is that NusA assists with the formation of suboptimal terminator hairpins, while NusG-dependent pausing provides additional time for hairpin completion, which drives transcript release in all cases where the U-rich tract is at or above an optimality threshold. Additionally, the ability of NusG to shift RNAP into the post-translocation register may assist in the hyper-translocation and deactivation of RNAP at intrinsic terminators with weak terminal base pairs and distal U-tract interruptions, while NusA assists in the formation of suboptimal hairpins and/or pausing at suboptimal U-rich tracts. The observation that NusA stimulates termination at a more upstream position provides evidence for a model in which terminators that depend on the formation of terminal A-U/G-U base pairs require NusG, while terminators that have G-C or C-G terminal base pairs may not be able to induce a sufficiently stable NusG-dependent pause, and therefore will depend solely on NusA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Moreover, our data suggests that the main feature that differentiates terminators that require NusA and NusG (Req A and G) from terminators that require either NusA or NusG (Req A or G) is hairpin strength, with Req A and G terminators having significantly weaker hairpins than Req A or G terminators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). This model suggests that the most suboptimal terminators (Req A and G) require both the NusG-dependent pause and the hairpin stimulation activity of NusA, while the comparatively more optimal (Req A or G) terminators can function efficiently with only one of these activities.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of NusA-dependent and NusG-dependent intrinsic termination.</title><p>(1) During transcription elongation, NusA binds to the β flap domain of RNA polymerase (RNAP) near the RNA exit channel, whereas NusG binds to the β' clamp helices in close proximity to the non-template DNA (ntDNA) strand within the transcription bubble. NusA stimulates pausing during transcription of a suboptimal U-rich tract containing distal U tract interruptions. (2) NusG shifts RNAP to the post-translocated state and increases the pause half-life by making sequence-specific contacts with the TTNTTT motif within the ntDNA strand of the paused transcription bubble. The T residues in this motif are shown as being flipped out toward the NGN domain of bound NusG, but evidence for base flipping has not been obtained.

(4) NusG-dependent pausing provides time for weak A-U and/or G-U base pairs to form at the base of the terminator hairpin such that the hairpin to 3’ end distance is reduced to 7–9 nt.

An intrinsic terminator contains a GC-rich RNA hairpin and a U-rich tract immediately downstream of the hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roberts, 2019</xref>). Some intrinsic terminators also contain an A-rich tract upstream of the hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roberts, 2019</xref>). As such, the 50 nt upstream of each 3’ end was iteratively sent through an in silico RNA secondary structure prediction algorithm (RNAStructure) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mathews et al., 2004</xref>). In cases where a hairpin was identified, the presence of a U tract leading to the 3’ end was verified by visual inspection.

Short window sizes of 10 nt were chosen to limit potential complications arising from transcription initiation downstream of the POT. A 3’ end containing the intrinsic terminator modules was included in this study only in cases where %T ≥ 5 in the WT strain.

Nonetheless, we felt that this conclusion can be strengthened with additional analysis and experiments that hopefully are not terribly burdensome. We believe that these additions would bring the paper to the level required for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The essential revisions are detailed below, followed by the individual reviews.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. While we appreciated the careful follow-up work, we felt that the major conclusion could be strengthened by a more in-depth analysis of the genome-wide data, assuming those data support the role of NusG-dependent pausing in termination. Reviewers 1 and 2 give specific suggestions in their reviews. Some of these relate to the way comparisons are made between datasets, and others address specific scientific questions. Of particular relevance are analyses that test whether NusG stimulates termination at sites with (i) weak terminal base-pairs, and (ii) gaps in the U-tract. Any other analyses of the genome-wide data that support the importance of NusG-simulated pausing in termination would be valuable to include. For example, is there any evidence that NusG-dependent pause sites identified by NET-seq are associated with sites of termination?</p><p>2. Termination sites in vitro are consistently downstream of those observed in vivo. While it is reasonable to hypothesize that this difference is due to trimming by exonucleases, there is no experimental evidence presented to support this. To test the hypothesis, we suggest mapping termination sites by 3' RACE in RNase mutant strains for one or two of the terminators characterized in the paper. B subtilis 3' exonucleases are defined, and mutant strains have been described (e.g., Oussenko et al., 2005 J Bacteriol 187:2758; Liu et al., 2014 Mol Microbiol 94:41).</p><p>3. Add a figure showing the model described in the discussion (lines 332-84) for the proposed roles of NusG and NusA in intrinsic termination.</p><p>4. Broaden the discussion of how the study relates to prior work on intrinsic termination, as detailed by Reviewer 2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript focuses on the role of NusA and NusG in intrinsic transcription termination in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. The authors argue that NusA and NusG are required for efficient termination at many sites, with NusG promoting termination by stimulating pausing. Stimulation of pausing by NusG appears to facilitate termination at sequences that would not ordinarily be expected to function as terminators. Lastly, the authors show that loss of NusA and/or NusG leads to large-scale changes in gene expression, including changes in expression of flagellar genes that lead to the loss of motility in a nusG deletion.</p><p>Finding a widespread role for NusG in intrinsic termination is interesting, and the authors make a reasonably strong case that this effect is due to NusG-dependent pausing. Nonetheless, several of the arguments made would be strengthened by further analysis of the genome-wide datasets. The effects of losing NusA/G on gene expression are somewhat less interesting; these changes are not surprising for such important regulators. Moreover, the physiological significance of these changes is unclear. Do NusG levels fluctuate sufficiently for there to be changes in gene expression? I think it is unlikely that NusG levels would ever drop sufficiently to impact motility.</p><p>There are a lot of comparisons of distributions in the manuscript. For the most part, the differences are clear, but a statistical analysis is warranted in the less obvious cases, e.g. Supplementary Figure 3.</p><p>Figure 4 shows a few examples of NusG stimulating termination at sites with weak terminal base-pairs. This is an interesting result, but with only a few examples it is difficult to judge how widespread this is. The authors should analyze their genome-wide datasets to determine if this is a common feature of NusG-dependent terminators.</p><p>Line 225. The authors argue that NusG stimulates termination at sites with gaps in the U-tract. This is an intriguing hypothesis, but should be tested using the genome-wide data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Mandell et al. report results of a genome-scale analysis of transcriptional termination in wild-type <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and derivative strains in which NusA, NusG, or both factors are depleted or deleted. The work is of particular significance because effects of NusG on stimulating termination, while known, have not been characterized mechanistically. The authors report that NusG promotes termination at intrinsic terminators with suboptimal features, and often does so additively with effects of NusA. They propose that NusG enhances intrinsic termination via stimulation of a sequence-specific pause, although only a correlation rather than a causal relationship for this effect on pausing and effects on termination is established. Finally, the authors link the loss of NusG to motility defects. Overall, this comprehensive analysis of terminators in Bacillus is highly informative, and the analysis of the NusA/NusG-dependence of these terminators provides important insights into transcription regulatory mechanisms. Nonetheless, the manuscript could be improved by addressing the following main points.</p><p>1. The authors demonstrate a correlational but not causal relationship between NusG stimulation of pausing and its effect to enhance termination. They show that the pause exists without termination, but do not directly link pausing to termination. Have the authors identified mutations of NusG that still interact with RNAP but are defective for pause stimulation? Was a mutant NusG defective for the NT-strand interaction tested for the ability to promote termination? Unless more supportive data can be provided, the claim of causality should be tempered and the need for testing causality should be described.</p><p>2. Section starting at line 162 and Figure 3. Related to point 1, the authors perform a detailed analysis of the ktrD terminator and focus on possible effects of NusG on pausing downstream from the site of termination mapped by term-seq (A+8 numbered from the last G-C base pair in the terminator hairpin). The authors conclude that NusG exerts its effect on intrinsic termination through its role in pausing (line 177), but do not highlight in the Results the fact that they do not observe pausing or termination at A+8 in vitro. If the effects of NusG on pausing all occur after the point of termination in vivo, then how could pauses at those locations possibly affect termination in vivo? The authors should address this question explicitly in the Results, since it seems to contradict their conclusion. The same point appears to apply to the yetJ and fur terminators (Figure 4). In the Discussion the authors suggest the discrepancy could be related to nuclease trimming in vivo of RNAs terminated at the sites seen in vitro. Readers will already be confused by the discrepancy in the Results, so it would better to bring up this idea, which is reasonable, in the Results. Have the authors considered testing it, however? Can nuclease mutants be used to see if pausing and termination really correlate in vivo and in vitro? Here again, unless a more definitive test is performed, the conclusions should highlight where uncertainty remains and be framed around the need for additional experiments.</p><p>3. The comparisons of different classes of terminators (stimulated by NusA, NusG, both, or neither; Figures 1, S3, S8) are reported using box plots or sequence logos without any accompanying statistical analysis for the significance of differences or similarities of the characteristics catalogued. Additionally, the box plots are ineffective in illustrating differences in distributions relative to the more information-rich violin plots or ridge plots that could be generated for the same datasets (e.g., using the R function geom_violin from the R package ggplot2 and the R function geom_density_ridges from the R package ggridges). Box plots work best when data are unimodal and roughly symmetric, which these data are not.</p><p>Additionally, when making statements about comparisons of characteristics between large datasets, it is accepted practice to include an estimate of the statistical significance of any differences described (i.e., a p value, although more sophisticated estimates of statistical significance are also possible). The authors should consider alternative presentations distributions (e.g., of %T) and should include estimates of statistical significance for any comparison from which they draw conclusions. For example, the change in %T from WT could easily be tested for statistical significance using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (a non-parametric paired difference test that avoids distributional assumptions). The distribution of predicted terminator hairpin stem lengths could be evaluated using a permutation test of shuffled classes.</p><p>4. The manuscript could be improved by placing the results in the broader context of what is already known and reported in the literature about intrinsic termination, NusA, and NusG. Currently, the authors' description of prior knowledge is more solipsistic than comprehensive. This narrow perspective limits in the impact of the work and at some points is misleading about what is already known or in debate. Examples of omissions are listed here. Correcting them comprehensively would greatly improve the manuscript.</p><p>(a) The authors do not cite a major prior study of genome-scale intrinsic termination in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (Lalanne et al., 2018 Cell 173:749). They should compare their results to those of Lalanne et al. at multiple places in the manuscript. In validating their term-seq data (lines 109-115), the authors should include a comparison of their findings to those of Lalanne et al. In the analysis of misregulation by NusA/NusG depletion/deletion, it seems obvious to ask whether NusA, NusG, or both contribute significantly to the 167 intergenic, 'tuned' intrinsic terminators reported by Lalanne et al. to singly or in combination set the expression of 276 genes in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. To what extent do contributions of NusA and NusG to termination at these 167 sites explain the misregulation of gene expression reported in the current manuscript?</p><p>(b) (line 96) As best I can tell, term-seq was developed independently by the Babitzke group and by the Sorek group in Israel (Dar et al., 2016 Science 352:aad9822). However, Dar et al. are not cited when describing the method. It would be appropriate to cite both the authors' own work and Dar et al. at this point in the manuscript.</p><p>(c) At multiple places in the manuscript (abstract, line72, line 314), the authors suggest that current or general dogma is that intrinsic terminators are not affected by transcription factors (or perhaps they mean not significantly affected by transcription factors). These statements employ a common trope in the scientific literature to frame and oversimplify prior knowledge so as to increase the perceived novelty of findings, and often constitute a strawman in scientific rhetoric. In this case, stating that intrinsic terminators not being significantly affected by transcription factors is a general dogma ignores long-standing knowledge that NusA stimulates intrinsic termination. Indeed NusA was discovered as an intrinsic termination factor and has long been described as such. See, for example, Greenblatt et al., 1980 PNAS 77:1991 &quot;L factor that is required for β-galactosidase synthesis is the nusA gene product involved in transcription termination&quot;; Schmidt and Chamberlin, 1987 JMB 195:809 &quot;nusA protein of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is an efficient transcription termination factor for certain terminator sites&quot;; Kingston and Chamberlin, 1981 Cell 27:523, which states in the abstract &quot;termination at [rrnB] tL is dependent on the nusA protein&quot;; Farnham et al., 1982 Cell 29:945 &quot;Effects of NusA protein on transcription termination in the tryptophan operon of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>&quot; or, more recently, Gusarov and Nudler, 2001 Cell 107:437 &quot;Control of intrinsic transcription termination by N and NusA: the basic mechanisms.&quot; Thus, there is no dogma that intrinsic terminators are not affected by transcription factors. There may be confusion about the definition of intrinsic termination, which is by no means exclusive to this manuscript. Intrinsic terminators are terminators that do not require transcription factors to exhibit at least some level of termination; they are not defined as terminators that are not affected by transcription factors. It is accurate to say the characteristics of intrinsic terminators that are affected by NusA (or in this case NusA and NusG) are not well characterized. The authors' results make a major contribution to such characterization, but they should be presented in that context and rather than the tired trope of overthrowing a dogma that doesn't really exist.</p><p>(d) At multiple places in the manuscript (line 15, line 72, line 302), the authors suggest that NusG was not previously known to affect transcriptional termination. This statement also is misleading. Mycobacterial NusG is known to stimulate intrinsic termination by Mycobacterial RNA polymerase and to stimulate intrinsic termination additively with NusA at some terminators (Czyz et al., 2016 mBio 5: e00931). The authors should include this precedent when introducing NusG effects on termination.</p><p>(e) (line 334) The authors note that &quot;NusG shifts RNAP to the post-translocation register&quot;. This was previously reported (Sevostyanova and Artsimovitch, 2010 NAR 38:7432), which should be noted here. Indeed effects of NusG favoring forward translocation or disfavoring backtracking were first described in 2000 (Pasman and von Hippel, 2000 Biochemistry 39:5573) and were characterized in some detail by Turtola and Belogurov, 2016 <italic>eLife</italic> 5:e18096, which would be appropriate to cite.</p><p>5. Lines 123-15 I found the criteria for deciding when contributions of NusA or NusG to termination were significant confusing. The authors state that effects of Δ%T ≥ 25 were considered significant or to be negligible when 10 ≥ Δ%T ≥ -10. Because %T is a ratio that asymtoptically approaches 0 and 100, however, these criteria seem to ignore potentially large effects and magnify others based on the absolute %T. A change of 90% to 99% termination would apparently be considered negligible even though it is close to a 10-fold effect both on downstream gene expression and on the relative rates of termination vs. terminator readthrough. In contrast a change in from 25% to 50% termination is less than a 2-fold effect on downstream gene expression and about 3-fold on the relative rates of termination vs. terminator readthrough. Thus, in terms of mechanistically meaningful effects on NusA and NusG, the criteria chosen seem arbitrary and not based on an obvious rationale. Have the authors considered using criteria that more directly connect to mechanistic effects of NusA and NusG?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>New data in the past few years have led to profound new insights into the structure and function of the bacterial RNA polymerase complex. In particular, this information has begun to uncover fundamental mechanistic features of transcription elongation, and, by extension, transcription termination. NusG protein, when bound to the transcription elongation complex, is known to form transient interactions with additional factors, from Rho to r-protein S10. Recent data have also revealed interactions between NusG and NusA, although not through the NGN domain. NusA has been shown to promote termination at intrinsic terminator sites while NusG has been described as an anti-pausing factor that improves processivity of the elongation complex. <italic>E. coli</italic> is thought to exhibit close coupling between the transcription elongation complex and the leading translating ribosome, while an interesting recent study argued that transcription and translation are uncoupled in the Gram-positive model microorganism <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. Therefore, transcription mechanisms may exhibit surprising differences between different phylogenetic groupings of bacteria. At the heart of this topic is NusG, which associates with a variety of factors in E coli, including NusA, NusB, S10 and Rho. Yet, B subtilis NusG appears to exhibit some differences, such as an apparent increase in sequence-specific NusG-DNA interactions, although the extent of these differences had not been examined. The current study addresses this issue and finds an entirely new mechanistic feature for B subtilis NusG proteins. High-throughput mapping of 3' termini can help identify sites of transcription termination at a global level. A prior study used this approach to discover the extent of NusA-mediated termination for <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. In this study, the authors repeat this approach with NusA- and NusG-depletion strains to find that &quot;intrinsic termination&quot; is somewhat of a misnomer, that the great majority of termination events appear to be strongly influenced by either NusA, NusG or both proteins. Moreover, their data point to some general trends, such as the length of the poly-uridine sequences and the overall size of terminator hairpin, which appear to be larger for truly intrinsic terminators and are weaker for the (more numerous) NusG/A-dependent terminators. This is a startling paper that fundamentally changes the perception of the role of NusG in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and suggests that NusG and NusA work together to promote termination for bacteria where transcription and translation are uncoupled.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61880.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

As such, we found that the intrinsic terminators identified by RNET-seq tended to have stronger RNA:DNA hybrids and stronger NusG-dependent pause signals compared to the total pool of intrinsic terminators, as these features stabilize RNAP at the POT. These findings complicated the direct comparison of RNET-seq data to Term-seq data.</p><p>This caveat is specified in lines 302-307 of the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(i) Weak terminal base-pairs, and (ii) gaps in the U-tract</p></disp-quote><p>The argument that a feature of NusG-dependent terminators with weak terminal base-pairs in the hairpin and distal U-rich tract interruptions was derived from the observation that the 3’ ends of all terminators tested in vitro were downstream of the 3’ ends identified in vivo. We suggested that this is due to post-release trimming by 3’ to 5’ exoribonucleases (added citation to PMID: 30381461). Regardless, in each case, after revising the U-rich tract and hairpin to account for this discrepancy, we noticed that each terminator tested in vitro contained several terminal A-U/G-U base-pairs and distal U-rich tract interruptions. Unfortunately, the discrepancy between the in vivo and in vitro 3' ends did not allow us to analyze whether this phenomenon is wide-spread at a transcriptome-wide level using only the Term-seq dataset presented in this manuscript.</p><p>RNET-seq reads are strictly obtained from nascent transcription events. Thus, the RNA 3’ ends identified by RNET-seq are unaffected from the effects of 3'-to-5' exonucleolytic trimming by ribonucleases. To determine how closely the RNET-seq and Term-seq derived 3’ ends agreed, we searched for the most abundant RNET-seq 3’ end (see revised Materials and methods) at, or 1-4 nt downstream of, the identified Term-seq 3’ end for each intrinsic terminator. For this task, we used the RNET-seq dataset in Yakhnin et al. 2020 collected from the WT strain of <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Through this analysis, we identified 485 intrinsic terminators with an RNET-seq 3’ end at or 1-4 nt downstream of the 3’ end identified by Term-seq. Notably, for 82% of these intrinsic terminators, the RNET-seq 3’ end was 1-4 nt downstream of the Term-seq 3’ end. While this information does not directly connect exoribonuclease trimming to the 3' ends identified by Term-seq, it provides compelling evidence that the nascent 3’ ends of intrinsic terminators are consistently downstream of the steady-state 3’ ends of released transcripts.</p><p>The 485 intrinsic terminators identified by RNET-seq were sorted into those that terminated strongly and independently of NusG (%T ≥ 70 in the WT strain, Δ%T between 10 and -10 in the Δ<italic>nusG</italic> strain), and those with a Δ%T ≥ 25 in the Δ<italic>nusG</italic> strain (NusG-dependent). For the terminators in each of these categories, we revised the terminator hairpin stems based on the genomic coordinates of the RNET-seq derived 3’ ends and tabulated the number of terminators that contained ≥ 1 consecutive terminal A-U/G-U base pairs vs. those that had 0 terminal A-U/G-U base pairs. Conducting a Fisher’s exact test for count data on these groups revealed that terminators with a Δ%T ≥ 25 in the Δ<italic>nusG</italic> strain (NusG-dependent) were more likely to contain ≥ 1 consecutive terminal A-U/G-U base pairs compared to SI terminators. Next, Supplementary file 2 was revised to account for the RNET-seq derived 3’ ends and sequence logos were generated for the updated U-rich tracts of SI of NusG and NusG-dependent intrinsic terminators. Using the computational sequence logo comparison toolkit DiffLogo (PMID: 26577052), we visualized the per-nucleotide differences between the sequence logos generated for these 3 groups and found that an increase in NusG-dependence was correlated with a decrease in distal U-richness of the U-rich tract. This analysis provides transcriptome-wide evidence that NusG-dependent terminators commonly have ≥ 1 consecutive terminal A-U/G-U base pairs in the hairpin stem and distal U-rich tract interruptions.</p><p>The description of this analysis is in lines 277-296 of the revised manuscript.

RNET-seq can be used to both identify all pause sites and quantify their NusG-dependence (Yakhnin et al. 2020). Thus, we calculated the normalized abundance of each of the previously mentioned 485 intrinsic terminator 3’ ends identified by RNET-seq in both the WT and Δ<italic>nusG</italic> strains (see revised Materials and methods). By calculating the log<sub>2</sub> transformed WT: Δ<italic>nusG</italic> abundance ratio for each of these 3’ ends, and by sorting these values into those derived from SI of NusG and NusG-dependent terminators, we observed that NusG-dependent pausing could be found at both SI of NusG and NusG-dependent terminators. This finding is not surprising considering that a major component of the NusG-dependent pause motif are T residues on the nt-DNA strand at positions -6, -7, and -8, , which correspond to U residues at positions 2, 3, and 4 of the U-rich tract. It is likely that the only terminators that require this pause to terminate efficiently are suboptimal terminators with ≥ 1 consecutive terminal A-U/G-U base pairs in the hairpin stem, weaker hairpin stems, and/or distal U-rich tract interruptions.</p><p>The manuscript was updated to include this analysis on lines 297-302 and Figure 4—figure supplement 3 was added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Our attempts at 3' RACE were unsuccessful. We spent two months on this to no avail.

The comparisons of different classes of terminators (stimulated by NusA, NusG, both, or neither; Figures 1, S3, S8) are reported using box plots or sequence logos without any accompanying statistical analysis for the significance of differences or similarities of the characteristics catalogued. Additionally, the box plots are ineffective in illustrating differences in distributions relative to the more information-rich violin plots or ridge plots that could be generated for the same datasets (e.g., using the R function geom_violin from the R package ggplot2 and the R function geom_density_ridges from the R package ggridges). Box plots work best when data are unimodal and roughly symmetric, which these data are not.</p><p>Additionally, when making statements about comparisons of characteristics between large datasets, it is accepted practice to include an estimate of the statistical significance of any differences described (i.e., a p value, although more sophisticated estimates of statistical significance are also possible). The authors should consider alternative presentations distributions (e.g., of %T) and should include estimates of statistical significance for any comparison from which they draw conclusions. For example, the change in %T from WT could easily be tested for statistical significance using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (a non-parametric paired difference test that avoids distributional assumptions). The distribution of predicted terminator hairpin stem lengths could be evaluated using a permutation test of shuffled classes.</p></disp-quote><p>These were excellent suggestions. While we decided to keep the box plots for all circumstances, we also overlayed violin plots onto all box plots to show the shape of the data in Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 3. We also conducted appropriate statistical tests whenever making comparisons as described above. We also used DiffLogo to compare sequence logos as described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The manuscript could be improved by placing the results in the broader context of what is already known and reported in the literature about intrinsic termination, NusA, and NusG. Currently, the authors' description of prior knowledge is more solipsistic than comprehensive. This narrow perspective limits in the impact of the work and at some points is misleading about what is already known or in debate. Examples of omissions are listed here. Correcting them comprehensively would greatly improve the manuscript.</p><p>(a) The authors do not cite a major prior study of genome-scale intrinsic termination in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (Lalanne et al., 2018 Cell 173:749). They should compare their results to those of Lalanne et al. at multiple places in the manuscript. In validating their term-seq data (lines 109-115), the authors should include a comparison of their findings to those of Lalanne et al.</p></disp-quote><p>We erred in not citing this paper, especially considering that we have discussed the Rend-seq method at length. This important paper is cited in the revised manuscript. We also compared our new terminator data with that from the Lalanne paper.

This was included in the main text in Lines 124-126.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the analysis of misregulation by NusA/NusG depletion/deletion, it seems obvious to ask whether NusA, NusG, or both contribute significantly to the 167 intergenic, 'tuned' intrinsic terminators reported by Lalanne et al. to singly or in combination set the expression of 276 genes in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. To what extent do contributions of NusA and NusG to termination at these 167 sites explain the misregulation of gene expression reported in the current manuscript?</p></disp-quote><p>We first determined the % of all intrinsic terminators that were determined to be SI, req A, req G, req A and G, and req A or G. We then determined the % of all ‘tuned’ intrinsic terminators that were determined to be SI, req A, req G, req A and G, and req A or G. By conducting pairwise Fisher’s exact test for count data, we found no difference between these proportions when comparing all intrinsic terminators to ‘tuned’ intrinsic terminators specifically. Thus, we have no reason to suspect that NusA and/or NusG preferentially contributes to the efficiency of this class of intrinsic terminators.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) (line 96) As best I can tell, term-seq was developed independently by the Babitzke group and by the Sorek group in Israel (Dar et al., 2016 Science 352:aad9822). However, Dar et al. are not cited when describing the method. It would be appropriate to cite both the authors' own work and Dar et al. at this point in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct-the two labs developed the method independently. The Dar et al. paper is now cited as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) At multiple places in the manuscript (abstract, line72, line 314), the authors suggest that current or general dogma is that intrinsic terminators are not affected by transcription factors (or perhaps they mean not significantly affected by transcription factors). These statements employ a common trope in the scientific literature to frame and oversimplify prior knowledge so as to increase the perceived novelty of findings, and often constitute a strawman in scientific rhetoric. In this case, stating that intrinsic terminators not being significantly affected by transcription factors is a general dogma ignores long-standing knowledge that NusA stimulates intrinsic termination. Indeed NusA was discovered as an intrinsic termination factor and has long been described as such. See, for example, Greenblatt et al., 1980 PNAS 77:1991 &quot;L factor that is required for β-galactosidase synthesis is the nusA gene product involved in transcription termination&quot;; Schmidt and Chamberlin, 1987 JMB 195:809 &quot;nusA protein of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is an efficient transcription termination factor for certain terminator sites&quot;; Kingston and Chamberlin, 1981 Cell 27:523, which states in the abstract &quot;termination at [rrnB] tL is dependent on the nusA protein&quot;; Farnham et al., 1982 Cell 29:945 &quot;Effects of NusA protein on transcription termination in the tryptophan operon of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>&quot; or, more recently, Gusarov and Nudler, 2001 Cell 107:437 &quot;Control of intrinsic transcription termination by N and NusA: the basic mechanisms.&quot; Thus, there is no dogma that intrinsic terminators are not affected by transcription factors. There may be confusion about the definition of intrinsic termination, which is by no means exclusive to this manuscript. Intrinsic terminators are terminators that do not require transcription factors to exhibit at least some level of termination; they are not defined as terminators that are not affected by transcription factors. It is accurate to say the characteristics of intrinsic terminators that are affected by NusA (or in this case NusA and NusG) are not well characterized. The authors' results make a major contribution to such characterization, but they should be presented in that context and rather than the tired trope of overthrowing a dogma that doesn't really exist.</p></disp-quote><p>Point taken. We removed any suggestion of overthrowing dogma. We are fully aware of the in vitro literature of NusA-stimulated termination and cite some of this work. Our previously published work remains as the only demonstration that NusA-dependent/NusA-stimulated termination occurs in vivo. Prior to our current work, the only suggestion that NusG affected intrinsic termination that we are aware of is one publication from the Landick lab using Mycobacterial RNAP in vitro. That work was cited in the Discussion of the original version of this manuscript and is now cited in the Introduction as well (Lines 79-80).</p><p>The Abstract was modified to emphasize that the information pertains specifically to <italic>B. subtilis.</italic> We assumed that this was implied considering that <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> is specifically mentioned in the preceding sentence.</p><p>These <italic>E. coli</italic> references were added to the description pertaining to line 72. (Greenblatt et al., 1981; Schmidt et al., 1987; Bermúdez-Cruz et al., 1999).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(d) At multiple places in the manuscript (line 15, line 72, line 302), the authors suggest that NusG was not previously known to affect transcriptional termination. This statement also is misleading. Mycobacterial NusG is known to stimulate intrinsic termination by Mycobacterial RNA polymerase and to stimulate intrinsic termination additively with NusA at some terminators (Czyz et al., 2016 mBio 5: e00931). The authors should include this precedent when introducing NusG effects on termination.</p></disp-quote><p>Line 15 of the Abstract was modified to emphasize that the information pertains specifically to <italic>B. subtilis.</italic> We previously cited the 2014 Czyz et al. work at the end of the Discussion, but now mention these findings in the Introduction, and the sentence pertaining to line 302 was modified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(e) (line 334) The authors note that &quot;NusG shifts RNAP to the post-translocation register&quot;. This was previously reported (Sevostyanova and Artsimovitch, 2010 NAR 38:7432), which should be noted here. Indeed effects of NusG favoring forward translocation or disfavoring backtracking were first described in 2000 (Pasman and von Hippel, 2000 Biochemistry 39:5573) and were characterized in some detail by Turtola and Belogurov, 2016 eLife 5:e18096, which would be appropriate to cite.</p></disp-quote><p>Sevostyanova and Artsimovitch, 2010 NAR 38:7432 is cited in the revised manuscript. Backtracking is not mentioned in our manuscript and so we did not cite the other two references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Lines 123-15 I found the criteria for deciding when contributions of NusA or NusG to termination were significant confusing. The authors state that effects of Δ%T ≥ 25 were considered significant or to be negligible when 10 ≥ Δ%T ≥ -10. Because %T is a ratio that asymtoptically approaches 0 and 100, however, these criteria seem to ignore potentially large effects and magnify others based on the absolute %T. A change of 90% to 99% termination would apparently be considered negligible even though it is close to a 10-fold effect both on downstream gene expression and on the relative rates of termination vs. terminator readthrough. In contrast a change in from 25% to 50% termination is less than a 2-fold effect on downstream gene expression and about 3-fold on the relative rates of termination vs. terminator readthrough. Thus, in terms of mechanistically meaningful effects on NusA and NusG, the criteria chosen seem arbitrary and not based on an obvious rationale. Have the authors considered using criteria that more directly connect to mechanistic effects of NusA and NusG?</p></disp-quote><p>In our 2016 Nature Microbiology paper on NusA-dependent termination we defined a ∆%T ≥ 25 as being NusA-dependent, and ∆%T between 10 and 25 as NusA-stimulated. We recognize that these cut-offs are arbitrary, but it allowed us to categorize the data so that we could discuss the results in a more meaningful way. We debated at great length about whether we should use fold change vs. ∆%T for the very reason mentioned by the reviewer (termination vs. readthrough). The various classes of terminator defects and the relative dependence on NusA fit the ∆%T scheme. Moreover, the work focused on the mechanism of termination (∆%T) rather than effects on downstream gene expression (termination vs. readthrough). We feel that this nomenclature is also the best way to describe the effects of NusG so we continued with this nomenclature in the current manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
