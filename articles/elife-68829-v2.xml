They are involved in a wide variety of DNA transactions including replication, repair, recombination, and transcription. Structural and bioinformatic analyses have classified helicases into several superfamilies (SF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>). Amongst the best-studied systems, particularly from a mechanistic point of view, are the UvrD-like family of SF1 enzymes, which include UvrD and its close cousin Rep from <italic>E. coli</italic>, as well as PcrA (a UvrD orthologue) from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and related organisms. Structural and biochemical analyses of the helicases in this family revealed conserved mechanisms for ATP hydrolysis, DNA translocation, and DNA unwinding among the different members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee and Yang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Velankar et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The PcrA/UvrD helicase has roles in rolling circle replication, nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), and homologous recombination (HR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bruand and Ehrlich, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Husain et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lahue et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Merrikh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Petit et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zieg et al., 1978</xref>). This adaptability is provided by the many different interaction partners, for example RepC/D, UvrB, MutL and RecA, which recruit the helicase to their respective pathways via physical interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machón et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manelyte et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Veaute et al., 2005</xref>). However, the structural basis for these interactions with different partner proteins remains largely unclear. Most recently, an interaction between PcrA/UvrD and RNAP has been identified, implying a role for PcrA in transcription, but its function is not understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Delumeau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Epshtein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gwynn et al., 2013</xref>). Studies in <italic>E. coli</italic> showed that UvrD can act as an accessory helicase which helps to minimise conflicts between the replisome and replication fork barriers including transcription complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boubakri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hawkins et al., 2019</xref>). The interaction was also reported to facilitate an alternative pathway for transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) in which UvrD removes RNAP from lesions by promoting backtracking and then helps to recruit NER factors to repair the damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Epshtein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kamarthapu and Nudler, 2015</xref>). However, the existence of this new TC-NER pathway (separate from that promoted by the canonical transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd) is debated, because high-throughput sequencing of the oligonucleotides excised during NER showed no evidence for strand-specific repair promoted by UvrD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adebali et al., 2017a</xref>). In the Gram-(+)ve model organism <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, PcrA was found to be enriched at highly transcribed regions of the genome and, in common with its orthologue UvrD, shown to alleviate replication-transcription conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Merrikh et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, genetic analyses of PcrA place this helicase at the interface of replication, repair, transcription, and chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moreno-Del Alamo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Petit et al., 1998</xref>). However, the mechanistic details of how PcrA/UvrD might help to promote the replication and/or repair of DNA on actively transcribed DNA remain unclear.</p><p>One nucleic acid intermediate that impacts on each of these key DNA transactions is the R-loop; a three-stranded structure in which a single RNA strand hybridises to a DNA duplex displacing an equivalent region of ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilera and García-Muse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crossley et al., 2019</xref>). R-loops can be formed when an RNA transcript re-hybridises to template DNA behind RNA polymerase. Once formed, R-loops are relatively stable structures which require active removal by enzymes such as RNases to prevent interference with other processes on DNA and preserve genome integrity. Interestingly, recent publications have shown that UvrD, Rep, Mfd and the single-stranded DNA-binding protein SSB are all important for R-loop homeostasis via unknown mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wimberly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wolak et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Although the function of PcrA/UvrD in transcription is still unclear, details are beginning to emerge about the interface formed between the helicase and RNAP which may provide some important clues. Crosslinking experiments revealed contacts between the 1B and 2B subdomains of the helicase and the β flap tip of the RNAP β subunit, as well as the N-terminal region of the RNAP β′ subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Epshtein et al., 2014</xref>). The extreme C-terminal domain (CTD) of PcrA, which is disordered or was removed to aid crystallisation in the available structures of this helicase, also plays a critical role in binding RNAP but its binding site on RNAP is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gwynn et al., 2013</xref>). A structure of the isolated CTD shows that it adopts a Tudor fold, which is connected to the main body of the helicase via a long, apparently disordered, linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanders et al., 2017</xref>). This is intriguing, because the canonical TC-NER factor Mfd also employs a Tudor domain for interaction with RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deaconescu et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we find that PcrA interacts tightly with a transcription elongation complex in vitro in a manner dependent on the CTD. We show that (unlike Mfd) the CTD binds to a lineage-specific insertion domain within the β subunit of RNAP, while the main body of the helicase surrounds the RNA and DNA exit channels. The CTD engages with an exposed beta-hairpin which defines a novel helicase interaction motif also found in other PcrA partners including UvrB. We further show that PcrA efficiently unwinds DNA:RNA hybrids in vitro and that blocking PcrA activity in vivo, by either overexpressing a dominant negative mutant or by preventing PcrA-RNAP association, results in increased R-loop levels. On the basis of these observations, we develop a model for PcrA as an R-loop surveillance helicase, where it acts to unwind DNA:RNA hybrids and minimise the potentially toxic effects of transcription on DNA replication and repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PcrA binds tightly to a transcription elongation complex using its C-terminal Tudor domain</title><p>Interaction between PcrA/UvrD and RNAP is well-documented in the literature, but little is known about which nucleic acid scaffolds or transcription states are the most favourable for association. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, a complex between RNAP and UvrD was reported to be stable enough to coelute during size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Epshtein et al., 2014</xref>). In the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> system, although purified PcrA and RNAP do clearly interact in the absence of nucleic acids, we found that a DNA/RNA scaffold which mimics an elongation complex was required to form a sufficiently stable complex to resolve using SEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the enhanced interaction was due simply to the helicase binding to the DNA, the complex formation was analysed further by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). PcrA efficiently supershifted the transcription elongation complex (TEC; a pre-formed complex between RNAP and a DNA/RNA scaffold), whereas it was barely able to bind to the scaffold alone. Based upon EMSA, the apparent dissociation constant was ~500 nM and the interaction was dependent on the C-terminal Tudor domain of PcrA (CTD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Removal of the CTD almost eliminated complex formation at concentrations of up to 1.5 µM of PcrA. Moreover, the purified CTD alone supershifted the TEC efficiently, albeit to a lower position in the gel. Although the UvrD CTD has been shown to possess a weak DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kawale and Burmann, 2020</xref>), in our hands the PcrA CTD does not detectably bind to either single- or double-stranded DNA (Kd &gt;&gt; 5 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanders et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, this result further supports the idea that the PcrA-TEC interaction (at least with this scaffold) is substantially mediated by protein-protein interactions. Additional support for this assertion was provided by EMSA supershift experiments in which the structure of the scaffold was varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). PcrA efficiently shifted the TEC regardless of the presence or length of the upstream and downstream DNA in the scaffold.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Interactions between PcrA and a transcription elongation complex are mediated by protein-protein interactions involving the PcrA-CTD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) EMSA supershift assays to monitor association of PcrA with a TEC.

PcrA was used at 1 µM concentration. Note that a unique supershifted band is formed in the final lane providing evidence for a PcrA-TEC complex. The free scaffold runs off the bottom of this gel due to the long electrophoresis time required to separate the shifted bands.

The upper panel shows the TEC signal (the template strand is Cy5- labelled) and the lower panel, the FL PcrA (V448C mutant labelled with Cy3). The ΔCTD construct is not able to supershift the TEC. When CTD is added to the TEC-PcrA complex, the band shifts downwards to the expected position of the CTD-TEC complex. FL PcrA and CTD were used at 3 µM concentration.

The addition of unlabelled CTD caused a decrease in the levels of fluorescently labelled PcrA bound to the TEC rather than a further supershift. This strongly suggests that full length PcrA and the CTD bind to the same (unknown) surface of RNAP and is consistent with the idea that the TEC recruits a single PcrA molecule. Note that the ability of the free CTD to outcompete full-length PcrA for RNAP association is relevant for in vivo experiments presented below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The C-terminal domain of PcrA interacts with the lineage-specific insertion domain 1 (SI1) of the β subunit of RNAP</title><p>Crosslinking of UvrD to RNAP has shown that the core helicase interacts with the RNAP β-flap tip and the N-terminal region of the β′ subunit in bacteria, but no information about the CTD-interaction domain was obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Epshtein et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we pursued a complementary approach in the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> system, using hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to study the complex formed between the free CTD and RNAP. This technique allows one to measure the rate of exchange of amide hydrogen atoms with deuterium atoms in the solvent. This rate is affected by hydrogen bonding, surface accessibility, protein dynamics and changes in the presence and absence of partner proteins and can therefore be used to probe potential binding interfaces or conformational changes.</p><p>We obtained good sequence coverage and redundancy for both the CTD and the major subunits of RNAP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The experiment was first validated by analysing the protection pattern on the CTD. As expected, data for the CTD in the CTD-RNAP complex showed significant protection compared to the CTD alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Moreover, it is mostly localised on the face of the Tudor domain that is typically expected to interact with partner proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Westblade et al., 2010</xref>).

It should be noted that, given the large size of RNAP (374 kDa) compared to the tiny Tudor domain (9.3 kDa), we did not expect to observe any protection for the large majority of the RNAP sequence if the stoichiometry of interaction is 1:1. In accordance with this expectation, only a small region of the β subunit of RNAP at approximately amino-acid position 300 showed significant protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, with HDX protection plots for the rest of RNAP β and the other RNAP subunits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Fortunately, this region of interest was well covered by the LC-MS/MS analysis with overlapping peptides, and the smallest part of the polypeptide protected was the seven-residue sequence PETGEIL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Intriguingly, despite the ubiquity of UvrD/PcrA orthologues in the bacterial domain and the strong conservation of the CTD sequence, the protected region in RNAP belongs to a lineage-specific insertion domain (SI1, also referred to as βi5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lane and Darst, 2010</xref>]) which differs significantly between organisms in terms of the length, sequence and precise location within the primary structure. Nevertheless, a nine-residue sequence motif (including the seven amino acids of interest) is present in most bacterial RpoB sequences despite variation in its exact position. As an example, primary structure diagrams for the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> RpoB subunits are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> with complete aligned sequences for the β2 and SI1 regions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. Despite being quite divergent compared to better-conserved parts of RpoB, the two SI1 domains contain a very similar peptide motif (VDPETGEIL and IDESTGELI respectively). Although the motifs are located in different parts of the SI1 domain primary structure they occupy a broadly similar space within the global architecture of RNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic> the motif adopts a beta hairpin structure, whereas this region is locally disordered in the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> TEC cryoEM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Newing et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pei et al., 2020</xref>).

The fragment of YxaL found to interact with PcrA in the yeast two-hybrid assay is consistent with the location of the newly identified motif. These two proteins are found in a very limited subset of bacterial proteomes and their cellular function is obscure. Therefore, we next decided to focus on the interaction of PcrA with UvrB; a ubiquitous Superfamily two helicase that is a key component of the nucleotide excision repair apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kisker et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, UvrB has already been shown to bind to the C-terminal domain of <italic>E. coli</italic> UvrD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manelyte et al., 2009</xref>) and this interaction is, therefore, potentially analogous to that formed between the CTD and RNAP β. To validate the predicted PcrA binding site on UvrB, we performed pulldown experiments using his-tagged UvrB as bait and myc-tagged PcrA in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> extracts as prey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These experiments confirmed the expected interaction between PcrA and wild-type UvrB protein. Furthermore, and in agreement with our hypothesis, substitution of the glutamic acid in the UvrB TGE motif (E233) severely disrupted the interaction with PcrA while having no effect on the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of UvrB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Inspection of the domain architecture of UvrB reveals that the PcrA interaction motif is located within domain 2, which also interacts with UvrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pakotiprapha et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Truglio et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, because amino acid substitutions reported to disrupt UvrA-UvrB interaction are not within the motif itself, binding of UvrA to UvrB would not necessarily preclude binding of PcrA/UvrD. Interestingly, a high scoring docking model for the interaction between the PcrA-CTD and UvrB using HADDOCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van Zundert et al., 2016</xref>) suggests that the complex is stabilised by an electrostatic interaction between UvrB E233 and the PcrA K727 residue, which is known to be critical for interaction between PcrA and RNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The docked complex shows how PcrA might be recruited to sites of damage after the damaged oligonucleotide has been nicked, as DNA near the docking site is accessible. A conservation logo for the PcrA interaction site on UvrB was created from reference proteomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The consensus sequence is highly similar to that obtained for the RNAP interaction although, interestingly, the glutamate residue shows somewhat greater variability.</p><p>Our results predict that the interaction between the PcrA C-terminal Tudor domain and UvrB is equivalent in molecular terms to its interaction with RNA polymerase. A corollary is that UvrB and RNA polymerase might be engaged in a simple competition for the Tudor domain of PcrA. To test this, we performed pulldown of RNA polymerase using PcrA as a bait and titrated the cell extract (i.e. the prey proteins) with increasing concentrations of purified recombinant UvrB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>). As expected, introduction of UvrB significantly reduced the amount of RNA polymerase that was recovered from the cell extract. As has been noted previously, other RNAP interactors also bind to the RpoB subunit via Tudor domains, including the transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd. Interestingly, using the same pulldown assay, titration of free Mfd did not diminish the yield of RNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>), despite biotinylated Mfd pulling down RNAP subunits under similar conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This suggests that, although both proteins contain Tudor domains for interaction with RNAP, PcrA, and Mfd bind at different physical locations and without competing. This is in agreement with recently-published observations for the <italic>E. coli</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kawale and Burmann, 2020</xref>), as well as the lack of protection of the expected Mfd-interacting region of RpoB (the β1 domain) that we observe in our HDX experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith and Savery, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Westblade et al., 2010</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Mfd pulls down RNAP subunits from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> cell extracts.</title><p>Proteins enriched in the biotinylated Mfd bait condition compared to the no-bait control pulldown (see Materials and methods for details).

This led us to consider the possibility that the N-terminal region of PcrA, including the helicase core, also contributes significantly to the interaction with RNA polymerase. This view is consistent with crosslinking studies of UvrD-RNAP which implicated the 1B and 2B subdomains of UvrD in interactions with the RNAP β-flap tip and the N-terminal region of the β′ subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Epshtein et al., 2014</xref>).

However, UvrD has also been shown to unwind DNA-RNA hybrids efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matson, 1989</xref>), although we are not aware of a cellular function having been ascribed to this activity. Moreover, no data is available for the enzyme’s activity on RNA duplexes. Therefore, given the apparent recruitment of PcrA close to the RNA and DNA exit channels of RNAP, we next investigated the relative helicase activity displayed by PcrA against all possible combinations of a 3′-tailed duplex that can be formed by DNA and RNA oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). PcrA was able to efficiently unwind the two substrates in which the 3′-ssDNA tail was formed from DNA, including an all-DNA duplex and a DNA-RNA hybrid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, the enzyme was unable to unwind either substrate containing a 3′-ssRNA tail (either an RNA-DNA hybrid or an RNA duplex), even at elevated concentrations. Unwinding of both the DNA duplex and the RNA-DNA hybrid was absolutely dependent on the presence of the 3′-ssDNA tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), implying that it is initiated by enzymes binding to ssDNA and moving in the 3′&gt;5′ direction. This idea was further corroborated by investigating the nucleic acid-dependence of the ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In the absence of DNA or RNA, the basal ATPase activity of PcrA was low (~1 s<sup>−1</sup>). However, it was stimulated approximately 100-fold in the presence of poly(dT) single-stranded DNA. In contrast, poly(U) single-stranded RNA had no effect on the observed ATPase activity. Similar results were obtained with short DNA and RNA oligonucleotides containing mixed base sequences (data not shown). These experiments demonstrate that PcrA helicase can efficiently unwind DNA-RNA hybrids but can only do so by ATP-dependent translocation on the DNA strand. Together with the HDX experiments localising PcrA to the RNA and DNA exit channels, we hypothesised that PcrA might act to unwind R-loops formed during transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>PcrA helicase suppresses R-loop levels in vivo</title><p>Both PcrA and UvrD have been shown to interact with RNAP and to alleviate replication-transcription conflicts (in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hawkins et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Merrikh et al., 2015</xref>). However, the precise role for this interaction remains unknown and study of the system is frustrated by the essentiality of both PcrA and RNA polymerase, making phenotypic analysis more complex. To overcome this difficulty, we first exploited a dominant negative mutant of PcrA/UvrD in which a glutamate in the Walker B motif is substituted to allow DNA and ATP binding, but not hydrolysis and concomitant DNA translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brosh and Matson, 1995</xref>). Studies in many Additional Strand Catalytic E (ASCE)-class NTPases identify this residue as the catalytic base which accepts a proton from water, thereby promoting nucleophilic attack at the γ-phosphate and enabling ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thomsen and Berger, 2008</xref>). Substitution of this glutamate residue with glutamine prevents ATP hydrolysis, trapping the enzyme in an ATP-bound or transition-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hirano and Hirano, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Soultanas et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Induction of PcrA-E224Q from an ectopic locus in otherwise wild-type cells caused severe growth defects which became most apparent as the cells entered exponential phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This defect was not apparent when wild type PcrA was expressed from the same locus and is therefore due to the E224Q mutation as opposed to the effects of overexpression per se or the elevated cellular PcrA concentration that results. Interestingly, delaying the induction of PcrA-E224Q until the onset of exponential phase (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref> for details) resulted in a much smaller effect, presumably because a lower concentration of mutant PcrA had accumulated in early exponential phase. This may suggest that the toxic effect of dysfunctional PcrA is mainly felt during rapid growth. Removal of the CTD from the dominant negative mutant did not relieve the toxicity we observed. This could indicate that PcrA-E224Q lacking the CTD can still interact weakly with RNAP (as we have discussed above) or that the toxic effect we observe arises from another role of this multifunctional enzyme that does not require the CTD. We also tested whether removal of <italic>mfd</italic> (that has been shown to counteract PcrA essentiality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moreno-Del Alamo et al., 2020</xref>]) could relieve the mutant’s toxicity but found that the deletion had no substantial effects on the growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>To test our hypothesis that PcrA unwinds R-loops, we next measured DNA-RNA hybrid levels in these PcrA overexpression strains using the S9.6 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boguslawski et al., 1986</xref>). In this experiment, genomic DNA was purified, spotted onto a dot blot membrane and probed for both DNA-RNA hybrids (S9.6) and total DNA (methylene blue staining) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The relative hybrid to DNA level was then normalised to a control experiment in which there was no gene in the ectopic expression cassette. Wild-type PcrA overexpression did not alter relative R-loop levels, whereas overexpression of the E224Q mutant led to a significant increase (~2.7 fold). This increase is comparable to the effect of deleting known R-loop suppression factors from bacterial cells such as <italic>rnhC</italic> or inhibiting <italic>rho</italic> using BCM in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Raghunathan et al., 2018</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p><p>With the aim of testing whether the interaction of PcrA with RNAP is important for R-loop regulation, we next overexpressed the CTD of WT PcrA or a CTD mutant (K727A) that does not interact with RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanders et al., 2017</xref>). Based upon in vitro TEC supershifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and ex vivo pulldown assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>), we knew that the free CTD inhibited the interaction between full length PcrA and RNAP. Therefore, we reasoned that overexpression of the CTD in cells should block endogenous wild-type PcrA from being recruited by RNAP. The relative R-loop levels in strains overexpressing the WT or mutant CTD were measured by dot-blot as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>). Overexpression of the WT CTD caused a significant increase in R-loop levels compared to WT cells or the empty expression cassette control. This increase approached the levels associated with an <italic>rnhC</italic> deletion strain. However, replacing the wild-type CTD with a CTD mutant that fails to interact with RNAP reduced R-loop levels to a value not significantly different to the strain with an empty expression cassette. This supports the idea that the activity of PcrA suppresses R-loop formation and that this effect is dependent upon the ability of the CTD Tudor domain to interact with RNAP and/or other partner proteins. Finally, to determine whether this function of PcrA is conserved in other bacteria, we compared R-loop levels in WT and Δ<italic>uvrD E. coli</italic> strains (where deletion of <italic>uvrD</italic> is not lethal). We observed that loss of UvrD caused a significant increase in R-loops levels in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D–E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The bacterial cell displays a remarkable ability to maintain genomic stability during rapid growth when many different DNA and RNA transactions occur simultaneously on the same chromosome. The UvrD-like family of helicases play a critical role at the interface of such pathways, orchestrating DNA repair as damage arises and helping to minimise conflicts that would otherwise occur between DNA replication and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dillingham, 2011</xref>). Several reports have identified physical or functional interactions between PcrA/UvrD and RNA polymerase which could underpin its emerging role in managing conflicts between transcription and replication or repair processes.</p><p>We showed here that PcrA binds tightly to a pre-formed TEC in vitro to form a complex that is stable during gel filtration, in contrast to complexes formed between free PcrA and RNAP. The complex was unaffected by removal of the upstream or downstream DNA duplex from the TEC, was still formed between the CTD (which lacks the helicase domains) and the TEC, and was not formed when a truncated form of PcrA lacking the CTD was used. These observations suggest that the increased stability associated with the PcrA:TEC complex is not simply due to the helicase being able to engage with DNA/RNA that flanks the polymerase. Instead, the RNA polymerase might adopt a conformation in the TEC that favours the recruitment of PcrA via the CTD.</p><p>HDX-MS analysis confirmed that RNAP interacted with a face of the PcrA Tudor fold that is frequently observed to form protein interactions in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Musselman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ruthenburg et al., 2007</xref>). The site for this PcrA-CTD interaction on the RNA polymerase was identified as a short peptide motif in the β subunit that sits within the SI1 domain. This is the first protein-protein interaction reported for the enigmatic SI1 domain, which is a lineage-specific insert in the β subunit whose function remains mysterious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Newing et al., 2020</xref>). This interaction site is distinct from that bound by the TC-NER factor Mfd, which also engages with the beta subunit via a Tudor domain but at the β1 domain. In agreement with this and other data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kawale and Burmann, 2020</xref>), we also found that PcrA and Mfd did not compete for RNAP in a physical interaction assay.</p><p>The short peptide motif to which PcrA binds is highly conserved within <italic>Bacillus</italic>-like SI1 domains but does not obviously align with β subunit sequences from more distantly related organisms. Indeed, because PcrA/UvrD is ubiquitous and its CTD so highly-conserved, we were initially surprised to find that the interaction with RNAP mapped to a highly variable domain. This paradox was resolved using bioinformatics, which revealed that the same motif is present widely in bacterial RNAPs, but that its positioning within the SI1 domain is different depending on the lineage. Relative to other more universal features in RpoB sequences, the interaction motif appears later in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>-like domains (which are representative of Firmicutes) than it does in <italic>E. coli</italic>-like domains (which are representative of Proteobacteria; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Note, however, that we did find examples of bacterial RpoB species for which we could find no clear helicase-interaction motif present in the SI1 domain. Our sequence searches proved rewarding as they revealed the presence of the same motif in other known PcrA-interacting proteins, including UvrB, YxaL, and YwhK. Moreover, this helicase interaction motif is also present in several poorly characterised proteins which might be previously unidentified interaction partners for PcrA. Where a structure is available, the motif always adopts a beta-hairpin with the highly conserved TGE triad protruding towards the solvent. The corollary of our observation that RNAP and UvrB employ the same structural element to recruit PcrA is that they might compete in the cell for the PcrA/UvrD helicase. This idea is supported directly by competition pulldown assays and is consistent with previous work in which the PcrA/UvrD CTD was shown to be important for interaction with both RNAP and UvrB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manelyte et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanders et al., 2017</xref>). However, the helicase interaction motif was absent from some known PcrA partners including the mismatch repair factor MutL. This is in agreement with recent work which showed that MutL binds and activates PcrA/UvrD via the 2B domain, rather than the CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ordabayev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ordabayev et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>PcrA/UvrD, along with ppGpp, has been suggested to participate in an Mfd-independent transcription-coupled DNA repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Epshtein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pani and Nudler, 2017</xref>). In this pathway, UvrD is thought to promote backtracking of RNAP stalled at bulky DNA lesions and then recruits NER factors including UvrB to repair the damage. We find here that RNAP and UvrB compete for PcrA interaction using the same conserved motif, meaning it is unclear how UvrB would be recruited to the UvrD:RNAP complex. Moreover, the role of UvrD in promoting strand-specific repair of DNA lesions remains controversial because a genome-wide analysis of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers showed no evidence for Mfd-independent TC-NER and also that the levels of ppGpp do not change the repair rate in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adebali et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adebali et al., 2017b</xref>). Our data lead us to a new hypothesis to explain why PcrA/UvrD interacts with RNA polymerase.</p><p>The HDX-MS data with full-length PcrA showed that the core helicase domains interact with multiple elements surrounding the RNA and DNA exit channels, for instance the β-flap tip and the N-terminal part of the β′ subunit, as has been shown previously by crosslinking-MS data for the complex between <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAP and UvrD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Epshtein et al., 2014</xref>). Our HDX-MS data also identified an interaction with the SI1 domain which we can assign to the PcrA CTD. The exit channels for nucleic acids are distant from the SI1 domain, but the long linker between the helicase core and the CTD is sufficiently long to accommodate both interaction patches. Interestingly, the length of this linker varies in different PcrA orthologues in a manner that reflects the distance between the RNAP exit channels and SI1 domains in each system. The precise details of the PcrA-RNAP interaction will await a high-resolution structure of the complex, but it is possible to build a speculative physical model which satisfies both our own HDX data and the crosslinking study of the <italic>E. coli</italic> system. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The involvement of the main body of the helicase in RNAP interactions may also help to explain the phenotypes associated with CTD deletion. Given the apparently key role played by the PcrA/UvrD CTD as a protein interaction hub, it is surprising that its complete removal has little effect on nucleotide excision repair or replication-transcription conflicts in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Merrikh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanders et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> where PcrA is recruited to highly transcribed regions of the genome to facilitate replication through active transcription units, the CTD seems to be dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Merrikh et al., 2015</xref>). A possible explanation lies in the fact that PcrA-RNAP association also involves the main body of the helicase including the core motor domain 2A, whose activity is largely unchanged by removal of the CTD. It is possible that residual weak interactions allow PcrA helicase core to function effectively in the absence of the CTD in vivo. However, it should also be acknowledged that stable interactions between the PcrA helicase core and RNAP cannot be detected between purified proteins (this and previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gwynn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanders et al., 2017</xref>), and consequently, we did not pursue HDX-MS experiments between these constructs. Therefore, at least in vitro, the presence of the CTD appears to facilitate binding of the core helicase domains near the RNA exit channels. Moreover, our observation of increased DNA-RNA hybrids in cells in which the free CTD is overexpressed provides a direct link between the RNAP binding function of the CTD and R-loop metabolism.</p><p>The location of the helicase core close to the RNA exit channel led us to consider roles for PcrA in manipulating the transcript. Due to the enzyme’s inability to translocate on RNA or to unwind duplex RNAs, we hypothesised that PcrA might act to unwind DNA/RNA hybrids that are formed upstream of the transcription bubble. This idea was supported by experiments in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> showing that R-loop concentration in cells was increased by two- to threefold by overexpressing dominant negative PcrA or free CTD (which blocks PcrA-RNAP interaction). This strongly suggests that an activity of wild-type PcrA, which is dependent upon interactions made by its CTD, is important for suppressing R-loops. Although out work does not establish the mechanism by which PcrA decreases R-loop levels in cells, we hypothesise that it does so by unwinding RNA-DNA hybrids that form behind the transcription elongation complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The well-documented 3′&gt;5′ polarity of PcrA/UvrD helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bird et al., 1998</xref>), together with its inability to move along RNA strands, suggests two possible working models for the unwinding of R-loops. In the first ‘co-directional’ model, the helicase translocates on the template strand and in the same direction as the RNA polymerase, unwinding R-loops as they form. Another possibility (the ‘backtracking model’) is that the helicase translocates on the non-template strand of the R-loop and in the opposite direction to transcription, indirectly unwinding the DNA/RNA hybrid by making the polymerase backtrack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Epshtein et al., 2014</xref>). In this scenario the lid domain of RNAP, rather than the helicase itself, would act as the ‘ploughshare’ to separate the two strands. We favour the first model because our HDX protection data places the 2A domain of PcrA (which is at the front of the moving helicase) in direct contact with the RNA exit region, suggesting that the helicase translocates towards the RNA polymerase. Indeed, the close contact between PcrA and RNAP suggested by our data could mean that R-loops are unwound as they are formed at the exit channels, rather than being targeted after they have extended behind the TEC. However, we also note that previous observations of UvrD-dependent backtracking of RNAP are more consistent with the second backtracking model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Epshtein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanders et al., 2017</xref>). In these models, we propose that the role of the CTD is simply to target the helicase activity to its physiological substrate in vivo (i.e. to increase the local concentration of PcrA near R-loops), rather than to catalytically activate the DNA motor protein in response to its engagement with RNAP. This view is consistent with our observation that free CTD can block R-loop suppression through dominant negative effects on wild-type PcrA, and also with previously published work in which we have observed only moderate effects of adding RNAP and/or removing the CTD on the ATPase and helicase activities of PcrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gwynn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Velankar et al., 1999</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical models for PcrA-dependent R-loop suppression during transcription.</title><p>R-loops form during transcription but lead to genomic instability and are therefore targeted for removal by PcrA.

It then engages the template DNA strand before translocating in the 3′&gt;5′ direction and directly unwinding the DNA:RNA hybrid. In this model, R-loops may be unwound as they are formed if the helicase is in close contact with the TEC. In the backtracking model, PcrA binds to the displaced (non-template) strand behind RNAP and pulls it backwards, thereby unwinding the R-loop indirectly (see main text for further details and Discussion).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68829-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig7s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Working model for the interaction between PcrA and a TEC.</title><p>The figure shows the PcrA core (homology model from PDB: 3PJR) coloured by domain organisation (red, blue, green, and yellow) as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>.

A role for PcrA in suppressing R-loops can explain its function in alleviating replication:transcription conflicts as well as why the helicase is enriched at highly transcribed rRNA and tRNA genes that have been shown to be prone to R-loop formation in yeast and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boubakri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Merrikh et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, recent work in <italic>E. coli</italic> has shown that <italic>uvrD</italic> is synthetically lethal with <italic>rnhA</italic>, in agreement with a role for this helicase in unwinding R-loops that may be distinctive from those dealt with by other R-loop suppression factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wolak et al., 2020</xref>). An R-loop suppression function might also explain why loss of PcrA leads to hyper-recombination and the formation of RecFOR- and RecA-dependent toxic recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arthur and Lloyd, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moreno-Del Alamo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Petit and Ehrlich, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Veaute et al., 2005</xref>). The displaced ssDNA within an unresolved R-loop may act as a ‘frustrated’ substrate for ssDNA gap repair, resulting in RecA recruitment and strand exchange but failing to be processed correctly into repaired products because of the presence of the R-loop and TEC. Finally, a very recent study involving depletion of PcrA in <italic>rnhB</italic>, <italic>rnhC</italic>, and <italic>dinG</italic> backgrounds led to the conclusion that PcrA alleviates replication-transcription conflicts, with biochemical analysis supporting the idea (broadly similar to that presented here) that the helicase activity of PcrA acts to unwind and remove R-loops in concert with R-loop nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moreno-Del Álamo et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain construction</title><p>All strains used in this work are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>.

Briefly, the RNA oligonucleotide was incubated with the template strand (TS) for 5 min at 45°C in buffer T (50 mM Tris pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 10 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM DTT) and cooled to room temperature at a rate of 1°C/min.

The final concentration of each component was: 118 nM TS, 236 nM RNA, 2.36 μM NTS, and 66 nM RNAP. To form the PcrA-TEC complex, the TEC was concentrated 10-fold using Amicon Ultra-0.5 3 kDa NMWL centrifugal filters and then incubated with 4.6 µM PcrA for 10 min at room temperature.

The wash and dilution buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) was supplemented with1 mM EDTA for experiments with the streptavidin beads and 20 mM imidazole for Ni-NTA beads. For the in vitro pulldown, purified β subunit was used at 2 µM concentration. For experiments that contained competitors 1.5 µM PcrA or PcrA-CTD, 1.5 µM Mfd and 3 µM UvrB were used. In vitro pulldowns were analysed by Coomassie staining the SDS-PAGE gel. Ex vivo pulldowns were analysed by western blotting using a monoclonal anti-RNAP β subunit antibody (Abcam; ab202891) or a monoclonal anti-myc antibody (Proteintech; 67447–1-Ig). In the latter experiments, a portion of the gel was excised before transfer to the blotting membrane to confirm uniform bait levels by Coomassie staining, except where this was not possible with UvrB due to its similar molecular weight to PcrA.

For the CTD-RNAP experiments, protein samples were prepared containing either or both 5 µM RNAP and 10 µM CTD. For the PcrA-RNAP experiments, samples were prepared using 0.5 μM RNAP and/or 2 μM PcrA. Thirty μl of the protein solution in sample buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4) was added to 135 μl deuterated buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate buffer in deuterated water, pD 7.4) and incubated at 4°C for 0.5, 2, 5, and 10 min. After labelling, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of sample to 100 μl quench buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate, 2 M guanidine-HCl, pH 2.2) resulting in a final pH of approximately 2.5. Fifty μl of quenched sample were loaded onto an immobilised ethylene-bridged hybrid (BEH) pepsin column (Waters Ltd.). The resulting peptides were passed through a VanGuard BEH C18 pre-column and a C18 column (Waters Ltd.) and separated by gradient elution of 0–40% MeCN (0.1% v/v formic acid) in H<sub>2</sub>O (0.3% v/v formic acid). For the CTD-RNAP experiments, quench and pepsin wash buffers were supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) DDM.</p><p>The UPLC was interfaced to the mass spectrometer via electrospray ionisation. HDMSE and dynamic range extension modes (Data Independent Analysis couple with IMS separation) were used to separate peptides by IMS prior to fragmentation in the transfer cell. Data were analysed using PLGS and DynamX software provided with the mass spectrometer. The restrictions applied for peptide identification in DynamX were the following: minimum intensity 1000, minimum products per amino acid 0.3, maximum sequence length 25, maximum ppm error 6, replication file threshold 4.

Precursors were filtered with an intensity threshold of 5000, according to charge state (to include charge states 2–7) and with monoisotopic peak determination set to peptide. Previously interrogated precursors were excluded using a dynamic window (60 s +/−10ppm). The MS2 precursors were isolated with a quadrupole isolation window of 1.2 m/z.

Peptide precursor mass tolerance was set at 10ppm, and MS/MS tolerance was set at 0.6 Da. Search criteria included oxidation of methionine (+15.995 Da), acetylation of the protein N-terminus (+42.011 Da) and Methionine loss plus acetylation of the protein N-terminus (−89.03 Da) as variable modifications and carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.021 Da) and the addition of the TMT mass tag (+229.163 Da) to peptide N-termini and lysine as fixed modifications. Searches were performed with full tryptic digestion and a maximum of two missed cleavages were allowed. The reverse database search option was enabled and all data was filtered to satisfy a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. Only the proteins with a high FDR confidence and more than one unique peptide were accepted as hits.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The resolution of R-loops that form during collisions between replication and transcription machineries is crucial for cell survival. This is exemplified by the lethality of deletion of PcrA, a helicase that appears to be involved in the resolution of such collisions. Here, the authors characterized the critical regions of PcrA/RNAP interactions and determined the function of such interactions. The manuscript's structural work is refined, elegant and leaves little room for doubt concerning the importance of the CTD PcrA-RNAP molecular interactions. This work moves the field forward in a meaningful way and unravels key aspects of PcrA/UvrD function with regards to interaction and function on RNAP. It will be of interest across the wide field of protein-DNA interactions, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Analysis of the PcrA-RNA polymerase complex reveals a helicase interaction motif and a role for PcrA/UvrD helicase in the suppression of R-loops&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Maria Spies as a Reviewing Editor and Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers found the paper technically very strong and conceptually interesting, but thought that the clearance of R-loops by PcrA was not adequately, directly demonstrated – instead the evidence is circumstantial. I.e. seeing an increase in R-loop formation with the mutant PcrA does not prove PcrA clears R-loops. The reviewers though that it will be fine to accept this as a new hypothesis that warrants future testing. This needs to be pointed out in discussion. Another point for discussion is the potential role of NTD, as the CTD interaction is clearly not the only one.</p><p>2) The reviewers would also like to bring to the authors' attention a very recently published study https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fcells10040935</p><p>While this work appeared while the authors manuscript was under review, it would be good to add to discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is one of the better papers I have reviewed all year and I have no corrections to report!

I.e. seeing an increase in R-loop formation with the mutant PcrA does not prove PcrA clears R-loops. The reviewers though that it will be fine to accept this as a new hypothesis that warrants future testing. This needs to be pointed out in discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have altered than manuscript accordingly. Although our work provides extensive new information on the PcrA:RNAP interface, and makes a clear link between PcrA activity and the steady state level of R-loops in cells, it does not show directly that PcrA unwinds co-transcriptional R-loops. That is our hypothetical model based upon three key observations; (1) the core motor domains of PcrA are close to the RNA/DNA exit channels, (2) PcrA is capable of unwinding DNA:RNA hybrids in vitro and, (3) interfering with PcrA activity in vivo leads to R-loop accumulation. We have re-written parts of the introduction (pg 4, line 31) and discussion (pg 16, line 30; pg18, line 3; pg 18, line 29) to more clearly acknowledge this, and now describe our final cartoons of the mechanism as “hypothetical models” (Figure 7 legend).

Nevertheless, the general point being made here is similar to that of reviewer 3: that we should study the interactions with the helicase core independently of the CTD domain. We specifically did not perform this HDX experiment because we already knew from published experiments that PcrA lacking the CTD does not interact with RNA polymerase in vitro. Moreover, in this work, we show that even with the TEC, an interaction with helicase core is barely detectable (Figure 1A). Thus, it appears that the interaction of the helicase core with RNAP requires the presence of the CTD, either because it is too weak alone, or because the CTD-SI1 interaction facilitates the interaction allosterically. We have added to the results (pg 11, line 12) and discussion (pg 17, line 19) to better explain these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the structural data was resounding, I was less convinced regarding the implication and impact of the biological data presented in the paper.

We showed that PcrA cannot translocate along RNA, nor can it unwind RNA duplexes and we can therefore dispense with the idea that it might act as an RNA chaperone. We also showed that PcrA can unwind DNA:RNA hybrids, which is consistent with (but we agree does not prove) R-loop unwinding activity in vivo. Moreover, the lack of translocation activity on ssRNA also limits the models for R-loop unwinding that are feasible (eg R-loop unwinding could not proceed by 3’-5’ translocation on nascent RNA, but would have to result from ssDNA translocation on either the transcribed or non-transcribed strands as per our cartoon; Figure 7). Therefore, while we agree that these results may not be that surprising <italic>per se</italic>, we think they are valuable in providing support for the model we develop for PcrA as an R-loop surveillance factor. We also agree that previous landmark papers (showing that UvrD and PcrA are important for overcoming transcription impediments to replication) might indeed have led one to speculate that PcrA can unwind R-loops. Our paper provides experimental evidence for this idea, which is just one way among many in which a SF1 helicase might conceivably suppress replication:transcription conflicts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further experiments into the role of PcrA as a resolution factor in R-Loops left me with some unclear conclusions.

In previous work (Gwynn et al., 2013) we have shown that the helicase activity of PcrA is not substantially affected by either the removal of the CTD or the presence of RNAP. Therefore, we do not imagine that formation of the CTD-RNAP interface catalytically <italic>activates</italic> the core helicase for R-loop unwinding, but rather that it helps to <italic>target</italic> the helicase to its physiological substrate in vivo. In this view, the role of the CTD is simply to increase the local concentration of PcrA near R-loops. We have clarified this in the discussion (pg 18, line 17). To test our idea, we plan to biochemically reconstitute the formation of co-transcriptional R-loops with <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> RNAP and then test the ability of PcrA with and without the CTD to resolve them. These experiments are quite complex and beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><p>The reviewer is correct to bring up the (lack of) phenotypes of the PcrA-ΔCTD mutant. We argue in the paper that this might be explained by residual interaction between the helicase core and RNAP that supports R-loop resolution, and we do provide experimental support for this assertion in the form of the HDX experiments with full length PcrA. However, we acknowledge that this argument is not entirely satisfying because, as discussed above, we know from in vitro work that this interface must be very weak. We were only able to probe the nature of this interaction by HDX in the context of full length PcrA, where it is presumably stabilised by the CTD-SI1 interaction. This complexity, in concert with the essential nature of the <italic>pcra</italic> gene, underlies our approach of using “dominant negative” interventions (i.e. helicase-dead PcrA or free CTD) in order to provoke phenotypes in vivo. We suspect that by actively blocking (rather than simply removing) the activity of PcrA, we are stabilising R-loops that would otherwise have been unwound not only by wild type PcrA, but also by other degenerate mechanisms for R-loop resolution. We have added some more discussion to the Results section (pg 17, line 19) to better explain these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, neither model proposed by the authors is reconciled by their assertion that the helicase core interacts closely with the RNA and DNA exit channels of RNAP – both models require PcrA to lag significantly behind RNAP, allowing for R-Loops to form on the template strand in between PcrA and RNAP.

These were intended to convey, in a simple manner, the idea that the R-loop could potentially be unwound in two ways, direct RNA:DNA unwinding in the same direction as transcription or by backtracking the RNAP to indirectly separate the hybrids. In the first model, the PcrA may act immediately behind the RNAP, to resolve R-loops <italic>as they are formed</italic>, and this would be consistent with close contact between the 2A domain and the exit channels as the reviewer correctly points out. Nevertheless, given that the helicase core binds weakly to the RNAP and is attached via an extended linker to the CTD-SI1 anchor point, there may also be some scope for the helicase to detach from the RNAP to unwind longer hybrids. The complete lack of structural insight into what R-loops actually look like in practice makes it difficult to be anything more than quite speculative at this stage! In the second model, the helicase would need to face “away” from the RNAP which, as we explain in the manuscript, is inconsistent with the protection of the 2A domain which is at the leading edge of the motor protein. We do not favour this model, but wanted to include it as a formal possibility because other groups (including our own) have provided evidence that PcrA/UvrD can backtrack the TEC. We have added a short section to the discussion and have modified the relevant figure legend to explain our position (pg 18, line 17; Figure 7 legend).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, while the structural component of the manuscript demonstrating the PcrA-CTD interaction with RpoB is well-rounded, a lack of information on the NTD of PcrA, as well as contradictory biological results on the capacity of PcrA to process DNA:RNA hybrids independently of RNAP leave me with a less than clear understanding of the models proposed by the authors.

Briefly, there is no contradiction between the biological results and the helicase assays. We envisage the CTD-SI1 as an anchoring interaction that targets PcrA to its physiological substrate, as opposed to a mechanism for allosteric control of unwinding activity. Experiments were not performed with the PcrA-ΔCTD construct in vitro as it does not bind to RNAP at tractable concentrations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Cytiva is now GE Healthcare.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Authors need to explain the C-protease is His-tagged to make the methods clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>The requested change has been made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For HDX methods: What were the number of technical and biological repeats performed (Masson 2017)?

After the dilution, PcrA is approximately 400 nM which is around the Kd value based on EMSA and above the K<sub>d</sub> value we have obtained previously from SPR measurements (Gwynn et al., 2013). This value was chosen because, in the absence of DNA, PcrA tends to precipitate at higher concentrations in the buffer used for HDX. Moreover, pilot experiments indicated that higher protein concentrations saturated the detector. We have clarified the number of technical repeats and also included a reference to the PRIDE database accession number for the raw data in the Methods section (pg 22, line 29).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1A: can the authors explain the multiple high MW bands in the presence of PcrA and TEC?</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t have a clear explanation for the presence of additional low occupancy bands in the EMSAs, which are most noticeable for the CTD-dependent shift.

It might reflect PcrA binding/stabilising different RNAP-TEC conformations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Does PcrA-CTD bind to a DNA/RNA hybrid? This might help the readers understand if PcrA needs to be in close association with RNAP to function, since it is not a lethal construct.</p></disp-quote><p>The PcrA-CTD does not bind to DNA (Sanders et al., 2017). However, based on the second sentence, we suspect the reviewer means to ask “does PcrA-ΔCTD bind to a hybrid”. We do not know, but expect it will both bind and unwind hybrids, because this enzyme has near wild type ATPase and helicase activity on DNA-only substrates (Velankar et al., 1999; Gwynn et al., 2013). This is related to the question of whether hybrid unwinding requires engagement of the CTD with the SI1 domain, and to our discussion (Reviewer 2, point 3) in which we distinguish between the concept of the CTD either targeting or activating the helicase. We have clarified this point in the discussion (pg17, line 19 and pg18, line 17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure S1D shows bandshifts but the shifts are not easy to see.

In fact, this gel did include a CTD-only shift which was used in Figure 1A. We now show the whole gel in Figure 1 – Supp 1D which helps one to appreciate that the labelled TEC changes position to the lower mobility associated with the CTD supershift. We also add the quantification of the amount of full length PcrA in the shifted band which is substantially reduced in the presence of free CTD. This experiment with the labelled PcrA was not repeated but supports the conclusion that full length PcrA and CTD compete for binding to RNAP, a point which is perhaps more convincingly made by data presented in the main paper using a different approach (Figure 6F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is really interesting how the PcrA CTD binding motif is found across species, but in <italic>B.Subtilis</italic> it is in a lineage specific insertion domain. Do all species with this sequence have PcrA, a cross correlation would be useful. How does UvrD fit in with this?</p></disp-quote><p>To the best of our knowledge, the PcrA/UvrD helicase is almost ubiquitous in bacterial species (Gilhooly et al., 2013). Therefore, the answer is yes; all bacteria with the interaction motif in RNAP also have a PcrA orthologue. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the positioning of the motif is slightly different but <italic>effectively</italic> within the same domain (Figure 2 – Supp 2) although that domain has been named differently, is variable between species, and is therefore considered “lineage-specific”. The implication of our work is that the function of this domain is in fact the same across species, and that the function is to bind PcrA/UvrD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 3D, Mfd does not diminish binding of RNAP: Doesn't Mfd need to be de-repressed to bind RpoB? Is there any evidence that they are binding to different locations? This is no clear evidence in this assay. There is no indication that Mfd is binding RpoB. Wouldn't it be better to titrate in the RID of Mfd? The evidence for Mfd and PcrA binding different locations on RNAP is not apparent here.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point. Our experiment is based on an underlying assumption that the free Mfd we titrate into the pulldown as a competitor is able to bind RNAP from the extract, and (originally) we showed no evidence to support this assumption. Although it is certainly expected that full length Mfd would interact with a TEC, it is perhaps not immediately clear that Mfd would bind to RNAP in the nucleic-acid depleted extracts used here. We now include (New Table 2, and new methods section) the results of an Mfd proteomics experiment in which recombinant biotinylated Mfd (as bait) pulls down <italic>Bacillus</italic> RNAP subunits from a cell extract under similar conditions. This justifies the assumption that the Mfd we added (Figure 3) was able to interact with RNAP and is therefore consistent with the idea that PcrA and Mfd bind to different sites on RNAP. Importantly however, the conclusion that Mfd and PcrA bind at different locations also arises from other results in our paper. The location for the Mfd-RNAP interaction is well-characterised structurally. Our HDX experiments show that PcrA binds to different locations on the surface of RNAP but also that there is no protection of the β1 domain to which Mfd binds based on the <italic>E. coli</italic> model. We now make these points in the Results section (page 10, line 25).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 6C would be well supported by an ATPase assay of a RNA/DNA versus dsDNA substrate. Using an ssDNA substrate does not show whether the removal of RNA is efficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t understand this point. An ATPase assay would not report on RNA removal. Instead, our helicase (strand displacement) assays show that PcrA efficiently unwinds a DNA:RNA hybrid. The ATPase assays were used as a proxy to determine whether the protein can translocate on RNA (or only on ssDNA as expected) and are informed by our current understanding of the inchworm mechanism employed by SF1 helicases. Together the data strongly suggest that the model hybrid substrate must be unwound as a result of translocation on the DNA strand coupled to strand displacement of the complementary RNA. This observed behaviour is also consistent with the well-known requirement for a 3’-overhang on the translocating strand to facilitate unwinding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Section starting &quot;Induction of PcrA-E224Q from an ectopic locus…&quot;: Please use PcrA-E224Q throughout when referring to the mutant, the use of PcrA alone was confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and have corrected the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Did the authors perform the HDX experiments on PcrA-ΔCTD without the E224Q mutant?

Isn't there a substantial entropic cost to the formation of such a long loop?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a fair point. Fundamentally, HDX-MS can report both protein interactions and conformational changes through changes in rates of H/D exchange upon protein:protein interactions. However, we think our interpretation is reasonable based on the following logic. We have HDX-data for both the CTD and full length PcrA. We know the small CTD binds tightly to RNAP alone, and the HDX shows a small region of protection in the SI1 domain which we confirm is the interaction site by mutagenesis. The HDX for full length protein shows the same interaction site at SI1 plus additional regions of protection around the DNA/RNA exit channels. These regions of HDX protection could, in principle, be caused either by allosterically-induced conformational changes, and/or by simple protection due to new protein:protein interfaces (the latter being our interpretation). For the first scenario to be exclusively true, one would have to argue that the N-terminal core region of the helicase causes conformational changes at the exit channels by binding elsewhere on the protein surface while simultaneously leaving no trace for its true physical interaction. Any putative conformational change cannot have been caused at a distance by binding of the CTD because we would then expect to see the same signals in the CTD-only data. We cannot exclude the idea that the helicase core binds near the exit channels and also causes conformational changes in this region which are partially responsible for the signals we observe. As discussed in the manuscript, our interpretation is also corroborated by crosslinking data for UvrD-RNAP from the Nudler laboratory.</p><p>Regarding the lack of a protection signal for the linker region. This reflects the fact that the linker peptides were not detected in the analysis above a quality threshold (Figure 4A; already discussed in original manuscript). We agree that there would be an entropic cost associated with the restriction of the linker into the extended position we postulate, but presumably this could be offset by binding energy. In the absence of a high-resolution structure of the PcrA-RNAP complex (which we are pursuing), the conformation adopted by the linker is still a matter of speculation. Our intention with the crude modelling shown in Figure 7 – Supp 1 was only to show that the linker was long enough to bridge the two interaction sites on RNAP we had detected by HDX-MS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) The authors need to acknowledge and cite the work from a highly-pertinent recent publication that they may have missed: https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fcells10040935</p></disp-quote><p>This is point 2 in the “Essential Revisions” section.
