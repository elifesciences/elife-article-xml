However, despite their widespread use, the neural circuitry giving rise to these signals remains unknown because the functional architecture of cortical columns producing attention-associated electric fields has not been explored. Here, we detail the laminar cortical circuitry underlying an attention-associated electric field measured over posterior regions of the brain in humans and monkeys. First, we identified visual cortical area V4 as one plausible contributor to this attention-associated electric field through inverse modeling of cranial EEG in macaque monkeys performing a visual attention task. Next, we performed laminar neurophysiological recordings on the prelunate gyrus and identified the electric-field-producing dipoles as synaptic activity in distinct cortical layers of area V4. Specifically, activation in the extragranular layers of cortex resulted in the generation of the attention-associated dipole. Feature selectivity of a given cortical column determined the overall contribution to this electric field. Columns selective for the attended feature contributed more to the electric field than columns selective for a different feature. Last, the laminar profile of synaptic activity generated by V4 was sufficient to produce an attention-associated signal measurable outside of the column. These findings suggest that the top-down recipient cortical layers produce an attention-associated electric field that can be measured extracortically with the relative contribution of each column depending upon the underlying functional architecture.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CSD</kwd><kwd>ECoG</kwd><kwd>EEG</kwd><kwd>LFP</kwd><kwd>N2pc</kwd><kwd>V4</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31EY031293</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Westerberg</surname><given-names>Jacob A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30EY008126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maier</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Woodman</surname><given-names>Geoffrey F</given-names></name><name><surname>Schall</surname><given-names>Jeffrey D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY019882</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woodman</surname><given-names>Geoffrey F</given-names></name><name><surname>Schall</surname><given-names>Jeffrey D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY008890</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schall</surname><given-names>Jeffrey D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY027402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maier</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD021771</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maier</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Woodman</surname><given-names>Geoffrey F</given-names></name><name><surname>Schall</surname><given-names>Jeffrey D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32EY007135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Westerberg</surname><given-names>Jacob A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Simultaneous sampling of electrical voltages outside the brain with neural signals in the cerebral cortex reveals how electrical currents in mosaics of cortical columns produce an electrical signal that can be measured noninvasively to assess the allocation of attention.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Research into extracortical electric fields provides fundamental insights into the mechanisms of human perception, cognition, and intention. For instance, event-related potential (ERP) components like the N2pc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eimer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Luck and Hillyard, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Woodman and Luck, 1999</xref>) and Pd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hickey et al., 2009</xref>) reliably index selective attention in humans and monkeys, alike. However, the interpretation of these extracortical measures of attention is severely limited by uncertainty about the exact neural processes that generate these signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006</xref>). Understanding what brain processes an electric field indicates requires knowing how it is generated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen, 2017</xref>).</p><p>One avenue to localize neural generators of electric fields is through inverse source localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Michel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grech et al., 2008</xref>). However, the results are indefinite and cannot offer conclusive answers. Moreover, these methods do not allow for the probing of the underlying neural circuitry. For example, most EEG signals are hypothesized to be generated by interlaminar interactions in cortical columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006</xref>). Columnar microcircuits are ubiquitous across the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Douglas et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Douglas and Martin, 1991</xref>), having a well-defined anatomical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mountcastle, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaas, 2012</xref>) and consistent physiological activation pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastos et al., 2012</xref> but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Godlove et al., 2014</xref>). The canonical cortical microcircuit offers a framework in which to interpret columnar dynamics in sensory or cognitive tasks, yet the relationship between this functional architecture and electric fields related to cognition commonly measured in humans is unexplored.</p><p>Electric fields measured at the surface of the brain (ECoG) and scalp (EEG) are theorized to be generated by dipoles in cortex. However, measuring current dipoles requires sampling electrical potentials across all the layers of the cerebral cortex. Such laminar neurophysiological measurements are rare and unsystematic in humans. Work in rodents has uncovered intriguing insights into cortical laminar microcircuits underlying evoked EEG signals, but all of these were limited to sensory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jellema et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruyns-Haylett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nass et al., 2021</xref>).

However, despite many studies linking intra- and extracortical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schroeder et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Whittingstall and Logothetis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Musall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Snyder and Smith, 2015</xref>), to date, little is known about the laminar origins of ERPs in primates.</p><p>Here, we show that visual cortex generates dipoles through layer-specific transsynaptic currents that give rise to electric fields that track the deployment of selective attention. These dipoles were generated by the extragranular compartments of cortex, indicating these cognitive operations likely arise from top-down interactions. Moreover, functional architecture â in the form of feature columns â was associated with the relative contribution of individual, local cortical columns to the global electric field. These results are the first to our knowledge to describe laminar specificity in synaptic activations contributing to the generation of electric fields associated with cognitive processing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Attention task</title><p>To investigate extracortical manifestations of attention-associated electric fields, we trained macaque monkeys to perform a visual search task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

A fourth monkey (P) performed visual search for an oddball shape (T or L) presented within an array of up to seven uniform distractors (L or T) (N sessions: monkey P, 22).

We sampled cortical neural signals during the color pop-out search to be certain of which item received the benefit of attention in the array.

Current source density (CSD) was derived from the local field potentials (LFPs) sampled across V4 layers. To relate the extracortical signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) to synaptic currents estimated as CSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâD</xref>), we employed information theory to capture multivariate factors and nonlinearities between signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shannon, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cover and Thomas, 2006</xref>). Importantly, information theory analyses are model independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Timme and Lapish, 2018</xref>). Information theory is thus superior to standard linear models since these models cannot capture all potential relationships between signals.

All cortical layers provided significant information transmission in &gt;75% of sessions during the N2pc window (150â190 ms following array onset). However, the magnitude of transmitted target information was significantly greater in L2/3 and L5/6 relative to L4 (L2/3-L4: t(29) = 2.15, p = 0.040; L5/6-L4: t(29) = 2.20, p = 0.036). The magnitude of information transmission was not significantly different between L2/3 and L5/6 (t(29) = 0.21, p = 0.84). Across sessions, the three other information theoretic analyses were consistent with the example session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, significant information transmission during the N2pc was observed in each monkey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To verify the results, we applied the information theoretic analysis over a longer interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, we found no signal differences or significant information transmission in the 100 ms pre-array baseline period as expected with baseline correction. We also evaluated the interval 200â250 ms following array presentation and found a polarization reversal in the extracortical signal likely corresponding to the Pd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cosman et al., 2018</xref>). We observe persistent current differences in the extragranular CSD during this interval sufficient to contribute to the extracortical signal. However, we observed no statistically significant information theoretic relationship between the CSD and extracortical signal during this interval. The absence of a relationship could indicate no actual association or be a consequence of the reduced trial count due to the clipping of signals at saccade initiation. This uncertainty prevents further consideration of this interval in these data.</p><p>Last, we performed two additional analyses to determine whether the observed information theoretic relationship is confounded by spurious factors. First, we measured the contribution of V4 neuron selectivity for stimulus color. We computed information transmission separately for trials with a red stimulus and with a green stimulus in the receptive field (RF). In the population average of the two calculations for each session, we observed significant information transmission during the N2pc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Hence, the relationship between V4 activity and the EEG does not depend on color specificity. Second, we measured the contribution of microsaccades, which have been linked to attentional modulation in V4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lowet et al., 2018</xref>). We computed information transmission separately for trials without microsaccades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>). In the population average of the two calculations for each session, we observed significant information transmission during the N2pc. Hence, microsaccade production was not responsible for the observed information theoretic associations between signals. The outcomes of these control analyses engender more confidence that the current dipole in V4 generated by the L2/3 CSD sink and the L5/6 CSD source contributes to the N2pc measured in the extracortical electric field.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Columnar feature selectivity influences contribution to N2pc</title><p>Given the columnar organization of color tuning of V4 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zeki, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zeki, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tootell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conway and Tsao, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kotake et al., 2009</xref>), we investigated the association between the N2pc and the CSD in columns with different color preferences. To quantify color selectivity through depth, we computed the response ratio between red and green stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

In session-wise correlations of the difference in information transmission between preferred and non-preferred colors at the time of peak information transmission (160â180 ms) as a function of columnar color selectivity index (CCSI), we found a significant relationship for L2/3 (Spearmanâs R = 0.50, p = 0.005) and L5/6 (R = 0.51, p = 0.004) but not L4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).</p><p>We also tested whether feature selective columns, on average, transmitted more information than their non-feature-selective counterparts. We found that feature selective columns, in all laminar compartments, transmitted significantly more information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) (two-sample t test: L2/3, p = 0.044; L4, p = 0.023; L5/6, p = 0.009). As such, we wanted to determine if this was due to a lack of attentional modulation in the non-selective columns. This was not the case, we observed that non-selective columns were modulated with attention. Attentional modulation was observed in both the CSD in L2/3 and L5/6 (one-sample t test: L2/3: t(64) = â6.01, p = 9.8e<sup>â8</sup>; L4: t(64) = â0.18, p = 0.86; L5/6: t(64) = 5.24, p = 1.9e<sup>â6</sup>) as well as across all layers in the population spiking activity (one-sample t test: L2/3: t(64) = 8.00, p = 3.7e<sup>â11</sup>; L4: t(64) = 9.66, p = 4.1e<sup>â14</sup>; L5/6: t(64) = 7.58, p = 1.8e<sup>â10</sup>) during the N2pc interval (averaged 150â190 ms following array onset) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we tested whether the N2pc varied across sessions with or without color-selective columns sampled. We found no difference between N2pc polarization (150â190 ms after the array) between sessions with (n = 17) or without (n = 13) sampling of color selective columns (two sample t test: t(28) = â0.75, p = 0.46). This invariance is expected because extracortical EEG spatially integrates signals from multiple cortical columns.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Translaminar currents in V4 recapitulate the N2pc</title><p>CSD is computed by differentiating between LFPs to eliminate volume-conducted signals that do not arise from local circuit activity.

We used this approach to compute an estimated extracortical ERP. Specifically, we computed the sum of currents produced by a cortical column to estimate the extracortical signal at a position directly above. The resultant potential (ERP<sub>cal</sub>) distinguished the target from a distractor in the RF throughout the N2pc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In other words, the summed potential generated by currents along V4 columns differentiates between attention conditions simultaneous with the extracortically measured attention-associated signal. Note that the shape of the observed extracortical ERP (ERP<sub>obs</sub>) differs from the estimated extracortical ERP<sub>cal</sub>. This is expected because the ERP<sub>obs</sub> reflects several more variables such as volume-conducted contributions of nearby columns as well as the filtering and attenuating effects of the tissue and cranium above the gray matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006</xref>). Moreover, the ERP<sub>cal</sub> does not reflect the potential contributions of other visual areas. Given these expected differences, it is remarkable how well the difference in ERP<sub>cal</sub> predicts the timing of the attention-associated electric field.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Comparing an estimated field potential generated from the current source density (CSD) across the cortical columns to the actually observed extracortical event-related potential (ERP).</title><p>Black lines indicate the empirically measured event-related potential (ERP<sub>obs</sub>, top), averaged across sessions.

For example, the electrocardiogram is useful in medicine because the physiological process associated with each phase of polarization is understood. Likewise, the electroretinogram is useful because the cell layers associated with each polarization are understood. In contrast, human ERP components indexing cognitive operations will have limited and only fortuitous utility until their neural generators are known.</p><p>The ERP indices of attention such as the N2pc or Pd are commonly used to assess the deployment of attention in human participants, but can also be observed in macaque monkeys, enabling systematic concurrent EEG and intracranial neurophysiological recordings. Our objective was to identify the neural generator of the attention-associated electric fields that comprise ERPs like the N2pc. Using inverse modeling of cranial surface EEG and laminar resolved CSD in a cortical area, we demonstrate that translaminar synaptic currents in visual cortical area V4 contribute to the generation of attention-associated electric fields during visual search. The dipole resulting in this electric field stemmed from layer-specific interactions in extragranular (top-down recipient) cortical layers. Unexpectedly, we discovered that the contribution of a cortical column to the overlying electric field depended on whether the visual feature in the RF matched the selectivity of the column â an important consideration in the mechanism producing EEG potentials that may not be observable through the macroscopic EEG signal alone.</p><p>The attention-associated electric field measured in our task is most likely representative of the commonly measured N2pc component of the EEG ERP. Given our findings regarding the functional architecture comprising attention-associated electric fields, it is conceivable that the N2pc arises from multiple, anatomically distinct cortical areas. That is, given the ubiquity of columnar architecture in sensory cortex and the specificity of visual feature representations to different cortical areas, electric dipoles formed across visual cortical layers could come about across multiple visual cortical areas with the relative contribution of each depending on the feature being attended to. This realization could help reconcile conflicting interpretations of the cognitive states and operations that are supposed to be indexed by the N2pc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eimer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kiss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pagano and Mazza, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Foster et al., 2020</xref>). It may also help account for variability in the N2pc as a function of attentional target presence in the lower versus upper visual hemifield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Luck et al., 1997b</xref>) given the positioning of retinotopic representations along the cortical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gattass et al., 1988</xref>) â a potential focus for future study. Moreover, contributions from areas other than V4 are plausible because previous neurophysiological studies in macaques demonstrate attentional selection signals during visual search in the temporal (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sato, 1988</xref>), parietal (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisley and Mirpour, 2019</xref>), and frontal (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Thompson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zhou and Desimone, 2011</xref>) lobes. Of particular note, neuroimaging studies in humans indicate a contribution to the N2pc from posterior parietal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hopf et al., 2000</xref>). In the same vein, FEF neurons locate the target among distractors as early as, or even before, the N2pc arises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Purcell et al., 2013</xref>). Given the interconnectivity of FEF and V4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schall et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ungerleider et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gregoriou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ninomiya et al., 2012</xref>), the frontal lobe could thus be the functional origin of an attentional selection signal communicated to V4 and other posterior areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armstrong and Moore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ekstrom et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gregoriou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gregoriou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marshall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Popov et al., 2017</xref>), which in turn generate the N2pc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Westerberg and Schall, 2021a</xref>).</p><p>Our discovery that dipoles established by synaptic currents in visual cortical columns underlie the generation of the attention-associated electric fields is consistent with the observation that ERP components such as the N2pc are largest over the occipital lobe in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luck and Hillyard, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Luck and Hillyard, 1994</xref>) and macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Woodman et al., 2007</xref>), which is also observed with MEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hopf et al., 2000</xref>). Our investigation to identify interlaminar interactions producing the N2pc has offered unexpected insights into the underlying neural circuitry. Visual cortical area V4 contains a functional map of hue along its surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tanigawa et al., 2010</xref>) with individual columns comprising the map preferring the same color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zeki, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zeki, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tootell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conway and Tsao, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kotake et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Westerberg et al., 2021b</xref>). We replicated the finding of columns specified by color-feature selectivity and discovered that the contribution of a column to the global electric field was greater for the preferred feature. Specifically, columns that preferred green (or red) contributed more to the electric field when the item in the RF was green (or red) rather than red (or green). This circuitry likely supports the decoding of visual features like color from EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sandhaeger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sutterer et al., 2021</xref>). The biophysical implications of this unexpected finding are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, which portrays how an attention-associated electric field like the N2pc can arise from mosaics of different cortical columns. While all columns with the attended target in their RF contribute to the N2pc, columns with RF enclosing a target with preferred features establishes stronger dipoles than do columns representing other features or visual field locations. If target position or feature change, then other columns contribute the strongest dipoles.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Feature mosaic hypothesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A map of preferred color in area V4 derived from optical imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tanigawa et al., 2010</xref>) with corresponding color columns in area V4.

First, the details of the attentional mechanism enacted in the cortical microcircuit and in turn manifested in the EEG remain unknown. In this study, the task design required both spatial and feature-based attention. Existing models of attention put forward hypotheses for the findings reported here. For example, multiplicative gain would predict a larger increase in response for preferred versus non-preferred stimuli when attended in the RF (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McAdams and Maunsell, 1999</xref>). Alternatively, feature similarity gain would predict that regardless of what is in the RF, red-preferring columns would increase activity and green-preferring would decrease activity when attending red and vice versa (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martinez-Trujillo and Treue, 2005</xref>). Further work should be undertaken to disentangle the contributions of spatial and feature attention to this attention-associated field generation. Second, we do not know whether the spatial shifts in the voltage distribution entailed by the mosaic hypothesis can be resolved on the human scalp due to smearing of the signals as they propagate through the skull and scalp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006</xref>). However, given decoding of features from EEG can be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sandhaeger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sutterer et al., 2021</xref>), that would suggest some spatial information is preserved. Additionally, we do not know if this observation generalizes to other cortical areas or other ERP components. However, the discovery has this general implication: A given ERP can arise from qualitatively different neural circuit configurations. This implication entails specific limits on the nature of mechanistic inferences available from ERP measures.</p><p>Other aspects of the data deserve further consideration. First, our information theoretic analyses, while yielding clear results through rigorous means, produced values that were of noticeably smaller magnitude than what has been reported in previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Optican and Richmond, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Timme and Lapish, 2018</xref>). We are not concerned about this difference because no previous study has performed these measures on the relationship between intracortical synaptic currents and extracortical electric fields, so we have no strong prior about the magnitude of information theoretic results to expect. Also, the previous information theoretic analyses have been applied most commonly to measure relationships between pairs of single units, but we are comparing mesoscopic currents with macroscopic EEG, which is likely comprised of the activity of many cortical columns beyond that being concurrently measured intracortically.</p><p>Second, the polarity of the N2pc measured concurrently with intracortical laminar activity was opposite what has been previously described in macaque monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Woodman et al., 2007</xref>). We believe this is an unfortunate consequence of differences in the referencing arrangements between the original and the present study. The previous work sampled EEG from an electrical lead embedded in the outer skull referenced to either linked ears or a frontal, extracranial electrode. We sampled EEG from LMA contact(s) outside the skull referenced to a rod supporting the LMA, which extended into the brain. As such, imbalanced measurement of the electric fields across the putative generator could lead to the inverted ERP polarity. We should also acknowledge possible differences caused by the presence of the craniotomy over the lunate gyrus. This curiosity can be resolved by sampling EEG from the cranial surface before and after a craniotomy with the alternative referencing arrangements. Regardless of the explanation, though, our findings of a strong association between V4 laminar substrates and the N2pc do not depend on the EEG polarization.</p><p>As a final note, it is important to consider what comes next for this program of research. Two avenues seem promising. In this study we are limited in that we only observed relationships between otherwise unaltered signals. While causal manipulations to neural circuits in cognitive tasks come with their own limitations (e.g., you are no longer observing the normal functioning system and consequent behavior), much could be gleaned about relative contributions from direct stimulation or inactivation of the putative circuitry generating these electric fields. In a similar vein, a biophysical modeling approach will yield more information on the relationships of attention-associated signals across scales. That is, by now knowing something about the circuit and mechanism yielding these attention-associated electric fields, we are able to use biophysically plausible computational models to gain further insight through simulations. Both approaches seem well suited to build on the findings detailed in this study. Ultimately the goal through these means and beyond should be to bridge the gap between what we know of the neurophysiology of attention at the microscopic scale to human attention-associated signals such as the N2pc.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Macaca radiata</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bonnet macaque;

Event times were assessed with a photodiode on the CRT. We used isoluminant red and green disks on a gray background (pop-out) or uniform gray Tâs and Lâs on a black background (T/L). Target feature varied within session for monkeys Ca, He, and Z. Monkey P identified the same target on any given session (T or L) but changed specific targets session to session. Trials were initiated by fixating within 1 (monkeys Ca and He) or 2 (monkeys P and Z) degrees of visual angle (dva) of a fixation dot. Time between fixation and array onset was at least 500 ms (monkey P: 500â1000 ms; Z: 500 ms; Ca and He: 750â1250 ms). For monkeys experiencing a range of fixation periods (monkeys Ca, He, P), a nonaging foreperiod function was used to determine the fixation period on a trial-by-trial basis. Arrays comprised of six (monkeys Ca and He) or eight (monkeys P and Z) items. Monkeys P and Z experienced invariable array eccentricity (10 dva) and item size (monkey P: 1.3 Ã 1.3 dva; Z: 1 Ã 1 dva). Two items were positioned on the vertical meridian, two on the horizontal, and the four remaining items equally spaced between. Monkeys Ca and He viewed items where size scaled with eccentricity at 0.3 dva per 1 dva eccentricity so that they were smaller than the average V4 RF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freeman and Simoncelli, 2011</xref>). The angular position of items relative to fixation varied session to session so that one item was positioned at the center of the RF. Items were equally spaced relative to each other and located at the same eccentricity. Each trial, one array item was different from the others. Monkeys saccaded to the oddball within 1 (monkeys Ca and He) or 2 s (monkeys P and Z) and maintained fixation within 2â5 dva of the target for more than 400 ms (monkeys Ca, He, and Z: 500 ms; monkey P: 400â800 ms). Note that monkeys Ca, P, and Z were trained to versions of their respective search tasks that included catch trials where no target was present and they were tasked to remain fixating. Monkey He did not experience catch trials. Juice reward was administered following successful completion of the trial. The target item had an equal probability of being located at any of the six or eight locations.

V4 data was collected from two monkeys (monkey Ca: left hemisphere; He: right) across 30 sessions (monkey Ca: 21; monkey He: 9) using 32-channel linear electrode arrays with 0.1 mm interelectrode spacing (Plexon) introduced through the intact dura mater each session. Recordings were conducted with the electrode in a tube-grounded, reference-grounded configuration which grounds the stainless-steel support tube of the electrode and grounds the reference of the headstage. Arrays spanned layers of V4 with a subset of electrode contacts deliberately left outside of cortex. The extracortical electric field was derived from the most superficial electrode outside the brain (above the dura mater) using the same tube-grounded, referenced-grounded configuration and filtered between 1 and 100 Hz.

Current sinks following visual stimulation first appear in the granular input layers of cortex, then ascend to the supragranular compartment. Previously described observations of laminar V4 CSD include a sink in the infragranular layers following the ascent to the supragranular layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nandy et al., 2017</xref>), an observation we do not observe in our data. This is likely because we used task-evoked CSD for alignment with stimulus presentation persisting throughout the measurement interval whereas the descending sink observation was found with very brief stimulus presentations. It is likely that the strength of the persistent supragranular sink is masking the previously reported infragranular sink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mitzdorf, 1985</xref>). We computed CSD and identified the granular input sink session-wise.

This method takes into account individual monkeyâs surface morphologies to create models of cortex surface, inner and outer skull, and skin boundaries. This model was used in conjunction with EEG to compute a voltage distribution over the cortical surface.

First, information theory analyses yield results in terms of âbitsâ which can be used to directly compare effect sizes across measurement methods (e.g., CSD, extracortical signal, and array composition [directed spatial attention]). Next, these analyses are inherently multivariate and able to capture linear and nonlinear relationships. Furthermore, information theory is model independent and does not necessitate a specific hypothetical structure in order to detect relationships between signals. This combination allows us to detect relationships between the extracortical signal and CSD signal that might not be linear and therefore would not be captured by linear models or correlation analyses. We chose to measure pairwise mutual information and information transmission to gauge the relationships between our three âsignalsâ (e.g., extracortical, CSD, and array composition [directed spatial attention]). Mutual information is the reduction in uncertainty in one variable afforded by another known variable. That is, mutual information is greater when you know the state of one variable covaries with the state of the other variable. If the two variables do not correspond well, mutual information is low. Therefore, the reduction in uncertainty is formalized as âinformationâ which is relayed in bits. Mathematically, mutual information is captured by the following equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cover and Thomas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beer and Williams, 2015</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">X</mml:mi><mml:mo>;</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Y</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">X</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">X</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Y</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where H<italic>(</italic>X<italic>)</italic> and H<italic>(</italic>X<italic>|</italic>Y<italic>)</italic> are the entropy X and X given Y, respectively.

Also, for our purposes, we set h to 0 as we assume that our observed CSD and the calculated ERP are in the same vertical plane.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Supervision, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Procedures were in accordance with National Institutes of Health Guidelines, Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol M1700067) following United States Department of Agriculture and Public Health Services policies.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72139-transrepform1-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Recording setup.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72139-supp1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="repstand1"><label>Reporting standard 1.</label><caption><title>ARRIVE checklist.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72139-repstand1-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data supporting the findings documented in this study are freely available online through Dryad at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.djh9w0w15">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.djh9w0w15</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation id="dataset1" publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Westerberg</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Schall</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Maier</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Woodman</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Schall</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2021">2021</year><data-title>Data from: Laminar microcircuitry of visual cortex producing attention-associated electric fields</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.djh9w0w15</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH through the NEI (P30EY008126, R01EY019882, R01EY008890, R01EY027402) and the Office of the Director (S10OD021771).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Chris Baker as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Steven J. Luck (Reviewer #2); Anirvan S Nandy (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Effects of attention in V4 generally start earlier (~100 ms). It is unclear why no effect is observed during earlier time periods in these data. To make better comparison with previous studies (such as Nandy et al., 2017), the authors should show the average PSTHs in supragranular, granular and infragranular layers during both target-out versus target-in conditions. Interestingly, Nandy and colleagues found largest changes in firing rates in the granular layer. To better understand the ERP outside the cortex, the authors should also show the average LFPs in the three layers, for target-in and target-out conditions. It is surprising that MI analysis reveals no significant information about the target in granular layer â given that some attentional effects are seen in upstream areas such as V1 and V2.</p><p>2. Eye position analysis: my understanding is that the animals could make a saccade as soon as the arrays were displayed. Given that the main effect of attention is observed after ~150-200 ms, the potential effect of saccade preparation could be important. There could also be small eye movements before the saccade. Given that the RFs were quite foveal for one monkey and not too far from the fixation window, and the effect of attention appears to be quite late, detailed analysis of eye position and microsaccades is needed to rule out the possibility of differences in eye movements between target in and target-out conditions influencing the results. A timeline and some analysis of eye movement patterns would be appropriate. The authors should also clearly mention the mean and SD of the saccade onset.</p><p>3. Attention studies typically keep the stimulus in the RF the same to tease out the effect of attention from stimulus selectivity. Ideally, the comparison should be between the two green (or red) in RF conditions as shown in Figure 4A. However, these results are shown only after pooling across all color selective columns. This comparison should be shown from Figure 2 itself (i.e., Figure 2C should have green in the RF and red target outside).</p><p>4. Information has been well characterized in a large number of previous studies (generally yielding values between a few bits/s, see for example, Reich et. al, 2001, JNP). Here, the absolute value of mutual information seems rather low. This may be due to the way the information is computed. A discussion about these reasons would be useful for scientists interested in information-theoretic measures.</p><p>5. Dependence on feature preference: The effect of spatial and feature attention is well studied. (A multiplicative gain model of spatial attention would predict a larger increase in firing rates and perhaps other signals such as CSD) for preferred versus non-preferred signals. Feature similarity gain model would predict the red preferring columns to increase their activity and green preferring columns to reduce their activity when the animal is attending to the feature red, irrespective of which stimulus is in the receptive field. Here, the task is a pop-out task which likely has both a spatial and feature attention component. The authors should discuss their findings in these contexts. Further, the authors should discuss whether their findings could just be a reflection of the magnitude of the change (which could be larger for preferred versus non-preferred stimulus). The information-theoretic measure should ideally not depend on the absolute magnitude, but these quantities often get biased in non-trivial ways based on the magnitude. Does information transmission depend on the magnitudes of firing rates/CSDs?</p><p>6. For columns that were not feature selective, is there an effect of attention? Does the magnitude of N2pc change depend on color selectivity? I think that should be the case based on Figure 4H and 4I, but a plot and/or some quantification would be useful.</p><p>7. The most challenging aspect of the study is to provide a solid link from the intracortical activity to the voltage on the cortical surface, and then to the monkey scalp ERPs, and finally to human ERPs. Toward that end, the present study relied entirely on correlational evidence, rather than experimental manipulations. That's quite appropriate for a first step, but it must be considered an important limitation on the conclusions that can be drawn. It would be wonderful if future research took the next step of providing experimental evidence.</p><p>8. There are also some troubling aspects of the existing evidence. The scalp ERP effect in this study, and the prior work from this group, is a positive voltage over the contralateral hemisphere, whereas in humans the voltage is negative. This may well reflect the orientation of the relevant cortical surface in monkeys versus humans. However, the voltage on the cortical surface in the present study was negative contralateral to the target, not positive. Unless this opposite voltage on the cortical surface relative to the scalp reflects something about the reference site for the cortical surface electrode, then this makes it difficult to link the intracortical effects and cortical surface effects to the scalp ERP effects. Also, the CSD was negative in the upper layers and positive in the lower layers, again suggesting that the voltage should be negative contralateral to the target on the surface. Ironically, this polarity is what would be expected from the human brain, where a contralateral negativity is observed. The oddity seems to be the contralateral positivity in the monkey scalp data. Also, the cortical surface voltage exhibits a polarity reversal at approximately 180 ms, which is not seen in the intracortical CSD. One possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the scalp voltage likely comes from multiple brain areas besides V4. If, for example, areas on the ventral surface of the occipital and temporal lobes produce stronger scalp voltages than V4 under the present conditions, the opposite orientation of these areas relative to the cortical surface would be expected to produce a positive voltage at the scalp electrodes. The manuscript notes that multiple areas probably contribute to the scalp ERPs and argues that the pattern of intracortical CSD results obtained in V4 will likely generalize to those areas. That seems quite plausible. Moreover, the results are interesting independent of their link to scalp ERPs. Thus, the present results are important even if the scalp polarity issue cannot be definitively resolved at this time.</p><p>9. There are also some significant concerns about the filters. The high-pass cutoff was high enough that it could have produced artifactual opposite polarity deflections in the data. If causal filters were applied (e.g., in hardware during the recordings), these artifactual deflections would have been after rather than before the initial deflection, possibly explaining the polarity reversal at 180 ms. If noncausal filters were applied in software, this would be a larger problem and could produce artifacts at both the beginning and end of the waveform. Moreover, the filters were different for the CSD data and the extracortical voltages, which is somewhat problematic for the information theoretic comparisons of these two data sources (but is likely to reduce rather than inflate the effects).</p><p>The filter for the intracranial recordings was listed as &quot;0.1-12kHz&quot;. Was the high pass cutoff really at 0.1 kHz (100 Hz), or was it supposed to be 0.1 Hz to 12 kHz? A cutoff at 100 Hz would make it impossible to see field potentials corresponding to the N2pc. For the extracortical electrode, the 1 Hz cutoff is still quite high. I think you'd need to show how it impacts an N2pc-like artificial waveform (e.g., one half cycle of a 5 Hz sine wave) so that the effects of the filter on the observed data can be estimated. Also, the authors might want to apply offline filters so that the same effective bandpass is used for the extracortical voltage and the intracortical CSD. (This could be shown in a supplemental figure.)</p><p>10. The method section states correctly that &quot;current sinks following visual stimulation first appear in the granular input layer of the cortex, then ascend and descend to extra granular compartments&quot;. However in the example CSDs shown in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure S3 there is no visible current sink in the infra-granular layers. Instead, the identified infra-granular layers show a prolonged current source (e.g. Figure S5B,C), which is unexpected. Can the authors comment on this discrepancy?</p><p>11. The example RF profile shown in Figure S5A, although aligned, looks a little strange in that the RFs taper off rapidly in the infra-granular layer. Is this the best representative example? It will be important to see other examples of RF alignment.</p><p>12. The study used LFP power in the gamma range to compute the response ratio between red and green stimuli. LFPs measured across the cortical depth are highly correlated, and so would gamma power estimated from the LFPs. Given this, how meaningful is the laminar analysis shown in Figure 4B? How confidently can it be established that the LFP derived gamma power estimates have laminar specificity?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72139.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Effects of attention in V4 generally start earlier (~100 ms). It is unclear why no effect is observed during earlier time periods in these data. To make better comparison with previous studies (such as Nandy et al., 2017), the authors should show the average PSTHs in supragranular, granular and infragranular layers during both target-out versus target-in conditions. Interestingly, Nandy and colleagues found largest changes in firing rates in the granular layer. To better understand the ERP outside the cortex, the authors should also show the average LFPs in the three layers, for target-in and target-out conditions. It is surprising that MI analysis reveals no significant information about the target in granular layer â given that some attentional effects are seen in upstream areas such as V1 and V2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have created a new figure showing multiunit activity and LFP across the layers in both attention conditions. It is included here for convenience. Accompanying text has been added to the Results and Discussion sections to address the reviewersâ comments.</p><p>The timing of differentiation between attended and unattended in the population spiking activity is evident in both MUA and LFP. We note that the largest magnitude difference in population spiking between attention conditions was observed in the middle layers, consistent with Nandy et al., 2017. We wish to highlight two observations.</p><p>First, with respect to the timing of attentional modulation, it should be noted that the attention task used in our study (pop-out visual search) is different from that used by Nandy et al., 2017, Neuron (cued change detection). The timing of âeffects of attentionâ vary according to stimulus properties and task demands (the number of publications demonstrating this is too long to list). Hence, we do not expect equivalence between the times we measure and times Nandy et al. measure. Nonetheless we are happy to include the requested supplementary figure with that caveat in mind.</p><p>Second, with respect to the surprising observation of a relationship between activity in the granular layer and the extracortical signal, we think it is important to remember that these information theoretic analyses are not simply correlational. That is, attentional modulation might be observed in both signals, but if the covariation of these signals trial-to-trial does not exist, then we would not expect a relationship in the mutual information analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Eye position analysis: my understanding is that the animals could make a saccade as soon as the arrays were displayed. Given that the main effect of attention is observed after ~150-200 ms, the potential effect of saccade preparation could be important. There could also be small eye movements before the saccade. Given that the RFs were quite foveal for one monkey and not too far from the fixation window, and the effect of attention appears to be quite late, detailed analysis of eye position and microsaccades is needed to rule out the possibility of differences in eye movements between target in and target-out conditions influencing the results. A timeline and some analysis of eye movement patterns would be appropriate. The authors should also clearly mention the mean and SD of the saccade onset.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a valuable observation. Saccades will influence the electrical signals, something we are quite familiar with (e.g., Godlove et al., 2011<italic>,</italic> J Neurophysiol). In an effort to combat this, we have two points worth noting. First, as was the case in the initial submission (which remains the same in the revision), we have clipped signals on a trial-by-trial basis prior to eye movements. By doing so, we cannot have an influence of the motor-related polarization of the task-demanded eye movement on the data.</p><p>Second, we have prepared a microsaccade analysis â and accompanying newly added supplementary figure included here for convenience â to determine whether they might be driving the results. To do this, we identified trials where microsaccades occurred using a well-regarded microsaccade detection algorithm (Otero-Millan et al., 2014, J Vis). We then reperformed the information theoretic analysis across sessions after removing trials where microsaccades were detected. Briefly, we found that the information theoretic relationship persists in the absence of trials where microsaccades occurred. We believe this serves as evidence that microsaccades are not responsible for the information theoretic findings.</p><p>To address the reviewerâs last point, we have included response time data (defined as the saccade onset latency) in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Attention studies typically keep the stimulus in the RF the same to tease out the effect of attention from stimulus selectivity. Ideally, the comparison should be between the two green (or red) in RF conditions as shown in Figure 4A. However, these results are shown only after pooling across all color selective columns. This comparison should be shown from Figure 2 itself (i.e., Figure 2C should have green in the RF and red target outside).</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified prior to Figure 4 that we used all trials including both colors in each of the attention conditions. That is, while the cartoon in Figure 2 shows only green-attended and red-unattended conditions, green-unattended and red-attended conditions were also included in this analysis. As the proportion of red-target and green-target trials was matched, this first analysis was designed in such a way that the influence of stimulus color should be minimized, yet all trials could still contribute to the calculation. We have included a new supplementary figure (included here for convenience) which is what we believe the reviewer requests. In this addition, we perform the information theoretic computation on only stimulus matched conditions. Briefly, we find that this approach does not seem to alter the temporal profile of information theoretic findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Information has been well characterized in a large number of previous studies (generally yielding values between a few bits/s, see for example, Reich et. al, 2001, JNP). Here, the absolute value of mutual information seems rather low. This may be due to the way the information is computed. A discussion about these reasons would be useful for scientists interested in information-theoretic measures.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the exact magnitude of our information theoretic analyses in curious. And while these methods have been widely characterized â they have not been characterized, to our knowledge, in relating intracortical laminar currents to extracortical field potentials. As such, we do not have a strong prior as to what we should expect magnitude-wise. We have expanded the discussion to note this observation and provide potential reasons as to why this might be the case. The conclusion being that further application of these methods to these datatypes is necessary to really gain a fuller sense of what should and shouldnât be expected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Dependence on feature preference: The effect of spatial and feature attention is well studied. (A multiplicative gain model of spatial attention would predict a larger increase in firing rates and perhaps other signals such as CSD) for preferred versus non-preferred signals. Feature similarity gain model would predict the red preferring columns to increase their activity and green preferring columns to reduce their activity when the animal is attending to the feature red, irrespective of which stimulus is in the receptive field. Here, the task is a pop-out task which likely has both a spatial and feature attention component. The authors should discuss their findings in these contexts. Further, the authors should discuss whether their findings could just be a reflection of the magnitude of the change (which could be larger for preferred versus non-preferred stimulus). The information-theoretic measure should ideally not depend on the absolute magnitude, but these quantities often get biased in non-trivial ways based on the magnitude. Does information transmission depend on the magnitudes of firing rates/CSDs?</p></disp-quote><p>The relationship of these findings to the specificities of attentional mechanisms and models is indeed intriguing. As the reviewer suggested, this task likely engages both spatial and feature attention â however, the design was not such that they can be disentangled wholly. We have added text to the Discussion to reflect this consideration. As for the potential influence of response magnitude changes on the information theoretic analyses â the exact parameters were chosen to mitigate concerns about magnitude. That is, we chose a uniform count binning procedure on the data which eliminates potential issues such as outliers driving relationships as well as the changes in variability associated with increases in magnitude. Moreover, the uniform count binning procedure results with states rather than magnitudes which again mitigates response-magnitude-driven effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. For columns that were not feature selective, is there an effect of attention? Does the magnitude of N2pc change depend on color selectivity? I think that should be the case based on Figure 4H and 4I, but a plot and/or some quantification would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>These questions have been addressed in a newly added supplementary figure as well as quantification in the Results. Briefly, we did find an effect of attention non-selective columns. Also, we found the magnitude of N2pc did not depend on color-selectivity of the intracortical recording. The results were reported as:</p><p>âWe also tested whether feature selective columns, on average, transmitted more information than their non-feature-selective counterparts. [â¦] This invariance is expected because extracortical EEG spatially integrates signals from multiple cortical columns.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The most challenging aspect of the study is to provide a solid link from the intracortical activity to the voltage on the cortical surface, and then to the monkey scalp ERPs, and finally to human ERPs. Toward that end, the present study relied entirely on correlational evidence, rather than experimental manipulations. That's quite appropriate for a first step, but it must be considered an important limitation on the conclusions that can be drawn. It would be wonderful if future research took the next step of providing experimental evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer noting that this manuscript is a valuable step in linking attention-associated electrophysiological signals across species. We also recognize that there is much work to be done in this domain. As requested, we have added to the Discussion the limitation of this type of study as well as what should be considered valuable next steps in this program of research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. There are also some troubling aspects of the existing evidence. The scalp ERP effect in this study, and the prior work from this group, is a positive voltage over the contralateral hemisphere, whereas in humans the voltage is negative. This may well reflect the orientation of the relevant cortical surface in monkeys versus humans. However, the voltage on the cortical surface in the present study was negative contralateral to the target, not positive. Unless this opposite voltage on the cortical surface relative to the scalp reflects something about the reference site for the cortical surface electrode, then this makes it difficult to link the intracortical effects and cortical surface effects to the scalp ERP effects. Also, the CSD was negative in the upper layers and positive in the lower layers, again suggesting that the voltage should be negative contralateral to the target on the surface. Ironically, this polarity is what would be expected from the human brain, where a contralateral negativity is observed. The oddity seems to be the contralateral positivity in the monkey scalp data. Also, the cortical surface voltage exhibits a polarity reversal at approximately 180 ms, which is not seen in the intracortical CSD. One possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the scalp voltage likely comes from multiple brain areas besides V4. If, for example, areas on the ventral surface of the occipital and temporal lobes produce stronger scalp voltages than V4 under the present conditions, the opposite orientation of these areas relative to the cortical surface would be expected to produce a positive voltage at the scalp electrodes. The manuscript notes that multiple areas probably contribute to the scalp ERPs and argues that the pattern of intracortical CSD results obtained in V4 will likely generalize to those areas. That seems quite plausible. Moreover, the results are interesting independent of their link to scalp ERPs. Thus, the present results are important even if the scalp polarity issue cannot be definitively resolved at this time.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for expressing that the results are important whether this polarity difference can be resolved. This is an interesting observation and quite important to consider carefully. First, it is worth reiterating that the referencing setup in our â10/20â monkeys was different than that for the monkeys where intracranial recordings took place. Specifically, the 10/20 recordings were more similar to our previous reports of monkey EEG (e.g., Woodman et al., 2007, PNAS; Cohen et al., 2009, J Neurophysiol; Purcell et al., 2013, J Neurophysiol). Recordings from these monkeys used either a frontal EEG electrode (approximately FpFz) or linked ears for referencing. These yielded the positive-going N2pc and contrast the negative-going N2pc found in humans. The V4 laminar recordings â and their accompanying extracortical signal â used a different referencing setup that we believe is the most likely candidate for the observed difference. Specifically, these recordings used a tied ground-reference setup which incorporated the support rod of the linear multielectrode array. This support rod extended into the brain meaning we had a neural tissue grounded signal and that the reference spanned the neural generator. Therefore, if we are not measuring both sides of the electric field across the generator equally, we can observe an inverted signal. Unfortunately, we cannot observe the 10/20 EEG distribution with an intracranial reference. Ideally, this could be resolved by an experiment where referencing setups are tested before and after performing craniotomy with a series of reference locations used to understand where exactly this flipping of polarization takes place. We have added this consideration to the Discussion and more thoroughly detailed the referencing setups in the Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. There are also some significant concerns about the filters. The high-pass cutoff was high enough that it could have produced artifactual opposite polarity deflections in the data. If causal filters were applied (e.g., in hardware during the recordings), these artifactual deflections would have been after rather than before the initial deflection, possibly explaining the polarity reversal at 180 ms. If noncausal filters were applied in software, this would be a larger problem and could produce artifacts at both the beginning and end of the waveform. Moreover, the filters were different for the CSD data and the extracortical voltages, which is somewhat problematic for the information theoretic comparisons of these two data sources (but is likely to reduce rather than inflate the effects).</p><p>The filter for the intracranial recordings was listed as &quot;0.1-12kHz&quot;. Was the high pass cutoff really at 0.1 kHz (100 Hz), or was it supposed to be 0.1 Hz to 12 kHz? A cutoff at 100 Hz would make it impossible to see field potentials corresponding to the N2pc. For the extracortical electrode, the 1 Hz cutoff is still quite high. I think you'd need to show how it impacts an N2pc-like artificial waveform (e.g., one half cycle of a 5 Hz sine wave) so that the effects of the filter on the observed data can be estimated. Also, the authors might want to apply offline filters so that the same effective bandpass is used for the extracortical voltage and the intracortical CSD. (This could be shown in a supplemental figure.)</p></disp-quote><p>In revisiting the description of the recording system and filters, we see how some information was conveyed poorly. The language describing the recording in the original submission suggested that online filters were applied to the data as it was being recorded. This was not the case. We have changed that language so that it reads as the data was being collected at a sampling frequency sufficient to observe data between 0.1 Hz and 12 kHz rather than the data being filtered between 0.1 Hz and 12 kHz. Related, the reviewer is correct on the typo regarding units. We did mean 0.1 Hz rather than 0.1 kHz; this has been corrected in the revision. Also, it appears that the description of the processing sequence regarding CSD was ambiguous in the original submission. The CSD underwent the same offline, bandpass filtering procedure (1-100 Hz) as the extracortical signal. We have clarified the Methods accordingly.</p><p>Additionally, we have conducted the filtering simulation to see how our filter choice affects a signal representative of the N2pc â as suggested by the reviewer. We have included the result as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. Using the same filtering parameters used throughout the manuscript on a 5 Hz half sine wave, we find that the filtering process modestly attenuates the frequency band and period where we expect the N2pc to exist. We have plotted the figure with similar conventions to the manuscript so that the time period and polarization component representative of the N2pc is highlighted.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72139-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The method section states correctly that &quot;current sinks following visual stimulation first appear in the granular input layer of the cortex, then ascend and descend to extra granular compartments&quot;. However in the example CSDs shown in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure S3 there is no visible current sink in the infra-granular layers. Instead, the identified infra-granular layers show a prolonged current source (e.g. Figure S5B,C), which is unexpected. Can the authors comment on this discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the Methods to reflect the observations of our data and why they may differ from previous reports. We believe the discrepancy is likely due to the stimulus conditions used to evoke the CSD profile. Specifically, the descending infragranular sink in visual cortical columns has most commonly been described when CSD was computed while monkeys view briefly presented flashes or stimuli (e.g., Schroeder et al., 1998, Cereb Cortex). However, our study uses task evoked CSD to perform the alignment. Importantly, this means there is a persistent stimulus in the receptive field. We believe this persistent stimulus, rather than a flashed stimulus, leads to a persistent, strong sink in the superficial layers of cortex which would mask any current sink present in the infragranular layers (Mitzdorf, 1985, Physiol Rev). This is an observation we made in previous reports (Task evoked CSD: Westerberg et al., 2019, J Neurophysiol vs. Flash evoked CSD: Maier et al., 2010, Front Syst Neurosci), albeit in V1 instead of V4. Given the latency offset between putative granular and supragranular sinks, that we observe receptive fields below the putative granular input sink, and the demonstrable multiunit activation as indicated by the newly included Figure S2, we have no reservations in our assessment of the position of the electrode relative to the layers across sessions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The example RF profile shown in Figure S5A, although aligned, looks a little strange in that the RFs taper off rapidly in the infra-granular layer. Is this the best representative example? It will be important to see other examples of RF alignment.</p></disp-quote><p>The attenuation observed in the lower layers is largely due to overall decreased gamma power in the lower layers of cortex as compared to upper and middle layers (Maier et al., 2010, Front Syst Neurosci). At the reviewerâs request, we have added an additional panel to the noted supplementary figure which shows additional laminar receptive field profiles using the evoked LFP so that they are more directly comparable to those shown in Nandy et al., 2017, Neuron.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The study used LFP power in the gamma range to compute the response ratio between red and green stimuli. LFPs measured across the cortical depth are highly correlated, and so would gamma power estimated from the LFPs. Given this, how meaningful is the laminar analysis shown in Figure 4B? How confidently can it be established that the LFP derived gamma power estimates have laminar specificity?</p></disp-quote><p>An astute observation â there are two aspects to consider. The existence of color-feature columns has been well-documented in V4 (e.g., Zeki, 1973, Brain Res; Zeki, 1980, Nature; Tootell et al., 2004, Cereb Cortex; Conway and Tsao, 2009, PNAS; Kotake et al., 2009, J Neurophysiol; Westerberg et al., 2021, PNAS). This manuscript did not need the evaluation of interlaminar differences in color selectivity to address the question at hand â the top of Figure 4B only serves as a step to the bottom of Figure 4B which provides the measurements used for the subsequent analyses. Thus, the estimation of color selectivity from gamma was sufficient to capture a general sense of the color selectivity of the column. Second, we recently published a manuscript which directly addresses the laminar specificity of gamma with respect to feature selectivity. Westerberg et al., 2021, PNAS uses a spatially localized form of gamma to evaluate color-feature selectivity along V4 columns. In that manuscript, we find a high degree of consistency along the layers of cortex using the gamma signal. Notably, we compared the gamma signal to the population spiking and found a high degree of coherence between selectivity in those two measures as a function of cortical depth. Given the secondary nature of the interlaminar feature selectivity to this submitted manuscript and the detailed report of laminar feature selectivity using the same dataset in another manuscript, we are inclined to leave the analysis reported here as is with adjustments to the text that note these considerations now included in the Results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
