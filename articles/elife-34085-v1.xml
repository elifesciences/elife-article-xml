Here, we present the peptidisc for their facile capture into water-soluble particles. Unlike the nanodisc, which requires scaffold proteins of different lengths and precise amounts of matching lipids, reconstitution of detergent solubilized proteins in peptidisc only requires a short amphipathic bi-helical peptide (NSP<sub>r</sub>) and no extra lipids. Multiple copies of the peptide wrap around to shield the membrane-exposed part of the target protein. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this ‘one size fits all’ method using five different membrane protein assemblies (MalFGK<sub>2</sub>, FhuA, SecYEG, OmpF, BRC) during ‘on-column’, ‘in-gel’, and ‘on-bead’ reconstitution embedded within the membrane protein purification protocol. The peptidisc method is rapid and cost-effective, and it may emerge as a universal tool for high-throughput stabilization of membrane proteins to advance modern biological studies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34085.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Surrounding every living cell is a biological membrane that is largely impermeable to water-soluble molecules. This hydrophobic (or “water-hating”) barrier preserves the contents of the cell and also regulates how the cell interacts with its environment. This latter function is critical and relies on a class of proteins that are embedded within the membrane and are also hydrophobic.</p><p>The hydrophobic nature of membrane proteins is however inconvenient for biochemical studies which usually take place in water-based solutions. Therefore, membrane proteins are under-represented in biological research compared to the water-soluble ones, even though roughly one quarter of a cell’s proteins are membrane proteins. Researchers have developed a few tricks to keep membrane proteins soluble after they have been extracted from the membrane. An old but popular technique makes use of detergents, which are chemicals with opposing hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties (hydrophilic literally means “water-loving”). However, even mild detergents can damage membrane proteins and will sometimes lead to experimental artifacts. More recent tricks to stabilize membrane proteins without detergents have been described but remain laborious, costly or difficult to perform.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, Carlson et al. developed a simple method to stabilize membrane proteins without detergent. Called the “peptidisc”, the method uses multiple copies of a unique peptide – a short sequence of the building blocks of protein – that had been redesigned to have optimal hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties. The idea was that the peptides would wrap around the hydrophobic parts of the membrane protein, and shield them from the watery solution. Indeed, when Carlson et al. mixed this peptide with five different membrane proteins from bacteria, all were perfectly soluble and functional without detergent. The ideal ratio of peptide needed to form a peptidisc around each membrane protein was reached automatically, without having to test many different conditions. This indicates that the peptidisc acts like a “one size fits all” scaffold.</p><p>The peptidisc is a new tool that will allow more researchers, including those who are not expert biochemists, to study membrane proteins. This will yield a better understanding of the structure of a cell’s membrane and how it interacts with the environment. Since the approach is both simple and easy to apply, more membrane proteins can now also be included in high-throughput searches for potential new drugs for various medical conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>peptide</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>structural biology</kwd><kwd>self-assembly</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>74525MOP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duong</surname><given-names>Franck Van Hoa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Grant 2796</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beatty</surname><given-names>J Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000233</institution-id><institution>Genome British Columbia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SOF153</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beatty</surname><given-names>J Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A simple, yet elegant method for robust self-assembly of diverse membrane proteins into soluble peptide nanoparticles for their structural and functional analysis in detergent-free solutions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Membrane proteins play essential roles, such as membrane transport, signal transduction, cell homeostasis, and energy metabolism. Despite their importance, obtaining these proteins in a stable non-aggregated state remains problematic. Membrane proteins are generally purified in detergent micelles, but these small amphipathic molecules are quite often detrimental to protein structure and activity, in addition to interfering with downstream analytical methods. This drawback has led researchers to develop detergent-free alternatives such as amphipols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Popot, 2010</xref>), SMALPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), saposin-lipoparticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frauenfeld et al., 2016</xref>), and the popular nanodisc system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bayburt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denisov et al., 2004</xref>). In the latter case, two amphipathic membrane scaffold proteins (MSPs) derived from apoA1 wrap around a small patch of lipid bilayer containing the target membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bayburt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denisov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denisov and Sligar, 2016</xref>). However, in spite of an apparent simplicity, the formation of a nanodisc depends on several factors such as lipid to protein ratio, scaffold length, nature of lipids, rate of detergent removal and overall amenability of the target for re-assembly into lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bayburt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denisov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hagn et al., 2013</xref>). The method is therefore not trivial and small deviations from optimal conditions often leads to low-efficiency reconstitution, or else liposome formation or protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bayburt et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Peptides have been considered as an alternative to scaffold proteins. Peptergents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corin et al., 2011</xref>), lipopeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tao et al., 2013</xref>), nanostructured [beta]-sheet peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Privé, 2009</xref>), and bi-helical derivatives of the ApoA1-mimetic 18A peptide, termed ‘beltides’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larsen et al., 2016</xref>), have been reported in the recent years. Yet, these systems have not been widely adopted for structural or functional characterization of membrane proteins for various reasons. Peptergents and lipopeptides can solubilize membrane proteins directly from a lipid bilayer, but same as detergent these peptides form mixed micelles that readily aggregate and precipitate below a certain critical micellar concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tao et al., 2013</xref>). Beltides were shown to trap bacteriorhodopsin in solution, but the method required prior incubation with specific amounts of lipids and the particles formed were reportedly unstable at physiological temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larsen et al., 2016</xref>). Cost and complexity of the peptide can also be problematic. Nanostructured [beta]-sheet peptides contain extended alkyl chains covalently linked to glycine residues, while lipopeptides need to be covalently linked to a lipid molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Privé, 2009</xref>). These hydrophobic peptides are also difficult to work with given their low solubility. Peptergents require titration of base to become soluble in aqueous solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corin et al., 2011</xref>), and [beta]-sheet peptides can form extended filament clusters without detergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Privé, 2009</xref>). Thus, a peptide-based reconstitution method that is cost-effective, rapid, unhindered by issues of solubility and generally applicable to membrane proteins remains to be developped.</p><p>We present the peptidisc. The peptidisc is made by multiple copies of an amphipathic bi-helical peptide (hereafter termed NSP<sub>r</sub>) wrapping around its target membrane protein. In contrast to the nanodisc, no additional lipids are necessary during reconstitution, except those that have co-purified with the protein (i.e. annular lipids). The peptide design we employ is a reverse version of the original nanodisc scaffold peptide (NSP), which consists of two repeats of the ApoA1-derived 18A peptide joined by a flexible linker proline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kariyazono et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 1985</xref>), in addition to two leucine residues which are substituted by phenylalanines to increase lipid affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kariyazono et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mishra et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The original NSP can stabilize lipid particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kariyazono et al., 2016</xref>), but issues of water-solubility and adaptability to membrane proteins were not demonstrated. We show here the NSP<sub>r</sub> design is very effective for stabilizing both α-helical and β-barrel membrane proteins of different size, topology, and complexity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The original NSP is able to capture lipids from a lipid bilayer and forms discoidal particles of varying size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kariyazono et al., 2016</xref>). However, due to its hydrophobicity, the NSP peptide is difficult to solubilize; the solution is cloudy after resuspension in water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To increase peptide solubility, we reversed the amino acid sequence of NSP, so that the two amphipathic helices have a slightly altered orientation, leading to a lower hydrophobic moment and higher overall electropotential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AC</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We also forewent acetylation and amidation of the peptide termini so that modifications such biotinylation remain possible. These small modifications allowed the final design (termed NSP<sub>r</sub>) to be fully dissolved in water at concentrations up to 25 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34085.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Solubility test of NSP and NSP<sub>r</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Peptide models computed by the 3D-hydrophobic moment peptide calculator.

The NSP<sub>r</sub> peptide was mixed with MalFGK<sub>2</sub> in dodecyl maltoside and the mixture applied immediately onto a size exclusion column equilibrated in a detergent-free buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The collected particles (hereafter termed peptidisc or MalFGK<sub>2</sub>-NSP<sub>r</sub>) were soluble and monodisperse, as shown by clear-native CN-PAGE and blue-native BN-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We determined the approximate peptide content using SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Also, since annular lipids are tightly bound to membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bechara et al., 2015</xref>), we determined the final lipid content in the peptidisc using thin layer chromatography and photocolorimetric methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). This analysis indicated a stoichiometry of 10 ± 2 peptides and 41 ± 10 lipids per MalFGK<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This stoichiometry allowed us to calculate the mass of the MalFGK<sub>2</sub> peptidisc to 251 ± 12 kDa (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, the lipids identified in the TLC analysis were predominantly negative phospholipids, cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These lipids play a role in regulation of MalFGK<sub>2</sub> by stabilizing interactions with the regulatory protein EIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao and Duong, 2013</xref>). To corroborate the peptide and lipid stoichiometry, we determined the molecular weight of the intact complex by native mass spectrometry (247 ± 24 kDa; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>), and size exclusion chromatography coupled multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) (250 ± 17 kDa; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The SEC-MALS analysis showed that the peptidisc remains perfectly stable during storage (e.g. 3 days at 4°C). We then examined the particles by single particle negative-stain electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The 2D-class averages revealed a structure very similar to MalFGK<sub>2</sub> in nanodiscs, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fabre et al., 2017</xref>) with distinctly visible elements such as the MalK<sub>2</sub> dimer, the periplasmic P2 loop and a larger discoidal density corresponding to the NSP<sub>r</sub> peptides wrapping around the MalFG membrane domain. The measured diameter of the peptidisc was 11.7 ± 1.4 nm, which is consistent with a stoichiometry of 12 ± 2 peptides per MalFGK<sub>2</sub> complex when arranged in the double-belt model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Finally, the ATPase activity of MalFGK<sub>2</sub> in peptidisc was similar to that reported in proteoliposomes and in nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao and Duong, 2012</xref>), in sharp contrast to the high and unregulated ATPase activity observed in detergent micelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Importantly, the structural integrity of the peptidisc remained stable at elevated temperatures, with ~80% of MalFGK<sub>2</sub> peptidisc intact after incubation for 3 hr at 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34085.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The ‘on-column’ reconstitution of MalFGK<sub>2</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Typical size-exclusion chromatography of MalFGK<sub>2</sub> in peptidisc (MalFGK<sub>2</sub>-NSP<sub>r</sub>) using the ‘on-column’ method.

Small amounts of peptides (0–2.5 µg) were mixed with the target protein (~1.25 µg) in detergent solution, and the resulting mixture immediately loaded on native gel. In that case, removal of the non-ionic detergent occurs during electrophoresis when the protein-peptide mixture enters the detergent-free part of the gel. At the correct NSP ratio, the target membrane protein does not aggregate at the top of the gel but instead migrates in a soluble form to its expected molecular weight position. This simple method allowed us to estimate the effective NSP concentrations required to trap four different integral membrane complexes into a peptidisc: MalFGK<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), FhuA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), the trimeric OmpF porin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), and the membrane translocon SecYEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). These membrane proteins were generally reconstituted at similar peptide concentrations, with a half-maximal molar ratio (RR50) of 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>). This is significantly higher than the measured stoichiometry of ~10 peptides per protein complex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that excess peptide is needed to achieve efficient assembly. This analysis also showed that the SecYEG complex can be trapped as a dimer and higher order oligomeric form in peptidisc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), probably due to the self-association of this complex in detergent solution, as shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bessonneau et al., 2002</xref>).

From these results, it appears more important to remove detergents than include lipids to increase thermal tolerance of the BRC.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Detergents remain the most effective way to extract and purify membrane proteins, yet these surfactants have many undesired effects on protein stability and downstream biochemical analysis. To circumvent these difficulties, and to handle these proteins like their water-soluble counterparts, membrane proteins are more often reconstituted with amphipathic scaffolds. However, current methods of reconstitution are difficult because each scaffold system has specific properties and limitations, and each requires substantial optimization. The aim of our work was to develop a ‘one-size fits all’ method to streamline the capture of membrane proteins in detergent-free solution.</p><p>We show that the peptidisc is a simple and efficient way to replace detergent. The system works with membrane proteins of different size, fold and complexity, and does not require addition of exogenous lipids. The peptidisc captures membrane proteins regardless of their initial lipid content, and therefore the use of exogenous lipids to match the diameter of the scaffold such as in the nanodisc system is avoided. Since the binding of the peptide is essentially guided by the size and shape of the protein template, the peptide stoichiometry is also self-determined. As a direct consequence, the preparation of peptidisc is possible through rapid detergent removal techniques such as ‘in-gel’, ‘on-column’ and ‘on-bead’ methods. Each of these methods has considerable advantages compared to overnight dialysis and ‘biobeads’ techniques traditionally used for scaffold reconstitution. The ‘in-gel’ method is fast, high throughput and requires only 1–2 µg of the precious target protein in order to identify the optimal peptide ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The ‘on-column’ method allows direct preparation of large quantities of peptidiscs with simultaneous removal of salts, detergent and excess peptides. However, gel filtration requires concentrated protein samples and unbound peptide is wasted. The ‘on-bead’ method is therefore ideal for the peptidisc reconstitution because protein purification, detergent removal, trapping in peptidisc and recovering of unbound peptide are carried out simultaneously in the same tube. Additionally, because long exposure or storage of the protein in detergent is avoided, the ‘on-bead’ method can be especially advantageous in the case of unstable membrane proteins.</p><p>Beside these methodological considerations, we show that the peptidisc maintain proteins in a functional state. For instance, both FhuA and MalFGK<sub>2</sub> retain their ability to interact with their soluble binding partners. In contrast to the detergent, the ATPase activity of MalFGK<sub>2</sub> in peptidisc regains dependence to substrate and maltose-binding protein MalE, indicating a return to the transporter’s native membrane conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao and Duong, 2012</xref>). Negative-stain electron microscopy of MalFGK<sub>2</sub> shows good resolution for the periplasmic P2 loop and cytosolic ABC domains, whereas the transmembrane domains MalFG are surrounded by an extra density corresponding to the peptide belt and naturally present lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Lipid quantitation indeed indicates that ~ 40 lipids molecules, mostly acidic, are captured with MalFGK<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In the case of the BRC complex however, there must be direct protein-peptide contact because almost no lipids are detected in the final assembly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Despite the absence of lipids, the thermal stability of the BRC in peptidisc is still much higher than in detergent, with a melting temperature similar to that observed proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Clearly, the peptidisc is more than a simple surrogate of the detergent molecules; the peptide assembly forms an environment that stabilize and support the transmembrane domains of a membrane protein from aqueous solution.</p><p>The peptidisc offers distinct advantages when compared to other amphipathic scaffolds. Unlike beltides, peptergents, lipopeptides, and nanostructured [beta]-sheet peptides, the NSP<sub>r</sub> does not require modifications at its N- or C-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Privé, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larsen et al., 2016</xref>). Both ends of NSP<sub>r</sub> remain available for modifications, such as biotinylation, which we show does not affect peptidisc assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, peptergents and lipopeptides have critical micelle concentrations and dynamically exchange in solution. Because of this instability, an excess of these peptides is always needed to keep membrane proteins in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McGregor et al., 2003</xref>). This is not the case for the peptidisc because NSP<sub>r</sub> binds strongly to its target, allowing free peptides to be removed without compromising peptidisc stability. The length of the NSP<sub>r</sub> also does not need to be adjusted to the diameter of the target protein. This property may be especially advantageous when capturing macromolecular membrane protein complexes or proteins that exist in oligomeric state, as is the case with the SecYEG complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Lastly, the NSP<sub>r</sub> is synthetically made and can be obtained in large quantity, high purity and free of immunogens usually found in recombinant cell expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwarz et al., 2014</xref>). The structural homogeneity of NSP<sub>r</sub> is also high compared to other synthetic scaffolds, such as amphipols and styrene-maleic acids (SMA). This is because peptide synthesis is sequential, whereas addition of carboxylate and other repeating units in amphipols and industrially prepared SMA polymers is randomly distributed along the polymer chain during assembly. Due to the ‘one-pot’ synthesis, these synthetic polymer preparations are often polydisperse mixtures of different lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Popot, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). This compositional heterogeneity can be problematic for functional and structural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deller et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, due to both positive and negative charged amino acids, the solubility of the NSP<sub>r</sub> remains high at various pH or with divalent cations. Both these conditions can destabilize assemblies formed by synthetic polymers because they largely depend on charged carboxylate groups for solubility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Popot, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gulati et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>How exactly the peptidisc wraps around the membrane protein template remains an important question. In ApoA1 lipid nanodiscs, the two scaffold proteins arrange themselves in an anti-parallel ‘double belt’ configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bibow et al., 2017</xref>). If NSP<sub>r</sub> were also arranged in a double belt, then the peptide to protein ratio would expectedly vary by factor of 2, as an odd number of scaffold would leave part of the protein exposed to the environment. However, the native mass spectrometry profiles for FhuA and BRC indicate peptidisc populations which can differ in mass by one peptide only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and F</xref>), suggesting an arrangement that is flexible. Possibly, the NSP<sub>r</sub> could be arranged in an orthogonal ‘picket fence’ orientation as proposed for lipopeptides, nanostructured [beta]-sheet peptides, and single helix ApoA1 mimetic peptides.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Privé, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Islam et al., 2018</xref>). However, the length of NSP<sub>r</sub> (37 amino acids) is too long to be orthogonal while maintaining contact with hydrophobic parts of the protein or alkyl chains of annular lipids. Thus, the NSP<sub>r</sub> perhaps simply lies in a tilted orientation. A tilted orientation would facilitate optimal binding and stoichiometry as the peptide shifts in angle of association, adapting to best fit the target membrane protein template.</p><p>In conclusion, the peptidisc offers several advantages. The method is cheap, fast and seamlessly integrated in existing protein purification protocols, such as size exclusion and affinity chromatography. The peptide is relatively simple to synthesize and it can be recycled via the ‘on-bead’ method to decrease consumption. The peptidisc is not hindered by issue of buffer instability or heterogeneity as observed with other synthetic scaffold. Since the peptide self-associates to its template and without added lipids, this could be advantageous for structural studies which are affected by compositional heterogeneity. There are of course applications where other scaffold systems are better suited, such as direct protein solubilization with SMA polymers, or control over lipid environment offered by nanodiscs. Nevertheless, the current advantages of the peptidisc surely diminish the challenges associated with biochemical, structural and pharmacological characterization of purified membrane proteins. The peptidisc may emerge as a very practical way to analyse or exploit membrane proteins in a detergent-free environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Biological reagents</title><p>Tryptone, yeast extract, NaCl, imidazole, Tris-base, acrylamide 40%, bis-acrylamide 2% and TEMED were obtained from Bioshop, Canada.

repeated in triplicate on three different gels. We note that detergent-purified FhuA co-purified with a contaminant, thought to be short chain lipopolysaccharides, that migrated to the same position as NSP<sub>r</sub>, therefore FhuA was reconstituted using NSP<sub>r</sub> labelled with a biotin group (NSP<sub>rbio</sub>). To quantify NSP<sub>rbio</sub>, western blots were incubated with streptavidin conjugated to Alexafluor 680 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), followed by several washes in PBS + 0.1% Tween. Western blots were imaged on a LICOR Odyssey scanner fluorescence (excitation 680 nm, emission 700 nm), and the bands corresponding to NSP<sub>rbio</sub> quantified in Image J.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Lipid extraction and quantification</title><p>The MaFGK<sub>2</sub> and BRC peptidiscs were prepared on-bead, and the FhuA peptidisc was prepared on-column. MalFGK<sub>2</sub> (40 µg), FhuA (40 µg), and BRC (80 µg) peptidiscs were diluted to a final volume of 200 µL of Buffer A, then mixed with 800 µL of a 2:1 solution of methanol:chloroform for 10 min at 25°C in glass screw cap vials. 200 µL of chloroform and 200 µL of distilled water were added sequentially, vortexed briefly, and the resulting two phase system separated by low-speed centrifugation (3000 r.p.m., 10 min). The organic phase was dried under nitrogen, and stored at −20°C. Total phosphate content was determined by a modified version of the malachite green assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lanzetta et al., 1979</xref>). Malachite green reagent was prepared as follows: ammonium molybdate (4.2 g) was dissolved in 100 mL of 4M HCl, then mixed with 300 mL malachite green (135 mg) dissolved in distilled water. The solution was mixed for 1 hr at 4°C, filtered, and stored at 4°C before use. Dried lipid extracts were subsequently incubated with 1 mL of 70% perchloric acid for 3 hr at 130°C, and then 20 µL of the resulting solution mixed with 500 µL of the malachite green reagent for 5 min at room temperature before absorbance measurement at 660 nm. Phosphate standards (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) were diluted into perchloric acid and used to prepare a standard curve with phosphate concentrations ranging from 0.01 nmol to 1 nmol PO<sub>4</sub>. For thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis, dried lipids were resuspended in 30 µL of chloroform, and 10 µL were dotted onto a TLC Silica gel 60 (Millipore). The TLC was developed in a solution of 35:25:3:28 chlorofrom:triethylamine:<sub>d</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O:ethanol. Plates were dried in an oven for 5 min at 150°C. Lipids were visualized by lightly wetting plates in a solution of 10% Cu<sub>2</sub>S0<sub>4</sub> in 8.5% phosphoric acid, followed by heating for 5 min at 150°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Other methods</title><p>The MalFGK<sub>2</sub> ATPase activity was determined by monitoring the release of inorganic phosphate using the malachite green method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lanzetta et al., 1979</xref>). Protein and peptide concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prehna et al., 2012</xref>). SMA polymer containing 2:1 styrene to maleic acid ratio was prepared following the procedure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dörr et al. (2014)</xref>. In brief, 10% of SMA 2000 (Cray Valley), was refluxed for 3 hr at 80°C in 1M KOH, resulting in complete solubilization of the polymer. Polymer was then precipitated by dropwise addition of 6M HCl accompanied by stirring and pelleted by centrifugation (1500 x g for 5 min). The pellet was then washed 3 times with 50 mL of 25 mM HCl, followed by a third wash in ultrapure water and subsequent lyophilization. Lyophilized SMA was later re-suspended at 10% wt/vol in 25 mM Tris-HCl, and the pH of the solution adjusted to 8 with 1M NaOH. Peptide hydrophobic moment and electropotential was calculated using the 3D-HM calculator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reißer et al., 2014</xref>). Sequences corresponding to NSP or NSP<sub>r</sub> were calculated with the C-terminus specified as (COO<sup>-</sup>) and N-terminus specified as (NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>). UV absorbance of solubilized peptides was measured by Nanodrop.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by operating grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (74525MOP to FD), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Discovery Grant 2796 to JTB), and Genome British Columbia (SOF153 to JTB).</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Has opened a website to distribute peptides to the academic community, registered the Peptidisc term and filed a provisional patent via the University of British Columbia.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing, Conceived the study, Contributed to discussion and writing, Performed light scattering experiments, Did all sample preparation and data analysis unless otherwise stated</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing—review and editing, Prepared detergent purified SecEYG, Conceived the study, Contributed to discussion and writing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing—original draft, Prepared and analyzed electron microscopy data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Data curation, Investigation, Writing—review and editing, Performed BRC stability experiments</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing—original draft, Performed and analyzed intact native MS experiments</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Prepared samples for analysis by mass spectrometry</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation, Performed peptide titrations, Analyzed and presented the data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation, Prepared detergent purified OmpF</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34085.017</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Amphipathic scaffolds used in this study.</title><p>The length of the scaffold proteins was calculated by multiplying the number of amino acids (aa) by 1.5 Å, which is the rise given by an amino acid structured in an alpha-helix.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Volker Dötsch (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Markus A Seeger (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While all reviewers see the potential usefulness and impact of the peptidiscs it seems that the use of peptides to solubilize membrane proteins has been proposed and implemented before. As you will see in the individual reviews the lack of comparison to these existing methods has been criticized. In addition, a more detailed analysis of how the peptides achieve solubilization is lacking in comparison to published peptide based methods. And finally, a real proof that peptidiscs are superior to existing methods for structure determination as claimed would have been beneficial. Overall, the manuscript describes a very interesting alternative to existing methods to solubilize membrane proteins, it seems however less evident that the method will provide a major breakthrough.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Carlson et al. describe a peptide based system that keeps membrane proteins soluble with tightly attached lipid molecules. In contrast to the well-established nanodisc system this system is based on a variable number of peptides that surround the membrane protein and stabilize it. No addition of lipids is necessary and the high flexibility of the system does not make the engineering of differently long peptides as scaffolds necessary. They show with five different membrane proteins that they can be stably solubilized in these discs and provide a very careful assessment of the peptide/protein/lipid composition of these discs. They also show that these discs can be formed in several different ways starting with detergent solubilized membrane proteins.</p><p>This is an interesting system that can provide an attractive alternative to the existing hydrophobic systems to solubilize membrane proteins. The study is well documented and carefully performed.</p><p>1) The proteins used are relatively large membrane protein complexes or b-barrel proteins that are stable even in detergent micelles. For those membrane proteins the peptidisc will be a good alternative. However, for membrane proteins that are not stable in detergent micelles, are expressed cell-free or resolubilized from inclusion bodies it is not clear if they can be stabilized with these discs. A GPCR or a transporter would have been good alternatives.</p><p>2) One of the advantages over nanodiscs that the authors advertise is that the peptidiscs can be used for structural investigations. It would have been good to show for example an NMR spectrum of a membrane protein in such a peptidisc and to show that this is advantages relative to larger nanodiscs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Carlson et al. includes a considerable amount of data on five different membrane proteins solubilized into bi-helical peptides. This is combined with three reconstitution methods to transfer proteins into peptidiscs on columns, beads or gels. As such, it potentially provides a useful methodological advance and benchmark within the rapidly developing field of preparation and analysis of membrane proteins in nanometer sized discs.</p><p>However, there are overstatements and lack of clarity of key points that need to be addressed.</p><p>The Abstract states that &quot;the peptidisc just requires a short amphipathic bi-helical peptide (NSP) and no extra lipids&quot;. However, the proteins are initially prepared using detergents and are expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Hence recombinant expression in for e.g. <italic>E. coli</italic> and detergent appear to be also required.</p><p>The authors go on to say that &quot;This drawback has led researchers to develop detergent-free alternatives such as amphipols,[Popot, 2010] SMALPs,[Lee et al., 2016] saposin-lipoparticles[Frauenfeld et al., 2016] and the popular nanodisc system.[Bayburt, Grinkova and Sligar, 2004; Denisov et al., 2004]&quot; Again, some of these methods also require detergent to be added. This is a distinction that needs to be clarified. The statement &quot;We present here the peptidisc as a simple assembly method to support membrane protein in detergent-free solution&quot; similarly needs to be corrected as it is not clear that the methods are simple or detergent-free. The concluding statement in the Introduction that &quot;we show that the NSP peptide may well be the universal scaffold for stabilizing both α-helical and β-barrel membrane proteins of different size, topology, and complexity&quot; and following the discussion that &quot;These advantages combined suggest that the peptidisc should diminish the challenges associated with biochemical, structural and pharmacological characterization of membrane proteins, making the peptidisc an efficient and perhaps universal tool for stabilizing these proteins in membrane- and detergent-free solution&quot; are overstated. For this to be a useful paper, the authors need to indicate the limitations of the method. In the Materials and methods used for on column peptidisc reconstitution detergents such as LDAO are used. Doesn't the peptide itself denature in such detergents, and would this not limit the effectiveness of this reagent?</p><p>The yield, purity and activity should be given quantitatively for each protein in a peptidisc vs. in detergent alone, and ideally also vs. in a liposome. This would allow the method to be objectively compared. Do the proposed methods not require detergent that could strip away natively bound lipids and destabilize membrane proteins? Is this not a limitation? Ideally assays should be given across a temperature range to ensure that folded protein is being measured for activity.</p><p>The identities of bound lipids should also be stated, rather than non-specific statements about lipid content like &quot;Also, because lipids (i.e. annular lipids) can remain tightly bound to membrane proteins during purification [Bechara et al., 2015], we also determined the lipid content by thin layer chromatography and photocolorimetric methods&quot; and &quot;Following the same approach applied to MalFGK<sub>2</sub> above, we quantified the individual peptide and lipid components of the FhuA peptidisc (Figure 3B and A), resulting in an average of 8 ± 3 phospholipids and 10 ± 2 NSP per FhuA peptidisc&quot;. The low number of lipid molecules present (4 and 8 in the cases of BRC and FhuA) indicates that only the most tightly bound lipids remain in the peptidisc, and that a disc shape cannot be assumed.</p><p>The presence of an apparently non-physiological multimer (Sec(EYG)n) in Figure 2D is glossed over. This needs to be explained as it indicates that use of NSP is leading to potentially artefactual multimeric states.</p><p>In Figure 2F, why do proteins with different molecular weight share the same RR50? Would one not expect to see a higher number of peptides interacting with larger assembly or with different membranes or cell types? The authors didn't explain their perspective on this, nor is it clear how this was optimized, despite being a significant cost and determinant of success of the method. A recommended molar concentration of peptide for reconstitution should be indicated and justified.</p><p>The description of the peptide being like a belt around the protein and of the disc shape of peptidiscs needs to be justified with experimental data and/or references. There is one set of negative stain EM data of MalFGK<sub>2</sub> in peptidiscs showing the presence of a number of pairs and triplets of discs. Is this not significant and indicative of disc-disc interactions, perhaps mediated by NSP peptides? If so shouldn't lower peptide concentrations be used to minimize such stacks in biophysical assays? Also, the scale bar in the bottom panel of Figure 1C appears to indicate 50 (not 5) Å. If so this is inconsistent.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Carlson et al. describes a protocol for membrane protein stabilization using an amphiphilic 37 amino acid peptide called nanodisc scaffold protein (NSP) to result in a peptidisc, which corresponds to the membrane protein surrounded by NSP and annular lipids. The method is applied and validated by reconstituting an ABC importer (maltose transporter), two outer membrane proteins, SecEYG and a bacterial reaction center (BRC). The ratio between protein and NSP peptide as well as the number of bound phospholipids was determined using a set of different biophysical methods. The ATPase activity of the maltose transporter embedded in a peptidisc was found to be strongly coupled to the presence of the maltose binding protein MalE, which is a hallmark of samples reconstituted in proteoliposomes or nanodiscs, whereas very poor coupling is observed in detergent solution. For BRC, the peptidisc was shown to stabilize the membrane protein as compared to the (rather harsh) detergent LDAO.</p><p>The peptidisc is proposed in the manuscript to be equivalent to other membrane reconstitution methods such as the widely used nanodisc system and the classical proteoliposomes with regard to conformational coupling (shown for the maltose transporter) as well as membrane protein stabilization. On the other hand, the NSP peptide is used as a surrogate for a detergent, i.e. it is very simple to use and just needs to be added to a solubilized membrane protein to replace the initial detergent as is often done with short chain detergents replacing for example DDM, which is widely used to solubilize membrane proteins.</p><p>The manuscript appears solid with regard to the biophysical analyses of the peptidisc complexes and their content of NSP peptides and annular lipids. Nevertheless, I am a bit skeptical whether a peptidisc represents a reconstitution in the classical sense, because the NSP peptides directly interact with the transmembrane helices (driven by hydrophobic protein-protein interactions mediated by amino acid side chains) instead of lipids via their aliphatic fatty acid chains. Nevertheless, the method (although not being a novel concept at as outlined below) seems to be rather easy and versatile in its application.</p><p>1) As a potential future user (and a current user of the nanodisc method), it is critical to know how expensive the synthesis (or any alternative preparation) of the NSP peptide is. I assume it is more expensive than detergents, but in contrast to the MSP protein used for nanodiscs, it might be less expensive. Along the same lines, the authors stated that the purity of their chemically synthetized NSP peptide was &quot;more than 80%&quot;. Is this sufficient? What are the impurities. Is this rather low purity linked to the price of the synthesis?</p><p>2) How aggregation-prone are peptidiscs? The authors hypothesize that the NSP peptides build a regular belt around the membrane protein, akin to the MSP belt. But is this really feasible? It is clear that the peptides arrange such that the hydrophobic parts of the membrane protein are covered by its hydrophobic side, while the hydrophilic face of the peptides remains exposed to the solvent. But this process is likely to be stochastic in the sense that there remain hydrophobic gaps on the membrane protein surface, as well as on some of the not perfectly placed NSP peptides. These remaining hydrophobic surfaces would then serve as nucleation points for protein aggregation. Remaining detergent molecules originating from the solubilization and purification of the membrane protein may shield these remaining hydrophobic surfaces.</p><p>3) Related to the above comment: Do peptidiscs still contain detergents? It is well known that quantitative detergent exchange is not a trivial endeavor. Often the initial detergent used to solubilize the membrane protein remains present to some degree. The authors need to show, whether in the peptidiscs there are still some detergents remaining (next to annular lipids and the NSP peptide).</p><p>4) How big is the NSP belt compared to detergent belts of different sizes? This question is highly relevant for membrane protein crystallization. The peptidisc appears more compact than a nanodisc and membrane proteins in peptidiscs might be crystallized. Did the authors try to crystallize their five membrane proteins used in this study, for which high resolution crystal structures (determined in detergent) exist?</p><p>5) Does the peptidisc really mimic the natural environment of a membrane protein? The authors carefully worked out that the peptidisc contains annular lipids. However, annular lipids are also contained in detergent-purified samples. The authors should address this question by comparing the content of annular lipids side-by-side and over time using the same transporter purified in detergent as well as in peptidiscs and measuring by mass spectrometry the mass (or loss of mass over time) of the entire complex.</p><p>6) The manuscript lacks a proper Discussion. Most problematically, the authors do not discuss at all that the concept of peptides used as detergent surrogates is not novel at all. Rather, it was first described in the 80s and 90s as peptitergent (you can find this word even on Wikipedia). See also in Schafmeister CE, Miercke LJ, Stroud RM. Structure at 2.5 A of a designed peptide that maintains solubility of membrane proteins. Science. 1993 Oct 29;262(5134):734-8. In addition, there are lipopeptide detergents (LPDs), nano-structured β-sheets (see Tao H, Lee SC, Moeller A, Roy RS, Siu FY, Zimmermann J, Stevens RC, Potter CS, Carragher B, Zhang Q. Engineered nanostructured β-sheet peptides protect membrane proteins. Nat Methods. 2013 Aug;10(8):759-61). Further, there was the development of short peptides for membrane stabilization, which are much cheaper to produce than the 37 aa NSP peptide (see Kiley P, Zhao X, Vaughn M, Baldo MA, Bruce BD, Zhang S. Self-assembling peptide detergents stabilize isolated photosystem I on a dry surface for an extended time. PLoS Biol. 2005 Jul;3(7):e230. Epub 2005 Jun 21.)</p><p>Important is the question whether at all or to what extent the NSP peptide is superior to these previously described methods using amphiphilic peptides, in particular the short designer peptides as described in Kiley et al., 2005). Critically, this point needs to be addressed experimentally by a functional assay including the maltose transporter and/or the BRC.</p><p>The Discussion should also include the concept of membrane protein stabilization via peptide-protein interactions (peptidisc) versus lipid protein interactions (nanodisc/saposins/proteoliposomes). And finally, it needs to address the amphipols (which are conceptually most closely linked to peptitergents and peptidiscs) in more detail.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The Peptidisc, a Simple Method for Stabilizing Membrane Proteins in Detergent-free Solution&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) What is interesting in the revised version is the fact that the sequence of the original NSP peptide as it is present in ApoA1 was in fact reversed and that this resulted in an increase of solubility of the peptide. Why was this information completely lacking in the first version?</p><p>2) The exact sequence of the NSPr peptide should be provided directly in the Materials and methods section under section &quot;Biological reagents and peptides&quot; (I had difficulties finding it in Supplementary file 1).</p><p>3) The authors are now stating in the manuscript that the method is inexpensive. However, I would still be interested to know how much a mg or a gram costs and how much you will need for an experiment (by providing a reasonable range).</p><p>4) Concerning the impurities of the peptide, the authors gave an interesting answer in the response letter (i.e. that the great majority of the impurity is in fact the same peptide missing its final amino acid). This should be mentioned in the manuscript as well.</p><p>5) The authors refer to a homepage to order/obtain the peptide: www.peptidisc.com. However, the homepage does work yet. It seems that the authors will or have already founded a start-up company to commercialize the peptidisc. Potential financial competing interests have to be declared.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34085.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) The proteins used are relatively large membrane protein complexes or b-barrel proteins that are stable even in detergent micelles.

However, in the case of the BRC complex, we observe 100 fold stability increase in peptidic versus LDAO detergent at elevated temperature. The immediate aim of our work is to present the peptidisc as a new tool, so that it can be tested by other researchers on their favorite target. For example, current biochemical work on GPCRs involves amphipols, and not so much nanodiscs perhaps due to the required addition of exogenous lipids which complicate the reconstitution. The peptidisc therefore has also potential to replace amphipols which are inherently polydisperse. Further studies characterizing the peptidisc’s usefulness for cell-free expression systems is certainly of interest, however beyond the scope of this introductory article. We feel that a cell-free expression should be investigated as a separate study with all the different possible membrane mimetics (nanodiscs/SMA/peptergents etc.) to be truly useful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One of the advantages over nanodiscs that the authors advertise is that the peptidiscs can be used for structural investigations.

All membrane mimetic systems show a similar increase in thermostability. Delipidation is a general problem with detergent solubilization. However, we show that the peptide increases the thermostability of the delipidated BRC complex. This is likely due to i) removal of denaturing detergents, and ii) a more stable hydrophobic environment as compared to a detergent micelle. Thus, even without extra lipids, the peptidisc is able to stabilize the BRC as much as in a proteoliposome (Figure 10—figure supplement 1). Detergent delipidation can also be a useful for increasing purity of membrane proteins. For example, during purification of FhuA, the inner membrane is first removed by solubilization in Triton X-100 before addition of LDAO to release FhuA from the outer membrane. This significantly increases the final purity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ideally assays should be given across a temperature range to ensure that folded protein is being measured for activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown that MalFGK<sub>2</sub> in peptidisc remains folded throughout the reconstitution using BN-PAGE and ATPase activity assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The identities of bound lipids should also be stated, rather than non-specific statements about lipid content like &quot;Also, because lipids (i.e. annular lipids) can remain tightly bound to membrane proteins during purification [Bechara et al., 2015], we also determined the lipid content by thin layer chromatography and photocolorimetric methods&quot; and &quot;Following the same approach applied to MalFGK<sub>2</sub> above, we quantified the individual peptide and lipid components of the FhuA peptidisc (Figure 3B and A), resulting in an average of 8 ± 3 phospholipids and 10 ± 2 NSP per FhuA peptidisc&quot;. The low number of lipid molecules present (4 and 8 in the cases of BRC and FhuA) indicates that only the most tightly bound lipids remain in the peptidisc, and that a disc shape cannot be assumed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included data on the identities of the bound lipids to MalFGK<sub>2</sub>. We also show that FhuA and BRC have very low lipid content. However, we do not agree that this precludes a disc shape, as both the periplasmic and cytoplasmic faces of FhuA are still accessible to its soluble binding partners. Therefore, the bulk of the peptide must be located around the transmembrane domains of the transporter. Electron microscopy data included in the manuscript support further this.

Would one not expect to see a higher number of peptides interacting with larger assembly or with different membranes or cell types?

Nevertheless, I am a bit skeptical whether a peptidisc represents a reconstitution in the classical sense, because the NSP peptides directly interact with the transmembrane helices (driven by hydrophobic protein-protein interactions mediated by amino acid side chains) instead of lipids via their aliphatic fatty acid chains. Nevertheless, the method (although not being a novel concept at as outlined below) seems to be rather easy and versatile in its application.</p></disp-quote><p>1) Interaction – we have included a full discussion on the possible mode of interaction of the peptide with the target membrane protein. Importantly, we show that the peptidisc represents a “true” reconstitution because it is entirely stable upon removal from excess peptide, in much the same manner as a nanodisc or amphipols. This is in contrast to other peptide scaffolds (lipopeptides and peptergents), which must be maintained in buffer above their CMC to maintain protein solubility.</p><p>2) Novelty – we have carefully addressed the issue of novelty in the section Introduction and Discussion by including comparisons (pro and con) with other peptides scaffolds, protein scaffolds and synthetic scaffolds. Although the concept of trapping membrane proteins with a scaffold is not novel, there isn’t to our knowledge other reports showing functional thermostable reconstitution of protein in peptidiscs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) As a potential future user (and a current user of the nanodisc method), it is critical to know how expensive the synthesis (or any alternative preparation) of the NSP peptide is. I assume it is more expensive than detergents, but in contrast to the MSP protein used for nanodiscs, it might be less expensive. Along the same lines, the authors stated that the purity of their chemically synthetized NSP peptide was &quot;more than 80%&quot;. Is this sufficient? What are the impurities. Is this rather low purity linked to the price of the synthesis?</p></disp-quote><p>Even low-purity peptides are still “cleaner” compared to other MSPs membrane protein scaffolds which are contaminated with lipids and other proteins due to recombinant cell protein expression (a major issue for the biotech industry when generating antibodies against membrane proteins stabilized in nanodiscs). In peptidisc, the bulk of “contaminants” consists of the NSP<sub>r</sub> missing its final amino acid (aspartate) during synthesis. In comparison to MSP protein, referenced from Sigma Aldrich, the peptide is less expensive. We have included comments on these points in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How aggregation-prone are peptidiscs? The authors hypothesize that the NSP peptides build a regular belt around the membrane protein, akin to the MSP belt. But is this really feasible? It is clear that the peptides arrange such that the hydrophobic parts of the membrane protein are covered by its hydrophobic side, while the hydrophilic face of the peptides remains exposed to the solvent. But this process is likely to be stochastic in the sense that there remain hydrophobic gaps on the membrane protein surface, as well as on some of the not perfectly placed NSP peptides. These remaining hydrophobic surfaces would then serve as nucleation points for protein aggregation. Remaining detergent molecules originating from the solubilization and purification of the membrane protein may shield these remaining hydrophobic surfaces.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer raises very important and fundamental questions, and the exact same questions apply to the nanodisc and SMA polymer systems as well. From our experiments, detergent appears to be completely eliminated from the peptidisc, as characteristic effects of a detergent environment on protein activity and stability are not seen once the protein is transferred into the peptidisc. The experimental data show that aggregation is not occurring and the system are very stable in water solution. We have also revised the Discussion to clarify how the peptide may possibly orientate itself around the membrane protein in a peptidisc to account for the issue of exposed alkyl chains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to the above comment: Do peptidiscs still contain detergents? It is well known that quantitative detergent exchange is not a trivial endeavor. Often the initial detergent used to solubilize the membrane protein remains present to some degree. The authors need to show, whether in the peptidiscs there are still some detergents remaining (next to annular lipids and the NSP peptide).</p></disp-quote><p>From the high degree of correlation between our calculated and observed masses for the peptidiscs, it is likely that most, if not all of the detergent is removed from the peptidisc. Furthermore, in all cases of exchange from detergent to peptidisc, significant changes in enzyme activity or thermostability are observed, suggesting that even if a small amount of detergent remains, the denaturing effect of a detergent environment does not. We have discussed this point in the expanded text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) How big is the NSP belt compared to detergent belts of different sizes? This question is highly relevant for membrane protein crystallization. The peptidisc appears more compact than a nanodisc and membrane proteins in peptidiscs might be crystallized. Did the authors try to crystallize their five membrane proteins used in this study, for which high resolution crystal structures (determined in detergent) exist?</p></disp-quote><p>We are also very excited with the perspective of getting crystals! Crystal trials are ongoing, and based on EM comparisons of MalFGK<sub>2</sub>, we also think the peptidisc is more compact than the nanodisc. However, the crystal optimization and use of the peptidisc for crystallization studies are outside the scope of this current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Does the peptidisc really mimic the natural environment of a membrane protein? The authors carefully worked out that the peptidisc contains annular lipids. However, annular lipids are also contained in detergent-purified samples. The authors should address this question by comparing the content of annular lipids side-by-side and over time using the same transporter purified in detergent as well as in peptidiscs and measuring by mass spectrometry the mass (or loss of mass over time) of the entire complex.</p></disp-quote><p>This question applies to all other membrane scaffold systems as well. The peptidisc is clearly more gentle environment than the detergent micelle. Comparison of BRC reconstituted in SMA, nanodiscs, peptidiscs, and proteoliposomes show that all these membrane mimetics lead to a comparable increase in the protein’s thermostability. However, the peptidisc also preserves protein ability to bind surface ligands as shown in the manuscript with FhuA/ColM/Ferricrocin and MalFGK<sub>2</sub>-MalE. In detergents, these proteins show binding/activity that is inconsistent with their performance in a lipid system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The manuscript lacks a proper Discussion. Most problematically, the authors do not discuss at all that the concept of peptides used as detergent surrogates is not novel at all. Rather, it was first described in the 80s and 90s as peptitergent (you can find this word even on Wikipedia). See also in Schafmeister CE, Miercke LJ, Stroud RM. Structure at 2.5 A of a designed peptide that maintains solubility of membrane proteins. Science. 1993 Oct 29;262(5134):734-8. In addition, there are lipopeptide detergents (LPDs), nano-structured β-sheets (see Tao H, Lee SC, Moeller A, Roy RS, Siu FY, Zimmermann J, Stevens RC, Potter CS, Carragher B, Zhang Q. Engineered nanostructured β-sheet peptides protect membrane proteins. Nat Methods. 2013 Aug;10(8):759-61). Further, there was the development of short peptides for membrane stabilization, which are much cheaper to produce than the 37 aa NSP peptide (see Kiley P, Zhao X, Vaughn M, Baldo MA, Bruce BD, Zhang S. Self-assembling peptide detergents stabilize isolated photosystem I on a dry surface for an extended time. PLoS Biol. 2005 Jul;3(7):e230. Epub 2005 Jun 21.)</p><p>Important is the question whether at all or to what extent the NSP peptide is superior to these previously described methods using amphiphilic peptides, in particular the short designer peptides as described in Kiley et al., 2005). Critically, this point needs to be addressed experimentally by a functional assay including the maltose transporter and/or the BRC.</p></disp-quote><p>We absolutely agree with the reviewer. The manuscript was initially submitted as a Short Communication, which has text limitations. We have now rewritten sections Introduction and Discussion so that many of the well thought out comments above can be addressed. In the revised manuscript, we explain why the peptidisc is superior than previous peptide-based methods, as well as addressing synthetic polymers protein scaffold based systems. We comment on possible orientations of the peptide in the peptidisc, as well as the possibility of detergents remaining in the particles.</p><p><italic>The Discussion should also include the concept of membrane protein stabilization via peptide-protein interactions (peptidisc) versus lipid protein interactions (nanodisc/saposins/proteoliposomes). And finally, it needs to address the amphipols (which are conceptually most closely linked to peptitergents and peptidiscs) in more detail.</italic> </p><p>We have modified the Discussion to encompass these points in more detail.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) What is interesting in the revised version is the fact that the sequence of the original NSP peptide as it is present in ApoA1 was in fact reversed and that this resulted in an increase of solubility of the peptide. Why was this information completely lacking in the first version?</p></disp-quote><p>The sequence utilized through this study has been consistently reported in the supplementary table and labeled generically as NSP (i.e. nano-scaffold peptide) because we did not find many differences in reconstitution performance compared to the NSP sequence described by Kariyazono et al. However, issues of lower solubility became more evident to us after submission of the first manuscript version. We therefore felt it important to present this information in the revision, include additional experimental data and also to determine the hydrophobicity moment to explain for this difference (Figure 8—figure supplement 1). To prevent confusion with Kariyazono et al., we had to rename this sequence to NSP<sub>r</sub> in the revised version, and it was an obvious mistake in hindsight not to label it as such in the first submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The exact sequence of the NSPr peptide should be provided directly in the Materials and methods section under section &quot;Biological reagents and peptides&quot; (I had difficulties finding it in Supplementary file 1).</p></disp-quote><p>The sequence of NSPr has been added to the manuscript Materials and methods, section entitled “Peptides”, in addition to Supplementary file 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors are now stating in the manuscript that the method is inexpensive. However, I would still be interested to know how much a mg or a gram costs and how much you will need for an experiment (by providing a reasonable range).</p></disp-quote><p>As an example, the peptide content of MsbA-peptidisc represents ¼ of the total molecular weight. Therefore the reconstitution of MsbA in peptidisc using the on-bead method in quantities suitable for crystallization screening (~20mg/mL, 200µL) utilizes at least of ~1mg peptide. The cost of the peptide can be as low as ~5-15$/mg, pricing dependent on supplier, quantity and purity, thus the peptide cost for crystallization screen can be ball parked in the ~5-15$ range. An equivalent amount of MSP (https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/m6574?lang=en&amp;region=CA) would cost close to $80. There is, of course, additional peptide lost during purification steps (IMAC, SEC, concentration steps). The final cost in our lab to prepare this amount of MsbA in peptidisc for crystal screening is $20, assuming we lose about 60% of the MsbA during the purification steps. In comparison, each Hampton sitting drop crystal plate will cost close to 5$. In the case of EM experiments, the cost is even lower since less protein is required (5-10 mg/mL). In either case, the on-bead method is important to limit the total cost because the peptidisc solution can be re-utilized multiple times, as only the requisite amount of peptide binds the protein. In comparison, the on-column reconstitution is more wasteful because the initial 10 fold excess of peptide cannot be recovered as it fractionates with small size impurities. The on-gel reconstitutions utilize approximately 2-8µg of NSP<sub>r</sub>, so the cost of optimization is extremely low. Another very important consideration is labor time generally associated with the preparation of other membrane scaffolds. This is not the case with the peptidisc since the product can be manufactured.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Concerning the impurities of the peptide, the authors gave an interesting answer in the response letter (i.e. that the great majority of the impurity is in fact the same peptide missing its final amino acid). This should be mentioned in the manuscript as well.</p></disp-quote><p>This information and the degree of peptide purity are now presented together in the same place in the Materials and methods, section entitled “Peptides”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors refer to a homepage to order/obtain the peptide: www.peptidisc.com. However, the homepage does work yet. It seems that the authors will or have already founded a start-up company to commercialize the peptidisc. Potential financial competing interests have to be declared.</p></disp-quote><p>We recently started a website with the goal to deliver NSP<sub>r</sub> in a kit along model membrane proteins so that other researchers can easily reproduce the core reconstitution experiments we present in this manuscript before proceeding on their own target. We mentioned in the manuscript “To aid accessibility to the academic community, bulk NSP<sub>r</sub> peptides and core protocols are available at www.peptidisc.com”, and we can declare a competing financial interest where necessary. Our goal is to make the method accessible to all and the anticipated cost will reflect a small revenue to cover its distribution and efforts to ensure its proper application including technical advices. We had not released the website yet due to the paper remaining under review and will do soon after publication. We have also named the other various source of peptide manufacturers employed in this study. The peptidisc presents an additional interesting opportunity in comparison to other scaffolds, as its use is not protected by intellectual property so it can be easily utilized by academics and industry alike.</p></body></sub-article></article>
