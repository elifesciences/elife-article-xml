involved in fracture healing. We sought to characterize progenitor cells and their contribution to bone fracture healing. The periosteum is highly enriched with progenitor cells, including Sca1<sup>+</sup> cells, fibroblast colony-forming units, and label-retaining cells compared to the endosteum and bone marrow. Using lineage tracing, we demonstrate that alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) identifies long-term, slow-cycling, self-renewing osteochondroprogenitors in the adult periosteum that are functionally important for bone formation during fracture healing. In addition, Col2.3CreER-labeled osteoblast cells contribute around 10% of osteoblasts but no chondrocytes in fracture calluses. Most periosteal osteochondroprogenitors following fracture can be targeted by αSMACreER. Previously identified skeletal stem cell populations were common in periosteum but contained high proportions of mature osteoblasts. We have demonstrated that the periosteum is highly enriched with skeletal progenitor cells, and there is heterogeneity in the populations of cells that contribute to mature lineages during periosteal fracture healing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fracture</kwd><kwd>periosteum</kwd><kwd>skeletal stem cell</kwd><kwd>pdgfra</kwd><kwd>alpha smooth muscle actin</kwd><kwd>osteoblast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004829</institution-id><institution>Connecticut Innovations</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14-SCA-UCHC-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matthews</surname><given-names>Brya G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001505</institution-id><institution>Health Research Council of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Charles Hercus Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matthews</surname><given-names>Brya G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010874</institution-id><institution>American Society for Bone and Mineral Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rising Star Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matthews</surname><given-names>Brya G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR055607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kalajzic</surname><given-names>Ivo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR070813</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kalajzic</surname><given-names>Ivo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004829</institution-id><institution>Connecticut Innovations</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16-RMB-UCHC-10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kalajzic</surname><given-names>Ivo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Murine periosteum is highly enriched for osteoprogenitors, many of which express αSMA, but fracture callus chondrocytes are partially derived from other sources.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone tissue retains the ability to heal and regenerate throughout life. This process relies on tissue-resident stem and progenitor cells capable of generating new matrix. Until recently, most studies focused on the bone marrow compartment as a source of osteoprogenitors, with respect to their contribution to growth and remodeling, and their potential as a source of cells for regenerative applications. In the bone marrow compartment, it is well established that the endosteal region, as well as regions near trabecular bone surfaces, are highly enriched for stem and progenitor cells, including cells of the mesenchymal or skeletal lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Siclari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morikawa et al., 2009</xref>). Skeletal stem cells (SSCs) can be isolated from various bone compartments based on their plastic adherence; however, more recently, numerous markers have been proposed to identify or isolate skeletal progenitors prospectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The skeleton has different requirements for the functionality of tissue-resident progenitors at different life stages. During development, the majority of the skeleton forms through endochondral ossification via a cartilage template, and this process continues during postnatal life at the growth plates. Hypertrophic chondrocytes can give rise to osteoblasts, particularly those in the primary spongiosa and trabecular region, likely via a progenitor intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wolff and Hartmann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mizuhashi et al., 2018</xref>). However, this process is growth-related, and SSC pools must become established in adult tissues by the completion of growth when the growth plate activity reduces dramatically (as in mice) or fuses completely (in humans). Many stem and progenitor markers have been studied primarily during early life. For example, skeletal progenitors expressing Gli1, Gremlin1, and CTGF are prevalent during development and adolescent growth but appear to diminish or disappear in mice over 1 month of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Worthley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Chan and colleagues have reported flow cytometry-based methods for identifying SSCs and downstream bone, cartilage, and stromal progenitors (BCSPs), as well as various other lineage-restricted populations in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2015</xref>). The murine cell surface antigen combinations were validated only in cells isolated from whole neonatal mouse long bones, but have since been applied to various settings in adult systems, including fracture healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marecic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tevlin et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, markers for putative SSCs in humans were identified using fetal tissue, with a focus on the hypertrophic cartilage zone, then applied to adult tissue. Another recent study used similar marker combinations to identify stem cell populations in the periosteum, with the majority of studies performed using very young animals (late embryonic up to P32, many at P6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debnath et al., 2018</xref>). PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup> (PαS) cells were characterized in adult animals, and leptin receptor Cre-labeled cells that ultimately give rise to osteoblasts and bone marrow adipocytes do not become established before 2 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morikawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou et al., 2014b</xref>). These results indicate that stem and progenitor cell populations and markers change at different life stages, meaning that markers identified in neonates or juveniles may not apply to the adult setting.</p><p>The periosteum is the tissue surrounding the outer surface of the bone. It is physically separated from the bone marrow compartment and appears to have a much greater regenerative capacity, playing a critical role in fracture healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colnot, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roberts et al., 2015</xref>). Periosteum-based healing involves a process similar to endochondral ossification. Following an inflammatory phase, the periosteum expands and forms a callus initially comprised of fibrocartilage in the central area, combined with direct bone formation at the periphery. It has been challenging to identify markers that are specific to the periosteum; however, recent studies have characterized cathepsin K and periostin as markers that are highly enriched in periosteal mesenchymal cells, and alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) was shown to enrich Mx1-labeled periosteal cells for progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debnath et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duchamp de Lageneste et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ortinau et al., 2019</xref>). We have previously shown that αSMA identifies a population of growth-related osteoprogenitors in the trabecular region, and cells that contribute to fracture healing in the adult periosteum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matthews et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grcevic et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we have used murine models to characterize the periosteal progenitor populations. We have demonstrated that αSMACreER identifies a subset of long-term osteochondroprogenitors involved in fracture callus formation. In addition, we have evaluated different bone compartments for the expression of stem/progenitor markers, including cell surface profile, SSC, and BCSP populations, and lifespan by label retention assays in different bone compartments, and evaluated growth potential of different periosteal populations ex vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vivo identification of long-term osteochondroprogenitors</title><p>In order to identify murine periosteal progenitor populations in vivo, we initially utilized a lineage tracing approach with a tamoxifen-inducible Cre combined with the Ai9 Tomato (Tom) reporter. We have demonstrated that αSMACreER identifies osteoprogenitors in both the periosteum and the bone marrow compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matthews et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grcevic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matthews et al., 2020</xref>). Previously, we delivered tamoxifen at the time of fracture, which potentially labels cells that activate αSMA expression at the time of or shortly after fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mori et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we delivered tamoxifen up to 90 days before fracture to evaluate whether the reporter was identifying long-term progenitor cells. First, we confirmed that αSMA-labeled cells were retained in the periosteum over the experimental time course by both histology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>) and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). αSMA-labeled cells remained in the periosteum at a similar frequency over the timeframe evaluated and also remained in the endosteum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In juvenile mice (4–5 weeks old), we see contribution of αSMA<sup>+</sup> cells from the bone marrow compartment, particularly in the trabecular region, to osteoblasts and osteocytes after 17 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grcevic et al., 2012</xref>). However, 70 days after tamoxifen delivery, osteoblasts are no longer labeled, but some Tom<sup>+ </sup>osteocytes remain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). In contrast, when tamoxifen is delivered to sexually mature mice, there is no contribution to osteoblasts in trabecular bone up to 100 days after tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) identifies long-term progenitor cells in the periosteum.</title><p>Representative images of tibia mid-shaft periosteum: (<bold>A</bold>) 14 days or (<bold>B</bold>) 56 days after tamoxifen with the periosteal surface near the top and endosteal surface near the bottom of the image. Percentage of αSMA-labeled (Tom<sup>+</sup>) cells within the CD45<sup>-</sup> population at different time points in (<bold>C</bold>) periosteum and (<bold>D</bold>) endosteum as measured by flow cytometry (n = 2–5).

We evaluated the expression of several cell surface markers in periosteum, endosteum, and bone marrow of adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). All stains included a CD45/CD31/Ter119 cocktail to exclude hematopoietic and endothelial cells and select for mesenchymal lineages (termed CD45<sup>-</sup> population). We confirmed that the freshly isolated CD45<sup>+</sup> population was unable to form fibroblast colony-forming units (CFU-F) or any type of colonies in the CFU-F assay. The CD45<sup>-</sup> population in periosteum was highly enriched with most of the markers evaluated compared to both endosteum and bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Sca1, PDGFRα, and PDGFRβ were abundant in periosteum, but expressed on &lt;2% CD45<sup>-</sup> endosteal and bone marrow cells. The only marker that did not follow this trend was CD105, which was consistently present on the majority of endosteal and bone marrow CD45<sup>-</sup> cells. Various marker combinations that have previously been used to identify stem cells such as Sca1/PDGFRα or Sca1/CD51 were easily identifiable in periosteum but very rare in the endosteum or bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The CD45<sup>-</sup> periosteal population formed around 20× more CFU-F than the CD45<sup>-</sup> endosteal population, suggesting functional enrichment of stem and progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This is in agreement with Duchamp de Lageneste et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duchamp de Lageneste et al., 2018</xref>) who used a different method to isolate periosteal cells. We went on to evaluate the expansion and differentiation potential of selected periosteal populations independently of αSMA expression using in vitro assays. CFU-F formation was restricted to CD51<sup>+</sup> cells, and most enriched in Sca1<sup>+</sup> CD51<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). CD90<sup>+</sup> cells also showed high CFU-F potential, whereas CD105<sup>+</sup> cells, which are almost exclusively CD90<sup>-</sup>, formed few or no colonies. Sca1<sup>+</sup> CD51<sup>+</sup> cells showed the ability to differentiate toward osteogenic (ALP<sup>+</sup>) and adipogenic (Oil Red O<sup>+</sup>) lineages, in many cases within a single colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B-C</xref>). Similar results were obtained for the CD90<sup>+</sup> population. Sca1<sup>-</sup> CD51<sup>+</sup> cells and CD90<sup>-</sup> CD105<sup>-</sup> cells efficiently activated ALP but never differentiated into adipocytes. This suggests that in addition to including some mature osteoblasts, these populations contain committed osteoprogenitors that remain capable of density-independent growth.

We next evaluated whether the prevalence of any of these markers in the αSMA-labeled population changed over time since labeling. We did not detect differences in the level of expression of any of the markers evaluated individually or in various combinations at different times after tamoxifen, suggesting that additional markers may be required to define the heterogeneity and phenotype of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p>To further evaluate heterogeneity, we performed plate-based single cell RNAseq analysis on αSMA-labeled periosteal cells isolated at different time points after tamoxifen administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Since expression levels for the majority of genes were low in this study, we restricted our analysis to basic clustering studies.

It is feasible that at least some of these cells are from the fibrotendonous lineage, as the periosteum contains fascia and fibrous tendon attachments, which appear to be targeted by αSMA histologically. Overall, our data indicate that αSMA<sup>+</sup> cells are a fairly rare, but heterogeneous cell population within the periosteum that can be separated into at least three different cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Label-retaining cells in the periosteum are enriched with progenitor markers</title><p>One feature of long-term stem cells is a slow cycling rate, and this can be evaluated experimentally using label retention assays. We used a doxycycline (dox)-inducible GFP-tagged histone system, H2B-GFP, which is incorporated into the DNA during dox feeding, then diluted during subsequent cell division. This system has been used for enrichment of highly self-renewing populations of hematopoietic stem cells and muscle satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foudi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chakkalakal et al., 2014</xref>).

H2B-GFP was incorporated into the majority of periosteal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Quiescent terminally differentiated cells such as osteocytes also effectively retain the label (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Flow cytometry was used to track GFP expression in the CD45<sup>-</sup> fraction of the periosteum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). Our periosteal isolation procedure excludes bone tissue and therefore osteocytes, and we have previously demonstrated that our endosteal preparations contain almost no osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matic et al., 2016</xref>). After the chase phase, the periosteum contained a small population of true LRCs (GFP<sup>hi</sup>), as well as a slightly larger GFP<sup>int</sup> population which would be expected to contain some LRCs. Histologically, the LRCs were mostly in the inner cambium layer of the periosteum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We confirmed that most cells capable of forming CFU-F initially incorporated a GFP label (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). After the chase, both GFP<sup>+</sup> populations showed enrichment of CFU-F compared to the GFP<sup>-</sup> fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We also evaluated cell surface marker expression in LRCs and found strong enrichment of Sca1 and CD51, more frequent expression of CD90, and fewer CD105<sup>+</sup> cells in periosteum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) and endosteum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) compared to GFP<sup>-</sup> cells. Since label retention alone was not very effective at enriching CFU-F, we combined this approach with αSMA-labeling. Initially, we labeled 73.4 ± 7.6% of αSMA<sup>+</sup> cells, and after at least 13 weeks chase, 22.6 ± 7.7% were LRCs, indicating a large proportion of these cells are quiescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

CD200 expression was present on over 90% of Col2.3GFP osteoblasts in both endosteum and periosteum, suggesting that CD200 may be useful for positive selection of osteoblasts. Around 35% of endosteal osteoblasts were CD51+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matic et al., 2016</xref>).

Diphtheria toxin (DTA) expression, which causes death of the cells where it is expressed, was driven by αSMACreER and induced by tamoxifen delivery around the time of fracture. When ablation was performed at the time of fracture (days 0, 1), we saw a 50% reduction in αSMA-labeled cells in 4 days post-fracture (DPF) callus tissue by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This is consistent with the 50% efficiency of recombination we demonstrated for αSMACreER in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sinder et al., 2020</xref>). Histologically, there is a clear reduction in fracture size and αSMA-labeled cells at 4 DPF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Histological analysis at 14 DPF revealed a significant reduction in total callus size as well as mineralized area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>). Micro-computed tomography (microCT) results at day 14 confirmed the histological observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). At 21 DPF, microCT showed no change in total callus volume but a significant decrease in callus bone mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Similar impairments in healing were seen whether ablation was performed at the time of fracture or throughout the first 8 days of healing, suggesting that early loss of αSMA+ cells was most important for this phenotype. Overall, our data demonstrate that partial ablation of αSMA+ progenitors reduced callus formation and delayed mineralization. The less severe phenotype at 21 DPF suggests this may be a delay in healing rather than complete disruption of the process, although the fractures from mice with αSMA-ablation probably never reach the size of control calluses. Healing in the DTA mice may still progress due to compensation of αSMA+ progenitors that escaped ablation or larger contribution from αSMA-negative progenitors in this setting.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Ablation of alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA)+ cells impairs fracture healing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow cytometry of day 4 fracture callus from control αSMACreER/Ai9 mice and DTA animals (αSMACreER/Rosa-DTA/Ai9) indicating significantly fewer (p&lt;0.01) αSMA-labeled cells in the ablation model (mean ± SD shown, n = 4).

We therefore examined the potential contribution of other populations. We tested the previously unexplored hypothesis that mature osteoblast lineage cells may contribute to osteoblast formation in the fracture callus. Col2.3CreER-labeled cells made a small but significant contribution to osteoblast formation in the fracture callus, but only when tamoxifen was given close to the time of fracture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8.A</xref>-B).

PDGFRaCreER targeted the majority of periosteal cells 1 day after completion of tamoxifen administration, as well as the majority of osteoblasts on trabecular and endocortical bone surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–E</xref>). It also targeted a population of cells in the bone marrow. This labeling was tamoxifen-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). These results were confirmed with immunostaining for PDGFRα that indicated expression in the periosteum and in endosteal osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). There is some discrepancy between our flow data and this result (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). PDGFRα staining by flow cytometry tends to be weak, and there is rarely a clear demarcation between positive and negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, PDGFRα-driven Cre in combination with a strong reporter gene such as Ai9 amplifies even low transgene activity. It is therefore likely that we are only gating for cells highly expressing PDGFRα in flow cytometry, but this makes it difficult to use as a reliable marker. This discrepancy is consistent with the results of Ambrosi et al. who report much wider expression of PDGFRα using a GFP reporter mouse compared to previous results with antibody staining and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morikawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambrosi et al., 2017</xref>). Their data also suggests expression of this reporter in osteoblasts. Another recent study reported much higher PDGFRα expression in bone marrow compared to periosteum in contrast with our flow cytometry results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tournaire et al., 2020</xref>). We conclude that PDGFRα is not an optimal marker of progenitor cells within the periosteum due to both technical variability depending on the method used and expression in mature osteoblasts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results indicate that the periosteum of adult mice is highly enriched for cells with markers and phenotype of stem and progenitor cells. Together with other recent studies, our results highlight the presence of unique cell populations within the periosteum that are rare or absent in the bone marrow compartment, and demonstrate that stem cell markers can change with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debnath et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duchamp de Lageneste et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ortinau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tournaire et al., 2020</xref>). There is abundant evidence suggesting that fracture healing is impaired if periosteum is removed, or that otherwise critical-sized defects in a variety of bones can regrow if periosteum is retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mashimo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuwahara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ozaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). There are also numerous studies reporting superior outcomes with cultured periosteal cells compared to other cell sources like bone marrow in terms of bone formation both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duchamp de Lageneste et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Gastel et al., 2014</xref>). Of the markers we examined, we found that most were much more abundant in the periosteum than endosteum. Sca1, CD51, CD90, αSMA, and PDGFRα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2019a</xref>) all enrich for CFU-F in periosteum, similar to what has been reported in other cell types. Although we did not thoroughly characterize PαS cells in the periosteum, we note that these cells were very rare in the endosteal compartment. Morikawa et al. report large enrichment of PαS cells following collagenase digestion of crushed bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morikawa et al., 2009</xref>). Our results raise the possibility that some of the cells isolated in their studies were actually derived from the periosteum. We confirmed by immunostaining and use of an inducible Cre that PDGFRα expression was very abundant in the periosteum. This result and abundant PDGFRα expression shown histologically in osteoblasts were not completely replicated in our flow cytometry data. Ambrosi et al. reported that all Sca1+ cells in the bone marrow co-express PDGFRα using a PDGFRα-GFP line which contrasted with the original study characterizing PαS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambrosi et al., 2017</xref>). This highlights the difficulty in using PDGFRα consistently as a stem and progenitor cell marker. With respect to CD51, our results agree with the studies using neonatal bones, indicating that progenitor cells are solely contained within the CD51+ population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2009</xref>); however, a significant proportion of mature osteoblasts are CD51+, so additional markers that exclude differentiated cells are required. Finally, our results suggest that strong Sca1 expression is specific to periosteal mesenchymal cells and enriches multipotent stem or progenitor cells in combination with CD51, at least in vitro. Sca1 expression was also highly enriched in LRCs in all bone tissue compartments. A recent study using scRNAseq in periosteal cells suggested Sca1 as a marker of differentiated cells in the periosteum, although it was unclear what cell type these mature cells were (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debnath et al., 2018</xref>). Inducible Cre models driven by expression of the Sca1 gene are now available and would potentially help to confirm the in vivo function of Sca1+ cells. Notably, they target endothelial progenitors which will complicate any analysis with these models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vagnozzi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2018</xref>), and one of these models was reported to target very few cells within the bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vesprey et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>LRCs in the periosteum showed large differences in cell surface marker profile compared to non-LRCs and enrichment of CFU-F formation. However, the experimental system presented some limitations, as we did not achieve uniform labeling initially, and some cells had low GFP expression even in the absence of dox. This ‘leaky’ GFP expression may be related to positioning of the tetO-H2B-GFP cassette in the <italic>Col1a1</italic> locus. Following chase, we found that CFU-F formation from the CD45<sup>-</sup> GFP<sup>int</sup> population was similar, or in some cases higher than the true GFP<sup>hi</sup> LRCs. The GFP<sup>int</sup> population potentially contains a mix of cells including those with dox-independent GFP expression, those who have lost some but not all label, and LRCs that did not achieve bright labeling initially. We are unable to distinguish between these populations. It is also possible that the true LRC population contains terminally differentiated quiescent cells that are present in the periosteum. Finally, CFU-F formation appears to be a feature of progenitor cells as well as stem cells, and progenitors may be enriched in the GFP<sup>int</sup> population. The use of label retention is likely to perform better in combination with other markers that already enrich stem cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foudi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chakkalakal et al., 2014</xref>). Within the αSMA-labeled population, we saw fourfold higher CFU-F frequency than αSMA-labeled non-LRCs. A previous study also reported the presence of heterogeneous LRCs in the periosteum; however, they were unable to perform functional characterization, while Nes-GFP+ periosteal cells were not LRCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tournaire et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cherry et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the previous study indicated that αSMA+ cells were not LRCs; however, many antibodies to αSMA stain perivascular cells in larger blood vessels but do not detect αSMA+ cells in the cambium layer of the periosteum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cherry et al., 2014</xref>). The αSMA+ cells in the cambium layer appear to be the cell subset involved in fracture healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ortinau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>). Label retention may be a useful tool to enrich periosteal stem cells in ex vivo assays, although more robust assays for testing self-renewal such as serial transplantation are required.</p><p>One of the key findings of this study is that αSMA identifies long-term, slow-cycling, self-renewing osteoprogenitors in the adult periosteum that are functionally important for bone and cartilage formation during fracture healing. αSMA+ periosteal cells also contribute to osteoblasts in response to loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matthews et al., 2020</xref>). The lineage tracing results suggest that αSMA identifies at least two distinct osteochondroprogenitor populations in the periosteum that contribute to fracture healing. First, there is a long-term quiescent tissue-resident progenitor population that contributes to a subset of osteoblasts and chondrocytes for at least 3 months after labeling. This population is presumably re-established following fracture and contributes to healing of a second fracture in the same bone. Second, there are cells that activate αSMA after injury, as visualized in studies using real-time αSMA reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mori et al., 2016</xref>). The majority of osteoblasts are derived from αSMA-labeled cells when tamoxifen is given at the time of fracture. The results from the fractures performed after a 2-week chase, which show slightly lower contribution than at the time of fracture but a trend toward higher contribution than after 6 or more weeks chase, suggest that there may be a third population of tissue-resident osteochondroprogenitor cells that have a limited lifespan or lack self-renewal capacity. RNAseq analysis of αSMA periosteal cells in intact bone suggested there are at least three cell populations present. While we cannot be certain which of these contains stem and progenitor cells, marker gene expression suggests that one cluster is perivascular cells, another is more fibroblast-like, and the intermediate population is likely to contain stem and progenitor cells. Unfortunately, few of the cluster marker genes were cell surface markers suitable for flow cytometry-based separation of populations.</p><p>We consistently saw lower contribution of αSMA to chondrocytes than to osteoblasts. This may be due to contribution of muscle-derived cells to chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abou-Khalil et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, αSMA expression is present in some muscle cells, both myogenic satellite cells and a separate population of stromal cells that can contribute to heterotopic bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matthews et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kolind et al., 2015</xref>). It is also possible that there is a periosteal population that is restricted to chondrogenic and perhaps fibroblastic lineages, although we are not aware of any cell populations that have shown these properties in vivo. Gli1+ cells contributed to more chondrocytes than osteoblasts in a similar fracture model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). Gli1+ cells also formed fibrous tissue in fractures that failed to heal due to radiation exposure, while αSMA+ cells did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>). The contribution of Gli1+ cells in the fibrous layer of the periosteum or from non-periosteal sources could explain these observations. Cxcl12-CreER also appears to identify cells that form mainly chondrocytes in a periosteal fracture callus; however, the presence of labeled cells outside the bone marrow compartment was not reported, making it difficult to identify the tissue where these cells originated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsushita et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Lineage tracing with Col2.3CreER indicated that there are cells the periosteum already committed to the osteogenic lineage that participate in osteoblast expansion during fracture healing. The Col2.3CreER+ cells only contribute significantly when tamoxifen is given near the time of fracture, indicating that it does not target long-lived self-renewing progenitors. Cells labeled by Prx1, Col2a1, Cathepsin K, LepR, and Mx1-driven Cres all make a major contribution to fracture callus osteoblasts; however, all these models involve either constitutive Cre expression or long-term labeling that includes differentiated cells, meaning that a combination of stem/progenitor cells and pre-osteoblasts/osteoblasts could be contributing to new osteoblast formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debnath et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duchamp de Lageneste et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ortinau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>). Prx1-CreER and Sox9-CreER also label cells in the periosteum that contribute to fracture healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawanami et al., 2009</xref>). It is unclear if these populations overlap with αSMA+ cells or represent separate progenitor pools. However, our results suggest that there is heterogeneity in the cell types contributing to both osteoblasts and chondrocytes in the fracture callus, but by administering tamoxifen at the time of fracture, the majority of periosteal progenitors, particularly those that form osteoblasts, can be genetically targeted by αSMACreER.</p><p>αSMA+ cells are present in the endosteum but are less frequent than in the periosteum. αSMA is expressed in a growth-related transiently amplifying progenitor population in the trabecular region. It is also activated in cells in situations where there is a greater need for osteoblasts, such as injury, or genetic ablation of osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalajzic et al., 2008</xref>). However, it does not appear to label cells involved in bone turnover during adulthood or consistently label long-term injury-responsive cells in the bone marrow compartment. αSMA also labels cells involved transiently in tendon growth as well as identifying progenitors of cementoblasts and periodontal fibroblasts in the periodontium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dyment et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roguljic et al., 2013</xref>). αSMA+ cells are also a major contributor to healing in both these tissues as well as during reparative dentinogenesis following injury in murine molars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vidovic et al., 2017</xref>). There is increasing evidence in bone tissue that different cell types could contribute to homeostasis compared to regeneration. In calvarial bones, the suture provides a niche for cells involved in both growth and healing. Axin2+ and Gli1+ cells contribute to both growth and healing; however, Prx1CreER labels a more restricted population only involved in healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maruyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wilk et al., 2017</xref>). Cxcl12+ cells in the central bone marrow do not contribute to osteoblast formation under homeostatic conditions, but are activated and recruited following injury involving the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsushita et al., 2020</xref>). αSMA+ cells in the periosteum appear to represent a population involved primarily in response to injury or increased need for bone formation.</p><p>A number of the markers and stains we evaluated did not specifically identify stem cells in the adult periosteum. CD105 was the only marker that was more prevalent in endosteum than periosteum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tournaire et al., 2020</xref>) and was mostly absent from LRCs in all cell types analyzed. CD105+ periosteal cells also failed to form CFU-F. CD105 is best known as one of the markers used to identify mesenchymal stem or stromal cells in culture but has also been used as part of stains to identify or enrich progenitor populations in the periosteum and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debnath et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ortinau et al., 2019</xref>). We demonstrated that the BCSP and SSC marker combinations, but not the pre-BSCP population, which were originally developed using neonatal bones, contain a significant proportion of mature osteoblasts when applied to adult bone tissue. This likely influences the observation that these populations expand in settings such as BMP2 treatment or fracture healing, which means some results should be revisited in future when more specific markers for adult bone-residing progenitors are developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marecic et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, a similar stain was used to enrich periosteal stem cells in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debnath et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, CD200 was almost universally expressed on mature osteoblasts. A number of studies suggest that CD200 is present in various stem cell populations, but it definitely does not exclude all mature cells, so should be used with caution in settings where mature osteoblasts are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debnath et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lukač et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the periosteum is highly enriched with skeletal stem and progenitor cells compared to endosteum and bone marrow. Our data demonstrate the presence of a long-term periosteum residing osteochondroprogenitor cell population that is identified by expression of αSMA, along with injury-activated αSMA+ progenitors and mature Col2.3+ osteoblasts that also contribute to the healing process. Overall, the periosteum contains quite different mesenchymal populations to those present within the bone marrow compartment, and there are multiple populations that directly contribute to new tissue formation during fracture healing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

University of Auckland. Mouse lines are listed in the Key Resources Table. αSMACreER and Col2.3GFP mice have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grcevic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalajzic et al., 2002</xref>). R26-M2rtTA; TetOP-H2B-GFP dual homozygous mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foudi et al., 2009</xref>), Ai9 Tomato reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>), Rosa-DTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Voehringer et al., 2008</xref>), Col2.3CreER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2004</xref>), and PdgfraCreER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2018</xref>) were purchased from Jackson Labs. All these strains were maintained on a C57Bl/6J background. NSG immunodeficient mice (<italic>NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ</italic>, stock # 005557) were a gift from David Rowe. All transgenic mice for experiments were bred at UConn Health and were group housed in individually ventilated cages maintained at 22 ± 2°C, 55 ± 5% humidity, and a 12 hr light-dark cycle and allowed ad libitum access to food and water. Male C57Bl/6J mice were used for experiments at the University of Auckland and were bred at the onsite facility under similar conditions. CreER was activated by tamoxifen in corn oil (75 µg/g i.p.), and two doses of tamoxifen were administered 24 hr apart unless otherwise stated. Animals were assigned to experimental groups in blocks, and cage-mates were generally exposed to the same tamoxifen regimen to avoid inadvertent exposure of low-dose tamoxifen.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Tibia fracture</title><p>Closed tibia fractures stabilized by an intramedullary pin were generated mid-shaft as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matthews et al., 2014</xref>). All mice undergoing fracture lineage tracing were female and were sexually mature young adults (8–16 weeks of age at tamoxifen administration, 8–24 weeks at fracture). The presence of fracture was confirmed by X-ray (Faxitron LX 60). Animals were euthanized and limbs collected for histology 7 or 14 DPF. For secondary fractures, tibia fractures were performed and allowed to heal for 8 weeks with the pin in place. Then a secondary fracture was performed in a similar location, confirmed by X-ray, and collected 7 DPF for histological analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Histology</title><p>Bones were fixed for 5–7 days in 4% paraformaldehyde, incubated in 30% sucrose overnight and embedded in cryomatrix (Fisher Scientific). Cryosections (7 µm) were obtained using a cryostat and tape transfer system (Section-lab, Hiroshima, Japan) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dyment et al., 2016</xref>). Imaging settings were kept consistent for each dataset. Fluorescent images were obtained with an Axioscan slide scanner (Zeiss). Immunostaining antibodies are listed in the Key Resources Table. For Sox9 and PDGFRα staining, sections were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X for 15 min, blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 1 hr, and stained with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. For osterix staining, sections were permeabilized in 0.1% Tween-20 for 15 min, blocked in 10% goat serum, 2% BSA/PBS for 1 hr, stained with anti-Osterix antibody overnight at 4°C. Both sets of slides were washed in 0.1% Tween-20/PBS and stained with secondary antibody for 1 hr at RT, then washed thoroughly. Slides were coverslipped in 50% glycerol/PBS containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Image analysis was performed as described previously using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matthews et al., 2020</xref>). Samples were excluded from all image analysis for the following reasons: fracture was not evident or callus was absent. For osteoblast analysis, sections were excluded if they did not contain a clear fracture site. Endosteal analysis was performed only in sections that had a clear central marrow cavity present, and new bone formation evident in this region. Chondrocyte analysis was performed at day 7 only, as most cartilage is gone by day 14, and some fractures were excluded due to lack of cartilage tissue for analysis. Briefly, to evaluate Tom+ contribution to osteoblasts, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn encompassing the fracture callus. Adjacent ROIs encompassing the central area of the callus (1 mm either side of the fracture site) as well as more distal regions were drawn (up to 6 ROIs/section), then data were pooled to determine total callus values. The DAPI channel was thresholded and separated using the watershed algorithm, then fluorescent signal for each channel was measured in nuclear regions. Standardized thresholds were set manually for each channel. We calculated the number of cells that were GFP+ or Osx+ (osteoblasts), the number that were Tom+, and the percentage of osteoblasts that were Tom+ (dual positive cells/osteoblasts). In most cases, one section/bone was analyzed. Where multiple sections were analyzed, results from different sections were consistently very similar and were pooled. A minimum of 3000 nuclei (median 9262) were evaluated for each sample. Similar analysis was performed on the bone marrow compartment when sections were suitable. For chondrocyte analysis, since there was some non-specific staining with the Sox9 antibody, only regions that demonstrated chondrocytic morphology were incorporated in the ROI analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cell isolation</title><p>For studies comparing different tissue compartments, bone marrow, endosteum, and periosteum were isolated from hindlimbs of the same mice as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2019a</xref>). In most cases, two or three animals of the same sex were pooled to generate a sample. Briefly, after removal of muscle tissue, bone marrow was flushed and underwent red blood cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matthews et al., 2017</xref>). Periosteum was scraped off the bone surface and digested in PBS containing 0.05% Collagenase P and 0.2% hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) for 1 hr at 37°C. To isolate endosteal cells, bones were then opened, crushed, loosely attached cells removed by washing, then digested in PBS containing 0.05% Collagenase P for 1 hr at 37°C. Cells were washed and resuspended in staining medium (SM, 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid in PBS).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Flow cytometry and cell sorting</title><p>Cells were stained using antibody cocktails in SM. Antibodies and secondary reagents are listed in the Key Resources Table. Analysis was performed on an LSRII or Aria II instrument (BD Biosciences), and sorting was performed on an Aria II. All experiments included unstained controls for establishing gates derived from non-fluorescent mice, and single color controls generated using periosteal or bone marrow cells. Some experiments included fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls to assist with gating. Dead cells were excluded in most experiments using DAPI staining (~50 ng/ml final concentration). Four-way sorting was performed on selected populations. Cells were sorted into 1.5 ml tubes containing 500 µl collection medium (αMEM 10% FBS). Acquisition and sorting was performed using FACSDiva software and analysis was performed in FlowJo (BD Biosciences). Experiments involved at least two biological replicates per group, and most were performed on more than one occasion to ensure consistent outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vitro assays</title><p>CFU-F assays were performed using freshly sorted cells. Live cell numbers were assumed to be 50% of the cells sorted by the machine. Sorted cells were resuspended in αMEM 20% FBS and seeded in six-well plates, generally at 50 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, although this varied depending on yield. In most cases, three wells were seeded per population, and at least three independent samples per population were evaluated. Cells were cultured in a 37°C humidified incubator, 5% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Medium was changed on day 4, and cultures were terminated for staining on day 7–8. Cells were fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min, washed in water, then underwent crystal violet staining. For differentiation, after 7 days, medium was changed to an osteogenic/adipogenic combined cocktail containing αMEM 10% FBS, 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid, 4 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 µM insulin, 0.5 µM rosiglitazone, and transferred to a normoxic incubator. Medium was changed after 3 days and cultures were terminated after 5 days of differentiation. Plates underwent concurrent ALP staining (86R or B5655, Sigma Aldrich) and Oil Red O staining, were imaged, then underwent crystal violet staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Single cell RNAseq analysis</title><p>Periosteum was prepared as described above but with a 30-min enzymatic digestion. We sorted Tom+ cells from periosteal isolations from two to three female αSMACreER/Ai9 mice. Cells were isolated from αSMACreER/Ai9/Col2.3GFP mice at 2 days and 6 weeks after tamoxifen and from H2B-GFP/αSMACreER/Ai9 mice 13 weeks after tamoxifen and withdrawal of dox. No staining was performed and dead cells were excluded by DAPI staining. Single Tom+ cells were sorted using the index sort function on the BD Aria II directly into individual wells of a Bio-Rad hard shell 384-well plate. The plate was immediately stored in a −80°C freezer. Approximately half a plate per sample was processed for sequencing (192 cells for 2 days and 13 weeks, 216 cells for 6 weeks). Custom designed Drop-Seq barcoded primers from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) were delivered into each well of the 384-well plate, with primers in one well sharing the same unique cell barcode and different UMIs. An Echo 525 liquid handler was used to dispense 1 µl of primers and reaction reagents into each well for cell lysis and cDNA synthesis. Following cDNA synthesis, the contents of each well were collected and pooled into one tube using a Caliper SciClone Liquid Handler. After treatment with exonuclease I to remove unextended primers, the cDNA was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified for 13 cycles. The cDNA was fragmented and amplified for sequencing with the Nextera XT DNA sample prep kit (Illumina) using custom primers that enabled the specific amplification of only the 3′ ends (see Key Resources Table). The libraries were purified, quantified, and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. The data preprocessing was performed using Drop-seq tools (version 1.13), with picard (version 2.17.8) for fastq to bam conversion and STAR (version 2.5.4a) for alignment to the reference genome, mm10 (version 1.2.0). Gene expression matrices were generated, and analysis was done using scanpy (version 1.3.7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>). The data is deposited in GEO under accession GSE165846. The data was filtered to remove cells with fewer than 200 genes, normalized and log transformed. The top 900 highly variable genes as measured by dispersion were used for neighborhood graph generation (nearest neighbor = 20) and dimensionality reduction with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Satija et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becht et al., 2019</xref>). Leiden community detection algorithm was used for clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Traag et al., 2019</xref>). Data were visualized and plots and heat maps generated by CellView (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolisetty et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Label retention studies</title><p>R26-M2rtTA; TetOP-H2B-GFP (H2B-GFP) males were crossed with αSMACreER/Ai9/Ai9 females to generate experimental mice. Mice received doxin their diet (625 mg/kg) from P10 for 5 weeks. Males were removed from breeding cages prior to birth of pups to ensure mothers did not ingest dox during subsequent pregnancies. Some animals received two doses of i.p. tamoxifen at the time of dox withdrawal. The chase period was a minimum of 13 weeks. Animals that were never exposed to dox were included in all experiments as controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Calvarial defect transplantation</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (135 and 15 mg/kg) and bilateral critical-sized circular defects (3.5 mm diameter) created in the parietal bone as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gohil et al., 2014</xref>). About 2500–5000 sorted αSMA-labeled cells were mixed with 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> BMSCs, resuspended in 7 µl PBS, loaded on a healos scaffold, and placed into calvaria defects of immunodeficient NSG mice (n = 6). After 5 weeks, mice were euthanized for histological analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Ablation studies</title><p>Animals were generated by crossing Rosa-DTA homozygous mice with αSMACreER, or where lineage tracing was required, crossing αSMACreER/Rosa-DTA with Ai9 and using only Cre+ animals. Fractures were performed in 7–10-week-old animals as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Novak et al., 2020</xref>). Tamoxifen was given 0 and 1 DPF in most cases. Briefly, closed transverse diaphyseal femoral fractures were created using a blunt guillotine, after inserting a 24G needle into the intramedullary canal. To evaluate efficacy of the ablation, flow cytometry and histology were performed 4 DPF. For flow, the callus tissue was dissected and single cell suspension from individual male mice (n = 4) was generated, stained with CD45/CD31/Ter119 cocktail and DAPI. For microCT, fractured bones were collected 14 and 21 DPF, fixed in 10% formalin, and scanned (µCT40, Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland) with a voxel size of 12 µm, 55 kV, and intensity of 145 µA. We evaluated 150 slices above and below the fracture site to measure density and callus volume, and calculate bone mass. For histological analysis on day 14, frozen sections were stained using von Kossa and callus size and mineralized areas were quantified using ImageJ software as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Novak et al., 2020</xref>). An additional group given tamoxifen 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 DPF were included. The 21 DPF analysis group received tamoxifen 0, 2, 4 DPF. Controls with different tamoxifen regimens showed no difference between groups, so were pooled. Both male and female mice were included (day 14: Cre-: n = 14, 8M 6F; DTA D0,1: n = 10, 4M 6F; DTA D0-8: n = 8, 4M 4F).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>All experiments include at least three biological replicates. For lineage tracing fracture experiments, we planned to include at least n = 6 per group, although long-term tracing groups in particular had more animals included to account for possible exclusions. We planned to include n = 10 for DTA studies based on our previous experience with quantitative fracture studies, but numbers and sex distribution were limited by the genotypes of available animals. Exact n values are listed in figures or figure legends, or where ranges are stated, in the source data files. Values represent the number of biological replicates (biological replicates represent one mouse/one fracture for injury studies, and one pool of two to three mice for most flow cytometry studies; most of the flow and CFU-F data involves analysis or sorts performed over multiple days or experiments). Graphs show mean ± standard error of the mean. Flow cytometry data on dot plots and in the text show mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism, using t-tests or one-way or two-way ANOVAs with appropriate post-hoc tests. For many of the flow cytometry datasets where different populations or tissues from one sample are evaluated, paired tests are used. Details are included in figure legends, and analysis or p values are supplied in the source data files. p&lt;0.05 was used as the threshold for statistical significance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work has been supported by Connecticut Stem Cell grant 14-SCA-UCHC-02, the Health Research Council of New Zealand Sir Charles Hercus Fellowship, and the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research Rising Star Award to BGM; Connecticut Regenerative Medicine Research Fund grant 16-RMB-UCHC-10 and NIH/NIAMS grants AR055607 and AR070813 to IK.

involved in fracture healing&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Clifford Rosen as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. If you have questions about the review and the concerns please contact me directly. I think the biggest issue remains novelty (see below).</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional edits are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>All three reviewers agree that the authors have performed extensive amount of work to support the major conclusion that different osteoprogenitors in the periosteum are involved in fracture healing. However, they all have raised the same concern regarding the limited novelty of the study which is a weakness of this paper. There is now a general agreement in the literature that different cells in the periosteum contribute to the skeletal development. Since the αSMA-labeled cells characterized in this study is considered heterogeneous, the delayed healing in the α-SAM depleted mice is not surprising. It is recommended that you consider performing additional experiments based on the comments of the reviewers provided below and rewrite the manuscript focused on the novel aspects of the paper during the revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Much attention has been focused recently in the skeletal biology research in characterizing the skeletal progenitors in the periosteum using various stem cell markers and evaluating their role in fracture healing. These studies have led to identification of a number of self-renewing skeletal stem cell populations (Nestin+; Mx1+αSMA+; Cathepsin K +) in the periosteum (Deveza et al., 2018; Ortinau et al., 2019; Debnath et al., 2018; Tournaire et al., 2020). Furthermore, these studies have identified stem cells in the periosteum to contribute significantly to fracture healing. In this study, Mathews et al. first characterized the putative mesenchymal stem cell markers in the periosteum, endosteum and bone marrow of adult mice. They further used lineage tracing strategy to identify αSMA cells in the periosteum to contribute to approximately 80% of osteoblasts and 40% of chondrocytes following fracture. Based on the finding that ablation of SMA+ cells reduced fracture callus volume and bone mass, it is concluded long-term, slow cycling SMA+ periosteal stem cells are functionally important for bone and cartilage formation during fracture healing. Since identifying cells that contribute to repair of fractured bone is important to the goal of developing therapies to promote healing of nonunion fractures, research in this area is of translational value. Overall, the manuscript is well written and the findings are clearly described. However, there are a number of issues that need the authors attention during the revision of this manuscript.</p><p>1) The first part of the studies is focused on characterizing the stem cell surface markers in the different regions of bone, i.e. periosteum, endosteum and bone marrow. These studies seem to clearly show evidence for presence of different populations of stem cells with different osteogenic potential in the different bone compartments. It would have been worthwhile to characterize which of these different populations, for example, Sca1+, CD51+; CD90+; Sca1-, CD51+, CD90-CD105-) are positive for SMA or other known markers of periosteal stem cells (nestin, cathepsin-k). Thus, there seems to be no connection between the first part of the studies and the subsequent studies that are focused on cells expressing SMA.</p><p>2) Fracture healing involves both intramembranous and endochondral ossification. Cartilage formation occurs early by chondrocytes which is subsequently converted to bone via endochondral ossification. Periosteal stem cells have been shown to contribute to both formation of chondrocyte-mediated endochondral bone formation as well as osteoblast-mediated intramembranous bone formation. In a recent study, Debnath et al. (Nature 562:133, 2018) showed that cathepsin-k positive periosteal cells contributed to intramembranous bone formation. In addition, recent studies also demonstrate that chondrocytes can directly transdifferentiate into bone forming osteoblasts during postnatal bone formation and fracture repair. Thus, the issues of whether there are different sub populations of stem cells in the periosteum that contribute to chondrocytes and osteoblasts during endochondral bone formation and osteoblasts during intramembranous bone formation and the extent to which the SMA+ stem cells in the periosteum contribute to the different cell types that contribute to the fracture healing remain unresolved.</p><p>3) The data in Figure 3 showing that SMA identifies long term progenitor cells in the periosteum seem very interesting. The contribution of SMA+ cells to osteoblasts was evaluated at day 7 after fracture healing. In the closed femur mid-shaft fracture model, cartilage callus is more predominant at day 7. One would, therefore, expect much more chondrocytes at day 7 fracture healing while at later stages around day 10-14, there are more osteoblasts. Accordingly, Figures 3E-G show that while there abundant SMA+ cells in the fracture callus area, the number of osteoblasts seem limited which could be due to the early time point used for histology when one would anticipate higher chondrocytes in the callus area. However, the quantitative data in Figure 3H show that 80% of Tom+ cells are osteoblasts which seem to be inconsistent with the data seen in Figure 3E.</p><p>4) To investigate the contribution of the SMA+ cells to fracture healing, the authors have used an established ROSA-DTA mouse model to ablate SMA expressing cells. The fracture phenotype in this model is not adequately characterized. The phenotype is evaluated only at one time point which is day 14 which seems early. Three and four week time points are more appropriate to evaluate if fracture healing is impaired. Time course studies of histological evaluation of cartilage and bone matrix would provide some mechanistic information on whether the reduced callus bone mass is due to reduced cartilage formation, impaired endochondral ossification or defective periosteal bridging.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors investigate heterogeneity of periosteal progenitor cells using a multitude of approaches, such as markers for skeletal stem cells, label-retaining assays and lineage tracing studies of cells expressing αSMA-CreER and Col2.3-CreER. They found that SSC markers are particularly enriched in αSMA-labeled label-retaining periosteal cells that contribute to fracture healing. This strength of this study is an extensive application of cutting-edge mouse genetic and flow cytometry technologies to characterize periosteal cells.</p><p>1) The novelty of this study is not clear from the manuscript. I see the value of a wealth of important information presented here, including periosteal SSC marker expression, label-retaining cells and SMA-labeled cells in fracture healing. However, most of the major findings have been already reported elsewhere by the authors' group and others. For example, the enrichment of SSCs in the periosteum has been reported by Duchamp de Lageneste et al., 2018, and the role of αSMA+ cells in fracture healing has been reported by the authors' group (Matthews et al., 2014; Grevic et al., 2012). The way it is presented now does not really convey the progress that they made in this study. This is the critical point that the authors need to carefully address in any revision of the manuscript.</p><p>2) Heterogeneity of periosteal cells is not experimentally examined in this study, although this point is emphasized in the title. They present many findings without much cohesiveness, though each of which is quite interesting. The authors suggest that αSMA+ cells are composed of short-term and long-term cells that differentially contribute to fracture healing. Single cell RNA-seq analyses of αSMA+ cells would be essential to support this central theme.</p><p>3) The authors should present additional histological data to support their important findings. They stated that LRCs were mostly found in the inner cambium layer of the periosteum. However, no high magnification image is provided to support this claim, with appropriate counterstaining. In addition, the authors raised a very interesting theory that PaS cells might be located in the periosteum. They should perform immunostaining for PDGFRa and Sca1, and provide evidence that these cells are indeed present in the periosteum. This will enhance the novelty of this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Current studies have evaluated that αSMA+ progenitor cells are long-term label retaining cells and majority of them are present in particularly on periosteum. These cells are activated with injury and become bone forming osteoblasts to contribute to the healing process. Authors provided evidences that αSMA-CreER-labeled cells express skeletal stem cell (SSC) markers and these cells maintain the expression of SSC markers for long period of time. Further, αSMA+ cells labeled at the time of injury make major contribute to bone healing process by turning into osteoblasts. However, the notion of the periosteal stem cell heterogeneity is not new and authors did not show new models, new functions and/or mechanism of αSMA+ population as compared to the authors previous study before. Further, there are many important issues to be addressed.</p><p>1) As authors have acknowledged, αSMA+ cells are heterogeneous. In fact, another group already demonstrated that a subset of αSMA-GFP+ cells overlap with Mx1+ cells and these double labeled cells are long-term repopulating stem/progenitor cells on periosteum and contribute to bone healing process with serial transplantation capability. Thus, the study with single αSMA-CreER mouse model may not further specify long-term progenitors within highly heterogenous periosteal cells and in bone healing process following the fracture.</p><p>2) LRCs in Figure 2C arrows are not convincing. There are only a few cells in periosteum but majority of GFP+ LRCs are cortical osteocytes in Figure 2C. Therefore, there are high possibility of mixture of these population in GFP high gating. Progenitor marker analysis in Figure 2H and 2I is not clear. What are the cell source for CFU-F assay from Figure 2F and 2G? periosteum? Endosteum?</p><p>3) Authors mentioned that αSMA+ cells from the bone marrow in juvenile mice became osteoblasts and osteocytes after 17 days. In Figure S3, Osteocytes are quite obvious to tell from histological section, while osteoblasts are not easy to make this conclusion without additional markers. it could be helpful to use the αSMA-CreER/Col2.3-GFP mice to investigate what proportion of αSMA+ cells turn into osteoblasts under normal bone homeostasis.</p><p>4) In previous literature, αSMA-GFP+ cells in periosteum are heterogeneous and only a subset (~25%) of them showed periosteal SSC characteristics (Ortinau et al., 2019). In Figure 3, authors claimed that αSMACreER-labeled cells are long-term osteochondroprogenitor cells. Are all αSMA-labeled cells long-term progenitors? In fact in supplemental figure, authors showed that αSMACreER-labeled cells are weak or no H2B-GFP (LRCs). Please explain this discrepancy.</p><p>5) From injury model of Figure 3, authors claimed that αSMA-labeled cells at the time of fracture make a major contribution to newly formed osteoblasts in the marrow compartment. However, it is hard to define the source of these cells as bone marrow αSMA+ cells. First, Figure S3 shows there are some αSMA+ cells in bone marrow regions (Figure S3E). Second, fracture model from current study have potential of having mixture of periosteum and bone marrow cells in both periosteum and bone marrow regions at the fracture site. Therefore, the source of those αSMA+Col2.3GFP+ cells in bone marrow compartment shown in Figure 3E is not clear.</p><p>6) In Figure 3F and H, authors showed that αSMA-labeled cells contribute to most fracture callus osteoblasts (~80%) at D+1 tam but only ~20% of osteoblasts at D+90 tam. If the labeled cells are long-term repopulating stem cells, their osteoblast contribution should be stable over the time. These results likely implicate that αSMA-labeled cells are not long-term repopulating progenitors. It will be more convincing if authors trace αSMA-labeled cells even longer time (8-10 months).</p><p>7) Figure 4G shows the transplantation of αSMA-labeled cells in a calvarial defect with a few osteoblast differentiation from αSMA+ cells.

Serial transplantation will be more informative.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58534.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All three reviewers agree that the authors have performed extensive amount of work to support the major conclusion that different osteoprogenitors in the periosteum are involved in fracture healing. However, they all have raised the same concern regarding the limited novelty of the study which is a weakness of this paper. There is now a general agreement in the literature that different cells in the periosteum contribute to the skeletal development. Since the αSMA-labeled cells characterized in this study is considered heterogeneous, the delayed healing in the αSMA depleted mice is not surprising. It is recommended that you consider performing additional experiments based on the comments of the reviewers provided below and rewrite the manuscript focused on the novel aspects of the paper during the revision.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript extensively. While the idea of heterogeneity of progenitors is becoming more commonplace, this is a recent development, and a lot of the literature, even in the past 10 years, appears to assume that there is one stem cell population that gives rise to osteoblasts in animals at various ages, and in settings including homeostasis and injury. Our study presents novel in vivo experimental data that proves there are separate populations contributing to fracture healing, and strongly suggests that the periosteum contains unique progenitor populations. We therefore believe it is an important contribution to the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Much attention has been focused recently in the skeletal biology research in characterizing the skeletal progenitors in the periosteum using various stem cell markers and evaluating their role in fracture healing. These studies have led to identification of a number of self-renewing skeletal stem cell populations (Nestin+; Mx1+αSMA+; Cathepsin K +) in the periosteum (Deveza et al., 2018; Ortinau et al., 2019; Debnath et al., 2018; Tournaire et al., 2020). Furthermore, these studies have identified stem cells in the periosteum to contribute significantly to fracture healing. In this study, Mathews et al. first characterized the putative mesenchymal stem cell markers in the periosteum, endosteum and bone marrow of adult mice. They further used lineage tracing strategy to identify αSMA cells in the periosteum to contribute to approximately 80% of osteoblasts and 40% of chondrocytes following fracture. Based on the finding that ablation of SMA+ cells reduced fracture callus volume and bone mass, it is concluded long-term, slow cycling SMA+ periosteal stem cells are functionally important for bone and cartilage formation during fracture healing. Since identifying cells that contribute to repair of fractured bone is important to the goal of developing therapies to promote healing of nonunion fractures, research in this area is of translational value. Overall, the manuscript is well written and the findings are clearly described. However, there are a number of issues that need the authors attention during the revision of this manuscript.</p><p>1) The first part of the studies is focused on characterizing the stem cell surface markers in the different regions of bone, i.e. periosteum, endosteum and bone marrow. These studies seem to clearly show evidence for presence of different populations of stem cells with different osteogenic potential in the different bone compartments. It would have been worthwhile to characterize which of these different populations, for example, Sca1+, CD51+; CD90+; Sca1-, CD51+, CD90-CD105-) are positive for SMA or other known markers of periosteal stem cells (nestin, cathepsin-k). Thus, there seems to be no connection between the first part of the studies and the subsequent studies that are focused on cells expressing SMA.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reorganized the presentation of the data to improve the flow and the integration of the αSMA data with the rest of the results focusing on characterizing periosteal progenitor populations. We have added quantification of αSMA+ cells within the Sca1/CD51 populations, and CD90/CD105 populations in Figure 2—figure supplement 2D, Results subsection “Putative mesenchymal stem cell markers are enriched in periosteum”. Since Nestin and CatK are not cell surface markers that can be evaluated without transgenic lines, we were not able to assess the overlap of these populations. We have, however, included all these markers, and various others used in recent studies, in the evaluation of αSMA+ cells’ gene expression (Figure 3D). CatK expression was detected in 79/529 αSMA+ cells. Most of these cells (90%) were within the progenitor and fibroblast-like clusters (#1 and 2). Nestin was detected in 15/529 cells, the majority (67%) of which were in the perivascular-like cluster 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Fracture healing involves both intramembranous and endochondral ossification. Cartilage formation occurs early by chondrocytes which is subsequently converted to bone via endochondral ossification. Periosteal stem cells have been shown to contribute to both formation of chondrocyte-mediated endochondral bone formation as well as osteoblast-mediated intramembranous bone formation. In a recent study, Debnath et al. (Nature 562:133, 2018) showed that cathepsin-k positive periosteal cells contributed to intramembranous bone formation. In addition, recent studies also demonstrate that chondrocytes can directly transdifferentiate into bone forming osteoblasts during postnatal bone formation and fracture repair. Thus, the issues of whether there are different sub populations of stem cells in the periosteum that contribute to chondrocytes and osteoblasts during endochondral bone formation and osteoblasts during intramembranous bone formation and the extent to which the SMA+ stem cells in the periosteum contribute to the different cell types that contribute to the fracture healing remain unresolved.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed a much more thorough characterization and quantification of αSMA+ cell contribution to fracture healing than other studies in the literature that have characterized other progenitor markers that we are aware of. While Debnath et al. report that CatK<sup>+</sup> progenitors show intramembranous bone formation upon transplantation, they demonstrate some contribution to fibrocartilage following fracture in vivo (see extended data Figure 8 in their publication) (Debnath et al., 2018). The CatK model is problematic for lineage tracing since it is a constitutive Cre that doesn’t enable temporal understanding of the CatK expression. Reaching a consensus on mesenchymal/osteoprogenitor cell identity will require the research community to compile data from numerous lineage tracing models to confirm contribution of different cell populations. There is a great deal more to understand, but we believe that our data using αSMACreER and Col2.3CreER clearly demonstrate that there are different populations contributing to healing, and some of these populations are lineage-restricted. We therefore think this is an important contribution to the field that can be considered in the context of other results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The data in Figure 3 showing that SMA identifies long term progenitor cells in the periosteum seem very interesting. The contribution of SMA+ cells to osteoblasts was evaluated at day 7 after fracture healing. In the closed femur mid-shaft fracture model, cartilage callus is more predominant at day 7. One would, therefore, expect much more chondrocytes at day 7 fracture healing while at later stages around day 10-14, there are more osteoblasts. Accordingly, Figures 3E-G show that while there abundant SMA+ cells in the fracture callus area, the number of osteoblasts seem limited which could be due to the early time point used for histology when one would anticipate higher chondrocytes in the callus area. However, the quantitative data in Figure 3H show that 80% of Tom+ cells are osteoblasts which seem to be inconsistent with the data seen in Figure 3E.</p></disp-quote><p>The data the reviewer is referring to (now Figure 1E-I) actually present the percent of Col2.3GFP+ osteoblasts that are Tom+ (dual positive cells/GFP+) rather than the proportion of SMA cells differentiating into osteoblasts. The reviewer’s comment about the dynamics of osteoblast and chondrocyte numbers in the callus are correct – there are generally fewer osteoblasts at day 7, and almost no chondrocytes by day 14, which is why this cell type was only analyzed in the day 7 callus. We analyzed both time points for osteoblasts as we hypothesized that there could be different cells contributing to osteoblasts at different phases of healing. Our data do not support this hypothesis, and we restricted certain analyses such as the 90 day chase to day 7 only. The different time points are now mentioned in the Results section: “The contribution of αSMA-labeled cells was similar in both the initial intramembranous bone formation in the day 7 callus, and the more fully mineralized day 14 callus.” We did not present additional data about the fracture composition as it is well-established, and we felt it made it more difficult to clearly present our findings. However, we clarified the parameter that is presented in both the Materials and methods: <italic>“</italic>We calculated the number of cells that were GFP+ or Osx+ (osteoblasts), the number that were Tom+, and the percentage of osteoblasts that were Tom+ (dual positive cells/osteoblasts).”; and the figure legend for Figure 1. In addition, we have added much more detailed source data for Figure 1G-I which shows all the key outputs from the image analysis. By comparing the GFP+ values in column N for day 7 and day 14, it is clear that the proportion of osteoblasts in the callus tends to increase over the time course. We hope this will make it clearer to readers what analysis is presented.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) To investigate the contribution of the SMA+ cells to fracture healing, the authors have used an established ROSA-DTA mouse model to ablate SMA expressing cells. The fracture phenotype in this model is not adequately characterized. The phenotype is evaluated only at one time point which is day 14 which seems early. Three and four week time points are more appropriate to evaluate if fracture healing is impaired. Time course studies of histological evaluation of cartilage and bone matrix would provide some mechanistic information on whether the reduced callus bone mass is due to reduced cartilage formation, impaired endochondral ossification or defective periosteal bridging.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the DTA ablation studies as a proof of principle that αSMA+ cells have a functional role in the fracture healing process, but limited the evaluation as this is not a physiologically relevant model, and there are potentially other effects of ablating αSMA+ cells that affect the health of the animals. We have added additional data to what is now Figure 7, and the accompanying Results section. We have confirmed that the callus area and mineralized area are reduced histologically at 14 DPF, and now present microCT data from 21 DPF. The phenotype at day 21 is more subtle, but still indicates a deficiency in fracture healing. The following statement has been added to the results to describe this process: “Overall, our data demonstrate that partial ablation of αSMA+ progenitors reduced callus formation and delayed mineralization. The less severe phenotype at 21 DPF suggests this may be a delay in healing rather than complete disruption of the process, although the fractures from mice with αSMA-ablation probably never reach the size of control calluses. Healing in the DTA mice may still progress due to compensation of αSMA+ progenitors that escaped ablation, or larger contribution from αSMA-negative progenitors in this setting.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors investigate heterogeneity of periosteal progenitor cells using a multitude of approaches, such as markers for skeletal stem cells, label-retaining assays and lineage tracing studies of cells expressing αSMA-CreER and Col2.3-CreER. They found that SSC markers are particularly enriched in αSMA-labeled label-retaining periosteal cells that contribute to fracture healing. This strength of this study is an extensive application of cutting-edge mouse genetic and flow cytometry technologies to characterize periosteal cells.</p><p>1) The novelty of this study is not clear from the manuscript. I see the value of a wealth of important information presented here, including periosteal SSC marker expression, label-retaining cells and SMA-labeled cells in fracture healing. However, most of the major findings have been already reported elsewhere by the authors' group and others. For example, the enrichment of SSCs in the periosteum has been reported by Duchamp de Lageneste et al., 2018, and the role of αSMA+ cells in fracture healing has been reported by the authors' group (Matthews et al., 2014; Grevic et al., 2012). The way it is presented now does not really convey the progress that they made in this study. This is the critical point that the authors need to carefully address in any revision of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reorganized the manuscript in a way that better highlights the important findings and improves the cohesiveness. While some of the observations have been reported in other studies, we believe that it is important to have multiple lines of evidence from a variety of sources to support the presence and definition of different populations of stem/progenitor cells within the periosteum. More importantly, while other studies imply heterogeneity of healing-related progenitors, our study shows direct evidence of this through in vivo lineage tracing of different populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Heterogeneity of periosteal cells is not experimentally examined in this study, although this point is emphasized in the title. They present many findings without much cohesiveness, though each of which is quite interesting. The authors suggest that αSMA+ cells are composed of short-term and long-term cells that differentially contribute to fracture healing. Single cell RNA-seq analyses of αSMA+ cells would be essential to support this central theme.</p></disp-quote><p>Flow cytometry data indicates heterogeneity with respect to surface marker expression, however we have extended this by adding single cell RNAseq data for αSMA+ cells to the revised manuscript (Figure 3 and supplements). This data has indicated heterogeneity in the population, and shifts in relative abundance of the populations over time. Further studies will be required, potentially with the use of new genetic tools, to confirm the roles of these subpopulations, but we believe this new data strengthens our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should present additional histological data to support their important findings. They stated that LRCs were mostly found in the inner cambium layer of the periosteum. However, no high magnification image is provided to support this claim, with appropriate counterstaining. In addition, the authors raised a very interesting theory that PaS cells might be located in the periosteum. They should perform immunostaining for PDGFRa and Sca1, and provide evidence that these cells are indeed present in the periosteum. This will enhance the novelty of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>High magnification of H2B-GFP expression in the periosteum is shown in what is now Figure 4—figure supplement 1. We have added additional annotation to this figure to indicate labeled cells within the inner layer of the periosteum. Unfortunately, we don’t have counterstained images available, but we believe that the DAPI staining clearly demonstrates the location within the periosteum.</p><p>We have added additional data addressing the use of PDGFRα, and this is presented in Figure 8 and the accompanying Results section. Both immunostaining and Cre-mediated labeling indicated that PDGFRα expression is very prevalent in the periosteum, likely more so than our flow data suggested. Unfortunately we were unable to achieve dual Sca1/PDGFRα staining of suitable quality for publication in the current circumstances. However, the new data we present indicates serious caveats of using PDGFRα as an osteoprogenitor marker, primarily due to clear expression in the osteoblast layer, that we thought were important to include, and we have altered the Results and Discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Current studies have evaluated that αSMA+ progenitor cells are long-term label retaining cells and majority of them are present in particularly on periosteum. These cells are activated with injury and become bone forming osteoblasts to contribute to the healing process. Authors provided evidences that αSMA-CreER-labeled cells express skeletal stem cell (SSC) markers and these cells maintain the expression of SSC markers for long period of time. Further, αSMA+ cells labeled at the time of injury make major contribute to bone healing process by turning into osteoblasts.

The data from other studies including the Ortinau study, and Debnath et al. 2018 (Debnath et al., 2018; Ortinau et al., 2019), as well as our data, suggest that transplantation results do not completely recapitulate in vivo differentiation potential as we generally see osteogenic differentiation only in following transplantation, while observing osteochondrogenic potential in the fracture setting. In the revised manuscript, we have changed the order to emphasize novel findings, added new data to confirm self-renewal, as well as single cell RNAseq data to further characterize the αSMA+ population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) LRCs in Figure 2C arrows are not convincing.

As mentioned in the results, over 20% of αSMA-labeled cells were LRCs, and we have added additional annotation to what is now Figure 4—figure supplement 1 to show this histologically as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) From injury model of Figure 3, authors claimed that αSMA-labeled cells at the time of fracture make a major contribution to newly formed osteoblasts in the marrow compartment. However, it is hard to define the source of these cells as bone marrow αSMA+ cells. First, Figure S3 shows there are some αSMA+ cells in bone marrow regions (Figure S3E). Second, fracture model from current study have potential of having mixture of periosteum and bone marrow cells in both periosteum and bone marrow regions at the fracture site. Therefore, the source of those αSMA+Col2.3GFP+ cells in bone marrow compartment shown in Figure 3E is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that we cannot completely exclude some bone marrow contribution in the fracture model, however the weight of evidence in the literature indicates that when present, the periosteum is the major contributor to fracture callus formation. We have also performed preliminary studies with a periosteal scratch model where the cortex is not injured, and demonstrated formation of a callus containing αSMA-labeled cells (data not shown). In addition, there is clear evidence indicating that bone marrow/endosteum-derived cells do not form fibrocartilage in vivo, and we see fibrocartilage near the fracture site in most day 7 samples (Colnot et al., 2009). On this basis, combined with our data indicating αSMA+ cells are present but much rarer in the endosteum (new Figure 2D), we have persisted with our interpretation that the cells contributing to the fracture callus osteoblasts and chondrocytes are primarily derived from the periosteum. The majority of the bone formation in the bone marrow compartment is around the pin and is usually in the proximal area of the bone at least 1mm from the fracture site. We also never see evidence of chondrocytes. On this basis, we are fairly confident that bone marrow-resident cells are responsible for this bone formation. The text has been modified to clarify this:</p><p>“Following the pin insertion and fracture, bone formation also occurs inside the marrow compartment, particularly in the proximal diaphysis surrounding the pin over 1mm from the fracture site (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 3F and H, authors showed that αSMA-labeled cells contribute to most fracture callus osteoblasts (~80%) at D+1 tam but only ~20% of osteoblasts at D+90 tam.

As explained in the manuscript, the difference between the labeling at the time of fracture, and 90 days before is likely to be primarily due to cells that activate αSMA expression soon after injury. It is also notable that contribution stabilizes between 42 and 90 days chase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 4G shows the transplantation of αSMA-labeled cells in a calvarial defect with a few osteoblast differentiation from αSMA+ cells.

We have included a different experiment to address self-renewal of these cells in the new Figure 6 where two cycles of fractures were performed (tamoxifen labeling, initial fracture, healing for 8 weeks, secondary fracture at same site). This shows significant contributions of initially αSMA-labeled cells to secondary fracture healing, even if the initial tamoxifen labeling was 14 days before fracture. This strongly suggests identification of at least a subset of self-renewing progenitors. We believe this experimental design is more physiologically relevant, particularly as there are many technical challenges involved in serial transplantation experiments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
