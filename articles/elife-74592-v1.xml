Diaphragm development requires the coordinated development of muscle, connective tissue, and nerve, which are derived from different embryonic sources. Defects in diaphragm development cause the common and often lethal birth defect, congenital diaphragmatic hernias (CDH). HGF/MET signaling is required for diaphragm muscularization, but the source of HGF and the specific functions of this pathway in muscle progenitors and effects on phrenic nerve have not been explicitly tested. Using conditional mutagenesis in mice and pharmacological inhibition of MET, we demonstrate that the pleuroperitoneal folds (PPFs), transient embryonic structures that give rise to the connective tissue in the diaphragm, are the source of HGF critical for diaphragm muscularization. PPF-derived HGF is directly required for recruitment of MET+ muscle progenitors to the diaphragm and indirectly (via its effect on muscle development) required for phrenic nerve primary branching. In addition, HGF is continuously required for maintenance and motility of the pool of progenitors to enable full muscularization. Localization of HGF at the diaphragm’s leading edges directs dorsal and ventral expansion of muscle and regulates its overall size and shape. Surprisingly, large muscleless regions in <italic>HGF</italic> and <italic>Met</italic> mutants do not lead to hernias. While these regions are likely more susceptible to CDH, muscle loss is not sufficient to cause CDH.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>diaphragm</kwd><kwd>HGF</kwd><kwd>MET</kwd><kwd>CDH</kwd><kwd>muscle</kwd><kwd>fibroblasts</kwd><kwd>cell culture</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD087360</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kardon</surname><given-names>Gabrielle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 HD093425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sefton</surname><given-names>Elizabeth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99HD101682</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sefton</surname><given-names>Elizabeth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HD104317</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kardon</surname><given-names>Gabrielle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wheeler Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kardon</surname><given-names>Gabrielle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>HGF derived from fibroblasts is critical for complete muscularization of the mammalian diaphragm, and loss-of-function experiments reveal that partial muscularization of the diaphragm is not sufficient to cause congenital diaphragmatic hernias.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The diaphragm is an essential skeletal muscle and a defining feature of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perry et al., 2010</xref>). Contraction of the diaphragm, lying at the base of the thoracic cavity, powers the inspiration phase of respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 1970</xref>). The diaphragm also serves an important passive function as a barrier separating the thoracic from the abdominal cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perry et al., 2010</xref>). Respiration by the diaphragm is carried out by the domed costal muscle, composed of a radial array of myofibers surrounded by muscle connective tissue, extending laterally from the ribs and medially to a central tendon, and innervated by the phrenic nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Merrell and Kardon, 2013</xref>). Diaphragm development requires coordination of multiple embryonic tissues: (1) somites are well established as the source of the diaphragm’s muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babiuk et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bladt et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dietrich et al., 1999</xref>), (2) the cervical neural tube gives rise to the phrenic nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allan and Greer, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allan and Greer, 1997b</xref>), and (3) the pleuroperitoneal folds (PPFs), paired mesodermal structures located between the thoracic (pleural) and abdominal (peritoneal) cavities, form the muscle connective tissue and central tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Merrell et al., 2015</xref>). Integration of these three tissues into a functional diaphragm is critical, but how their development is coordinated and integrated is largely unknown.</p><p>Defects in the development of the diaphragm cause congenital diaphragmatic hernias (CDH), a common (1 in 3000 births) and costly ($250 million per year in the US) birth defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pober, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raval et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Torfs et al., 1992</xref>). CDH compromises the integrity of the diaphragm by effecting muscularization, leading to an incomplete barrier between the abdominal and thoracic cavities. As a result, the liver herniates into the thorax, impeding lung development and resulting in long-term morbidity and up to 50% neonatal mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colvin et al., 2005</xref>). Correct innervation of the diaphragm by the phrenic nerve is also essential, as breathing must be functional by birth and fetal breathing movements are important for normal lung development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jansen and Chernick, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Recruitment of muscle progenitors and targeting of phrenic nerve axons to the nascent diaphragm are essential first steps for correct diaphragm development. The receptor tyrosine kinase signaling cascade initiated by the binding of the ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) to its receptor MET is a promising candidate pathway for regulating these steps of diaphragm development as HGF/MET signaling has been implicated in multiple aspects of muscle and motor neuron development (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birchmeier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maina and Klein, 1999</xref>). HGF binding to MET leads to MET phosphorylation and the activation of multiple downstream pathways, including JNK, MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and FAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Organ and Tsao, 2011</xref>). HGF/MET signaling is a critical regulator of muscle progenitors migrating from somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bladt et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dietrich et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maina et al., 1996</xref>). HGF is also critical for innervation. HGF acts as a chemoattractant, required for correct guidance of MET+ motor neuron axons to target muscles in the developing limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ebens et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamamoto et al., 1997</xref>), and MET signaling is required for distinct functions in different motor neuron pools, including axon growth in the latissimus dorsi and motor neuron survival in the pectoralis minor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lamballe et al., 2011</xref>). However, these reports do not distinguish between the effect of HGF on muscle versus nerve or rely on in vitro experiments. Thus, HGF/MET signaling has complex, tissue-specific roles in regulating the neuromuscular system.</p><p>Here we dissect the role of HGF/MET signaling in muscularization and innervation of the diaphragm. In previous studies, <italic>Met</italic> mutations have been associated with CDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Longoni et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>Hgf</italic> is downregulated in mutants or pharmacological treatments that induce diaphragmatic hernias in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Merrell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Met</italic> null mice lack all diaphragm musculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bladt et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dietrich et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maina et al., 1996</xref>). However, which cells are the source of HGF and what steps of diaphragm muscle development HGF/MET signaling regulates is unclear. Using conditional mutagenesis, pharmacological treatments, and an in vitro primary cell culture system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bogenschutz et al., 2020</xref>), we demonstrate that the diaphragm’s connective tissue fibroblasts are a critical source of HGF that recruits and maintains MET+ muscle progenitors into and throughout the developing diaphragm. In addition, PPF-derived HGF, via its regulation of muscle, is required for defasciculation of the phrenic nerve. While either genetic or pharmacological inhibition of HGF/Met signaling results in large muscleless regions in the diaphragm, surprisingly these muscleless regions maintain their structural integrity and do not herniate. Thus, revising our previous conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Merrell et al., 2015</xref>), we now show that muscle loss is not sufficient to induce CDH and additional connective tissue defects are required to weaken the diaphragm.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Hgf</italic> and <italic>Met</italic> are expressed in the developing diaphragm</title><p>To begin dissecting the precise role(s) of HGF/MET signaling in diaphragm development, we investigated the expression of <italic>Hgf</italic> and <italic>Met</italic> in the early diaphragm. We first examined mouse embryos at embryonic day (E) 10.5 when muscle progenitors are migrating from cervical somites to the nascent diaphragm and progenitors have already populated the forelimb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sefton et al., 2018</xref>). At this stage, <italic>Hgf</italic> is expressed in the mesoderm lateral to the somites (but not in the somites themselves) and in the limb bud mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), while <italic>Met</italic> is expressed in the somites and the muscle progenitors in the limb bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sonnenberg et al., 1993</xref>). At E11.5, muscle progenitors have migrated into the PPFs of the diaphragm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sefton et al., 2018</xref>). During this stage, <italic>Hgf</italic> is expressed throughout the pyramidal PPFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, arrows), while <italic>Met</italic> is expressed in a more restricted region in the PPFs (presumably in muscle progenitors; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), in limb muscle progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sonnenberg et al., 1993</xref>), as well as the phrenic nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). By E12.5, the PPFs have expanded ventrally and dorsally across the surface of the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Merrell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sefton et al., 2018</xref>). Strikingly, <italic>Hgf</italic> is restricted to the ventral and dorsal leading edges of the PPFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, arrows and asterisks). Although <italic>Met</italic> is no longer detectable by whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization, qPCR indicates that it is still expressed at E12.5 at comparable cycle threshold values to <italic>Hgf</italic> and <italic>Pax7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These expression patterns suggest that HGF expressed in the mesoderm adjacent to the somites, PPF fibroblasts, and limb bud fibroblasts activates MET signaling in the diaphragm, limb muscle progenitors, and phrenic nerve.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fibroblast-derived <italic>Hgf</italic> and somite-derived <italic>Met</italic> are required for muscularization of the diaphragm and limb.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lateral view at embryonic day (E) 10.5 of <italic>Hgf</italic> expression in lateral mesoderm adjacent to somites (arrow) and limb.

In summary, these data establish that HGF derived from PPF and limb fibroblasts induces MET signaling in somite-derived myogenic cells, which is required for muscularization of the diaphragm and the limbs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Diaphragm and shoulder muscle progenitors require fibroblast-derived <italic>Hgf</italic> during a similar temporal window</title><p>HGF/MET signaling is required for both diaphragm and limb muscle, but it is unclear whether <italic>Hgf</italic> is required during the same temporal window for development of diaphragm and forelimb muscles. This question is of particular interest because it has been proposed that a subset of shoulder muscle progenitors were recruited into the nascent PPFs during evolution, leading to the muscularization of the diaphragm in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirasawa and Kuratani, 2013</xref>). If this were the case, shoulder muscle progenitors would be expected to migrate at a similar time and under the control of HGF/MET signaling as diaphragm progenitors in extant mammals. To dissect the temporal requirement for fibroblast-derived <italic>Hgf</italic> for diaphragm and forelimb muscles, we examined these muscles in E16.5–18.5 <italic>Pdgfra<sup>CreERT2/+</sup>; Hgf<sup>Δ/flox</sup></italic> mice given tamoxifen at E9.5 or E10.5, when muscle progenitors are actively delaminating from the somites and migrating into the nascent diaphragm and forelimb. We initially gave 6 mg of tamoxifen at E9.5, but only two embryos survived. Based on these two embryos, there was no obvious difference between 6 mg versus 3 mg tamoxifen on muscle: one embryo given 6 mg had muscleless limbs and diaphragm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Q–T</xref>), while the other had partial muscle in the diaphragm with normal limb muscle. Therefore, we used 3 mg of tamoxifen for all subsequent experiments and compared diaphragm and limb defects in individual embryos (each row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows diaphragm and forelimb muscle from a single embryo). In the most mildly affected embryos, the diaphragm is missing a small ventral patch of muscle with normal forelimb muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>; n = 3/10, compare with control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). In the most severely affected case, both the forelimb and diaphragm are muscleless (n = 1/10). A small number of mutants had muscleless diaphragms, but normal forelimb muscles (n = 2/10). Strikingly, a subset of mutants had muscleless (or nearly muscleless) diaphragms and displayed specific defects in shoulder musculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–P</xref>; n = 4/10). The acromiodeltoid was absent or reduced and mispatterned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L and P</xref>) and the spinodeltoid was strongly reduced in size, while other forelimb muscles appeared normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and O</xref>). In all cases, the body wall muscles developed normally (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Q</xref>). When tamoxifen was given at E10.5, diaphragms had partial muscle, with normal forelimb muscles (n = 3/3; data not shown). In summary, muscleless limbs are always accompanied by a muscleless diaphragm, suggesting that these embryos had an early defect whereby muscle progenitors were unable to delaminate from the somites and migrate into nascent forelimbs and diaphragm. Partially muscularized diaphragms are associated with normal limb muscle. While a muscleless or nearly muscleless diaphragm may or may not have accompanying limb defects, loss of shoulder muscle was always associated with a muscleless or nearly muscleless diaphragm. These intermediate phenotypes indicate that most muscle progenitors migrate into the forelimb in advance of progenitors migrating into the diaphragm. However, based on their similar temporal sensitivity to HGF/MET signaling, the shoulder acromiodeltoid and spinodeltoid progenitors migrate at a similar time as the diaphragm progenitors. Thus continued expression of <italic>Hgf</italic> at this later developmental time point is required for recruitment of muscle cells necessary for development of diaphragm and shoulder muscles.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Reduced and mispatterned acromiodeltoid and spinodeltoid accompanies loss of diaphragm muscle following deletion of <italic>Hgf</italic> in the <italic>Pdgfra</italic> lineage.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Diaphragm and limb musculature in control <italic>Pdgfra<sup>CreERT2/+</sup>; Hgf <sup>fl/+</sup></italic> given 3 mg tamoxifen at embryonic day (E) 9.5.

However, the function of HGF and MET in the development of the phrenic nerve, the sole source of motor innervation in the diaphragm, has not been examined.

By E12.0, in control mice the phrenic nerve has reached the PPFs and defasciculates into numerous small branchpoints prior to the full extension of the three primary branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, arrows). However, in <italic>Hgf<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> mutants, while the phrenic nerves reach the surface of the diaphragm, they do not correctly branch and defasciculate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Instead of arborizing into numerous small branches, the right phrenic nerve bifurcates around the vena cava (n = 3/3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and the left phrenic nerve fails to defasciculate to the same extent as in control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

While the phrenic nerves reach the muscleless diaphragm, they lack primary and secondary branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, arrows). Thus, loss of PPF-derived HGF leads to both muscle defects and phrenic nerve defasciculation defects. Similar defasciculation phenotypes are also present in <italic>Met<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> mutants. Confocal analysis of E11.5 diaphragms, when the phrenic nerve is just reaching the PPFs, reveals that defasciculation defects are present in <italic>Met<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> mutants by this early time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I and J</xref>).

We administered daily doses of BMS777607 to pregnant females to temporally inhibit MET signaling. In vehicle-treated controls harvested at E17.5, the diaphragm is completely muscularized (n = 12/12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). When BMS777607 was administered daily between E7.5 and E12.5, all embryos (n = 7/7) displayed bilateral dorsal muscleless patches and a ventral muscleless region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, arrows). When treated at E8.5–E9.5 or E9.5–10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>), all diaphragms had ventral muscleless regions (n = 14/14) and 35% had dorsal muscleless regions (n = 5/14). When treated at E11.5 and E12.5, after diaphragm progenitors have fully delaminated from the somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sefton et al., 2018</xref>), embryos had ventral muscleless regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>; n = 8/8) and dorsal muscleless regions (n = 3/8). Quantification of the size of the ventral muscleless region indicates that all MET inhibition strategies lead to muscleless regions, with the largest muscleless regions when MET is inhibited E7.5–E12.5 or E8.5–E9.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These data demonstrate that MET is continuously required from E7.5 to E12.5 for complete muscularization of the diaphragm. The regions requiring continuous MET signaling are on the leading edges of the diaphragm: the bilateral dorsal muscle and ventral midline muscle. These are the last regions to receive muscle progenitors that differentiate into myofibers. For both <italic>Hgf</italic> deletion in fibroblasts and global MET inhibition, loss during muscle migration from somites at approximately E9.5 leads to dorsal and ventral muscleless regions, while later loss at E11.5 leads to primarily ventral muscleless regions.

Not only is the diaphragm a functionally important muscle, but it serves as an excellent system to study muscle patterning and morphogenesis, since it is a flat muscle that largely develops in two dimensions. Development of the diaphragm, like other skeletal muscles, requires the integration of muscle, connective tissue, and nerve that arise from different embryonic sources. Our study establishes that the connective tissue fibroblasts are the source of a molecular signal, HGF, that directly controls the recruitment, survival, and expansion of MET+ muscle progenitors and indirectly, via muscle, regulates phrenic nerve branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of HGF-MET signaling in skeletal muscle and phrenic nerve in the diaphragm.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Our data support a model where pleuroperitoneal fold (PPF) fibroblast-derived HGF directly regulates recruitment, survival, and expansion of MET+ muscle progenitors (in red) and indirectly, via muscle, regulates phrenic nerve (in yellow) branching and outgrowth.

The connective tissue is an ideal candidate tissue to orchestrate this process as it enwraps myofibers and neuromuscular junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nassari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sefton and Kardon, 2019</xref>). In the diaphragm, the PPFs are the source of the diaphragm’s connective tissue fibroblasts and critical for overall diaphragm morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Merrell et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the PPFs are likely to coordinately regulate muscle and the phrenic nerve. A number of previous studies also suggested that HGF/MET is a key signaling pathway for this coordination since it has been found to regulate both muscle development and innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bladt et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dietrich et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ebens et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lamballe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maina et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamamoto et al., 1997</xref>). In addition, previous studies established that <italic>Met</italic> is required for diaphragm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bladt et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dietrich et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maina et al., 1996</xref>). Here, we used conditional mutagenesis to specifically target <italic>Hgf</italic> and <italic>Met</italic> in PPF-derived connective tissue fibroblasts or muscle progenitors to genetically dissect the role of these cells and HGF/MET signaling in diaphragm development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). First, as expected we found that HGF/MET signaling is required for the initial delamination and migration of MET+ muscle progenitors from the somites to the nascent diaphragm. More surprisingly, we found that HGF expressed at the dorsal and ventral margins of the expanding PPFs is continuously required for proliferation, survival, and motility of muscle progenitors and the consequent expansion and full muscularization of the diaphragm. Our experiments also showed that, unlike the muscle progenitors, HGF/MET signaling is not required for the recruitment and targeting of phrenic nerve axons to the nascent diaphragm. However, PPF-derived HGF, through its regulation of muscle, is required for phrenic nerve defasciculation, primary branching, and subsequent branch outgrowth throughout the diaphragm muscle. Previous studies have identified how phrenic motor neurons are specified in the motor column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dasen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dasen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dasen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rousso et al., 2008</xref>) and later arborize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Philippidou et al., 2012</xref>) to form neuromuscular junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burden, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yumoto et al., 2012</xref>). Only one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Uetani et al., 2006</xref>) has identified molecular regulators, Receptor Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases σ and δ, of phrenic nerve defasciculation and primary axon outgrowth. Altogether our study demonstrates that PPF-derived connective tissue fibroblasts and HGF directly control diaphragm muscle recruitment and expansion and indirectly, via muscle and the neurotrophic factors it expresses, control phrenic nerve branching and outgrowth. Connective tissue and HGF are also likely to regulate the development of other muscles and their motor neurons as connective tissue and HGF/MET signaling have been implicated in the development and innervation of limb and back muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caruso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Helmbacher, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our study also provides insights into how the diaphragm might have evolved. The diaphragm muscle is unique to mammals and how it evolved in mammals is a major unanswered question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perry et al., 2010</xref>). Evolution of the diaphragm involved the acquisition of developmental innovations in mammals that are absent from birds and reptiles. Comparison of these groups suggests the following important developmental innovations: formation and expansion of PPFs across the liver to separate the thoracic and abdominal cavities, recruitment of muscle progenitors to the PPFs and their expansion and differentiation into the radial array of myofibers, and recruitment and targeting of motor neurons to the diaphragm muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirasawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirasawa and Kuratani, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sefton et al., 2018</xref>). HGF/MET signaling has important, conserved functions in the development of most vertebrate hypaxial muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adachi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haines et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Okamoto et al., 2019</xref>). Here we identify that <italic>Hgf</italic> expressed by the PPFs is crucial for recruitment and expansion of diaphragm muscle progenitors. Our experiments conditionally deleting <italic>Hgf</italic> also indicate that migration of diaphragm and shoulder (spinodeltoid and acromiodeltoid) muscle progenitors is <italic>Hgf</italic>-dependent and occurs contemporaneously. Recruitment of shoulder muscle progenitors to the nascent diaphragm has been proposed as important for the evolutionary origin of the mammalian diaphragm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirasawa and Kuratani, 2013</xref>). Thus, our experiments suggest that the evolutionary acquisition of <italic>Hgf</italic> expression in the PPFs may have been a key event that allowed a subset of shoulder muscle progenitors to be recruited to the nascent diaphragm. Our experiments also indicate that continued <italic>Hgf</italic> expression is critical for the full muscularization of the diaphragm. Therefore, once <italic>Hgf</italic> was expressed in the PPFs there may have been selection for its continued expression at the PPF’s leading edges to enable expansion of the muscle and complete separation of the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Localization of HGF at the leading edges provides a mechanism to regulate the directional expansion and shape of muscle by promoting survival and motility of muscle progenitors at the dorsal and ventral edges of the muscle. Interestingly, our data indicate that the evolutionary acquisition of <italic>Hgf</italic> expression in the PPFs is not sufficient to recruit motor neurons to the PPFs and so some other signal(s) must be involved in the evolutionary recruitment of the phrenic nerves. Also, still unknown are the developmental and evolutionary mechanisms driving formation and morphogenetic expansion of the PPFs.</p><p>Finally, our study elucidates some of the cellular mechanisms underlying the etiology of CDH. CDH is characterized by defects in the muscularization of the diaphragm, and two sites where muscle is commonly absent are the dorsal-most region of the diaphragm (designated posterior in humans and hernias in this area are called Bochdalek hernias) and the ventral-most diaphragm (anterior in humans and hernias here are called Morgagni hernias) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Irish et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kardon et al., 2017</xref>). Our analysis of diaphragms in which HGF/MET signaling is perturbed has found that these two regions are the most likely to have muscularization defects and suggests mechanistically why the dorsal-most and ventral-most diaphragm are most susceptible to muscularization defects. Mutations or variants in any gene or signaling pathway that, similar to HGF/MET, regulates the proliferation, survival, or motility of muscle progenitors will lead to a depletion of the pool of muscle progenitors and the consequent loss of the dorsal and ventral-most diaphragm muscle since these regions develop last (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Most surprisingly, our analysis revealed that the muscleless connective tissue regions in mice with deletion of <italic>Hgf</italic> in the PPFs or pharmacological inhibition of MET signaling do not herniate. We previously conducted a detailed analysis of mice in which the transcription factor <italic>Gata4</italic> was deleted in the PPFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Merrell et al., 2015</xref>). In these mice, muscleless connective tissue regions develop, but these regions always herniate and give rise to herniated tissue covered by a connective tissue sac. Based on our study of <italic>Gata4</italic>, we had proposed that such ‘sac’ hernias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pober, 2007</xref>) develop when localized regions of amuscular tissue develop in juxtaposition with muscularized tissue; the biomechanical difference in strength between these regions allows the abdominal tissues to herniate through the weaker amuscular regions. However, the lack of herniation in the <italic>Hgf</italic> mutants demonstrates that the formation of amuscular connective tissue regions is not sufficient to cause ‘sac’ hernias. While the formation of amuscular regions is likely a critical step in the formation of ‘sac’ hernias, other defects in connective tissue integrity are likely necessary to cause these susceptible amuscular regions to actually herniate. Thus, herniation may be a multistep process involving loss of muscle followed by defects in connective tissue strength or elasticity that allow the liver to herniate into the thoracic cavity. Comparison of amuscular connective tissue that maintains its structural integrity to herniated connective tissue may provide further insight into these processes and reveal therapeutic targets in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Carmen Birchmeier-Kohler as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Braun (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary</p><p>Sefton et al., analyze 'Fibroblast-derived HGF integrates muscle and nerve development during morphogenesis of the mammalian diaphragm'. The role of Met in the development of the muscle has been previously investigated by many papers, and roles in delamination of progenitor cells form the somites, in migration, survival, proliferation and differentiation have been described. The novel finding of the paper is a in depth analysis of the development of the diaphragm muscle, and the role of Met and HGF in the process. The authors provide evidence for the expression of HGF in pleuroperitoneal folds and for its requirement for muscle progenitor expansion and maintenance during diaphragm muscle formation. The reviewers found the manuscript clearly written and the experimental approach overall of high standard. However, there were several deficiencies noted that need to be addressed. The data supporting that HGF/Met function during development of the phrenic nerve was found to be less well supported and requiring additional experimental data to be included in the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revision</p><p>1) A major concern is the limited data on the role of Met in the development of the phrenic nerve. While it is well documented that HGF acts as a trophic factor for motor neurons in culture, its role in development of motor neurons has been highly debated. Moreover, careful genetic analyses previously demonstrated indirect mechanisms of Met during motor neuron development. Despite the weakness of the data on the role of Met in phrenic development, the role of HGF/Met in is strongly emphasized in abstract /intro/discussion. Data relying on motor neurons specific ablation of met need to be included in order to strengthen this point. Additional suggestions how to improve the analysis of phrenic development in Met-/+ animals are provided in the individual reviews appended below.</p><p>2) The authors should exclude a connective tissue phenotype in conditional HGF/Met mutants. Why is Prx1Cre used instead of PDGFRaCre to trace PPFs? In addition, the reason for the differences in phenotypes regarding dorsal/ventral diaphragm muscles after either HGF inactivation or Met-inhibitor treatment should be explained, or at least discussed. Is this due to timing of the mutation/inhibition, or to efficacy of ablation/inhibition?</p><p>3) The authors propose a role of Met in myogenic commitment, based on the co-culture experiments. Myogenic commitment implies a major role in myogenic lineage progression or differentiation. The evidence for that claim is weak and the reduced differentiation might be the consequence of increased cell death, reduced proliferation or other causes that change myoblast density. It is mandatory to address this issue appropriately, by analyzing both, fibroblast and myoblast cell numbers, proliferation, apoptosis, myogenic differentiation (i.e. ratio of MyoD/MyoG-positive cells).</p><p>4) A potentially interesting conclusion form the manuscript is hat hernia does only develop when both, connective tissue and muscle of the diaphragm are affected. Although this explanation is intriguing, the authors have to make sure that body wall muscles are fully developed, to exclude that the abdominal pressure is not reduced in mice conditional Met/HGF mutations. The images in Figures 1 and 2 seem to indicate normal development of body wall muscles but a dedicated statement in this respect would be helpful.</p><p>5) Treatment of WT embryos from E7.5 will impact on myogenic progenitor delamination, and this is also expected for Pax3CreKIMetnull/fl mutation. The authors have to dissociate the Met-related somite delamination, a migration of the progenitors to the diaphragm and the potential additional role of Met signaling in the colonization and expansion of myogenic progenitor cells in the anlage of the diaphragm.</p><p>6) Validation for the drug BMS777607 effectiveness in inhibiting MET downstream pathway should be performed and shown.</p><p>7) Comments referring to missing controls, scale bars, statistics need to be addressed.</p><p>Additional points: The authors should address wherever possible the other comments raised by the three reviewers (see below).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It was previously shown that HGF and Met controls development of the diaphragm muscle. In particular, the signal induces delamination and migration of muscle progenitor cells that colonize the diaphragm. The present manuscript by Sefton and coworkers confirms and extends these observations using (i) conditional mouse lines in which the HGF gene was targeted by Cre/loxP recombination in the pleuroperitoneal folds (Prx1-cre) and at other sites PdgfraCreERT2, and of (ii) Met inhibitors. Overall, the technical quality of the data on diaphragm muscle development is excellent; the conceptual advance over previous work is not exceptional; the evidence for Met/HGF-dependent development of the phrenic nerve is marginal and needs to be strengthened.</p><p>The data show that fibroblasts provide HGF signals received by Met in muscle progenitor cells that is essential for diaphragm development. The PdgfraCreERT2 line was used to demonstrate that HGF produced by fibroblasts but not by muscle progenitors is essential for diaphragm development. Moreover, development of dorsal and ventral regions of diaphragm muscle requires continuous MET signaling. Thus, HGF is not only required for the delamination of progenitors, but also for proliferation and survival of those muscle progenitors that reached the anlage of the diaphragm.</p><p>My major concern is the limited data on the HGF-dependent development of the phrenic nerve (defasciculation). While it is well documented that HGF acts as a trophic factor for motor neurons in culture, its role in development of motor neurons was highly debated due to the fact that some changes observed in Met or HGF mutant mice in vivo are also present in other mutants that lack the muscle groups derived from migrating muscle progenitors. Moreover, careful genetic analyses previously demonstrated indirect mechanisms of Met during motor neuron development, i.e. a non-cell-autonomous function of Met during the recruitment of motor neurons to PEA3-positive motor pools (Helmbacher et al., Neuron 2003).</p><p>Sefton et al., provide an analysis of a single time point, one histological picture (3G, magnified in 3H) that indicate that in Met+/- animals defasciculation of the phrenic nerve does not occur correctly. This is accompanied by a quantification that barely reaches significance (Figure 3K). Data shown in Figure 7 using Met inhibitors show a major change in phrenic nerve branching, which is presumably due to the major change in diaphragm development, as conceded by the authors.</p><p>Despite this weakness on the experimental side, the role of HGF/Met in phrenic nerve development is strongly emphasized in abstract /intro/discussion (e.g. line 414: However, PPF-derived HGF is crucial for the defasciculation and primary branching of the nerve, independent of muscle). The data need to be strengthened in order to conclude that HGF coordinates both, diaphragm muscle and phrenic development. I expect that the defasciculation of the phrenic nerve is highly dependent on the developmental stage. The authors should provide data that show different stages of phrenic nerve development, i.e. the time course of the of defasciculation in wildtype animals, explain how the staging was done, and compare different stages in the Met mutants and analyze whether the defasciculation is resolved at later stages. Met mutations also affect placental development, resulting in developmental delays that in turn might lead to an apparent small change in the time course of defasciculation. The authors should exclude that indirect effects cause the small change in phrenic nerve morphology, for instance by examining conditional Met mutations that are restricted to motor neurons. Good Cre lines that target motor neurons are available.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Since the authors observed a correlation between loss of should muscle and loss of diaphragm muscularization, which is related to the timing of migration of shoulder muscle and diaphragm muscle progenitors, they claim a &quot;closer relationship&quot; between should muscles and diaphragm, which was further extended in the discussion. I was not convinced by this conclusion. Is there a &quot;closer relationship&quot; between the muscles just because the progenitor cells migrate roughly at the same time? They authors may modify or delete this statement, although I agree that a broader expression of HGF may facilitate enhanced recruitment of muscle progenitor cells, required for formation of the diaphragm.</p><p>Based on co-cultures of PPFs and myoblasts the authors describe a function of MET in myogenic commitment. In my opinion the evidence for such a function is weak. The authors observed no change in proliferation but reduced motility and a higher rate of apoptosis after pharmacological inhibition of MET. Increased apoptosis and reduced aggregation of myoblasts at distinct locations may easily interfere with myogenic differentiation. A general function of MET in myogenic commitment does not seem very likely, since myoblasts that do not undergo prior long-range migration differentiate normally in the absence of Met.</p><p>Pharmacological inhibition of MET increases the rate of apoptosis in numerous cell types, which has been studied extensively in cancer. It seems appropriate to explore the mechanism of increased apoptosis in myoblasts following MET inhibition more closely. Previous reports suggest increased expression of p53, increased sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis or increased autophagy, among others, as potential causes for increased apoptosis after MET inhibition. Which pathway is relevant in myoblasts?</p><p>Obviously, it would be great to learn more about the mechanisms that control Hgf expression in fibroblasts within and derived from PPTs. Such knowledge may also help to better understand the reasons leading to Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernias (CDH). Unfortunately, the authors did not to go any further in this direction.</p><p>The authors observed that branching of the phrenic nerve was reduced in heterozygous Met mutants with normal diaphragm musculature, suggesting a direct role of Met in phrenic nerve branching. Timed inactivation of Met specifically in motoneurons would greatly increase the impact of this finding and allow a more specific analysis of the role of MET in phrenic nerve development and branching.</p><p>Surprisingly, the authors did not observe CDH in mutant mice with muscle-less diaphragms, from which they conclude that additional defects in the connective tissue are necessary to allow hernia formation. Although this explanation is intriguing, the authors have to make sure that abdominal pressure is not reduced in mice without muscularized diaphragms, e.g. demonstrate that body wall muscles are fully functional. The images in Figures 1 and 2 seem to indicate normal development of body wall muscles but a dedicated statement in this respect would be helpful.</p><p>Scale bars are missing in some panels.</p><p>According to the methods part, Student's t-test was used for the statistical analysis shown in Figure 3. A pairwise comparison of WT, heterozygous and homozygous Met mutants is not appropriate when all three genotypes are compared with each other. An ANOVA test should be used as in Figure 5F.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The present manuscript addresses questions on the role of HGF/MET signaling in diaphragm formation once myogenic progenitors have already migrated to the PPFs. In addition, it identifies the PPFs as the source of HGF. The study is interesting and developed with rigor. However, the role of HGF is not clearly dissociated from the presence/absence of the fibroblasts/connective tissue itself. Also, the authors do not link in the results, for example, how the muscleless diaphragms and HGF itself relate to the hernia phenotype mentioned in the abstract.</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>1C) Co-staining for Hgf (PPFs) and Met (migrating progenitors) should be provided for a clear visualization of ligand-expressing cells and receptor-expressing cells.</p><p>1F) Co-staining for Met and migrating progenitors (PAX3 or LBX1 for example) should be provided for a clear visualization of migrating progenitors versus general Met expression in other cell types.</p><p>1M) The claim that fibroblast-derived HGF is required for diaphragm muscle development cannot be addressed with only this experimental analysis. What is the connective tissue phenotype in PDGFaCreER;HGFnull/fl embryos? Lack of connective tissue could affect muscle migration and development rather than HGF expression on its own. Are fibroblasts still present?</p><p>1G, I, K, M) Control genotypes should be analyzed and added in the Figure or as Supplementary Data.</p><p>1I) Pax3CreKIMetnull/fl originates a muscleless diaphragm but this could be associated with lack of delamination and migration from the somites rather than a specific MET requirement for diaphragm muscle formation once progenitors have colonized this area as suggested by the authors.</p><p>Figure 3</p><p>It is not clear whether HGF controls phrenic nerve formation independently of muscle. In the end of this section the authors mention that Met heterozygous embryos have normal muscles referring to Figure 1K (which is not a picture referring to a Met het embryo). The authors should confirm if in Met null embryos there is a direct effect on the nerve bifurcation and brunching or if the lack of muscle is leading to this observation. Is the phenotype dose dependent for muscle formation? This is not properly shown by the authors. Could the authors perform a conditional KO of Met in the nerves?</p><p>This concern is further supported by the Figure 4 data where phrenic nerve only extends to regions with muscle.</p><p>Figure 4</p><p>The role of HGF versus the presence of fibroblasts/connective tissue remains vague. Is the lack of ventral muscles associated with lack of migration of progenitors within the forming diaphragm towards an HGF source? Or due to the lack of connective tissue scaffold itself? Why is Prx1Cre used instead of PDGFRaCre (the one used in the actual experiments) to trace PPFs?</p><p>4E) Please provide a control with a Cre allele to compare putative secondary effects for the presence of the Cre in the cKO embryos.</p><p>Figure 5</p><p>Validation for the drug BMS777607 effectiveness in inhibiting MET downstream pathway should be performed and shown.</p><p>The phenotype with the inhibition of Met signaling (lack of dorsal muscles in addition to ventral) is distinct to the one observed in Figure 4 (less ventral muscle formation in PDGFaCreER;HGFnull/fl). How do the authors explain the dorsal phenotype when inhibiting Met (since migration should have not been affected at this time-point) and Hgf inhibition in Figure 4 is not leading to this phenotype?</p><p>Figure 6</p><p>What is the time point after treatment in B and C? What is the total nuclei number in the cultures (since these are co-cultures)?</p><p>The authors should provide pictures together with nuclear staining for a global view of the cell density in the cultures. Also T0 time point pictures should be added for comparison, in particular in C.</p><p>In these experiments the authors performed co-culture (fibroblasts + myogenic progenitors) derived from PPfs. However, fibroblast phenotype is not addressed. If there is less GFP+ cells is there more fibroblasts in the culture? Could this impact on the phenotype observed and linked by the authors to the Met inhibitor treatment? The only piece of evidence is Gata4 qPCR which is not sufficient to address fibroblast phenotype in the culture.</p><p>Figure 7</p><p>Treatment of WT embryos from E7.5 will impact on myogenic progenitor migration. The authors have to dissociate the Met-related somite migration phenotype and the potential additional role of Met signaling in the diaphragm muscle formation.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Fibroblast-derived <italic>HGF</italic> controls recruitment and expansion of muscle during morphogenesis of the mammalian diaphragm&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been much improved but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The majority of my concerns were appropriately addressed by the authors.

While the quality of the figures is overall good, many of the panels in Figure 2 are very dark. It should be easy to modify this.</p><p>2. While the authors show very convincingly that the effects on the phrenic nerve observed are caused indirectly by the loss of muscle, and not directly by the loss of HGF/Met signaling, this is not always made clear in the text. Furthermore, the mechanism that causes branching deficits should be clearly stated in the Abstract.</p><p>Line 41-42...and indirectly required for phrenic nerve primary branching.</p><p>Please mention the specific indirect mechanisms, i.e. via the effect on muscle development.</p><p>Line 81…HGF is also critical for innervation.</p><p>The reports cited do not distinguish between the effect of the nerve/muscle or report in vitro experiments.

Please rephrase.</p><p>3) Met inhibition using BMS777607</p><p>BMS777607 acts as an AXL, RON and Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This should be mentioned. Are effects of RON/AXL on skeletal muscle development described?</p><p>4) Antibody specificity: Antibody specificity should be tested by analysis of the phrenic nerve on Met mutants.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Sefton et al., have submitted a revised version of a study, in which the role of fibroblast-derived HGF for recruitment and expansion of muscle during morphogenesis of the mammalian diaphragm was investigated. The authors have changed the title to cope with new findings, indicating that reduced primary branching of the phrenic nerve in Met-mutants is not due direct effects of HGF on the nerve but most likely caused by indirect effects resulting from reduced muscle formation in Met-mutants.</p><p>The authors did an excellent job to deal with the reviewers' criticisms. In particular, by specifically deleting Met in motoneurons and by analysis of splotch mutants they demonstrate that Met does not intrinsically regulate phrenic nerve branching. Analysis of splotch mice, which show normal expression of HGF PPFs but display muscle-less diaphragms, revealed reduced branching of the phrenic nerve, similar to Met-mutants, clearly suggesting a critical role of muscle fibers in the diaphragm for phrenic nerve branching. Furthermore, Sefton et al., now demonstrate that fibroblasts expand and populate the diaphragm in the absence of muscle, which essentially excluded a connective tissue phenotype in conditional Hgf/Met mutants. They also clarified the statement about what I understood was meant to claim a role of Hgf/Met in myogenic commitment. Additional controls (effectiveness of BMS777607 for inhibition of MET, treatment with BMS777607 at additional timepoints) were done as requested, providing additional interesting insights into a role of Met for ventral expansion of the diaphragm at relatively late developmental timepoints.</p><p>The authors argue that &quot;PPF-derived HGF, via muscle, controls phrenic nerve defasciculation&quot;. Well, this is formally correct but exaggerates the role PPF-derived for phrenic nerve defasciculation in my view. Probably, deletion of any gene that prevents diaphragm muscle formation will have similar effects on phrenic nerve defasciculation. I would prefer a more neutral statement: &quot;Muscle formation, requiring PPF-derived HGF, controls phrenic nerve defasciculation&quot;, or something similar. The authors may consider modifying the statement.</p><p>I do not have any further objections.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74592.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revision</p><p>1) A major concern is the limited data on the role of Met in the development of the phrenic nerve.

In our first submission, we found a decreased number of phrenic nerve branches at E11.5 in <italic>Met <sup>Δ/ Δ</sup></italic> and <italic>Met <sup>Δ/+</sup></italic> compared with <italic>Met<sup>+/+</sup></italic> embryos. In the <italic>Met <sup>Δ/ Δ</sup></italic> embryos, no muscle is present in the diaphragm. Therefore, the greatly reduced branching in these embryos is likely a secondary effect of the requirement of Met in muscle progenitors for diaphragm muscularization. Of particular interest is the reduced branching in the <italic>Met <sup>Δ/+</sup></italic> embryos. Because the diaphragm is muscularized in these embryos, this suggested that Met may be required intrinsically in the phrenic nerve. One reviewer suggested that the reduced branching in the <italic>Met <sup>Δ/+</sup></italic> embryos could be due to a developmental delay in the whole embryo. However, we found that <italic>Met <sup>Δ/ Δ</sup></italic> and <italic>Met <sup>Δ/+</sup></italic> embryos are not overall delayed relative to <italic>Met<sup>+/+</sup></italic> embryos (as measured by crown rump length or limb length; Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Also, to increase the robustness of these data, we added additional embryos to the analysis. We then extended our analysis of <italic>Met <sup>Δ/ Δ</sup></italic>, <italic>Met <sup>Δ/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Met<sup>+/+</sup></italic> embryos to E12.5 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) to see whether the branching phenotype persisted; we found that while the of <italic>Met <sup>Δ/ Δ</sup></italic> embryos continue to have very few branches, the number of branches in <italic>Met <sup>Δ/+</sup></italic> embryos recovers and matches that of <italic>Met<sup>+/+</sup></italic> embryos.</p><p>To explicitly test whether Met is required within the phrenic nerve, we used <italic>Olig2<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>to conditionally delete <italic>Met</italic>. This line was chosen for its early expression in motor neurons (Zawadzka et al., 2010). We examined <italic>Olig2<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Met</italic> <sup>Δ<italic>/flox</italic></sup> embryos compared to <italic>Olig2<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Met<sup>flox/+</sup></italic> embryos. We chose to include <italic>Olig2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> in our controls because the <italic>Olig2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> is a knock-in/knock-out and <italic>Olig2</italic> has important roles in nerve development. However, deletion of <italic>Met</italic> did not affect the number of branches at E11.5 (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) or E12.5 (data not shown). These data suggest that Met does not intrinsically regulate phrenic nerve branching. This suggests that PPF-derived HGF regulates phrenic nerve branching indirectly via muscle. To test if HGF is sufficient to promote early stages of nerve branching in the absence of muscle, we turned to <italic>Pax3<sup>SpD/SpD</sup></italic> mutants in which a point mutation in Pax3 prevents migration of muscle progenitors into the diaphragm (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). In these embryos, the diaphragm is muscleless, but the PPFs still express HGF. In these diaphragms the number of branches at E11.5 is severely reduced. These data demonstrate that in the absence of muscle the presence of HGF in the PPF fibroblasts is not sufficient to support diaphragm branching.</p><p>Altogether our data demonstrate that PPF-derived HGF, via its regulation of muscle, controls the primary branching of phrenic nerve. The <italic>Met <sup>Δ/+</sup></italic> data demonstrate that Met controls phrenic nerve branching at E11.5 in a dose-dependent manner, but this effect is lost by E12.5. Although we see no obvious defects in muscle of <italic>Met <sup>Δ/+</sup></italic> diaphragms at later stages, the most parsimonious explanation of the reduced phrenic nerve branching at E11.5 is that this is due to fewer muscle progenitors at this time point.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for prompting us to look at the role of HGF/Met in the phrenic nerve more closely. Our revised conclusions are presented in the Results and Discussion. We show that PPF-derived HGF is critical for integrating both muscle and phrenic nerve development, but now demonstrate that HGF’s regulation of phrenic nerve branching is via muscle, which is well-known to express multiple trophic factors required by motor neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should exclude a connective tissue phenotype in conditional HGF/Met mutants. Why is Prx1Cre used instead of PDGFRaCre to trace PPFs? In addition, the reason for the differences in phenotypes regarding dorsal/ventral diaphragm muscles after either HGF inactivation or Met-inhibitor treatment should be explained, or at least discussed. Is this due to timing of the mutation/inhibition, or to efficacy of ablation/inhibition?</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Prx1Cre</italic> and <italic>PDGFRa<sup>CreER</sup></italic> both label connective tissue fibroblasts in the developing diaphragm. We have included additional panels to Figure 4—figure supplement 1 of <italic>PDGFRa<sup>CreER/+</sup>; HGF<sup>delta/flox</sup>; Rosa<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic>embryos demonstrating the presence of <italic>GFP+</italic> fibroblasts in the muscleless regions. Thus, fibroblasts do expand and appropriately populate the diaphragm even in the absence of muscle.</p><p>The phenotype after genetic deletion of <italic>HGF</italic> via <italic>Prx1Cre</italic> or <italic>PDGFRa<sup>CreER</sup></italic> and after MET-inhibitor treatment is quite similar (see slightly revised model in Figure 8). Genetic <italic>HGF</italic> deletion or MET inhibition early leads to ventral muscleless regions and two bilateral dorsal muscleless regions (Figures 4 C, H and 5 B-D). Genetic <italic>HGF</italic> deletion or MET inhibition later consistently leads to ventral muscleless regions and less commonly to dorsal muscleless regions (Figures 4 G and 5 E). We have provided additional clarification in the text and in model in Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors propose a role of Met in myogenic commitment, based on the co-culture experiments. Myogenic commitment implies a major role in myogenic lineage progression or differentiation. The evidence for that claim is weak and the reduced differentiation might be the consequence of increased cell death, reduced proliferation or other causes that change myoblast density. It is mandatory to address this issue appropriately, by analyzing both, fibroblast and myoblast cell numbers, proliferation, apoptosis, myogenic differentiation (i.e. ratio of MyoD/MyoG-positive cells).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the misunderstanding here and have altered the text to indicate that we do not propose a role for Met in myogenic commitment, but rather that Met regulates the number of MyoD+ cells by promoting their survival. Using our co-culture methods, unfortunately we are unable to quantify fibroblast cell numbers, as they are too dense to distinguish using either our software or manual counting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A potentially interesting conclusion form the manuscript is hat hernia does only develop when both, connective tissue and muscle of the diaphragm are affected. Although this explanation is intriguing, the authors have to make sure that body wall muscles are fully developed, to exclude that the abdominal pressure is not reduced in mice conditional Met/HGF mutations. The images in Figures 1 and 2 seem to indicate normal development of body wall muscles but a dedicated statement in this respect would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a statement in the Results section indicating the body wall muscles are normal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Treatment of WT embryos from E7.5 will impact on myogenic progenitor delamination, and this is also expected for Pax3CreKIMetnull/fl mutation. The authors have to dissociate the Met-related somite delamination, a migration of the progenitors to the diaphragm and the potential additional role of Met signaling in the colonization and expansion of myogenic progenitor cells in the anlage of the diaphragm.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 5, we have delivered the Met inhibitor at various stages to determine when Met is required. Delivery at E7.5-E12.5 gives the most pronounced phenotype; muscleless regions in the dorsal and ventral regions of the diaphragm. To exclude that inhibition of Met is affecting the initial delamination of progenitors from the somites and migration to the PPFs, we also delivered the inhibitor at E11.5-E12.5 (Figure 5E). Previously we showed that migration to the PPFs is completed by E11.5 (Sefton et al., 2018). Thus the appearance of dorsal and ventral muscleless regions in these diaphragms demonstrates that Met has an additional later role.</p><p>Our original analysis of the mechanistic effects of Met inhibition in vivo (in Figure 7) were based on experiments administering BMS777607 E7.5-E12.5 because this dosage gave the most highly penetrant and consistent phenotype. To exclude possible effects due to early delamination and migration defects, we have repeated these experiments by administering inhibitor at E11.5-E12.5 and analyzing the ventral-most expansion of diaphragm muscle at E15.5 (Figure 7O-V). We find that Pax7/MyoD/Myosin+ cells are substantially reduced in the ventral leading edge of the diaphragm following BMS777607 treatment. This demonstrates that Met is required at later timepoints for the ventral expansion of the diaphragm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Validation for the drug BMS777607 effectiveness in inhibiting MET downstream pathway should be performed and shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to limited number of cells in our PPF cultures, quantitative validation of pathways is difficult in the embryonic diaphragm. As such, we have validated the effectiveness of BMS777607 in inhibiting phosphorylation of MET, which is essential for downstream pathway signaling, using adult skeletal muscle stem cells, where there are sufficient cells to perform phospho-specific flow cytometry (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Moreover, the drug BMS777607 has been previously validated in downregulating pAkt, pERK, and pPLC by Western blot (Faham, Zhao and Welm, 2018 doi:10.1038/s41523-018-0091-5). BMS777607 from Selleck Chem has been cited by 47 publications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Comments referring to missing controls, scale bars, statistics need to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed comments about controls, scale bars, and statistics below and thank reviewers for their careful and thoughtful reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It was previously shown that HGF and Met controls development of the diaphragm muscle. In particular, the signal induces delamination and migration of muscle progenitor cells that colonize the diaphragm. The present manuscript by Sefton and coworkers confirms and extends these observations using (i) conditional mouse lines in which the HGF gene was targeted by Cre/loxP recombination in the pleuroperitoneal folds (Prx1-cre) and at other sites PdgfraCreERT2, and of (ii) Met inhibitors. Overall, the technical quality of the data on diaphragm muscle development is excellent; the conceptual advance over previous work is not exceptional; the evidence for Met/HGF-dependent development of the phrenic nerve is marginal and needs to be strengthened.</p><p>The data show that fibroblasts provide HGF signals received by Met in muscle progenitor cells that is essential for diaphragm development. The PdgfraCreERT2 line was used to demonstrate that HGF produced by fibroblasts but not by muscle progenitors is essential for diaphragm development. Moreover, development of dorsal and ventral regions of diaphragm muscle requires continuous MET signaling. Thus, HGF is not only required for the delamination of progenitors, but also for proliferation and survival of those muscle progenitors that reached the anlage of the diaphragm.</p><p>My major concern is the limited data on the HGF-dependent development of the phrenic nerve (defasciculation). While it is well documented that HGF acts as a trophic factor for motor neurons in culture, its role in development of motor neurons was highly debated due to the fact that some changes observed in Met or HGF mutant mice in vivo are also present in other mutants that lack the muscle groups derived from migrating muscle progenitors. Moreover, careful genetic analyses previously demonstrated indirect mechanisms of Met during motor neuron development, i.e. a non-cell-autonomous function of Met during the recruitment of motor neurons to PEA3-positive motor pools (Helmbacher et al., Neuron 2003).</p><p>Sefton et al., provide an analysis of a single time point, one histological picture (3G, magnified in 3H) that indicate that in Met+/- animals defasciculation of the phrenic nerve does not occur correctly. This is accompanied by a quantification that barely reaches significance (Figure 3K). Data shown in Figure 7 using Met inhibitors show a major change in phrenic nerve branching, which is presumably due to the major change in diaphragm development, as conceded by the authors.</p><p>Despite this weakness on the experimental side, the role of HGF/Met in phrenic nerve development is strongly emphasized in abstract /intro/discussion (e.g. line 414: However, PPF-derived HGF is crucial for the defasciculation and primary branching of the nerve, independent of muscle). The data need to be strengthened in order to conclude that HGF coordinates both, diaphragm muscle and phrenic development. I expect that the defasciculation of the phrenic nerve is highly dependent on the developmental stage. The authors should provide data that show different stages of phrenic nerve development, i.e. the time course of the of defasciculation in wildtype animals, explain how the staging was done, and compare different stages in the Met mutants and analyze whether the defasciculation is resolved at later stages. Met mutations also affect placental development, resulting in developmental delays that in turn might lead to an apparent small change in the time course of defasciculation. The authors should exclude that indirect effects cause the small change in phrenic nerve morphology, for instance by examining conditional Met mutations that are restricted to motor neurons. Good Cre lines that target motor neurons are available.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to comments from the reviewers, we have more thoroughly investigated the role of Met in the development of the phrenic nerve and include two new sets of genetic experiments.

Could this impact on the phenotype observed and linked by the authors to the Met inhibitor treatment? The only piece of evidence is Gata4 qPCR which is not sufficient to address fibroblast phenotype in the culture.</p></disp-quote><p>Although it is possible that fibroblasts are affected by Met inhibition, our in vivo deletion of Met in fibroblasts (Figure 1K) does not suggest that Met inhibition would negatively impact PPF fibroblasts in culture. Because of technical limitations (see above), it is difficult to explicitly quantify the number of fibroblasts unless we were to passage the fibroblasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7</p><p>Treatment of WT embryos from E7.5 will impact on myogenic progenitor migration.

To exclude possible effects due to early delamination and migration defects, we have repeated these experiments by administering inhibitor at E11.5-E12.5 and analyzing the ventral-most expansion of diaphragm muscle at E15.5 (Figure 7O-V). We find that Pax7/MyoD/Myosin+ cells are substantially reduced in the ventral leading edge of the diaphragm following BMS777607 treatment. This demonstrates that Met is required at later timepoints for the ventral expansion of the diaphragm.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The majority of my concerns were appropriately addressed by the authors.

There is limited information about the role of RON/AXL on skeletal muscle development. A recent study found that Axl is a survival and growth receptor in mouse myoblasts during skeletal muscle regeneration (Al-Zaeed et al., 2021; doi: 10.1038/s41419-021-03892-5).

This region includes the extracellular semaphorin domain, furin cleavage site, plexin semaphorin domain, and the four IPT domains. The mutant Met allele we are using is from Huh et al., (PNAS 2004; doi: 10.1073/pnas.0306068101) and deletes exon 16 which contains a critical ATP-binding site in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Western analysis from Webster et al., (Figure 1C; PLoS 2013; doi: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0081757) and the Huh et al., 2004 paper (Figure 1 L) show that the MET pTyr 1234/1235 domain and downstream pAKT are inactivated with this mutant allele, respectively. However, the pre-processed MET protein is still present in these mutants (Figure 1K of Huh et al., and Figure 1B of Webster et al.,). The R&amp;D antibody that we and others use recognizes the extracellular domain that is present in the preprocessed protein (see Figure 1B of Webster et al). Thus when we examine <italic>Met<sup>D/D</sup></italic> mutants using the R&amp;D antibody, we still see labeling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Therefore the Huh et al., Met allele that we use is not able to test the specificity of the R&amp;D antibody. However, over 24 references have used this antibody (https://www.rndsystems.com/products/mouse-hgfr-c-met-antibody_af527#product-citations). We have not exhaustively searched these references to determine whether any tested the specificity of the R&amp;D antibody (e.g. that it does not cross-react with the closely related RON protein).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>­The extracellular region of MET protein (using AF527 R&amp;D antibody) is still detected in <italic>Met<sup>D/D</sup></italic> mutants.</title><p>Transverse cross section of E10.5 embryos with dorsal to the top; lateral is on the left side in left panel; lateral is on the right side in right panel.

The authors have changed the title to cope with new findings, indicating that reduced primary branching of the phrenic nerve in Met-mutants is not due direct effects of HGF on the nerve but most likely caused by indirect effects resulting from reduced muscle formation in Met-mutants.</p><p>The authors did an excellent job to deal with the reviewers' criticisms. In particular, by specifically deleting Met in motoneurons and by analysis of splotch mutants they demonstrate that Met does not intrinsically regulate phrenic nerve branching. Analysis of splotch mice, which show normal expression of HGF PPFs but display muscle-less diaphragms, revealed reduced branching of the phrenic nerve, similar to Met-mutants, clearly suggesting a critical role of muscle fibers in the diaphragm for phrenic nerve branching. Furthermore, Sefton et al., now demonstrate that fibroblasts expand and populate the diaphragm in the absence of muscle, which essentially excluded a connective tissue phenotype in conditional Hgf/Met mutants. They also clarified the statement about what I understood was meant to claim a role of Hgf/Met in myogenic commitment. Additional controls (effectiveness of BMS777607 for inhibition of MET, treatment with BMS777607 at additional timepoints) were done as requested, providing additional interesting insights into a role of Met for ventral expansion of the diaphragm at relatively late developmental timepoints.</p><p>The authors argue that &quot;PPF-derived HGF, via muscle, controls phrenic nerve defasciculation&quot;. Well, this is formally correct but exaggerates the role PPF-derived for phrenic nerve defasciculation in my view. Probably, deletion of any gene that prevents diaphragm muscle formation will have similar effects on phrenic nerve defasciculation. I would prefer a more neutral statement: &quot;Muscle formation, requiring PPF-derived HGF, controls phrenic nerve defasciculation&quot;, or something similar. The authors may consider modifying the statement.</p><p>I do not have any further objections.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive response to our revisions.
