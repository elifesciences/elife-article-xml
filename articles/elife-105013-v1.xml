PCs are classically seen as stereotypical computational units, yet mouse PCs are morphologically diverse and those with multi-branched structure can receive non-canonical climbing fiber (CF) multi-innervation that confers independent compartment-specific signaling. While otherwise uncharacterized, human PCs are universally multi-branched. Do they exceed allometry to achieve enhanced integrative capacities relative to mouse PCs? To answer this, we used several comparative histology techniques in adult human and mouse to analyze cellular morphology, parallel fiber (PF) and CF input arrangement, and regional PC demographics. Human PCs are substantially larger than previously described; they exceed allometric constraint by cortical thickness and are the largest neuron in the brain with 6–7 cm total dendritic length. Unlike mouse, human PC dendrites ramify horizontally to form a multi-compartment motif that we show can receive multiple CFs. Human spines are denser (6.9 vs 4.9 spines/μm), larger (~0.36 vs 0.29 μm), and include an unreported ‘spine cluster’ structure—features that may be congruent with enhanced PF association and amplification as human-specific adaptations. By extrapolation, human PCs may receive 500,000 to 1 million synaptic inputs compared with 30–40,000 in mouse. Collectively, human PC morphology and input arrangement is quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from rodent. Multi-branched PCs are more prevalent in posterior and lateral cerebellum, co-varying with functional boundaries, supporting the hypothesis that this morphological motif permits expanded input multiplexing and may subserve task-dependent needs for input association.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Purkinje neuron</kwd><kwd>dendritic spine</kwd><kwd>morphological reconstruction</kwd><kwd>climbing fiber</kwd><kwd>peripherin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21NS124217</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hansel</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31NS129256</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Busch</surname><given-names>Silas E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A comparative study of Purkinje dendrite morphology, input arrangement, and regional subtype distribution shows human cells evade constraint by cortical thickness to be both <italic>quantitatively</italic> and <italic>qualitatively</italic> distinct from mouse.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Being the sole output of the cerebellar cortex, Purkinje cells (PCs) perform the final step to integrate all cortical input. The dendritic arbor of each PC is the target of tens of thousands of granule cell parallel fiber (PF) axons, which deliver an expansion recoding of mossy fiber contextual input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albus, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Marr, 1969</xref>) and prediction-error signals carried by one—<italic>or several</italic>—climbing fiber (CF) axons from the inferior olive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ito and Kano, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and Hansel, 2023</xref>). Understanding cerebellar function thus requires us to understand the process of PC dendritic integration.</p><p>PC dendrite structure and function is adapted to receive the most synaptic connections on one of the largest dendritic arbors of the central nervous system. Yet, PC dendrites appear to adapt beyond being simply large and densely innervated. Recent work has shown that PC dendrites are morphologically diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and Hansel, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaneko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nedelescu et al., 2018</xref>) and their sub-branches can exhibit heterogeneous physiological excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Midtgaard, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ohtsuki, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ohtsuki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zang and De Schutter, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cirtala and De Schutter, 2024</xref>). Primary dendrite morphology can influence patterns of CF innervation, in some cases permitting non-canonical CF multi-innervation in adult mice that confers independent signaling across compartments in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and Hansel, 2023</xref>). A study using patch-clamp electrophysiology in cerebellar slices found that dendritic compartments can undergo independent plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ohtsuki et al., 2012</xref>). Combined physiological and calcium imaging experiments in awake mice found that intrinsic and synaptic plasticity mechanisms can operate on distinct, compartment-level spatial scales to tune dendritic signaling and gate its impact on axosomatic output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lin et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Morphology thus plays a critical role in shaping PC input integration. While this insight comes largely from the use of the experimentally accessible rodent cerebellum, human PCs are far more enigmatic. Very little is known about the nature of their dendrite morphology, input arrangement, or physiology. Since their illustration by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Golgi, 1874</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ramón y Cajal, 1909</xref>, the morphology of human PC dendrites have only been analyzed occasionally and in small numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eccles et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kato et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Louis et al., 2014</xref>), eluding systematic quantification. We recently developed a framework for morphological categorization and performed a comparative analysis of thousands of PCs in human and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and Hansel, 2023</xref>). We defined PCs as having either one (‘Normative’) or multiple primary dendrite compartments (‘Split’ when compartments arise from one proximally bifurcated dendrite, or ‘Poly’ when multiple dendrites emerge directly from the soma). This approach revealed that human PCs are almost universally multi-branched whereas a plurality of mouse PCs are Normative. In mice, ~25% of multi-branched PCs received multiple functionally distinct CFs while Normative cells did not, indicating a link between primary dendrite morphology and cellular physiology. Human PC physiology, on the other hand, remains largely inaccessible, but recent work leveraged limited access to acute human cerebellar tissue and a comparative modeling approach to make important progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Masoli et al., 2024</xref>.) To further understand human PC physiology, we will require more complete data on their dendritic morphology and the arrangement of inputs such as PFs and CFs on the arbor.</p><p>Here, we provide a comprehensive quantification and comparative analysis of human and mouse PC morphology, excitatory input arrangement, and regional distribution. Our reconstructions reveal that—with dendritic lengths of 6–7 cm—PCs far exceed pyramidal cells in having the largest dendritic arbor in the human brain. They also exceed the allometric constraint of cortical thickness by ramifying horizontally and increasing compartmentalization to produce an expanded multi-branched structural motif. We hypothesized that this motif would permit more input multiplexing and association. In support of this, we found that human cells have increased spine size (~0.36 vs 0.29 μm diameter) and density (6.9 vs 4.9 spines/μm)—receiving upward of 1 million inputs compared with 30–40,000 in mouse—and host a previously unreported ‘spine cluster’ structure not found in mouse. Co-labeling PCs (calbindin) and CFs (peripherin) confirms that non-canonical CF multi-innervation is present in adult human, as in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and Hansel, 2023</xref>). The regional prevalence of a multi-branched motif among PC populations covaries with human functional boundaries and exhibits subregional patches of clustered morphologies. This supports the hypothesis that a multi-branched structure can provide for enhanced input multiplexing and that this may subserve complex multimodal association and learning in posterior and lateral cerebellar regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human PCs are not an allometrically scaled mouse PC</title><p>We used fluorescent calbindin immunohistochemistry in fixed, unembalmed postmortem cerebellar tissue to achieve specific and complete labeling of human PCs for cellular reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; Methods). Unlike embalmed human tissue, as used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and Hansel, 2023</xref>) and for regional analysis below, immunolabeling of unembalmed tissue provides variable sparseness of cell labeling that is ultimately more complete and produces brighter staining that dramatically enhances the signal-to-noise ratio. Calbindin density in mouse tissue precludes individual cell separation, so we achieved sparse labeling via viral expression of Cre-dependent GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; Methods). High-resolution z-stack confocal scans (~0.2 μm × 0.2 μm × 0.5 μm voxel resolution) permitted manual reconstruction and analysis of dendritic morphology (n=5,5 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Human PCs were selected for isolation from adjacent cells and completeness of the arbor but minor truncation (approximately &lt;5%) was unavoidable. Occasionally branches from adjacent PCs were visible near and within the area of the dendritic arbor, but these could be reliably excluded from the manual reconstructions as they were disconnected from the cell of interest.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell reconstructions reveal expanded dendritic size and compartmentalization of human Purkinje cells (PCs).</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Manually reconstructed human and mouse PCs (same scale).

Human PCs had 3.9× the number of total and terminal branch segments (2750±247 vs 707±118 and 1377±125 vs 355±59; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), which were produced by branching that reached nearly double the maximum and average branch order (50±5.4 vs 28±5.3 and 25±2.5 vs 14±2.6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Despite considerable morphological variation, a trend emerged wherein human primary dendrites commonly ramified parallel with the PC layer and bore numerous, often 7–8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), compartments that projected vertically toward the pial surface. This alignment rendered their abor ~4.5× wider than in mouse (644±126 μm vs 143±31 μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), while their molecular layer thickness—a crucial allometric variable—defined the maximal arbor height to be only 2.3× taller (366±58 μm vs 158±22 μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Thus, human PCs attained a horizontal dimensionality with 79±42% greater width than height while mouse PCs had 6.3±31% greater height than width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Horizontal orientation was not limited to the primary dendrites. Across branching orders and somatic distances, human branches ramified at more horizontal eccentricities than in mouse (~37±24° vs 45±24°; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Both human and mouse dendrite eccentricities turned upward with increased distance from the soma (~29±23°, 39±24°, 42±23° among branches in proximal, intermediate, and distal compartments vs 41±24°, 43±25°, and 51±23°; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), a trend conserved across cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><p>Emerging from a somatic compartment that is 2× the diameter (roughly 7.7× the volume) of mouse (32.8±3.07 μm vs 16.5±0.78 μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>), human primary dendrites were 2.1× thicker (6.49±2.43 μm vs 3.12±1.17 μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Human dendrites narrow nearly tenfold as they branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>) such that the spiny dendrites of both species converge on an apparently conserved thickness (~0.6–1 μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). As a result, most branching orders have only ~15% the diameter of the primary dendrite in human compared with ~25% in mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). Relatedly, 95% of human dendritic length is devoted to thin, spiny dendrites with &lt;1.3 μm diameter (the log-normal mean+1 SD of dendrite diameter across species) while that figure is 89% in the mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>).</p><p>Both species shared patterns of near-symmetric fractal branching over similar relative orders (17/50, 34% vs 10/28, 36%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>) and evenly distributed length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>). Individual branch segments were 2.3× longer on average in human and varied more in their length (24.53±18.78 μm vs 9.23±5.7 μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>). The species difference was even greater (3×) among terminal dendritic segments (33.14±19.59 μm vs 10.9±5.81 μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>). Also reflecting more heterogeneity in the human arbor, the rate of branch emergence in human peaked at precisely half the dendritic height while mouse PC branch segments emerged at a constant rate through roughly the middle 60% of their arbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2J</xref>). This pattern was also observed in the distributions of relative total dendritic length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q–R</xref>) and branch number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2K–L</xref>) across Sholl radii.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Human-specific adaptations for size and associative complexity in spine structure and number</title><p>As predominantly the sites of excitatory PF input and plasticity, dendritic spines and their morphology contribute to PC physiology. To assess this input pathway, we manually reconstructed ~4000 spines from high-resolution confocal z-stack images (~26 nm × 26 nm × 150 nm voxel resolution; a calculation of the Rayleigh criterion yields a diffraction limit of ~242 nm, see Methods) of spiny dendrite segments across molecular layer compartments of the same tissue as used above for cell reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; Methods). Dendrite sections were chosen for their isolation from nearby branches. This ensured that there was no substantial contamination of the field of view by spinous or dendritic structures from other branches. Some truncated PC dendrite and spine structures were unavoidably present, but these could be distinguished from connected and putatively connected structures when scrolling through the z-plane. Human PCs exhibited higher spine density than mouse PCs (6.81±0.77 vs 5.1±0.61 spines/μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

As in our cell reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2N–O</xref>), spiny dendrite thicknesses were equivalent in both species (0.68±0.1 μm vs 0.73±0.1 μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), leading us to hypothesize that human spine necks may be longer to maintain a similar volume ratio between spines and the space surrounding the dendrite (see Methods). Spine necks were indeed longer on average in human (0.83±0.48 μm vs 0.7±0.31 μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), but the ratio of spine to surrounding volume nearly doubled from mouse to human (1.96±0.5% vs 3.73±0.92%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), such that elongated necks did not compensate for elevated spine density and size in the human. Increased spine neck length and head diameters made human spines protrude further from the dendrite than in mouse (1.41±0.57 μm vs 1.13±0.41 μm) and with an elevated distance distally (1.34±0.51 μm to 1.47±0.58 μm), while in mice this value was stable (1.16±0.44 μm to 1.13±0.38 μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>In mouse, spines were smaller in distal compartments than proximal (0.28±0.08 vs 0.31±0.08 μm), but in human we observed the opposite effect where distal spine heads were larger than proximal ones (0.43±0.21 vs 0.4±0.17; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Again, while the relative values are informative here, the absolute values are imperfect. As a result, the total spine volume fraction around the dendrite remains stable in mouse (1.87±0.24 vs 2.1±0.55%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) while in human there is a trend toward higher spine volume on distal branches (4.44±1.36%) than proximal branches (3.52±0.44%).

Unlike branched spines, spine clusters have one large head with multiple swellings that form distinct punctate structures. Our imaging resolution (Rayleigh limit ~242 nm) clearly precludes a description of their ultrastructure; however, it does permit us to determine that: (1) the puncta emerge from a connected structure rather than being multiple spatially converging spine heads as they are often &gt;400 nm apart, and (2) individual puncta diameters appear to be roughly 0.2–0.5 μm. These dimensions resemble thin spine heads and thus perhaps constitute individual synaptic contact sites, although this could not be determined here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). While only 1 of 1380 mouse spines met the criteria, spine clusters were present across all human branches, cells, and specimens. It is conceivable that this phenomenon is a factor of aging and not species, as our human specimens came from relatively older individuals (93 and 61yo) than our mouse specimens (12–15 weeks). We addressed this concern by obtaining a tissue sample from the brain of a 37-year-old human (not included in the overall quantitative analysis) and observing the presence of spine clusters there as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B2</xref>). The following analyses focus on the phenomenon in the original, older human samples.</p><p>Spine clusters were present at an average density of 0.52±0.16/μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>; included in the total of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) that increased distally from 0.41±0.05 to 0.62±0.17/μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>; included in the total of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Spine clusters typically had 4–6 puncta (4.84±1.75; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>) and a spherical volume of 0.49±0.42 μm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>) such that the average puncta volume (as a post hoc division of the total) was 0.1 μm<sup>3</sup>—approximately that of thin spines with 0.3–0.5 μm head diameters. Spine clusters had larger diameters than thin and mushroom spines (0.93±0.19 vs 0.34±0.07 and 0.58±0.07 μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G and H</xref>). The number of puncta, volume, and size of spine clusters were constant across compartments. Diameter and puncta number scale linearly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>), suggesting that spine clusters vary in size largely through the gain or loss of discrete, stereotypically sized puncta and not through growth or shrinkage of the puncta. The increased number and trend toward increased size of spine clusters in distal compartments contributed to almost double the density of clustered puncta per dendritic length in proximal vs distal compartments (1.85±0.37 to 3.07±0.81/μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CF multi-innervation may be more common in human than mouse cerebellum</title><p>While PFs are the predominant source of input onto the spines of thin dendrites, the dendritic shaft and primary dendrite are the sites of a second excitatory projection from CF axons of the inferior olive.

However, the underlying PC morphology offers a modestly more concrete range. In mouse, multi-branched structure and wider dendrite separation distances elevate the rate of multi-innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and Hansel, 2023</xref>). Overall, our peripherin co-labeled PCs have typical rates of multi-branched structure for human posterior hemisphere (2.3% Normative, 36.4% Split, 61.3% Poly). We also categorized co-labeled PCs as having primary dendrite orientations that were either vertical (&gt;30 angle relative to the PCL) or horizontal (parallel with the PCL with a &lt;30 angle; see Methods). Mono-innervated cells, however, are less multi-branched (4.5% Normative, 41% Split, 54.5% Poly; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and horizontally oriented (31.8% vertical, 68.2% horizontal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) while fully labeled multi-innervated cells are more multi-branched (0% Normative, 20% Split, 80% Poly) and horizontal (20% vertical, 80% horizontal). Factors shaping the relationship between multi-branched structure and CF multi-innervation may thus be conserved across mice and humans. The demographics of intermediate classifications diverge: absence multi-innervation PCs (0% Normative, 45.5% Split, 54.5% Poly) closely align with mono-innervated PCs while putative multi-innervation PCs (0% Normative, 16.7% Split, 83.3% Poly) resemble fully labeled multi-innervated PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, putative and fully labeled cases may in fact demarcate the same phenomenon, multi-innervation, and set the population rate to at least 25% in human.</p><p>Beyond CFs, our staining reveals that segregated primary dendrite compartments can be the recipient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) of narrowly branching recurrent PC axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ramón y Cajal, 1909</xref>).

We also found that primary dendrites sometimes host the axon, thereby differentiating the axon initiation site exposure to the distinct primary dendrite signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We asked whether task-specific computational demands act on PC populations at the level of whole regions, individual folia, or smaller circuits of neighboring cells with overlapping dendrites. The distribution of PC morphologies would thus sort randomly throughout a region, be homogeneous in each folium, or exhibit ‘patches’ of homogeneous morphologies among neighboring PCs.</p><p>To assess demographic sorting, we first tested cell-type clustering at the scale of adjacent PCs close enough to partially overlap their dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

The elevated prevalence fell below 5% within 2 mm and 500 μm in human and mouse, respectively, and dropped to near zero at scales roughly over 1 cm and 2 mm. Clustering within the core of a measured area could artificially inflate the rate of drop-off, so we next sampled only cells surrounding variably sized core regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Recent work using developmental and spatial transcriptomics in human tissue has revealed that PCs are genetically diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sepp et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zhong et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldinger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kozareva et al., 2021</xref>). Conservative assessments identify four developmental PC subtypes. While these four subtypes are equally identified in human and mouse PCs, the subtype ratios shifted in mammalian evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sepp et al., 2024</xref>). Moreover, human-specific PC genes have been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchholz et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, variable genetic profiles may factor into the diversification of PC morphology within species and may also underlie the human-specific features observed here. In clarifying how the species diverge, this work not only highlights the importance of further anatomical study in humans but also strengthens the interpretability of disease studies that must by necessity be pursued in animal and in silico models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Masoli et al., 2024</xref>). Dendrite morphology may factor into cerebellar disease etiology. In mouse, PC morphology and CF signaling is altered in disease models such as spinocerebellar ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Du et al., 2019</xref>) and syndromic autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Simmons et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Busch et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Piochon et al., 2014</xref>). On the only occasions that human PC dendritic morphology has been measured with respect to cerebellar disease, it was disrupted in essential tremor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Louis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mavroudis et al., 2022</xref>) and Friedreich’s ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kemp et al., 2016</xref>), and dendritic abnormalities were recently reported in spinocerebellar ataxias and other neurodegenerative movement disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Louis et al., 2023</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Are human PCs an allometrically scaled mouse PC?</title><p>Human PCs are substantially larger than those of the mouse. But are they <italic>just</italic> allometrically scaled mouse PCs? The answer is likely no. Only some features appear to be either invariant or proportionally scaled with molecular layer thickness. We observed similar fractal branching patterns and relative average distances of peak branch number and dendritic length from the soma, suggesting a possible shared dependence on cell-autonomous factors governing the branching pattern. The diameter of thin caliber dendrites is identical, indicating a shared constraint on dendritic thickness, perhaps by limits of physiological conduction.</p><p>The dimensions of the cerebellar cortex are a plausible allometric constraint on cellular growth. Yet, human PCs expand their size well beyond the relative difference in molecular layer thickness—reflected by PC height—by multiplying and extending their primary dendrites outward in the parasagittal axis to articulate an expanded horizontal profile. The horizontal eccentricities of non-primary dendrites further drive the extended width of human PCs and permit spiny branches to double back, overlap in distinct mediolateral planes, and possibly resurvey the PF axons projecting through the arbor. The latter feature could expand combinatorial coding by human PC dendritic branches without requiring increased granule cell or PF densities. Human PCs also exhibit more variable morphological features across locations in the arbor, such as having a rapid rise and decline in branch location, total length, and branching order relative to the position of the soma. The complexity of this distribution is distinct from mouse PCs where these properties are maintained homogeneously through most of their structure. More variable branch lengths may also diversify independent signaling capacity across the arbor. While this cannot currently be tested directly, the confluence of invariant, allometric, and non-allometric morphological features may indicate that human PC physiology diverges from the rodent not only as a matter of scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Masoli et al., 2024</xref>) but as a matter of kind.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Enhanced and human-specific features of input amplification and association by dendritic spines</title><p><italic>Qualitative</italic>, unlike <italic>quantitative</italic>, species differences are uncommon. We observed human-specific spine clusters that—to the best of our knowledge—have not been described before. These clusters certainly deserve further histological and functional characterization that was beyond the scope of this study. Spine clusters may be potentially fertile ground to explore new modes of synaptic and dendritic signaling. Some features—larger size and possibly more postsynaptic densities—represent quantitative expansion, but others may represent novel physiological phenomena. First, unlike branched or calyx spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Loschky et al., 2022</xref>), several synaptic contacts would be exposed to membrane potentials and cytosolic plasticity factors in common. Second, while not quantified here, clustered inputs may operate in variable isolation from the dendrite and other local synapses as the neck diameter varies widely from the conserved value of 0.1–0.3 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harris and Stevens, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ofer et al., 2021</xref>) to 0.5–0.7 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, I</xref>). The latter would have low electrical resistance, more contiguity with the dendritic shaft, and therefore behave like a small dendritic sub-branchlet. Indeed, spine clusters protrude ~1.5–3 μm, echoing the 2–4 μm length of the smallest terminal dendritic branchlets in the mouse. These two features may combine to produce both an associative structure, like proposed for branched spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Loschky et al., 2022</xref>), and a new form of amplifying structure providing the substrate to initiate dendritic calcium spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eilers et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hartell, 1996</xref>).</p><p>In addition to spine clusters, human PCs are more spine dense and thus may receive disproportionately more inputs than rodent PCs. The spine density we observe in mouse differs from studies reporting 1–2/μm—or the frequently cited work in rat reporting, by extrapolation, ~17/μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Napper and Harvey, 1988</xref>)—but are in perfect agreement with recent confocal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">O’Brien and Unwin, 2006</xref>) and EM reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nguyen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Loschky et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hillman and Chen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ichikawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Špaček and Hartmann, 1983</xref>). Our data reveal elevated spine density in distal compartments, which comports with the knowledge that distal compartments receive denser PF innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eccles et al., 1967</xref>). We also show that branched spine density increases distally, possibly supporting their proposed role in associative PF plasticity, a critical feature of the perceptron model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Loschky et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunel et al., 2004</xref>). Larger spine heads in human may strengthen postsynaptic signaling so a higher percentage of inputs can influence PC output than in mouse. Alternatively, this amplification may simply compensate for human PC size, an idea supported by the fact that in human, unlike mouse, the spines are larger in distal compartments. Possibly reflecting shared factors of increased computational complexity and compensation for size or compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2018</xref>), pyramidal cells have similarly greater spine density (pyramidal: 1.3× vs Purkinje: 1.41×) and size (1.27× vs 1.41×) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benavides-Piccione et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benavides-Piccione et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Human Purkinje dendrite size and input numerosity</title><p>The previously reported average human PC dendritic length was 10–20,000 μm, varying with methodology (Golgi impregnation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Louis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Paula-Barbosa et al., 1980</xref>] vs post-fix dye electroporation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Masoli et al., 2024</xref>]). Our current knowledge, then, would conclude that human PCs are the same size as pyramidal cells (L2/3 are ~14,500 μm, &lt;22,000 μm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mohan et al., 2015</xref>]; thick tufted L5/6 are ~1–2000 μm longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mohan et al., 2015</xref>]; hippocampal CA1 are ~18,600 μm, &lt;27,000 μm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mertens et al., 2024</xref>]). While one might naturally expect the 2D radiations of PCs to make them larger in human than 1D radiating pyramidal cells, the previous data would suggest instead that there is a ceiling for maximal neuronal size and that, in human, both cell types met that limit before diverging. On the contrary, we demonstrate for the first time that PCs are substantially bigger than pyramidal cells and boast the largest dendritic arbor of any recorded neuron in the human brain. Intriguingly, our findings also indicate that pyramidal and PCs scale differently in mouse (~5500 vs ~6000 μm) than human (~15,000 vs ~65,000 μm).</p><p>With higher spine density and longer spiny dendrites, we can extrapolate that human PCs likely host half a million spines compared to ~30,000 in mouse. Branched spines (~7% of spines in both species) can host synapses with two PF axons while spine clusters (~10% in human) may host over four. As such, the human may receive ~750,000 synaptic inputs on spines. It is not only staggering to consider a single neuron receiving ~1 million inputs, but it highlights that the species’ dendritic length ratio (11:1) belies an input ratio around 30:1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Human PCs multiplex CFs and other inputs</title><p>We previously found more multi-innervated PCs in posterior lobules of mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and Hansel, 2023</xref>), likely due to the heightened prevalence of multi-branched PCs. This was recently replicated, albeit tangentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nakayama et al., 2024</xref>). We predicted that multi-branched structure permits CF multi-innervation by providing segregated synaptic territories where multiple CFs could avoid the competitive pruning that would have prevented their translocation from soma to dendrite. This prediction was also supported by our finding that surplus CFs had greater synaptic strength in older animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and Hansel, 2023</xref>), possibly reflecting a delayed or elongated maturation process following distinct developmental trajectories of presynaptic plasticity at weak vs strong CF inputs before P21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pätz et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Human PC dendrites commonly ramify in more horizontal eccentricities than in mouse. This produces a distinct multi-branched motif with primary dendrites ramifying outward and giving rise to numerous (around 7–8) sub-compartments, each ~5–10,000 μm in length—roughly an entire rodent cell. Dendrite width complements multi-branched structure to further enable CF multi-innervation in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and Hansel, 2023</xref>). Here, co-immunolabeling of calbindin and peripherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Errante et al., 1998</xref>) provides the first demonstration of CF multi-innervation in adult human. It also extends to humans the hypothesis that multi-branched structure supports CF competition avoidance. Finally, our co-labeling supports a likely higher prevalence of multi-innervation than in mouse.</p><p>Cerebellar cortical geometry allows us to speculate that a horizontally aligned dendritic arbor—often almost a millimeter wide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and G</xref>)—would allow human PCs to receive input from highly segregated excitatory PFs from distant granule cells. If conserved, spatial-functional PF clustering reported in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wilms and Häusser, 2015</xref>) would make their functional similarity diminish with distance. Thus, the disproportionate width of human PCs may sample more distinct PF representations. Similarly, this dendritic width may engender more compartment-specific inhibition by molecular layer interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lackey et al., 2024</xref>) and oversampling of modulatory influence by vertically ascending cholinergic beaded fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barmack et al., 1992</xref>) and Bergmann glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Zeeuw and Hoogland, 2015</xref>). Taken together, human PCs likely perform highly complex input multiplexing and dendritic computations that are unlike what is commonly reported in mouse. This would, in turn, distinguish human PC dendritic plasticity and output information content as distinct from mouse PCs.</p><p>Studies of PC computation have largely considered the dendritic arbor a continuous functional compartment due to the equally unusual singularity and numerousness of CF and PF input, respectively. More recently, experimental and modeling studies demonstrate that Purkinje dendrite compartments exhibit heterogeneous ion channel density and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ohtsuki, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ohtsuki et al., 2012</xref>), localized calcium signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kitamura and Häusser, 2011</xref>), PF input clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wilms and Häusser, 2015</xref>), and variable calcium signaling due to branch shape in a homogeneous channel model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zang and De Schutter, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cirtala and De Schutter, 2024</xref>). Combined with the finding that some PC dendrites are innervated by multiple CFs that confer branch-specific signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and Hansel, 2023</xref>), the potential for dendritic input multiplexing is becoming more widely appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zang and De Schutter, 2021</xref>).</p><p>We previously suggested that CF multi-innervation may be an adaptation to maintain receptive field matching in multi-branched PCs with more disparate PF representations across segregated dendritic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and Hansel, 2023</xref>). This would preserve perceptron function among mouse PCs with expanded dendritic arbors. Our findings extend this concept to human PCs where there is likely a greater demand to match distinct receptive fields. As a possible consequence, human PC output may convey more features of sensory, internal, or cognitive state.

The spatial scale of clustering and the comparative scale ratio (~5–7× longer in human; enhanced clustering in core regions of 2 mm vs 400 μm) are congruent with the absolute and relative widths of the dendritic arbor. Both properties support the idea that neighboring cells’ primary dendrites may reciprocally influence each other during development. Notably, the clustering scale ratio exceeds the comparative PC height ratio (a proxy for allometric constraint). This comports with observations that segregated branches of multi-dendritic mouse PCs often stagger in interdigitated dendrite arbors with lower medio-lateral overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nedelescu et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that cerebellar cortical region, especially in human, may employ ‘patches’ of homogeneous PC morphologies to create niches for heterogeneous computations. Nonrandom spatial clustering of neuronal cells by morphological subtype has not previously been described in other brain areas, potentially making this a cerebellum-specific means to boost functional diversity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Human cerebellar tissue was collected from three unembalmed and three embalmed donor bodies provided by the Anatomical Gift Association of Illinois (AGAI) and the New York Brain Bank (NYBB).

Gyrus was defined as a region where the total parasagittal length of the pial surface exceeded that of the border between the granule cell layer and the white matter. Bank was defined as regions where those two lengths were equal, such that neither layer of the cortex was compressed or expanded relative to the other.

Spines were categorized as branched if two heads emerged from a shared neck emerging from the dendrite.

Second, an initial cluster score of –1 was assigned to each cell. Third, the final cluster score was assessed for each cell based on whether the leading or following immediately adjacent cell matched the morphology of that cell. If there were adjacent cells within the threshold distance (1000 µm for human, 200 µm for mouse), then the cluster score was set at 0. Leading or following adjacent cells with matching morphologies each added (+1) to the cluster score, producing either a final score of 1 if one of two adjacent cells match or 2 if both are matching. The morphology match was determined one of several different ways, requiring either a complete match (e.g. both the morphological type of Normative, Split, or Poly and the orientation of Vertical or Horizontal are the same; thus, cells fall into five total categories of Normative, vertical Split, horizontal Split, vertical Poly, and horizontal Poly, wherein a vertical Split cell does not match with a horizontal Split cell or a vertical Poly cell), or a more liberal match by only morphological type (e.g. Normative, Split, or Poly; thus, a vertical Split cell matches with a horizontal Split cell but not a vertical Poly cell) or orientation (e.g. vertical or horizontal; thus, a vertical Split cell does not match with a horizontal Split cell but does match a vertical Poly cell). Once cluster scores were calculated, consecutive IDs were assigned to each cluster such that the number of cells and total parasagittal inter-somatic distance could be determined. The identical operation was performed for a shuffled version of each dataset to compare the observed effect of clustering with chance based on cell-type ratios. All aspects of cell information were held constant (e.g. X,Y coordinate, location by foliar subdivision) and the morphology was shuffled without replacement (i.e. the same ratio of cell types was maintained). To assess the specific effect of foliar location on clustering, the same analysis was performed but using a shuffled dataset in which the possible shuffled cell-type identities for each cell was only drawn from the cells within the same foliar subdivision (e.g. gyrus, bank, or sulcus).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>Population clustering</title><p>Here, the number of cells of every type was tallied among the whole population of cells within a defined distance of each cell in question. This threshold varied from 250 µm and 50 µm in human and mouse, respectively, to 10 mm and 2 mm, respectively. Thus, this analysis is more lenient to interruptions in an otherwise relatively homogeneous population by assessing multiple cells and not just the single most adjacent leading and following cells. The frequency of observing each cell type in the population around each cell type was determined. From that was subtracted the same calculation for a version of each dataset that was shuffled as described above without considering foliar location (e.g. new shuffled identities were drawn from the whole population, not just from those cells in the same foliar subdivision). This subtraction gave us a percent relative increase in the rate of observing either the one complete matching morphology, or any of all four nonmatching morphologies, vs the rate expected by chance. Then, across all cell types, we averaged the rates of all matches (e.g. combining the rate of vertical Splits near a vertical Split with the rate of horizontal Polys near horizontal Polys, etc.) and non-matches (e.g. combining the rate of vertical Splits near a horizontal Polys with the rate of vertical Polys near Normative, etc.).</p><p>When measuring wider populations with larger radius thresholds, we controlled for the effect of local clustering on the rate of clustering among distant cells by instead assessing cell populations selectively in 500 µm leading and following shell regions around each cell while ignoring the most immediately local cells within the core region (from the soma location to the inner edge of the shell analysis region) around the cell in question. For example, to analyze clustering in a 500–1000 µm shell region, we only included cells that were at least 500 µm away but no more than 1000 µm away on either side (leading and following the cell in question), and thus ignored more local cells within a core 1000 µm (500 µm on either side) of the cell in question. Similarly, to analyze clustering in a 1500–2000 µm shell region, we only included cells that were at least 1500 µm away but no more than 2000 µm away on either side (leading and following), and thus ignored more local cells within a 3000 µm core region around the cell. By calculating the elevation of clustering over chance for equivalently sized shell regions with variable distances running stepwise in 500 µm increments while ignoring a growing core region, we could selectively isolate distant populations and observe the true drop-off distance for clustering.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistics</title><p>Standard parametric statistics such as the Student’s t-test or ANOVA with Tukey post hoc and Bonferroni correction were used to assess individual and multi-group comparisons except in cases where the data were non-normally distributed, in which case we used single or multiple comparisons Mann-Whitney U tests. In cases of a paired comparison where the underlying inter-individual variability was uninformative, we performed a one-way Student’s t-test on within-individual normalized data. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess differences between cumulative distributions. A chi-squared test for independence was used to distinguish the ratios of categorical data by group. Co-variation of each measure by sex was assessed but no significant differences were observed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>For experiments involving mice, all experimental and surgical procedures were in accordance with the University of Chicago Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-105013-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated and analyzed during this study, along with code, is included in the manuscript and available in a Zenodo repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15066697">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15066697</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Busch</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2025">2025</year><data-title>Non-allometric expansion and enhanced compartmentalization of Purkinje cell dendrites in the human cerebellum</data-title><source>Zenodo</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5281/zenodo.15066697</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>For valuable advice and technical support, we thank Hansel lab members T-F Lin, A Silbaugh, D Huang, and A Ferrell.

We appreciate that the reviewer acknowledges that this is out of necessity as those factors are inaccessible to experimentation at the current time; however, we are enthusiastic that our current findings will motivate future work that will shed light on these critical additional features of the system, both in rodents and humans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>PCs are now known to be genetically diverse, with unique PC types found only in humans. Could this cellular diversity contribute to the differences observed between species in this study? This possibility should be at least discussed in the context of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a fascinating possibility. The perhaps most detailed recent study (Sepp et al., Nature 625, 2024) – in a conservative assessment – describes four developmental PC subtypes in mice that are identical in humans. The study points out that the subtype ratio changes over the course of development, though. Taken together with the possibility of additional human-specific subtypes, a genetic basis for morphological as well as physiological diversity arises. This is now discussed on p. 7. It needs to be kept in mind, however, that other factors, such as push-pull influences during tissue growth, might also play a role.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The human tissue used in this study was obtained from elderly individuals, while the mouse tissue was not. It is unclear whether the age difference might influence the findings, and this warrants further discussion or control.</p></disp-quote><p>We share this concern, in particular regarding the spine / spine cluster analysis as here tissue quality and or degenerative effects might play a role. We additionally analyzed a tissue sample from a 37 year-old human, and observed the same spine clusters as in the other human brains. This is now described on p. 4 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study includes spine size comparisons, but it is not clear if the point spread function (PSF) of the microscope provides the necessary resolution for these quantitative assessments. For instance, are multi-headed spines truly multi-headed, or could this be an artifact of limited resolution?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. We addressed it by calculating the Rayleigh limit (more conservative than the Abbe limit) as 248.4nm for the equipment and conditions used (Methods, p. 22). On pages 3-5, we updated our Results section accordingly to point out what quantifications are well supported and discuss the limitations (p. 3-5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>This is nice work which must have been very time-consuming. It would be good to make sure that the technical details are properly discussed, to quantify the data properly. Please include details of how you measured the resolution of the microscope used to evaluate spine size.</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to the last comment of Referee 1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The figure panels are mostly satisfactory, but they are exceptionally crowded and will probably be difficult to read at the final size. Some work tidying these would be worth it. In Figure 3B, include mention of open and blue triangles in legend. In 3E, the dendritic branches are shown at a different gray scale. You have not done this elsewhere, so probably good to mention it in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3 and its legend have been updated / improved accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The definition of horizontal and vertical is not absolutely clear. Perhaps re-assess this bit of the text. Does it mean that you did not include cells that were neither vertical nor horizontal?</p></disp-quote><p>We categorized those PCs as ‘vertical’ that have a &gt;30° angle relative to the PC layer, and those as ‘horizontal’ that have a &lt;30° angle relative to the PC layer. All PCs are covered by these categories. This is now described on p. 5.</p></body></sub-article></article>
