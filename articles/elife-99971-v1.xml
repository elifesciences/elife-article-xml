nematode and mouse models. Previous work supports that <italic>C. elegans fmo-2</italic> promotes longevity, stress resistance, and healthspan by rewiring endogenous metabolism. However, there are five <italic>C. elegans</italic> FMOs and five mammalian FMOs, and it is not known whether promoting longevity and health benefits is a conserved role of this gene family. Here, we report that expression of <italic>C. elegans fmo-4</italic> promotes lifespan extension and paraquat stress resistance downstream of both dietary restriction and inhibition of mTOR. We find that overexpression of <italic>fmo-4</italic> in just the hypodermis is sufficient for these benefits, and that this expression significantly modifies the transcriptome. By analyzing changes in gene expression, we find that genes related to calcium signaling are significantly altered downstream of <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression. Highlighting the importance of calcium homeostasis in this pathway, <italic>fmo-4</italic> overexpressing animals are sensitive to thapsigargin, an ER stressor that inhibits calcium flux from the cytosol to the ER lumen. This calcium/<italic>fmo-4</italic> interaction is solidified by data showing that modulating intracellular calcium with either small molecules or genetics can change expression of <italic>fmo-4</italic> and/or interact with <italic>fmo-4</italic> to affect lifespan and stress resistance. Further analysis supports a pathway where <italic>fmo-4</italic> modulates calcium homeostasis downstream of activating transcription factor-6 (<italic>atf-6</italic>), whose knockdown induces and requires <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression. Together, our data identify <italic>fmo-4</italic> as a longevity-promoting gene whose actions interact with known longevity pathways and calcium homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>flavin-containing monooxygenase</kwd><kwd>stress resistance</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>ER</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG075061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leiser</surname><given-names>Scott F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AG000114</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tuckowski</surname><given-names>Angela M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leiser</surname><given-names>Scott F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007270</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rackham Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tuckowski</surname><given-names>Angela M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>fmo-4</italic> slows aging downstream of dietary restriction and mTOR and regulates calcium-mediated signaling in the hypodermis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging is a major risk factor for the onset of cancer, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and many other serious illnesses. Studying the aging process is crucial because a more comprehensive understanding can lead to the development of therapeutics that treat multiple diseases simultaneously. The use of model organisms, from yeast to mammals, has helped define genetic and environmental pathways that influence aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kenyon, 2010</xref>). Many of these pathways, such as dietary restriction (DR), defined as a decrease in nutrient intake without malnutrition, involve active modification of metabolism that robustly and reproducibly improve health and longevity across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bodkin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Swindell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kapahi et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, the response to oxygen deficiency, or hypoxic response, can lead to increased longevity, healthspan, and stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shen et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> both DR and the hypoxic response converge upon a single gene, <italic>fmo-2,</italic> that is necessary and sufficient to improve health and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leiser et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>FMOs are a family of enzymes that use oxygen and NADPH to oxygenate nucleophilic substrates. FMOs oxygenate a wide array of xenobiotic substrates and were discovered ~50 y ago for their role in drug metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krueger and Williams, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rossner et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, a majority of published data on FMOs relate to this role. Recently, studies have begun to focus on the endogenous role(s) of FMOs. Results show that multiple mammalian FMO proteins are involved in systemic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Steinbaugh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2023</xref>). We initially discovered a role for <italic>C. elegans fmo-2</italic> in regulating stress resistance and longevity downstream of DR and hypoxia and have continued to identify role(s) for FMO-2 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> metabolism and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2023</xref>). However, the conserved mechanisms for FMO-mediated health benefits are still unclear, as are the roles of individual FMO enzymes. Thus, to best understand how FMOs could be leveraged to improve health, we need to understand the conserved mechanism of these enzymes in longevity and metabolism.</p><p>There are five <italic>C. elegans</italic> FMOs, and three of the five share significant structural overlap with mammalian FMOs. This overlap involves a predicted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization and a membrane-spanning domain, which are each found in <italic>fmo-1, fmo-2</italic>, and <italic>fmo-4</italic>. In comparison to the more well-studied longevity gene <italic>fmo-2, fmo-4</italic> in particular shares 88% identity in the catalytic domain amino acids, suggesting that FMO-2 and FMO-4 may bind similar substrates and could plausibly have overlapping endogenous roles. Published data also show that DR induces both <italic>fmo-2</italic> and <italic>fmo-4</italic> gene expression, implying a role for <italic>fmo-4</italic> in longevity regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rossner et al., 2017</xref>). Based on this, we hypothesized that <italic>fmo-4</italic> may play a role in <italic>C. elegans</italic> longevity and that studying this role can help to understand this gene family and its relevance to aging.</p><p>FMOs are transmembrane enzymes thought to primarily reside in the ER. While mainly studied for its involvement in protein and lipid synthesis, the ER also plays a key role in metabolism and maintaining homeostasis within the cell. For instance, the ER responds to misfolded proteins by eliciting its unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>ER</sup>), thereby removing dysfunctional proteins and restoring homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Read and SchrÃ¶der, 2021</xref>). The ER is also responsible for storing and releasing calcium in a coordinated manner with the cytosol and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Groenendyk et al., 2021</xref>). The ER establishes calcium homeostasis through processes involving (1) sequestering calcium in the lumen with the calreticulin chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Groenendyk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Park et al., 2001</xref>), (2) releasing calcium into the cytosol through the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Groenendyk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berridge, 1993</xref>), and (3) bringing calcium into the ER lumen through the sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Groenendyk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marchi and Pinton, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the ERâs role in regulating metabolic and calcium homeostasis in the cell has recently been linked to longevity in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Knocking out <underline>a</underline>ctivating <underline>t</underline>ranscription <underline>f</underline>actor (<italic>atf</italic>)â6, one of the three branches of the UPR<sup>ER</sup>, modulates calcium signaling from the ER to the mitochondria, resulting in increased mitochondrial turnover and lifespan extension in <italic>C. elegans (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burkewitz et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Given that (1) <italic>fmo-4</italic> is induced by a longevity-promoting pathway (DR), (2) <italic>fmo-4</italic> is predicted to be an ER transmembrane protein, and (3) the ERâs role in cellular homeostasis is linked to aging, we hypothesized that <italic>fmo-4</italic> regulates longevity by modulating ER-related processes. Here, we test this hypothesis by modifying <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression and interrogating interactions between <italic>fmo-4,</italic> stress resistance, longevity, and the ER. Our resulting data show that <italic>fmo-4</italic> promotes longevity and paraquat stress resistance downstream of mTOR and DR through calcium homeostasis. We find that not only is <italic>fmo-4</italic> a regulator of multiple longevity-promoting pathways, but it is also sufficient to extend lifespan and confer paraquat stress resistance when overexpressed either ubiquitously or in the hypodermis. Transcriptomics data and stress assays reveal that calcium signaling is altered downstream of <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression, and that <italic>fmo-4</italic> interacts with calcium regulation between the ER and mitochondria to promote longevity and paraquat stress resistance. Together, these results establish <italic>fmo-4</italic> as a longevity-promoting gene and provide evidence as to how <italic>fmo-4</italic> extends <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan through calcium-mediated ER to mitochondrial processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Cefmo-4</italic> is required for DR and mTOR-mediated lifespan extension</title><p><italic>C. elegans fmo-4</italic> shares significant similarities to its family member and longevity gene, <italic>fmo-2,</italic> including 88% conservation in catalytic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), a transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and predicted subcellular localization in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kishore et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, <italic>fmo-4</italic> is induced by the longevity intervention DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rossner et al., 2017</xref>). These structural similarities and DR-mediated induction led us to hypothesize that <italic>fmo-4</italic> may play a role in aging. To test this, we first asked whether <italic>fmo-4</italic> is required for well-studied longevity pathways, including DR. We utilized <italic>fmo-4</italic>(<italic>ok294</italic>) knockout (KO) animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">C. elegans Deletion Mutant Consortium, 2012</xref>) on five conditions reported to extend lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Since <italic>fmo-4</italic> is induced by dietary restriction, we started with fed and DR (sDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greer and Brunet, 2009</xref>) conditions. Our results show that loss of <italic>fmo-4</italic> has no significant effect on control-fed worms but prevents nearly all the lifespan extension seen under DR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Wild-type (WT) worms on DR experience a ~35% lifespan extension compared to fed WT worms, but when <italic>fmo-4</italic> is knocked out this extension is reduced to ~10% and this interaction is significant by Cox regression (p-value &lt;4.50e<sup>â6</sup>). These data support that <italic>fmo-4</italic> is required for the DR longevity pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Having established this role, we continued lifespan analyses of <italic>fmo-4</italic> KO worms exposed to RNAi knockdown of the S6-kinase gene <italic>rsks-1</italic> (mTOR signaling; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pan et al., 2007</xref>), the Von Hippel-Lindau gene <italic>vhl-1</italic> (hypoxic signaling; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leiser et al., 2013</xref>), the insulin receptor <italic>daf-2</italic> (insulin-like signaling; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kimura et al., 1997</xref>), and the cytochrome c reductase gene <italic>cyc-1</italic> (mitochondrial electron transport chain, cytochrome c reductase; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâF</xref>). The resulting data show that <italic>fmo-4</italic> is fully required for <italic>rsks-1</italic>-mediated longevity as marked by a complete abrogation of the <italic>rsks-1</italic> RNAi lifespan extension when <italic>fmo-4</italic> is knocked out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), placing <italic>fmo-4</italic> downstream of mTOR. <italic>fmo-4</italic> was not required for the hypoxic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), insulin-like signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), or cytochrome c reductase inhibition pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) to increase lifespan. It is notable that, unlike <italic>fmo-4, fmo-2</italic> is required for <italic>vhl-1</italic>-mediated longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leiser et al., 2015</xref>). This result, coupled with <italic>fmo-4</italic> and <italic>fmo-2</italic> each being required for DR, suggests that these two genes in the same family are overlapping but distinct in their requirement. Together, these data suggest that <italic>fmo-4</italic> plays a necessary role in <italic>C. elegans</italic> longevity regulation downstream of at least two pathways: DR and mTOR signaling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Cefmo-4</italic> regulates mTOR and dietary restriction-mediated longevity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hydropathy plots of FMO-2 and FMO-4 predicting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane (TM) domains based on protein sequence analysis.

We find that ubiquitous <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE is sufficient for an improvement (p=0.011) in healthspan benefits with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). We next measured the stress resistance of the ubiquitous <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worms to 5 mM paraquat (oxidative stress), 37 Â°C heat stress, 5 Âµg/mL of tunicamycin (ER glycosylation stress), and 1 mg/mL thapsigargin (ER calcium stress). We included two ER stresses because FMO-4 is predicted to be an ER transmembrane protein. We find that ubiquitous <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE is sufficient to convey paraquat stress resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) but does not offer any protection from heat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) or tunicamycin stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

We first validated that carbachol increases calcium levels by utilizing worms that neuronally express the calcium indicator GCaMP7f (SWF702; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dag et al., 2023</xref>).

Previous results suggest that loss of <italic>itr-1</italic> decreases WT lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burkewitz et al., 2020</xref>), which our results confirm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Importantly, we also find that <italic>itr-1</italic> RNAi decreases lifespan of <italic>fmo-4</italic> KO worms similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) and <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) worms to a greater extent than WT, negating the relative longevity of <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worms compared to WT. Thus, <italic>itr-1</italic> is required to increase lifespan downstream of <italic>fmo-4</italic>. MCU (<italic>mcu-</italic>1) is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and allows cytosolic calcium into the inner mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Groenendyk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marchi and Pinton, 2014</xref>). We also find that <italic>mcu-1</italic> is required downstream of <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE, as <italic>mcu-1</italic> RNAi abrogates the <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The <italic>fmo-4</italic> KO lifespan is slightly decreased on <italic>mcu-1</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).

The relationship between <italic>fmo-4</italic> and calcium is further illustrated by <italic>fmo-4</italic> OEâs susceptibility to thapsigargin, a calcium-mediated ER stress.

Collectively, our data suggest that <italic>fmo-4</italic> promotes longevity and paraquat stress resistance by regulating calcium homeostasis between the ER and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies from our lab have elucidated how <italic>C. elegans fmo-2</italic> promotes longevity through endogenous metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2023</xref>). Based on the conservation within the <italic>fmo</italic> gene family and that multiple Fmos are induced in long-lived worms and mammals, it was reasonable to hypothesize that Fmos could play overlapping roles in longevity regulation. Our data here support the broader hypothesis that Fmos have a conserved role in aging, but interestingly, that the mechanisms by which they modulate aging are separable. Importantly, we find that <italic>fmo-4</italic> is required for multiple longevity-promoting pathways, including DR and mTOR, but is not required for lifespan extension through the hypoxic response, insulin-like signaling, or cytochrome c reductase pathways. We also find that <italic>fmo-4</italic> does not require <italic>fmo-2,</italic> but that <italic>fmo-2</italic> does require <italic>fmo-4</italic>. This is interesting because not only do these data tell us that <italic>fmo-4</italic> is important in the context of longevity, but also that it acts distinctly from <italic>fmo-2</italic>.</p><p>After creating ubiquitous and hypodermal-specific <italic>fmo-4</italic> overexpressing strains, we find that <italic>fmo-4</italic> is sufficient for longevity and paraquat stress resistance but not heat, tunicamycin, or thapsigargin stress. These results further differentiate <italic>fmo-4</italic> from <italic>fmo-2</italic> and also provide insight into <italic>fmo-4âs</italic> potential roles in the cell. For instance, <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE wormsâ resistance to paraquat could suggest a role in responding to or controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the mitochondria. Additionally, <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE wormsâ sensitivity to thapsigargin likely points towards an involvement in ER calcium regulation. These are both interesting plausible roles for <italic>fmo-4,</italic> and may go hand in hand, as calcium levels are known to impact ROS levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">GÃ¶rlach et al., 2015</xref>), and changes in ROS levels are known to impact ER calcium release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">GÃ¶rlach et al., 2015</xref>). Based on this and the data with calcium perturbations, we speculate that FMO-4 acts as a calcium sensor, and when calcium levels are too high or too low, FMO-4 responds by regulating downstream calcium signaling proteins to restore homeostasis in the cell. As FMO-4 is a predicted ER transmembrane protein, we hypothesize that FMO-4 is sensing changes in calcium levels in the ER and/or cytosol.</p><p>We note that our data reveal genetic interactions between <italic>fmo-4</italic> and other longevity pathways like DR, mTOR, FMO-2<italic>,</italic> and ATF-6. However, it is important to also understand on the protein level how FMO-4 is interacting with these pathways and how FMO-4 is regulating downstream calcium signaling components to promote longevity and paraquat stress resistance. For instance, it was previously shown that rabbit FMO protein forms a complex with calreticulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guan et al., 1991</xref>). It is possible that an increase in FMO-4 leads to more binding between FMO-4 and calreticulin, which ultimately prevents calreticulin from binding ER calcium. This would then allow for proper calcium flux from the ER to the mitochondria via the IP<sub>3</sub>R and MCU, respectively. Our future work will look into these protein interactions so that we can further tease apart the FMO-4-mediated longevity pathway. We also note that we have utilized RNAi knockdown rather than knockout mutants to assess these genetic interactions with <italic>fmo-4</italic>. In particular, we were wary of knocking out crucial calcium regulating genes, like <italic>itr-1</italic> and <italic>mcu-1,</italic> that already result in some level of sickness in the worms when knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) or could potentially lead to other confounding metabolic changes if knocked out. We were able to obtain robust and reproducible results using RNAi knockdown, but recognize the caveats that come with not testing full deletion mutants.</p><p>While our transcriptomics analysis and calcium manipulations suggest <italic>fmo-4</italic> involvement in calcium regulation, there are other measures that can better assess an interaction between <italic>fmo-4</italic> and calcium. Carbachol and EDTA supplementation are not perfect assessments of altered calcium levels, as carbachol does not act in every tissue and EDTA may be depleting more than just calcium from the cell. Thus, future studies should measure calcium levels and calcium flux in <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE and KO worms using GCaMP expressing worms to determine the direct link between <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression and calcium in the cell. Additionally, to determine if FMO-4 is acting as a calcium sensor or interacting with one to regulate calcium homeostasis, development of FMO-4 antibodies for immunoprecipitation assays would be useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaufmann and Sauter, 2017</xref>). Together, it will be important to establish the biochemical parameters of the FMO-4 calcium interaction.</p><p>As calcium signaling occurs between the ER and the mitochondria, our results could have interesting implications in ER-mitochondrial metabolism. We would expect that FMO-4 regulates ER-mitochondria metabolism because (1) FMO-4 is a predicted ER transmembrane protein and blocking the expression of another ER transmembrane protein, ATF-6, induces the expression of <italic>fmo-4</italic>, (2) <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worms are highly sensitive to ER calcium stress but resistant to ROS induced stress, (3) lifespan extension driven by <italic>fmo-4</italic> depends on mitochondrial calcium import (<italic>mcu-1</italic>), and (4) Fmo gene expression is induced by mitochondrial inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, changes in mitochondrial calcium import affect various mitochondrial measures like respiration, dynamics (i.e. fission and fusion), membrane potential, and TCA cycle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Duchen, 2000</xref>). Future studies will delve into how <italic>fmo-4</italic> perturbations impact each of these measures and if they act in the <italic>fmo-4-</italic>mediated longevity pathway. Based on our data, we speculate that <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE may increase mitochondrial calcium by regulating <italic>mcu-1</italic> activity, and that <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worms may in turn be regulating ROS production in the mitochondria. We hypothesize that changes in <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression will alter mitochondrial respiration, dynamics, membrane potential, and TCA cycle activity. Taken together, future experiments will shed light on the role that FMOs play in calcium regulation and mitochondrial metabolism and will help to further tease apart the FMO-mediated longevity pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p>Standard <italic>C. elegans</italic> cultivation procedures were used as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leiser et al., 2015</xref>).

In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, fmo-2 has received the majority of attention, but there are multiple fmo genes in both worms and mammals, and how overlapping or distinct the functional roles of these paralogs are remains unclear. Here Tuckowski et al. identify that a new family member, fmo-4, is also a positive modulator of lifespan. Based on differential requirements of fmo-2 and fmo-4 in stress resistance and lifespan extension paradigms, however, the authors conclude that fmo-4 acts through mechanisms that are distinct from fmo-2. Ultimately, the authors place fmo-2 genetically within a pathway involving atf-6, calreticulin, the IP3 receptor, and mitochondrial calcium uniporter, which was previously shown to link ER calcium homeostasis to mitochondrial homeostasis and longevity. The authors thus achieve their overarching aim to reveal that different FMO family members regulate stress resistance and lifespan through distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, because the known enzymatic activity of FMOs involves oxygenating xenobiotic and endogenous metabolites, these findings highlight a potential new link between redox/metabolic homeostasis and ER-mitochondrial calcium signaling.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors demonstrate links between multiple conserved life-extending signaling pathways and fmo-4, expanding both the significance and mechanistic diversity of FMO-family genes in aging and stress biology.</p><p>The authors use genetics to discover an interesting and unanticipated new link between FMOs and calcium pathways known to regulate lifespan.</p><p>The genetic epistasis patterns for lifespan and stress resistance phenotypes are generally clean and compelling.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors achieve a necessary and valuable first step with regard to linking FMO-4 to calcium homeostasis, but the mechanisms involved remain preliminary at this stage. Specifically, the genetic interactions between fmo-4 and conserved mediators of calcium transport and signaling are convincing, but a putative molecular mechanism by which the activity of FMO-4 would alter subcellular calcium transport remains unclear and potentially indirect. The authors effectively highlight this gap as a key pursuit for subsequent studies.</p><p>The authors have shown that carbachol and EDTA produce the expected effects on a cytosolic calcium reporter in neurons, supporting the utility of the chemical approach in general, but validating that carbachol, EDTA and fmo-4 itself have an impact on calcium in the tissues and subcellular compartments relevant to the lifespan phenotypes would still be valuable in supporting the overall model. Notably, however, the hypodermal-specific role of FMO-4 suggests potential cell non-autonomous regulation of lifespan, such that this pathway may ultimately involve complex inter-cellular signaling that would necessitate substantially more time and effort.</p><p>Employing mutants and more sophisticated genetic tools for modulating calcium transport or signaling (in addition to RNAi) would strengthen key conclusions and/or help to elucidate tissue- or age-specific aspects of the proposed mechanism.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99971.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors assessed the potential involvement of fmo-4 in a diverse set of longevity interventions, showing that this gene is required for DR and S6 kinase knockdown related lifespan extension. Using comprehensive epistasis experiments they find this gene to be a required downstream player in the longevity and stress resistance provided by fmo-2 overexpression. They further showed that fmo-4 ubiquitous overexpression is sufficient to provide longevity and paraquat (mitochondrial) stress resistance, and that overexpression specifically in the hypodermis is sufficient to recapitulate most of these effects.</p><p>Interestingly, they find that fmo-4 overexpression sensitizes worms to thapsigargin during development, an effect that they link with a potential dysregulation in calcium signalling. They go on to show that fmo-4 expression is sensitive to drugs that both increase or decrease calcium levels, and these drugs differentially affect lifespan of fmo-4 mutants compared to wild-type worms. Similarly, knockdown of genes involved in calcium binding and signalling also differentially affect lifespan and paraquat resistance of fmo-4 mutants.</p><p>Finally, they suggest that atf-6 limits the expression of fmo-4, and that fmo-4 is also acting downstream of benefits produced by atf-6 knockdown.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>â¢ comprehensive lifespans experiments: clear placement of fmo-4 within established longevity interventions.</p><p>â¢ clear distinction in functions and epistatic interactions between fmo-2 and fmo-4 which lays a strong foundation for a longevity pathway regulated by this enzyme family.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>â¢ no obvious transcriptomic evidence supporting a link between fmo-4 and calcium signalling: either for knockout worms or fmo-4 overexpressing strains.</p><p>â¢ no direct measures of alterations in calcium flux, signalling or binding that strongly support a connection with fmo-4.</p><p>â¢ no measures of mitochondrial morphology or activity that strongly support a connection with fmo-4.</p><p>â¢ lack of a complete model that places fmo-4 function downstream of DR and mTOR signalling (first Results section), fmo-2 (second Results section) and at the same time explains connection with calcium signalling.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have addressed and fixed all the private comments we had made. In terms of the public comments, I think nothing has changed in terms of strengths and weaknesses. They have multiple independent results (drugs, RNAi and transcriptomics) that suggest a connection between fmo-4 and calcium regulation, but there is no strong evidence for what this connection is. The work still lacks direct measures of calcium, ER or mitochondrial function in relation to fmo-4 (which they acknowledge in the discussion). The first four sections strongly place fmo-4 within established longevity interventions, but their model doesn't explain how calcium regulation would fit into these.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99971.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tuckowski</surname><given-names>Angela M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ann Arbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Beydoun</surname><given-names>Safa</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ann Arbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kitto</surname><given-names>Elizabeth S</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Michigan</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ann Arbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bhat</surname><given-names>Ajay</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ann Arbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Howington</surname><given-names>Marshall B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ann Arbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sridhar</surname><given-names>Aditya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ann Arbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bhandari</surname><given-names>Mira</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ann Arbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chambers</surname><given-names>Kelly</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ann Arbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Leiser</surname><given-names>Scott F</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ann Arbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p><p>Comment 1: Within the scope of the current work there are no major weaknesses.

Validating that these agents and fmo-4 itself have an impact on calcium in relevant subcellular compartments is important to support conclusions on how fmo-4 regulates and responds to calcium.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important suggestion. We agree that carbachol and EDTA can be broad agents and validating that they are altering calcium levels is very useful. While this is technically challenging, we attempted to address this by using neuronally expressed GCaMP7f calcium indicator worms and measuring their GFP fluorescence upon exposure to carbachol and EDTA. Assessing both short term and long term exposure to these agents, we were able to show that carbachol increases GFP fluorescence, indicating an increase in calcium levels, and EDTA decreases GFP fluorescence, indicating a decrease in calcium levels. Unfortunately, because FMO-4 is not neuronally expressed, we were not able to test the effects of FMO-4 on calcium in this strain, which would require hypodermal expression and possibly short-term modification of <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression to test. We have made sure to temper our language about the indirect measures we used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2: Experiments are generally reliant on RNAi. While in most cases experiments reveal positive results, indicating RNAi efficacy, key conclusions could be strengthened with the incorporation of mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate and value this suggestion and agree that mutants could be helpful to strengthen our conclusions. We address this caveat in the discussion of the revised manuscript. We explain that we were concerned about knocking out key calcium regulating genes like <italic>itr-1</italic> and <italic>mcu-1</italic> that either already result in some level of sickness in the worms when knocked down (<italic>itr-1</italic>) or could lead to confounding metabolic changes if knocked out. We do find that our RNAi lifespan results are robust and reproducible, but we also understand and recognize the caveats that come with using RNAi knockdown instead of full deletion mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 3:</bold></p><p>Comment 1: no obvious transcriptomic evidence supporting a link between fmo-4 and calcium signaling: either for knockout worms or fmo-4 overexpressing strains.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this feedback. While there is some transcriptomic evidence, we agree that it is not overwhelming evidence. We do think that this evidence, combined with the phenotype observed under thapsigargin (i.e., significant reduction in worm size and significant delay or prevention of development), in addition to the genetic connections to calcium regulation, provide additional compelling evidence that FMO-4 interacts with calcium signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2: no direct measures of alterations in calcium flux, signalling or binding that strongly support a connection with fmo-4.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in reviewer 2 comment 1, we have successfully used GCaMP7f worms to assess calcium flux upon exposure to carbachol and EDTA. This approach confirmed the changes in calcium expected from these compounds. Unfortunately, because FMO-4 is not neuronally expressed, we were not able to test the effects of FMO-4 on calcium in this strain, which would require hypodermal expression and possibly short-term modification of <italic>fmo-4</italic> expression to test.

We have made sure all the references are properly italicized where necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p><p>Comment 1: While FMO-4 is clearly placed in the ER calcium pathway genetically, the molecular mechanism by which FMO-4 would alter ER calcium is unclear. Notably, Tuckowski et al. highlight this gap in the discussion as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for identifying this important caveat. We hope to address the molecular mechanism by which FMO-4 alters ER calcium in upcoming projects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2: Determining whether overexpression of catalytically dead FMO-4 or introduction of an inactivating point mutant into the endogenous locus phenocopy FMO-4 OE and KO animals would help distinguish between mechanisms involving protein-protein interactions or downstream metabolic regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. This is an experiment we are hoping to do in the near future to better understand molecular mechanisms and protein-protein interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>Comment 1: When measuring the effect of thapsigargin on development of fmo-4 mutants it would be great to use a developmental assay rather than quantifying normalized worm area. Also please add scale bars to Figure 3G and 4H, it seems that fmo-4 overexpression decreases worm size even in control conditions, clarify if this is the case.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this feedback. In addition to quantifying normalized worm area in Figure 3G-I, we have added a developmental assay (Figure 3J) that shows the development time of wild-type worms on DMSO or thapsigargin as well as the <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worms on DMSO or thapsigargin. These data validate that the <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worm development is either delayed significantly or even prevented when the worms are treated with thapsigargin.</p><p>We have added scale bars to Figure 3G and 4H as suggested.</p><p>We also appreciate the reviewerâs observation of the <italic>fmo-4</italic> overexpression worms appearing smaller than wild-type worms in control conditions. We looked through the replicates and found that just one replicate showed a significant decrease in worm size, as observed in our unrevised manuscript. We repeated this experiment twice more to gather more data and determined that the <italic>fmo-4</italic> overexpression worms were ultimately not significantly different in size compared to wild-type worms. We have included the new images and quantifications in Figure 3G-I and Figure 4H-J in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2: correct or replace Supplementary Table 2, which is not showing a DAVID analysis as the title and text would suggest. We should see biological/molecular processes, effect sizes, p-values, ...</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for identifying this issue. We have added more detail to the Supplementary Table 2 so that it is clearer what is being shown in each tab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3: clarify the data presented in Supplementary Data 2 because it does not clearly explain what is shown</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point, and we have added more detail to the Supplementary Data 2 to make sure the data are more clearly explained in each tab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4: in Figure 5B the fluorescent images do not seem to reflect the quantification in panel 5C.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this feedback. We re-analyzed our data to make sure the proper fluorescent images are included with their matching quantifications in Figure 5B-C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5: where is Supplementary Data 3?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this. Supplementary Data 3 was accidentally missing from the first submission, and has now been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 6: conceptually the last results section (regarding atf-6) does not add much to the story, I would consider removing these results</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this feedback. We have decided to keep Figure 7 because we think it helps to validate <italic>fmo-4</italic>âs role in calcium movement from the ER. While we show genetic interactions between <italic>fmo-4</italic> and key genes involved in calcium regulation (<italic>crt-1, itr-1,</italic> and <italic>mcu-1</italic>), we think that showing how <italic>fmo-4</italic> also interacts with <italic>atf-6,</italic> a known regulator of calcium homeostasis, strengthens and supports the genetic mechanisms of <italic>fmo-4</italic> proposed in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 7: the model proposed in Figure 7E is not convincingly supported by the results:</p><p>o the arrows connecting atf-6, fmo-4 and crt-1 (calreticulin) suggest that fmo-4 is downstream of atf-6 and upstream of crt-1: Berkowitz 2020 showed that atf-6 knockdown downregulates calreticulin, so unless the authors show that this downregulation is mediated directly by fmo-4, the more likely explanation is that atf-6 knockdown affects calcium levels which in turn induces fmo-4 expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful feedback. We have addressed this by updating our proposed model. We used a solid arrow leading from the reduction of <italic>atf-6</italic> to induction of <italic>fmo-4,</italic> as this is supported by our data in Figure 7A-B. We then used dashed arrows between <italic>fmo-4</italic> and <italic>crt-1</italic> as well as between <italic>atf-6</italic> and <italic>crt-1</italic> to indicate that more data is needed to clarify this part of the pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 8: Avoid pointing at a mitochondrial connection in the title as the only evidence supporting this interaction comes from the mcu-1 RNAi epistasis.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion. We added another piece of evidence suggesting an interaction between <italic>fmo-4</italic> and the mitochondria to Supplementary Figure 7G-H. Here we show that while <italic>fmo-4</italic> OE worms are resistant to paraquat stress, knocking down <italic>vdac-1</italic> (a calcium regulator located in the outer mitochondrial membrane), abrogates this effect. We have kept mitochondria in our title but have made sure to temper our language in the main text to avoid pointing to a strong mitochondrial connection, since we have two pieces of evidence connecting <italic>fmo-4</italic> to the mitochondria.</p></body></sub-article></article>
