In addition to transporting vesicular cargos, dynein helps to organize MTs within MT networks such as mitotic spindles. How dynein performs such non-canonical functions is unknown. Here we demonstrate that dynein crosslinks and slides anti-parallel MTs in vitro. Surprisingly, a minimal dimeric motor lacking a tail domain and associated subunits can cause MT sliding. Single molecule imaging reveals that motors pause and frequently reverse direction when encountering an anti-parallel MT overlap, suggesting that the two motor domains can bind both MTs simultaneously. In the mitotic spindle, inward microtubule sliding by dynein counteracts outward sliding generated by kinesin-5, and we show that a tailless, dimeric motor is sufficient to drive this activity in mammalian cells. Our results identify an unexpected mechanism for dynein-driven microtubule sliding, which differs from filament sliding mechanisms described for other motor proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00943.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00943.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00943.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When cells divide, they must also divide their contents. In particular, both ‘mother’ and ‘daughter’ cells require full sets of chromosomes, which must first be duplicated, and then evenly distributed between the cells. Protein filaments called microtubules form a network that helps to accurately segregate the chromosomes. Microtubules emanate from structures at each end of the dividing cell known as spindle poles; after the chromosomes have duplicated, the microtubules latch onto them and align the pairs in the middle of the cell. As the two cells separate, microtubules at opposite spindle poles reel in one chromosome from each pair.</p><p>Microtubules are composed of alternating copies of two different types of a protein called tubulin, and have ends with distinct properties. The ‘minus’ ends are directed outwards, away from the chromosomes; the ‘plus’ ends—which can actively add tubulin—grow toward the middle of the cell, and can also bind to chromosomes. Microtubules can be manipulated by motor proteins that ‘walk’ along them carrying cargoes, which can include other microtubules. The combined actions of many motor proteins rearrange the microtubule network into a configuration that enables the chromosomes, and other cellular structures, to partition equally between the mother and daughter cells.</p><p>Motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin transport cargoes along microtubules; each motor is composed of two identical copies of the protein bound to each other. Kinesin walks toward the plus end of a microtubule, propelling itself using ‘feet’ that are called motor domains; it binds cargoes (including other microtubules) through additional regions located at the opposite end of the protein. In contrast, dynein walks toward the minus end of a microtubule. Although dynein is known to carry certain cargoes through regions outside its motor domain, how it transports other microtubules is not well understood.</p><p>Tanenbaum et al. now show that regions outside the motor domain of dynein are unnecessary to transport microtubule cargoes. When two dynein motor domains are isolated and linked to each other in vitro, each can bind to a separate microtubule. By walking toward the minus ends of their respective microtubules, the motor domains drive the microtubules in opposite directions, sliding them apart. These studies thus provide insight into the mechanism through which dynein works with additional motor proteins (such as kinesin) to rearrange microtubules during cell division—and also to ensure that chromosomes segregate evenly between mother and daughter cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00943.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00943.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>spindle</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>Eg5</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM096484</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKenney</surname><given-names>Richard J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vale</surname><given-names>Ronald D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMBO ALTF 720-2011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanenbaum</surname><given-names>Marvin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>KWF – Dutch Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanenbaum</surname><given-names>Marvin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM097312</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vale</surname><given-names>Ronald D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37GM038499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vale</surname><given-names>Ronald D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The motor domains of dynein are sufficient to crosslink microtubules and slide them antiparallel to each other.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytoplasmic dynein is a 1.2 MDa, multisubunit microtubule motor complex that belongs to the AAA family of molecular machines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ogura and Wilkinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allan, 2011</xref>). The dynein complex is composed of a dimer of two heavy chains. Each heavy chain contains a C-terminal motor domain, and an N-terminal tail domain that binds to accessory chains and adaptor proteins, which are needed to link the motor to its cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kardon and Vale, 2009</xref>). Dynein transports a plethora of cargoes towards MT minus-ends, including many types of organelles, mRNAs and proteins.</p><p>In addition to its well-studied role in cargo transport, cytoplasmic dynein has been implicated in the organization of the MT cytoskeleton itself, particularly during cell division. When mammalian cells enter mitosis, dynein is needed to remodel the prophase MT network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rusan et al., 2002</xref>), and at later stages dynein assists in organizing MTs to form focused spindle poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heald et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merdes et al., 1996</xref>). Dynein also generates an inward force within the spindle that counteracts an outward force generated by kinesin-5 and kinesin-12 motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mitchison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tanenbaum et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferenz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vanneste et al., 2009</xref>). The balance of these forces is important for normal spindle assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tanenbaum and Medema, 2010</xref>). In cell extracts, dynein also has been shown to organize MTs into aster-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Verde et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaglio et al., 1996</xref>), drive the fusion of two closely positioned spindles into a single bipolar spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gatlin et al., 2009</xref>), and transport stabilized MT seeds to the spindle pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heald et al., 1996</xref>). Collectively, these results show that dynein plays an important role in organizing the MT network during cell division.</p><p>In contrast to cargo transport, which involves a well-studied walking mechanism of the two dynein motor domains along a MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gennerich and Vale, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeWitt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>), the mechanism by which dynein organizes MTs in a MT network has not been established. One possibility is that dynein is anchored at fixed subcellular sites through its tail domain and moves processively along MTs through the cytoplasm. However, since the ‘cargo’ is sufficiently large in this instance, the MT themselves would move, rather than the cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wühr et al., 2009</xref>). Such a mechanism may also function during spindle positioning, where cortically-anchored dynein pulls on spindle MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galli and van den Heuvel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kotak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laan et al., 2012</xref>), as well as during centrosome separation, where dynein is anchored to the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Splinter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolhy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raaijmakers et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, dynein could physically crosslink two MTs and slide them relative to each other. To generate sliding between two MTs, an individual dynein motor, a dimer of two heavy chains, could use its two motor domains to walk along one MT and employ a second MT binding domain to transport a ‘cargo MT’. Axonemal dyneins function in this manner to produce MT sliding in cilia and flagella. Several classes of kinesin utilize a similar mechanism for crosslinking and sliding MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Straube et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fink et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seeger and Rice, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Su et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weaver et al., 2011</xref>). However, there is currently no evidence suggesting that cytoplasmic dynein contains a secondary MT binding site outside of the motor domain. A second model is that dynein could crossbridge and slide MTs by forming small oligomers or co-complexes with other proteins. Kinesin-5, which forms a bipolar tetramer of motor domains, crossbridges and slides MTs by such a mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kashina et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>). A third model is that dynein’s two motor domains bind to and move along two separate MTs.</p><p>Here using an in vitro assay, we demonstrate that both native rat, and recombinant yeast cytoplasmic dynein can drive sliding of anti-parallel MTs in the absence of additional proteins. Single molecule data of dynein in a MT overlap zone is most consistent with a model in which the two dynein motor domains walk along different MTs to generate sliding. We also show in vivo that a minimal dynein dimer, lacking expected cargo binding interactions, can substitute for native dynein in generating an inward force within the spindle that antagonizes outward MT sliding forces generated by kinesin-5 and kinesin-12. Together, these results show that dynein can slide and organize MTs, using a sliding mechanism that differs from that described for other motor proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynein crosslinks and slides MTs within bundles</title><p>Previous work has reported that purified brain cytoplasmic dynein crosslinks and bundles MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amos, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Toba and Toyoshima, 2004</xref>), but the mechanism has remained unclear. We similarly found that purified rat brain dynein induces the formation of large bundles of purified MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). Since cytoplasmic dynein can crossbridge MTs, we next investigated whether it can slide two MTs relative to each other. To test for MT sliding, we incubated brain dynein in solution with both green- and red-labeled fluorescent MTs; the green MTs in the MT bundles were also biotinylated, allowing their immobilization onto a streptavidin-coated coverslip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>).

Alternatively, the two motor domains of the dynein dimer could each bind a different MT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested a well characterized, GST-dimerized, truncated yeast dynein construct, GST-Dyn1<sub>331kDa</sub>, which contains the motor domain but lacks the non-motor tail domain and other dynein subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). This minimal, dimeric dynein was affinity purified, followed by gel filtration to remove any potential oligomers or aggregates. GST-Dyn1<sub>331kDa</sub> crosslinked MTs, while a monomeric version lacking the GST dimerizing domain did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>).

These results provide the first direct in vitro demonstration that cytoplasmic dynein can slide MTs within bundles.

To achieve this, we first bound GST-Dyn1<sub>331kDa</sub> in the absence of ATP to an immobilized ‘track’ MT on the coverslip surface, and then introduced ‘transport’ MTs, which became crosslinked to the ‘track’ MT by dynein. After addition of ATP, GST-Dyn1<sub>331kDa</sub> drove robust sliding of transport MTs along the immobilized track MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). The transport MTs frequently moved until they reached the end of the track MT, where they swiveled around an end point on the track MT (asterisk <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The speed of MT-MT sliding (53 ± 24 nm/s; mean ± SD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) was similar to the velocity observed in MT gliding assays (47 ± 11 nm/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) with this dynein construct. We found that purified rat brain dynein also produced MT-MT sliding using this same assay, although the movement was slower than surface gliding (10 ± 5 nm/s vs 615 ± 200 nm/s) and characterized by more frequent pausing than MT gliding by surface-bound brain dynein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). The slower motility may be a result of the much weaker processivity and directionality observed for individual mammalian dyneins in vitro compared to yeast dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ross et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ori-McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trokter et al., 2012</xref>). Other proteins (such as LIS1 and Ndel1) that directly modify these properties of mammalian dynein may be needed for more robust processivity and sliding, consistent with the requirement of these proteins for dynein-dependent MT organization in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raaijmakers et al., 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, the finding that rat dynein alone is capable of crosslinking and sliding MTs in our assays, shows that this type of motility is an intrinsic ability of the motor.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00943.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dynein crosslinks and slides single MT overlaps.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of single MT-MT sliding driven by GST-Dyn1<sub>331kDa</sub>.

These experiments revealed that the large majority of MT sliding events involved MTs in an anti-parallel configuration (18 of 21 events, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To confirm this, we also analyzed MT polarity using the direction of movement of single GFP-tagged dynein motors on the track and transport MT, in cases where the transport MT moved past the end of the track MT. In 21 of 22 cases, the transport and track MTs were anti-parallel to one another. This result is consistent with a model in which dynein binds to an anti-parallel MT overlap with one motor domain on each MT in the overlap. In this configuration, both motor domains walk towards the minus-end of their respective MT, thereby driving sliding of the crosslinked pair of MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A natively dimerized, minimal dynein crosslinks, and slides MTs</title><p>The above results demonstrate that GST-dimerized yeast dynein, and the native rat dynein complex, both can crosslink and slide MTs. However, in the case of the minimal, GST-dimerized dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho and Vale, 2012</xref>), it is possible that the artificial, anti-parallel dimerization may allow the two motor domains to crosslink MTs in a manner that would not occur in native dynein dimer. Additionally, the native dynein dimer may utilize a different mechanism, in which it crossbridges MTs through an additional MT binding site, either in the tail of the heavy chain or in one of the dynein accessory subunits. To rigorously examine these possibilities, we tested a truncated dynein molecule that includes its native dimerization domain, but lacks any of its associated subunits. GST-Dyn1<sub>331kDa</sub>, is monomeric in the absence of GST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>), so we reasoned that a larger portion of the tail domain was necessary for dynein heavy chain dimerization. Prior unpublished observations from our lab indicated that a dynein with a slightly longer N-terminus (Dyn1<sub>387kD</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) was processive when fused to GFP (S Reck-Peterson and A Carter, unpublished observations), and processivity is an attribute of a dynein dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>). We overexpressed Dyn1<sub>387kD</sub> from a Gal promoter, and the purified protein revealed no co-purifying accessory subunits by silver staining after SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In sucrose gradients, purified Dyn1<sub>387kD</sub> sedimented at approximately 19S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which is similar in size to the full dynein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paschal et al., 1987</xref>), as well as a truncated dimeric dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trokter et al., 2012</xref>).

The reason for the lower brightness of GFP in Dyn1<sub>387kD</sub> is not clear, although it might be due to fluorescence quenching of nearby fluorphores.

To test this possibility, we deleted the canonical MTBD and expressed the protein (Dyn1<sub>387kD ΔMTBD</sub>). Dyn1<sub>387kD ΔMTBD</sub> showed no specific association with MTs in a cosedimentation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>) and was unable to crosslink MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Thus, Dyn1<sub>387kD ΔMTBD</sub> does not possess a MT binding region outside of the motor domain. Together, these results show that a natively dimerized dynein can crosslink and slide MTs in vitro, and that associated chains or an additional MT binding site is not required for this activity. These results strongly support a model in which dynein slides MTs in vitro using only its two motor domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Dimeric dynein molecules can bind two MTs simultaneously</title><p>The previous experiments suggest that a dimer of two motor domains can bind two different MTs simultaneously and generate anti-parallel sliding. This model would predict that individual dimeric dynein motors would be approximately stationary in a MT overlap zone, as each motor domain generates opposing pulling forces on the two MTs. To test this model, we imaged individual, fluorescently-labeled dynein molecules within an anti-parallel MT overlap. To generate stable anti-parallel overlaps, we crosslinked MTs with GFP-Ase1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janson et al., 2007</xref>), a protein that crosslinks MTs into anti-parallel bundles with an inter-MT spacing of around 15–40 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaillard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roque et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Subramanian et al., 2010</xref>).

However, GST-Dyn1<sub>331kDa</sub> appeared largely immobile in MT overlaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, when individual molecules moving processively along a single MT reached the MT overlap zone, they would appear to stop moving (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

While yeast dynein occasionally takes backwards steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>), such long distance directional switching and frequent prolonged pausing were never observed when dynein moved along single MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00943.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Dynein can bind two MTs simultaneously.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>E</bold>) Biotinylated Cy5-MTs were incubated with 2 nM GFP-Ase1 or with buffer for 5 min.

Despite the high concentration of GFP-Ase1, single dynein molecules moved unidirectionally and processively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, we conclude that bidirectional switching and pausing are due to the presence of a MT overlap, not to the presence of GFP-Ase1 on MTs.

In the first assay, we evaluated dynein’s ability to drive monopolar spindle formation when kinesin-5 is inhibited before the onset of mitosis. Kinesin-5 inhibition results in the formation of monopolar spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blangy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mayer et al., 1999</xref>), but this effect is prevented and bipolar spindle formation is restored when dynein is depleted by RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tanenbaum et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferenz et al., 2009</xref>). This result has been interpreted as kinesin-5 and dynein producing counteracting sliding forces during spindle formation; when kinesin-5 is inhibited, dynein-induced sliding forces produce an unbalanced inward force that results in the formation of monopolar spindes. We tested whether GST-hDyn could produce this inward sliding force when expressed in cells depleted of dynein heavy chain by RNAi. We monitored dynein RNAi by blotting for the intermediate chain (IC), which is co-depleted with the heavy chain upon knockdown and found that dynein was robustly depleted from cells upon RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Strikingly, GST-hDyn expression substantially increased the number of monopolar spindles in dynein-depleted, kinesin-5 inhibited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

During metaphase, two kinesins (kinesin-5 and kinesin-12) provide an outward force on the spindle, which is counterbalanced by an inward force produced by dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanenbaum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vanneste et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, unlike in early stages of mitosis, when a kinesin-5 inhibitor is applied at metaphase, it only results in a collapse of the spindle to a monopolar structure in a low percentage of the cells (38 ± 5%) since kinesin-12 can still effectively oppose dynein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). However, in metaphase-arrested cells expressing GST-hDyn, kinesin-5 inhibition resulted in a much greater percentage (88 ± 2%) of cells with monopolar spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). While treatment of cells with MG132 might alter the abundance of other MT binding proteins as well in this assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song and Rape, 2010</xref>), this result suggests that the expression of GST-hDyn increased the total inward force, tipping the balance of forces and resulting in spindle collapse. Furthermore, overexpression of GST-hDyn, did not result in spindle collapse in the presence of both kinesin-5 and kinesin-12 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Our two assays together suggest that GST-hDyn is sufficient to generate an inward force, which is most likely the product of anti-parallel MT sliding. To determine if dimerization of the motor domains is required for the inward force generation by dynein in vivo, we fused dynein to FKBP (FKBP-hDyn), which homodimerizes upon addition of the small molecule dimerizer AP20187 (inducing processivity of yeast dynein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>]), and then performed RNAi rescue experiments. Control cells treated with STLC to inhibit kinesin-5 mostly formed monopolar spindles (87.7 ± 4.5%). As described earlier, depletion of endogenous dynein by RNAi in the presence of STLC decreased the number of monopolar spindles to 46.5 ± 1.5%, consistent with a role for dynein in antagonizing kinesin-5 in bipolar spindle assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). As a control, the dimerizer AP20187 did not significantly affect spindle bipolarity (50.7 ± 1.8% monopolar spindles, p=0.16) in STLC-treated, dynein-depleted cells in the absence of FKBP-hDyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Next, cells expressing FKBP-hDyn were depleted of endogenous dynein by RNAi and treated with STLC. Expression of FKBP-hDyn in the absence of AP20187 did not alter the fraction of monopolar spindles (47.8 ± 2.7%; mean ± SD), indicating that the monomeric version of dynein was unable to reconstitute the function of native dynein. However, addition of AP20187 to cells expressing FKBP-hDyn substantially increased in the fraction of cells with monopolar spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, 75.5 ± 2.5%). This result demonstrates that dimerization of two dynein motor domains robustly activates the ability of dynein to generate an inward force in the spindle. Together, our results suggest that a minimal, dimeric motor can slide anti-parallel MTs to generate an inward force during spindle assembly.</p><p>In addition to its role in generating an inward force in the spindle, dynein also is important for focusing MT minus ends at the spindle pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Walczak and Heald, 2008</xref>). To test whether the GST-hDyn was able to support spindle pole focusing, we compared spindle pole focusing in control cells, cells depleted of dynein, and cells depleted of dynein that express GST-hDyn. Depletion of dynein increased the percentage of spindles with unfocused poles and detached centrosomes; however, this pole focusing defect was not rescued by GST-hDyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results show that a minimal dynein is able to generate an inward force in the spindle, which likely involves anti-parallel MT sliding, but is unable to fulfill other mitotic functions of dynein.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>The mechanism of dynein-mediated MT sliding</title><p>In this study, we show that cytoplasmic dynein can slide anti-parallel MTs in vitro and provide evidence that this mechanism can occur in vivo. Several kinesin motors have the ability to crosslink and slide MTs in vitro. However, these motors either form a tetrameric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kashina et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kapitein et al., 2008</xref>), or contain a second MT binding domain within their tail domain, which facilitates MT crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, our results show that MT crosslinking and sliding by dynein dimers does not require its tail domain, accessory subunits, regulatory proteins, or further oligomerization. Rather, our results indicate that the two motor domains of a dynein dimer can bind to separate MTs and each motor domain can walk independently on the MT to which it is bound. To accomplish this, the two motor domains likely splay apart, allowing the dimer to bind to the two MTs simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00943.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Mechanisms of MT-MT sliding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Kinesin-5 forms tetrameric molecules, allowing them to crosslink and slide MTs using motor domains at opposite ends of the tetramer.

Inside the overlap, dynein often pauses and switches directions, suggesting the motor spends a fraction of time stepping with both motor domains on a single MT in the overlap, and some fraction with each motor domain bound simultaneously to opposite MTs. This behavior was observed for both GST-dimerized dynein, as well as two natively dimerized dyneins (Dyn1 and Dyn1<sub>387kD</sub>), indicating that it was not an effect of artificial dimerization. These results suggest that the two motor domains have considerable flexibility, allowing them to explore space on a rapid time scale, making frequent transitions between one and two MT bound states.</p><p>The ability of native or artificially dimerized dynein to walk on the same or different MTs suggests that the dynein motor domains work in a more autonomous fashion than kinesin-1. Consistent with this notion, recent data suggests that dynein’s two motor domains step in a relatively stochastic and independent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeWitt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, a dynein dimer made of one active and one inactive motor domain, still moves processively on a single MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeWitt et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that a single active head can step forward, provided that it remains tethered to the MT track. The relatively uncoupled motion of dynein’s two motor domains likely allows for them to step independently on oppositely oriented MTs in an overlap and promote MT-MT sliding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>MT sliding in vivo</title><p>Dynein has a key role in minus-end-directed cargo transport along MTs in mammalian cells. In addition, a large body of evidence suggests that dynein controls MT organization during mitosis by sliding MTs within the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Verde et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rusan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tanenbaum et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferenz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gatlin et al., 2009</xref>). In these earlier studies, this MT sliding in vivo was speculated to occur between anti-parallel MTs, generating an inward force that opposes the outward forces of kinesin-5 and kinesin-12 acting upon these overlapping MTs. This model agrees well with our in vitro data showing that dynein virtually always slides MTs in an anti-parallel configuration. Our in vivo experiments also demonstrate that a minimal dimer is able to generate an inward force in the spindle that can reconstitute the function of the endogenous motor. This activity was observed using two different dimerization methods, indicating that the MT-MT sliding ability is independent of the method of dimerization. As we cannot directly observe MT-MT sliding in the spindle, we cannot exclude that the minimal dynein collapses the spindle through an alternative mechanism, for example through interaction with additional proteins. However, our in vivo analysis is consistent with the notion that dynein slides MTs in the spindle using only its motor domains, which is further supported by the in vitro experiments. These results suggest that sliding of MTs in the spindle reflects an inherent activity of the dynein motor domains alone, consistent with a model in which the two motor domains of dynein walk on two distinct MTs in the spindle, driving their relative movement. However, the situation with native dynein may be more complicated, since other dynein subunits, as well as additional dynein-associated proteins, such as Lis1 and Nde1 contribute to inward force generation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tanenbaum et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raaijmakers et al., 2013</xref>). These factors could change the fundamental sliding mechanism of native dynein in vivo, so that the two motor domains do not crossbridge two overlapping microtubules, as described in our model. However, we feel that this is unlikely and rather these factors preserve the fundamental mechanism described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), but may be necessary for promoting dynein stability, efficient targeting to the spindle, and/or modify dynein’s force production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trokter et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the sliding mechanism described in this study, dynein may act through multiple parallel mechanisms to control proper MT organization in the spindle. For example, Wühr and Mitchison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wühr et al., 2010</xref>) provide evidence that dynein anchored at cytoplasmic sites may also contribute to MT sliding in the spindle in large embryonic cells. Additionally, we show that spindle pole focusing cannot be restored by expression of the minimal dynein dimer. While generation of an inward force likely involves sliding of anti-parallel MTs in the middle of the spindle, pole focusing occurs in a region where most microtubules are expected to have a parallel orientation, perhaps explaining why the minimal dynein is unable to support pole-focusing activity. It is currently unclear how dynein controls pole focusing; however interactions of dynein with NuMA may be important for this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merdes et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2000</xref>), Kinesin-14 motors play an important role in pole focusing through MT crossbridging and MT sliding as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mountain et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fink et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>MT sliding has also been observed in other cellular systems. While kinesin-1 is best characterized for such activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Navone et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Straube et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>), dynein may contribute as well. Anterograde transport of MTs was observed in nerve axons and shown to be dependent upon dynein activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2005</xref>), although the mechanism by which dynein moved MTs in the axon was unclear. Similarly, loss of dynein in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons results in a loss of uniform MT polarity within axons, suggesting that dynein actively sorts MTs based on their polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>). The mechanism of MT-MT sliding described here provides a model for how dynein may achieve such MT sorting in neuronal cells. Thus, dynein driven MT-MT sliding could be a more generally used mechanism to organize and sort MTs in the cell.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein preparation</title><p>Rat brain cytoplasmic dynein was purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paschal et al., 1991</xref>).

Over all they find the idea that a minimal, GST-dimerized human dynein motor lacking the tail domain and the ability to bind to its adaptor proteins is capable of producing an inward force in the spindle that can substitute for endogenous dynein.

This is never shown; rather you show the sensitivity to kinesin-5 inhibition. No data are shown in the absence of the drug, and it is not discussed whether the rescued spindles are positioned correctly and functional to segregate chromosomes, with poles focused, chromosomes aligned, etc. While we would not insist that these data are included, you should more fully discuss the other major functions of dynein in the spindle, and whether they might be accomplished by an anti-parallel sliding mechanism.

This may be true for pure motor domains in vitro, but movements of MT seeds on the spindle in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, and spindle pole focusing, have been shown to require dynein. Similarly, “These results provide the first direct demonstration that cytoplasmic dynein can slide MTs within bundles” seems to be a bit of an overstatement.</p><p>- One issue that speaks to whether dynein could carry microtubules as cargo is the presence of non-motor microtubule binding domains. While perhaps not present on the dynein motor itself, doesn't the fact that rat dynein possesses a much slower velocity on bundled MTs compared to single microtubules indicate there is another MT binding domain on the heavy chain? Furthermore, spindle dynein is known to function together with dynactin, which does have a MT binding domain. The authors show convincingly that just a motor dimer can mediate one aspect of spindle morphogenesis, the inward sliding, but without examining the other functions they should soften their statements about the sufficiency of this mechanism.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after additional work had been performed.]</p><p>Thank you for giving us another opportunity to evaluate your work entitled “Cytoplasmic dynein crosslinks and slides anti-parallel microtubules using its two motor domains” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, if you feel that you can perform the experiment with the minimal dimeric motor, then we would encourage you to submit your interesting paper again to eLife</italic>.</p><p>We have now addressed this critical point in full in two new figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). As suggested by the reviewers, we expressed and purified a natively dimerized recombinant minimal dynein (Dyn<sub>387kD</sub>). We show that Dyn<sub>387kD</sub> sediments at ∼19S on a sucrose gradient, similar to other dimeric dyneins, and does not contain additional subunits. By deleting its canonical MT binding domain, we also find no evidence for a second “cryptic” MT binding site that might crosslink microtubules. Functionally, single Dyn<sub>387kD</sub> molecules move processively along MTs. Next, we show that Dyn<sub>387kD</sub> can bundle MTs, slide MTs within the bundles, and slide MTs within single MT-MT overlaps, very similar to GST-Dyn<sub>331kD</sub>. While Dyn<sub>387kD</sub> walks processively and unidirectionally on single MTs, it frequent pauses and reverses direction in anti-parallel MT overlaps. Taken together, these results show that a minimal, natively dimerized motor can slide MTs using only its two motor domains. We should also note that transition from unidirectional motion along a single microtubule, to pauses and bidirectional runs within an overlap is most likely a single molecule signature of the two motors domains binding to two different microtubules in an overlap region. This behavior is noted for native yeast dynein, again underscoring that this behavior is not an artifact of truncating the heavy chain.</p><p><italic>A second problem identified by the reviewers concerned whether GST-dynein rescues spindle assembly upon DHC knock-down. This is never shown; rather you show the sensitivity to kinesin-5 inhibition. No data are shown in the absence of the drug, and it is not discussed whether the rescued spindles are positioned correctly and functional to segregate chromosomes, with poles focused, chromosomes aligned, etc. While we would not insist that these data are included, you should more fully discuss the other major functions of dynein in the spindle, and whether they might be accomplished by an anti-parallel sliding mechanism. For example, can this mechanism generate a spindle pole. Again a schematic would help, and ideally some data showing whether or not GST-dynein can generate asters or mediate pole focusing</italic>.</p><p>We thank the referees for this clarification, as we did not describe our results and views adequately. We never meant to imply that a minimal dynein dimer can fully compensate for all dynein functions in spindle assembly. Our results show that GST-dynein (or chemically dimerized FKBP-FRB-dynein) can counteract the outward microtubule sliding forces generated by kinesin-5 and kinesin-12, which strongly suggests that this construct produces anti-parallel microtubule sliding in vivo. However, we agree that other dynein functions in mitosis are unlikely to be replicated by this minimal dynein dimer, including pole focusing which occurs mainly between parallel microtubules. We have now tested this directly and show that GST-dynein does not rescue spindle pole focusing after dynein heavy chain RNAi. The spindle pole focusing mechanism likely involves the dynein tail domain, as well as associated molecules such as NuMa. We have clarified these points in the Discussion. We also have expanded the Discussion with recent data showing that the inward sliding forces produced by native dynein in the spindle require associated chains. While we feel that native dynein and the minimal GST-dynein slide anti-parallel MTs by the same mechanism, these results illustrate that native dynein has additional requirements for in vivo function, which may include stability of the entire heavy chain by associated proteins, as well as regulation of its force-generating activities. Thus, between our new in vivo data and new Discussion section, we feel that we have better represented the broader activities of dynein in the spindle. We experimented with a schematic but felt that it did not enhance the paper. We have added a schematic of our model for dynein-driven sliding and how it differs from mechanisms proposed for other motor proteins.</p><p><italic>Minor comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>- Binding of dynein to MTs without ATP in solution might impair further functionality of the motors. The authors could address this by performing a single molecule no-ATP to ATP switching experiment on single MTs and quantify the percentage of processively moving dynein molecules</italic>.</p><p>While this is an interesting suggestion, we are unfortunately unable to do such experiments because we do not have a setup to add ATP to our flow chamber while performing simultaneous imaging. We note that the majority of dynein molecules appear to be motile in our assays.</p><p><italic>- The native dynein slides MTs very slowly and with pauses. Are the pauses accounted for in the average velocity in the histogram in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A, B</italic></xref><italic>? What is the explanation of the slow sliding speed compared to the fast speed of the surface gliding</italic>?</p><p>MTs that were stationary for prolonged periods of time were not included in the average speed. However, since our time between images in these experiments was 3-5 sec, pauses of less than 3 sec are likely included in the average speed. Nonetheless, these pauses cannot explain the slow speed of MT-MT sliding. We currently do not fully understand why rat brain dynein slides MTs faster in surface gliding experiments than in MT-MT sliding. One possible explanation is that mammalian dyneins have a low MT affinity, much lower processivity, and show birectional movements in vitro (Trokter et al., 2012; Ori-McKenney et al. 2010, and our own unpublished results), while yeast dynein is more processive and unidirectional. This point is now discussed in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>- The fact that the GST-hDyn slides MTs in vivo doesn't clarify the mechanism of the native dynein sliding</italic>.</p><p>Our findings that native rat bovine brain dynein and four different recombinant dimerized dyneins (two yeast and two human) all can slide MTs make it reasonable to propose a model in which native dynein slides MTs by a similar mechanism. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that native dynein uses a sliding mechanism that differs from what we have observed in our in vitro assay. We have noted this possibility in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>- Using polarity-marked MTs an anti-parallel MT orientation was inferred for 18 out of 21 events. Were the other 3 events parallel sliding? How good was the polarity marking? Please quantify</italic>.</p><p>Polarity marked MT can be problematic, since occasionally they fragment or anneal to yield a spurious result. In this revision, we have included an additional method of assessing polarity- direct single molecule observation of the direction of movement of individual GFP-dynein molecules on the track and transport MTs. Using this approach we found 21/22 sliding events to be anti-parallel. The one parallel event showed very slow sliding. This analysis is now included in the manuscript. Collectively, these two methods reveal predominant anti-parallel MT sliding with an occasional MT sliding event.</p><p><italic>- What influence did the ionic strength of the assay buffer have on the results</italic>?</p><p>We tested MT-MT sliding at a higher ionic strength (100 mM KAc) and observed very similar sliding activity. At 200mM KAc, we observed no crosslinking or sliding of MTs. We included this information in the Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>- The role of kinesin-14 as minus-end directed, MT-MT sliding motor in spindle assembly and integrity should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>We added a sentence indicating kinesin-14’s important role in pole focusing to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>- In the Introduction, it is stated that there is no evidence that dynein could directly cross link and slide MTs relative to one another. This may be true for pure motor domains in vitro, but movements of MT seeds on the spindle in Xenopus egg extracts, and spindle pole focusing, have been shown to require dynein. Similarly, “These results provide the first direct demonstration that cytoplasmic dynein can slide MTs within bundles” seems to be a bit of an overstatement</italic>.</p><p>It is true that previous studies found that dynein is required for MT movement and organization in the spindle (which we stated in the text, including references). However, it has never been shown that dynein alone is sufficient for sliding of MTs in the spindle, as it could be indirect and require additional factors. Nonetheless, we have changed the text to specify that our results are the first fully reconstituted in vitro demonstration of dynein-dependent sliding and have added a reference to the study that shows transport of stabilized seeds to the spindle pole by dynein (Heald et al., 1996).</p><p><italic>- One issue that speaks to whether dynein could carry microtubules as cargo is the presence of non-motor microtubule binding domains. While perhaps not present on the dynein motor itself, doesn't the fact that rat dynein possesses a much slower velocity on bundled MTs compared to single microtubules indicate there is another MT binding domain on the heavy chain</italic>?</p><p>We have now included new data, as described above, showing that a minimal, natively dimerized yeast dynein molecule can drive MT-MT sliding in the absence of associating factors and without an additional MT binding site. We do not fully understand why rat dynein possesses a slower MT-MT sliding speed. It is possible that this is due to an additional MT-binding site somewhere in the complex (which may be regulated in vivo), but it is also possible that this is due to the short dwell time and low processivity of mammalian dynein in vitro (Trokter et al., 2012 PNAS, Miura et al. 2010 FEBS Letters, our unpublished results) and we have added these possible reasons to the Results section.</p><p><italic>- Furthermore, spindle dynein is known to function together with dynactin, which does have a MT binding domain</italic>.</p><p>As noted above, we cannot completely exclude that the native dynein complex has an extra MT binding site, but MT-MT sliding in the spindle appears to be independent of dynactin (Raaijmakers et al., 2013, JCB).</p><p><italic>- The authors show convincingly that just a motor dimer can mediate one aspect of spindle morphogenesis, the inward sliding, but without examining the other functions they should soften their statements about the sufficiency of this mechanism</italic>.</p><p>As discussed above, we have now included additional data examining the ability of the minimal dimer to rescue spindle pole focusing. We have adjusted our statements in the abstract and main text regarding the role of dynein-dependent MT sliding in spindle morphogenesis accordingly.</p><p><italic>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.</italic>]</p><p><italic>On the side of the cell work</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The authors switch to using GST-GFP-hDyn for the cell experiments but do not describe this construct very well beyond which nucleotides were sub cloned in the Methods section. How similar/identical is it to the yeast protein? Why can it be assumed to behave the same? Does it associate with any other proteins within cells? How does it run on a sucrose gradient/gel filtration? Does the yeast protein behave similarly when introduced? Does the dimerized yeast construct rescue a yeast dynein mutant</italic>?</p><p>We now provide more detailed information on this construct in the Materials and methods. The GST-GFP-hDyn construct is based on previously published boundaries for the minimal motor domains in yeast, <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, and rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reck-Peterson et al. 2006</xref>, Koonce and Samso, 1996, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hook et al. 2005</xref>). The human and yeast constructs used in this study are truncated at similar points relative to the motor domain (human residue number 1284 and yeast residue number 1219) and fused to GST. This truncation lies 189 and 145 residues N-terminal to the beginning of linker subdomain 1 in human and yeast respectively. This construct lacks the tail domain of dynein, and thus is not expected to associate with any other dynein subunits. To demonstrate this, we have now included a pull-down experiment demonstrating that the GST-GFP-hDyn construct indeed does not associate with other dynein subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In other ongoing work in our lab, we have expressed a similar human GST-dynein construct using the baculovirus system and show by hydrodynamic studies (sucrose gradient/gel filtration) and negative stain EM that it is indeed a dimer, as expected based upon its fusion to a GST dimer. We believe the other suggestions, while interesting, are beyond of the scope of our study. Also, the truncated GST-dynein dimer will not have the associated subunits needed to rescue dynein function in spindle positioning in yeast (Markus et al. 2009).</p><p><italic>2) To what degree is endogenous dynein depleted? Blots should be shown also to show how much overexpression there is of the introduced proteins</italic>.</p><p>We have now included a western blot showing that dynein is strongly down regulated by ∼87% upon RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This result agrees with prior work on dynein reduction by RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tanenbaum et al., 2008</xref>). Unfortunately, we are unable to determine the precise level of overexpression because the minimal dimer lacks the N-terminal domain, which is targeted by all commercially available antibodies to dynein heavy chain. Furthermore, because the transfection efficiency in our overexpression experiments is only 5–10%, and varies between cells, blotting cell lysates from the total population would not be very informative on the amount of overexpression per cell. We state in the Materials and methods section that we focused on cells with moderate expression levels and exclude the cells with very high expression.</p><p><italic>3) The two assays in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>are basically showing the same thing twice. The authors should note that MG132 treatment does more than just arrest at metaphase as it influences turnover of MAPs (Song and Rape, Mol. Cell 2011)</italic>.</p><p>We have now included the reference to the turnover of MAPs in response to MG132 treatment. We included two different assays, exactly for this reason. As each assays has its specific pitfalls, we performed two assays to be sure that the ability of dynein to collapse the spindle was not due to a specific type of assay.</p><p><italic>4) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C</italic></xref><italic>, the fraction of monopolar spindles in response to STLC in an RNAi control should be shown</italic>.</p><p>This information is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1"><italic>Figure 5—figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>, the spindles appear more multipolar than with “split poles” and the chromosomes are misaligned. How is it determined whether the cells are in metaphase or prometaphase and does dynein RNAi cause chromosome misalignment</italic>?</p><p>The multipolar spindles are due to centrosomes that detach from the spindle, which is a well-known phenotype of dynein depletion. Similarly, dynein depletion is known to cause chromosome alignment defects (Draviam et al., 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raaijmakers et al., 2013</xref>). Cells in metaphase and prometaphase were distinguished based on chromosome alignment to the metaphase plate, as visualized by DNA staining.</p><p><italic>On the in vitro work</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) In order to exclude dynein aggregation as a potential cause for MT bundling and siding, the authors should still investigate and show the dynein-GFP signal during the MT-MT sliding experiments (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figures 1D, E</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref><italic>). Does the signal look homogeneous ruling out the possibility of clustering?

However, the dynein concentration in single molecule experiments is most likely much lower than in sliding experiments, so the lack of aggregates in single molecule experiments still doesn't rule out that there are clusters in the sliding assay</italic>.</p><p>We have included a representative <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref> to show the GFP-dynein signal during a MT sliding event. The dynein signal is homogenous and does not show any evidence of aggregation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
