(ER)-localized Hsp70 chaperone BiP contributes to protein folding homeostasis by engaging unfolded client proteins in a process that is tightly coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis. The inverse correlation between BiP AMPylation and the burden of unfolded ER proteins suggests a post-translational mechanism for adjusting BiP’s activity to changing levels of ER stress, but the underlying molecular details are unexplored. We present biochemical and crystallographic studies indicating that irrespective of the identity of the bound nucleotide AMPylation biases BiP towards a conformation normally attained by the ATP-bound chaperone. AMPylation does not affect the interaction between BiP and J-protein co-factors but appears to allosterically impair J protein-stimulated ATP-hydrolysis, resulting in the inability of modified BiP to attain high affinity for its substrates. These findings suggest a molecular mechanism by which AMPylation serves as a switch to inactivate BiP, limiting its interactions with substrates whilst conserving ATP.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hsp70</kwd><kwd>BiP</kwd><kwd>AMPylation</kwd><kwd>J-proteins</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome 200848/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome 082961/Z/07/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Read</surname><given-names>Randy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome 100140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PG/12/41/29679</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Yahui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>AMPylation of BiP allosterically interferes with stimulation of its ATPase activity by J-proteins that is required for high affinity substrate binding.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Compartment-specific chaperones contribute substantially to folding of newly synthesized polypeptides and to protein turnover and thereby facilitate maintenance of proteome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bukau et al., 2006</xref>). The abundant Hsp70-type chaperone BiP (or Grp78) is a central component of the chaperone repertoire of the endoplasmic reticulum – the gateway to the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. BiP mRNA and protein levels have long been known to respond to changes in the burden of unfolded secretory proteins; induction of BiP-encoding mRNA being a hallmark of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kozutsumi et al., 1988</xref>). However, in the secretory pathway fluctuations in the unfolded protein load occur on time scales that are too short to be accommodated solely by slow and costly antagonistic regulation of BiP levels by transcription and protein degradation. Therefore, post-translational mechanisms for rapidly adjusting the level of active BiP to the burden of unfolded proteins in the ER (ER stress) have long been suspected to exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freiden et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaut, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laitusis et al., 1999</xref>), but the details have only come into focus recently.</p><p>BiP binding to its clients is in competition with inactivating oligomerization due to self-association via substrate interactions amongst individual BiP molecules. BiP oligomers likely serve as a repository from which pre-existing active chaperone can be rapidly recruited when the concentration of unfolded clients increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preissler et al., 2015a</xref>). A second mechanism involves the covalent modification of BiP by reversible AMPylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanyal et al., 2015</xref>). When the burden of unfolded proteins in the ER declines, the ER-localized enzyme FICD (or HYPE) uses ATP to transfer adenosine monophosphate (AMP) onto the hydroxyl side chain of a single residue within BiP, threonine 518 (T518) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Preissler et al., 2015b</xref>). With mounting ER stress, an altered functional form of the same enzyme, FICD, rapidly removes the AMP, restoring the hydroxyl side chain to T518 and BiP to its ground state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Preissler et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Deregulated FICD activity strongly induces the UPR; an observation consistent with modified BiP being less able to buffer ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Preissler et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Preissler et al., 2017</xref>). The inactivating nature of the modification is further supported by observations that in vitro AMPylated BiP binds a model peptide substrate less stably than the unmodified chaperone and by evidence for an ill-defined defect in the responsiveness of AMPylated BiP to the stimulatory effect of J-domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Preissler et al., 2015b</xref>).</p><p>Like other members of its family, BiP consists of an N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and a C-terminal substrate binding domain (SBD), both of which are connected by a conserved hydrophobic linker. BiP, and Hsp70s in general, interact transiently with extended, usually hydrophobic, amino acid sequences exposed on the surface of their client proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flynn et al., 1991</xref>). These substrate interactions are modulated by nucleotide binding and hydrolysis at the NBD that are accompanied by substantial conformational changes in both domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mayer, 2013</xref>). Substrate binding is facilitated by J-domain containing co-chaperones (J-proteins) that stimulate ATP hydrolysis by Hsp70s in proximity of the substrate. The concerted action of chaperone and J-protein yields a substrate binding machine of ultra-high affinity, characterized by fast initial association of the Hsp70/BiP with the substrate (high ‘on’ rates) in the ATP-bound state and slow dissociation (low ‘off’ rates) upon J domain-driven ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Los Rios and Barducci, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Misselwitz et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Here we have combined biochemical and structural approaches to dissect how AMPylation influences the J protein-driven ATPase cycle of BiP to cause its functional inactivation. Our findings reveal an unanticipated role for the structural modification of a residue on the far reaches of BiP’s SBD - the AMPylated T518 - in affecting an allosteric transition that is essential for Hsp70s to achieve ultra-affinity for binding their substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AMPylation biases BiP towards a conformation normally attained by the ATP-bound chaperone</title><p>Nucleotide binding and hydrolysis markedly affect interactions between the NBD and SBD of Hsp70s/BiP. In both the ADP-bound and nucleotide-free (or apo) state the two domains are undocked, substrates are bound tightly (with low ‘off’ rates), and the hydrophobic interdomain linker is exposed to the solvent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertelsen et al., 2009</xref>). In the ATP-bound state the two domains are docked against each other, substrates exchange rapidly (with high ‘on’ and ‘off’ rates), and the interdomain linker is tucked against the NBD and relatively shielded from the solvent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kityk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2015</xref>).

It is thus a useful tool to probe the linker’s disposition vis-à-vis the aforementioned allosteric transitions. However, the tendency of ADP-bound (or apo) BiP to oligomerize confounds interpretation of the effects of nucleotide on SubA-mediated linker cleavage, because engagement of the interdomain linker of one BiP molecule in the SBD of another protects the linker from cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preissler et al., 2015a</xref>). The net result of these two competing processes manifests in complete resistance of a substantial fraction of ADP-bound wildtype BiP (BiP<sup>WT</sup>) to cleavage by SubA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preissler et al., 2015a</xref>’, and reaction 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

ADP-binding also stabilizes BiP oligomers, of which only the terminal BiP molecule can easily be cleaved by SubA, whereas protomers whose linkers are engaged by an SBD of an interacting molecule are strongly protected. Thus, all species are rapidly cleaved but a substantial fraction of protected BiP from oligomeric assemblies remains intact. <bold>Reaction 2:</bold> ATP binding converts BiP into the low-affinity state, which leads to oligomer disassembly and protection of the linker of monomeric BiP due to enhanced domain docking.

When the same experiment was performed with an ADP-bound substrate binding-deficient BiP<sup>V461F</sup> mutant, the linker was rapidly cleaved nearly to completion. Cleavage of BiP<sup>V461F</sup> was slower in the presence of ATP, consistent with a domain-docked conformation that partially protects the linker from cleavage (compare reactions 3 and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>).

Thus, in the case of ADP-bound BiP<sup>WT</sup>, AMPylation likely impaired substrate interaction-dependent oligomerization and thereby increased BiP’s cleavability by SubA, whereas the protective effect of AMPylation on the interdomain linker due to enhanced domain docking dominated in the context of the V461F mutation. The enhanced protection of the linker of ATP-bound AMPylated BiP<sup>WT</sup> and AMPylated BiP<sup>V461F</sup> (compared to their non-AMPylated ATP-bound versions) was a conspicuous and reproducible finding (compare reactions 6 and 8 with 2 and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>).

This surprising feature extends to the fine details, as the NBD of nucleotide-free AMPylated BiP assumed a conformation that resembled the ATP-bound NBD of intact BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>) and deviated considerably in structure from the isolated NBD, whether crystallized in the apo state or with ADP or ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Macias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wisniewska et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This feature is likely imparted on the NBD allosterically, as a consequence of AMPylation, because the T229A mutation did not abolish the nucleotide-dependent allosteric regulation of BiP nor bias the protein towards an ATP-bound conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>).</p><p>As expected of BiP/Hsp70 in the domain-docked conformation, the truncated lid of the SBD (SBDα) was in the open position and the substrate binding groove was substantially wider than that of the isolated SBD of human BiP (PDB 5E85, which reflects the state of the SBD of the domain-undocked ADP-bound chaperone, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertelsen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Differences between the SBD of AMPylated apo BiP and ATP-bound BiP were also noted in the distal loops of the SBDβ subdomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). In particular the conformation of loop L<sub>7,8</sub>, harboring the AMPylation site residue T518, differed substantially between both structures. Although no clear density for the entire AMP moiety was observed, several indications point to the presence of the modification. First, the side chain of T518 is oriented outwards and protrudes into the solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The missing density may thus be explained by flexibility of the hydrophilic AMP exposed on the protein surface. Second, additional electron density extends from the T518 side chain hydroxyl group, consistent with the phosphodiester linkage to adenosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Third, whereas the surrounding loops are engaged with the neighboring molecule at the crystal packing interface, loop L<sub>7,8</sub> does not form such contacts, providing space in the crystal to accommodate AMP and affording substantial flexibility to the region, as reflected in the high B-factors of L<sub>7,8</sub> of AMPylated BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>The aforementioned features were observed in four additional crystal forms of AMPylated BiP derived from independent protein preparations and from molecules arranged in a different space group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>) and supported by intact protein mass spectrometry, pointing to the presence of the modification in the crystallized protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>). In all structures BiP adopted a very similar domain-docked conformation in absence of density for ATP in the NBD and all reveal additional density protruding from the T518 side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). Furthermore, their L<sub>7,8</sub> loop regions appeared more disordered than surrounding parts of the SBDβ (indicated by higher B-factors, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). These findings indicate that the bulky modification favored solvent exposure of loop L<sub>7,8</sub> and prevented T518 from forming intramolecular contacts observed in structures of unmodified BiP or other Hsp70s.</p><p>Notably, a structure of AMPylated BiP from a crystallization reaction supplemented with ADP showed that BiP adopted the domain-docked, loop L<sub>7,8</sub>-exopsed conformation even when ADP was bound (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A–E</xref>). Thus, despite lack of density corresponding to the bulk of the modification, the structural data are in agreement with the results of the limited proteolysis experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and strongly support the conclusion that AMPylation favors a state of BiP that, in absence of ATP, is very similar to the conformation of ATP-bound unmodified BiP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>AMPylation impairs BiP oligomerization</title><p>The data presented above reveal that AMPylation biases BiP’s conformational equilibrium towards an ATP bound-like, domain-docked state that is predicted to weaken substrate binding. BiP molecules bind each other through typical chaperone-substrate interactions. In cells, these interactions assemble inactive BiP oligomers to buffer short-term fluctuations in the ER unfolded protein load, whereas in vitro BiP oligomerization is a convenient means to probe its affinity for substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preissler et al., 2015a</xref>). Purified AMPylated BiP migrates mostly as a monomer on native-PAGE gels and AMPylation increases the monomeric fraction of endogenous BiP from mammalian cells, suggesting that the modification might interfere with the ability of BiP to oligomerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Preissler et al., 2015b</xref>).

Our efforts to understand the consequences of this physiologically-entrained, high-stoichiometry modification of an important ER chaperone have yielded two key findings: Regardless of the identity of the bound nucleotide, AMPylation favors the domain-docked conformation of BiP; a conformation that specifies unstable substrate binding and is normally associated with ATP-bound Hsp70s. In this domain-docked conformation AMPylated BiP is recognized by J-proteins, however, the modification of T518 imposes an intrinsic blockage on BiP’s ability to respond to the co-chaperone by accelerated ATP hydrolysis.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>AMPylation weakens BiP-substrate interactions</title><p>ADP-bound BiP adopts a heterogeneous ensemble of conformations with a bias towards the domain-undocked state, whereas ATP binding strongly favors domain docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marcinowski et al., 2011</xref>). The findings presented here suggest that even when bound to ADP the equilibrium of AMPylated BiP is shifted towards a conformation in which the SBD and NBD are docked onto each other, thus resembling the ATP-bound state of unmodified BiP. This is evident both in solution-based protease-sensitivity experiments that track the disposition of the interdomain linker of BiP (a proxy for its conformational state, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhuravleva et al., 2012</xref>) and in the crystal structure of AMPylated BiP, which is found in a domain-docked conformation despite the absence of ATP in the nucleotide binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29428.024</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Hypothesized mechanisms by which AMPylation inactivates BiP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ADP-bound unmodified BiP is strongly biased towards a domain-undocked conformation with low substrate ‘off’ rates. AMPylation (BiP-AMP) biases the ADP-bound chaperone towards a more domain-docked state with higher substrate ‘off’ rates. As a consequence, AMPylation enfeebles BiP-client interactions. (<bold>B</bold>) The contacts formed between the docked nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and substrate binding domain (SBD) of ATP-bound BiP are proposed to inhibit its basal ATPase activity (red arrow). J-domain interaction with BiP likely weakens these inhibitory interdomain contacts favoring ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kityk et al., 2015</xref>) and triggering complete domain undocking, exposure of the interdomain linker (green), and stable substrate binding (red). By an allosteric mechanism, AMPylation on threonine 518 further strengthens the domain-docked conformation of ATP-bound BiP, which also strengthens the ATPase-inhibitory interdomain contacts (bold red arrow). This elevates the threshold for J domain-mediated stimulation of ATPase activity.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-29428-fig7-v2"/></fig><p>The substrate-binding domain of AMPylated apo BiP is found in a conformation typical of ATP-bound Hsp70/BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kityk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) and its widened substrate binding groove likely underlies the destabilizing effect of AMPylation on substrate binding. This structural feature is concordant with the enfeebling effect of AMPylation on BiP oligomerization in vitro (noted here), with previous observations that AMPylation correlates with an increased pool of monomeric cellular BiP and with higher substrate dissociation rates from ADP-bound AMPylated BiP observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Preissler et al., 2015b</xref>’, Figure 8E therein).</p><p>Loop L<sub>7,8</sub>, comprising T518, and the connected β-sheet in the SBDβ subdomain undergo major rearrangements during the transition between the nucleotide-dependent conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhuravleva and Gierasch, 2015</xref>). In the ADP-bound state the T518 side chain is oriented inwards and contributes to contacts amongst other loop residues. These contacts are lost upon ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2015</xref>), confining AMPylation to the ATP-bound conformation of BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Preissler et al., 2015b</xref>’, Figure 7 therein). In the structures presented here the modified T518 side chain was flipped outward and pointed into the solvent. This suggests that the bulky and hydrophilic AMP moiety sterically prevents loop L<sub>7,8</sub> from reverting to its ADP-bound position. As a consequence, the connected downstream β-sheet<sub>8</sub> likely retains its conformation even in absence of ATP, biasing the SBD towards a conformation associated with high substrate ‘off’ rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhuravleva and Gierasch, 2015</xref>) and stabilizing the contacts at the interface between the SBD and NBD, including the linker region. The net effect is to interfere with the allosteric transition to the domain-undocked conformation, normally observed in the ADP-bound state.</p><p>The benefit of inactivating BiP in a conformation that precludes stable engagement of substrates may arise in circumstances of an excess of BiP over its client proteins; for example, in the declining phase following a physiological burst of secreted protein synthesis. By interfering with the ability of excess BiP to engage substrates, AMPylation works against the tendency of the over-chaperoned ER to degrade clients that would otherwise be secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorner et al., 1992</xref>). Furthermore, over-expression of BiP that is locked in a conformation of slow substrate release is detrimental to ER function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hendershot et al., 1995</xref>), suggesting how the emergence of a mechanism for inactivating excess BiP in the alternative conformation, specified by AMPylation, may have been selected.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>AMPylation interferes with BiP’s responsiveness to J-proteins</title><p>The consequences of AMPylation to BiP’s functional interactions with ER-localized J-proteins may be even more important than the effects of AMPylation on substrate binding in the ADP-bound state. In cells the interaction of Hsp70 proteins with their clients is governed by J-domain co-chaperones that instruct a non-equilibrium ATP hydrolysis-driven conformational cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</xref>). The initial interactions between the ATP-bound chaperones and their substrates occur with high association rates followed by nucleotide hydrolysis that then strongly decreases the dissociation of the chaperone-substrate complex. Under physiological conditions (of excess ATP) J-proteins recruit ATP-bound Hsp70s to their substrates and thus couple substrate binding to acceleration of ATP hydrolysis, which increases the effective binding affinity beyond the equilibrium values observed in either nucleotide-bound state, thus establishing a regime of ultra-affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Los Rios and Barducci, 2014</xref>).</p><p>AMPylation strongly interferes with the ability of J-proteins to impart ultra-affinity on BiP. This is reflected both by the dramatic defect in J protein-driven BiP oligomerization and by the defect in J protein-mediated BiP association with a model substrate in BLI experiments. Both the higher dissociation rate of substrates from ADP-bound AMPylated BiP and the defect in J protein-stimulated ATP hydrolysis appear to contribute to the inability of AMPylated BiP to attain ultra-affinity for its substrates. Thus, by targeting the rate-limiting step of its ATPase cycle AMPylation favors the retention of BiP in an inert, mostly ATP-bound conformation, whilst impeding wasteful ATP hydrolysis.</p><p>The significance of the modest, but reproducible defect observed in nucleotide exchange from AMPylated BiP, remains to be determined. The rate of ATP hydrolysis we observed was slower than ADP dissociation, suggesting that AMPylated BiP spends most of its time in the ATP-bound state (a feature that is likely accentuated in cells by the presence of nucleotide exchange factors). Nonetheless, a slowing of nucleotide exchange would serve to further limit ATP consumption by AMPylated BiP, whilst retaining even the small ADP-bound AMPylated fraction of BiP in a relatively inert state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Insights into AMPylation-mediated interference with J-protein stimulated ATP hydrolysis</title><p>AMPylation does not affect the ability of BiP to engage in protein-protein interactions with the J-domain - unmodified and AMPylated BiP both bind the J-domain with similar affinities - rather AMPylation blocks the subsequent stimulation of ATP hydrolysis. Can this be explained by the structural effect of the modification?</p><p>It has been proposed that the interdomain contacts formed between the SBD and NBD in the ATP-bound conformation of the <italic>E. coli</italic> Hsp70 DnaK communicate to the active site within the NBD to inhibit ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kityk et al., 2015</xref>). Docking of the SBD against the NBD likely exerts a similar inhibitory effect in BiP, as the ATPase activity of the isolated NBD is 2-fold greater than that of intact BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hendershot et al., 1995</xref>) and BiP’s ATPase activity is increased 2-fold by mutations that interfere with domain docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Awad et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the SBD-NBD contacts identified by Kityk et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kityk et al., 2015</xref>) as having a role in enforcing the inhibited state, are largely conserved in the crystal structure of AMPylated BiP.</p><p>J-proteins, which bind at the interface between the NBD and SBD, are proposed to weaken the interaction between the two, relieving the repression and thereby favoring ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Awad et al., 2008</xref>). Our findings suggest that BiP AMPylation further biases even the ATP-bound BiP towards the domain-docked conformation (compare reactions 4 and 8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This likely arises from the presence of a bulky modification on T518, which prevents major rearrangements in the SBDβ by enforcing a specific conformation on loop L<sub>7,8</sub>, thus stabilizing contacts between the SBD and NBD, frustrating J-protein action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The importance of long-range allosteric communication between the SBD and NBD of BiP and the impact of AMPylation and other subtle changes in the SBD on this allostery receive independent support from NMR studies of the Zhuravleva lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wieteska et al., 2017</xref>). Though situated on the opposite end of the SBD, AMPylation allosterically targets the principal mechanism by which J-proteins enhance ATP hydrolysis by the NBD of Hsp70s.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>The plasmids used in this study were described previously or generated by standard molecular cloning techniques and are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Protein purification</title><p>Wildtype and mutant Chinese hamster BiP proteins carrying an N-terminal hexahistidine (His6)-tag were purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Preissler et al., 2015b</xref>) with modifications.

The retained protein was eluted with elution buffer L (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM ATP, 1 mM TCEP). After AMPylation with GST-FICD<sup>E234G</sup> and cleavage of the His6-Smt3 tag with Ulp1 (as described in strategy A) the protein solution was incubated with 1 ml Glutathione Sepharose 4B for 2 hr at room temperature (to bind GST-FICD<sup>E234G</sup>). The matrix was collected by centrifugation and the supernatant was dialyzed twice for 14 hr against 5 l buffer M (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA) and once for 24 hr against 10 l AEX-LS buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 50 mM NaCl). Afterwards, the protein was subjected to anion exchange chromatography using a 5 ml HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in AEX-LS buffer and bound protein was eluted with AEX-HS buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 M NaCl) on a linear gradient (0% to 50% AEX-HS in 20 column volumes). The purest fractions were pooled and incubated with 1.5 ml Ni-NTA agarose beads in presence of 25 mM imidazole for 30 min at 4°C (to bind residual uncleaved protein and free His6-Smt3 tag). To crystallize AMPylated BiP in absence of nucleotide the protein solution was desalted over a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column equilibrated with buffer N (10 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl). The protein solution was then supplemented with 1 mM TCEP and concentrated for crystallization. Crystals grown in 20% PEG-1000, 0.1 M NaKHPO<sub>4</sub> pH 6.2, 0.1 NaCl (PDB 6EOB) and 5% PEG-1000, 0.2 M Li<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> pH 4.2 (PDB 6EOC) were used for data collection and the structures were solved as described above.</p><p>Strategy C (PDB 6EOE): Protein was expressed, purified, and AMPylated as in strategy B. Protein obtained after ion exchange and reverse Ni affinity chromatography was incubated with 14 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 mM ATP for 2 hr on ice before addition of 100 mM EDTA and immediate gel filtration using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column (GE Healthcare) in buffer TN (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl). Fractions of the main elution peak (corresponding to monomeric BiP protein) were pooled, supplemented with 1 mM TCEP, and concentrated for crystallization. The structure of BiP crystallized in 5% PEG-1000, 0.2 M Li<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> pH 4.2 was solved as described above.</p><p>Strategy D (PDB 6EOF): Protein was initially purified according to strategy B except that dialysis (after AMPylation and removal of the modifying enzyme) was performed against buffer O (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl) for 16 hr at 4°C. The dialyzed solution was passed through a column containing 2 ml Q Sepharose High Performance matrix (GE Healthcare) by gravity flow. The flow-trough was concentrated and applied to gel filtration using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column equilibrated in buffer TN. The purest elution fractions were pooled and dialyzed twice for 24 hr at 4°C against 5 l buffer TN containing 5 mM EDTA (to remove nucleotides) and once against the same buffer without EDTA. The protein solution was then supplemented with 1 mM TCEP and concentrated. The crystallization reactions were set up in presence of 10 mM ADP and 14 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Crystals grown in 9% PEG-1000, 0.2 M Li<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> pH 4.4 were used for data collection and the structure was solved as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analytical size-exclusion chromatography</title><p>Analytical size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preissler et al., 2015a</xref>) with modifications.

Where indicated ADP or ATP (each at 1.5 mM) as well as GST-J<sup>WT</sup> or GST-J<sup>QPD</sup> J-domain proteins (each between 1.25 µM and 10 µM) were added to the reactions. 10 µl of each sample were injected onto a SEC-3 HPLC column (300 Å pore size; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) equilibrated with HKM and the runs were performed at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min at room temperature. Peptide bond absorbance at 230 nm (A<sub>230 nm</sub>) was detected and plotted against the elution time. A gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad, cat. no. 151–1901) was applied as a size reference and the elution peaks of Thyroglobulin (670 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa), Ovalbumin (44 kDa), and Myoglobulin (17 kDa) are indicated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Bio-layer interferometry</title><p>Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) experiments were performed on the FortéBio Octet RED96 System (Pall FortéBio, Menlo Park, CA).

Biotinylated GST-J<sup>WT</sup> and GST-J<sup>QPD</sup> were diluted to 20 nM and P15 peptide (ALLLSAPRRGAGKK; custom synthesized by GenScript, Piscataway, NJ), which was biotinylated on the C-terminal lysine, was diluted to 50 nM in the same solution. Streptavidin (SA)-coated biosensors (Pall FortéBio) were hydrated in assay solution for at least five minutes before the experiment. Where indicated 2 mM ADP or ATP was added. All solutions were prepared in a final volume of 200 µl on a 96 well microplate (greiner bio-one, Kremsmünster, Austria, cat. no. 655209) and data acquisition was performed at a shake speed of 600 rpm and at 24°C with the indicated experimental steps. In brief, after an initial equilibration step in assay solution biotinylated GST-J<sup>WT</sup> or GST-J<sup>QPD</sup> was immobilized until a difference in the binding signal of 0.4 nm was reached. The sensors were then washed and saturated with P15 peptide. Following a baseline step the sensors were introduced in BiP protein-containing solution to measure association followed by dipping into protein-free solution to record BiP dissociation. The dissociation data from at least three independent repeats were fitted with a one-phase decay function to determine the dissociation rate constants using the GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>).</p><p>The experiments to analyze non-substrate interactions between the J-domain and BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) were performed likewise without P15 peptide and the sensors were saturated with biotinylated GST-J<sup>WT</sup> or GST-J<sup>QPD</sup> (both at 20 nM) before exposure to unmodified or AMPylated BiP<sup>T229A-V461F</sup> (UK 1825) at the indicated concentrations.

Unmodified and AMPylated BiP proteins were adjusted to 30 µM in reaction solution (25 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and incubated in a final volume of 50 µl with 0.8 mM ATP and 0.6 MBq α-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP (EasyTide; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) for 3 min on ice. The formed BiP•ATP complexes were separated from free nucleotide by gel filtration using illustra Sephadex G-50 NICK columns (GE Healthcare, cat. no. 17-0855-01) that have been pre-saturated with 1 ml of a 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution and equilibrated with ice-cold reaction solution. Individual elution fractions (two drops each) were collected and the fractions of the first radioactive peak were pooled and flash frozen in aliquots. The final protein concentration of the pools was estimated based on the dilution of the sample during separation. For each reaction a fresh aliquot of the pre-formed complexes was rapidly thawed at room temperature. After 0.5 µl were withdrawn as a zero time point sample, 6 µl of the remaining BiP•ATP complexes were added to reactions containing GST-J<sup>QPD</sup> or GST-J<sup>WT</sup> proteins (both at 2 µM) in a final volume of 50 µl. The final BiP protein concentration in the reactions was ~0.8 µM. At the indicated time points 2 µl were withdrawn from the reactions and spotted onto a thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate (PEI Cellulose F; Merck Millipore, cat. no. 105579), which was pre-spotted with a mixture of 5 mM ADP and 5 mM ATP. The nucleotides were then separated by developing the TLC plates with 400 mM LiCl and 10% (v/v) acetic acid as a mobile phase. The plates were dried, exposed to a storage phosphor screen, and the signals were detected using a Typhoon Trio imager (GE Healthcare). The signals were quantified using Image J64 and the ADP values were normalized to the total radioactive signal (ADP + ATP) for each time point and fitted with a single exponential function using the GraphPad Prism 6 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>ADP release experiments</title><p>Non-AMPylated or AMPylated BiP proteins at 1 µM were incubated with 1 µM of the fluorescent ADP analog MABA-ADP (8-[(4-Amino)butyl]-amino-ADP - MANT; Jena Bioscience, Jena, Germany, cat. no.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary of the work:</p><p>AMPylation inactivates the ER Hsp70 chaperone BiP. This study provides an explanation for the effect of AMPylation on BiP function, building on the earlier discovery of this modification. The authors show that AMPylation reduces the ATPase rate of BiP. Interestingly, J-protein binds to modified BiP but does not stimulate its ATPase. Crystallization of a construct of BiP that harbors the AMP modification shows that AMPylated BiP adopts the typical ATP-bound conformation in which the N-terminal ATPase domain and the C-terminal peptide binding domain are docked. The structure supports the effect of the AMP modification to shift the conformation of BiP towards the domain-docked state.</p><p>Essential points to be addressed in the revised manuscript:</p><p>1) In the crystal structure, AMP is not visible. The evidence for the presence of the modification is only indirect. The mass spec analysis was performed on the non-crystallized protein, but should be done on protein from a dissolved crystal. Also, it should be shown that the modified and unmodified forms behave similarly in the mass spec analysis. A 50:50 mixture of both forms could be analyzed.</p><p>2) ADP release was measured in the presence of Grp170. The protein shows impurities in the range of 75 and 60 kDa. The larger impurity could be DnaK, which might influence the results in the ADP release assay. The impurities should be analyzed by mass spectrometry.</p><p>3) Grp170 was produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>. This protein is known to be heavily glycosylated. Authors should comment on the functionality of the <italic>E. coli</italic> produced protein.</p><p>4) How reproducible are the proteolysis data? Corresponding panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> for unmodified BiP, with the V461F mutation in ADP seem to show different amounts of residual full-length protein. Please comment on the reproducibility of this assay.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>1) The Abstract doesn't do justice to the story. Authors should consider making a clearer statement of the conclusions as was done in the Discussion.</p><p>2) The authors make their arguments about the docked and undocked allosteric equilibrium based on the behavior of DnaK. However, BiP may be different. Authors should at least state that they are assuming a similar behavior before they start talking about BiP in terms that have been developed with lots of data from DnaK behavior.</p><p>3) In the crystal structure a large part of the substrate binding domain (lid) is missing. The lid is known to be important for substrate binding and stimulation of ATP hydrolysis. This should be discussed in more detail.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29428.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential points to be addressed in the revised manuscript:</p><p>1) In the crystal structure, AMP is not visible.

Therefore, we prepared new crystals of apo BiP, solved their structure (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) and performed intact protein mass spectrometry that revealed the presence of a homogenous preparation of AMPylated BiP in the crystal (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) ADP release was measured in the presence of Grp170.

It follows therefore that both possess a His-6 tag and argues that contaminating <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaK is unlikely to make an important contribution to the mass of the 75 KDa species. This impression is supported by mass spectrometric analysis of a tryptic digest of the 75 KDa species present in the Grp170 preparation, which shows that most of peptides recovered are from Grp170 and not from <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>To address head on the potential contribution of DnaK to the ADP-release data, we examined directly that potential role of Grp170 in stimulating ADP release from DnaK and found no evidence for such activity (panel B).</p><p>From these experiments we conclude that DnaK is not an important contributor to the Grp170 preparation, neither in content nor in functionality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Grp170 was produced in E. coli.
