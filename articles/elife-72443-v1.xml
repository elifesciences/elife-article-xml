inflammation, folliculitis, and microbial infection, resulting in a decrease in quality of life and dose interruption. However, no effective clinical intervention is available for this adverse effect. Here, we report the atrophy of dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT), a highly plastic adipose tissue with various skin-specific functions, correlates with rash occurrence and exacerbation in a murine model of EGFR inhibitor-induced rash. The reduction in dWAT is due to the inhibition of adipogenic differentiation by defects in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) signaling, and increased lipolysis by the induced expression of the lipolytic cytokine IL6. The activation of PPARγ by rosiglitazone maintains adipogenic differentiation and represses the transcription of IL6, eventually improving skin functions and ameliorating the severity of rash without altering the antitumor effects. Thus, activation of PPARγ represents a promising approach to ameliorate cutaneous toxicity in patients with cancer who receive anti-EGFR therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dermal adipose tissue</kwd><kwd>anti-EGFR therapy</kwd><kwd>cutaneous toxicity</kwd><kwd>PPARγ</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17Z127060041、19Z127060001、19Z127010003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Shiyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004921</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WF220408211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Shiyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004921</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>YG2017MS18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Shiyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>State Key Laboratory of Onco- genes and Related Genes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>90-17-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Shiyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81773347</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Nan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Modulation of dermal adipocytes contributes to skin homeostasis and provides a promising new therapeutic strategy in the treatment of EGFRI-related skin disorders.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a canonical therapeutic target for non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. Cutaneous toxicity induced by EGFR inhibitors (EGFRIs) is an inflammatory disorder characterized by papulopustular rash, folliculitis, microbial infection and pruritus. Most commonly, rash is observed in 70–90% of patients receiving anti-EGFR therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cappuzzo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sequist et al., 2013</xref>), resulting in a decrease in quality of life. Except for the empiric use of corticosteroids and antibiotics, no effective clinical treatment is currently available for these adverse effects, which is responsible for 8–17% of dose modifications and interruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lacouture, 2006</xref>). Therefore, new therapeutic targets for EGFRI-specific skin toxicity urgently need to be discovered.</p><p>Dysfunction of the epidermal barrier, retardation of hair follicle growth and various dermal inflammatory responses have been proposed as causative factors for EGFRI-induced rash, but therapeutic agents that interfere with these mechanisms have limited effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lichtenberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mascia et al., 2013</xref>). An analysis of biopsies from rodents with the genetic ablation of EGFR or pharmacological EGFR inhibitors both showed a dramatic loss of dermal adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Murillas et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sibilia and Wagner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sugawara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Surguladze et al., 2009</xref>), a newly recognized adipose layer termed dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT). Compared to other conventional fat depots, dWAT has more skin-specific functions and a high plasticity to expand or contract in response to different stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). For example, local infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), a high-fat diet (HFD) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2019a</xref>) induce dWAT expansion. Recent studies have revealed unique roles for dWAT in skin fibrosis and scarring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marangoni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Varga and Marangoni, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2019b</xref>), wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Plikus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schmidt and Horsley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shook et al., 2020</xref>), immune modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dokoshi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), and regeneration of hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donati et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Festa et al., 2011</xref>). During the hair cycle, dermal adipose tissue expands in the anagen phase and regresses in catagen phase, providing vital signals to regulate hair growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2019b</xref>). In addition, the reduction in dWAT in transgenic and pharmacologically treated mice results in a scaly skin phenotype with delayed hair coat formation, poorly developed pilosebaceous structures and epidermal barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herrmann et al., 2003</xref>), and these phenomena resembled the abnormalities in skin observed upon EGFR inhibition. A similar synchronized pattern was also observed in wound healing. Dermal adipocytes surrounding the site of skin injury undergo lipolysis and dedifferentiation, transition to myofibroblasts and attract macrophages to stimulate re-epithelialization and revascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shook et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, new adipocytes regenerating from myofibroblasts were also observed in healed wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Plikus et al., 2017</xref>). The importance of dWAT in host defense is the promotion of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (Camp) release during adipogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). The production of Camp defends against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>) infection, which often develops along with EGFRI skin toxicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lichtenberger et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Since the multiple functions of dWAT are closely related to EGFRI-induced skin toxicities and a reduction in dermal fat has been observed in EGFR-depleted mice, we investigated whether dWAT plays a central role in EGFRI-induced rash. Here, using an EGFRI-induced rash model and dermal fibroblast (dFB) differentiation assays, we showed that atrophy of dWAT occurs during rash development and has a strong causality with rash severity. The differentiation of dFBs was obviously inhibited and lipolysis of mature adipocytes was increased upon EGFR inhibition. Notably, stimulating dermal adipocyte expansion with a high-fat diet (HFD) or the pharmacological PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (Rosi) ameliorated the severity of rash.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A reduction in dWAT is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of rash</title><p>EGFRI therapy in patients is consistently associated with specific skin toxicities, such as papulopustular rash. Additionally, weight loss and decreased appetite accompany these changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Recent reports have shown a strong, positive correlation between body weight and dWAT thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kasza et al., 2016</xref>). To investigate whether dWAT responses to EGFR inhibition, we established a rat rash model by repeated oral gavage of Afatinib (Afa), an EGFR inhibitor with a high occurrence of skin toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sequist et al., 2013</xref>). Rats continued losing weight and exhibited reduced food intake throughout the Afa intervention, and at the end of the treatment, they had lost up to 27.9% and 23.1% of their initial body weight and food intake, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). After 3 days of treatment, few rats began to occur the skin lesions, until day 7, almost all rats developed rash with 23.08% of them were grade two and above. Grade three rash happened at day eight and increased in the next two days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The rat model recapitulated all skin features of patients receiving EGFRIs, including erythema, pustules and itching, and the pustules conflated to lakes of pus that dried and formed yellow crusts when rash developed to a higher grade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Administrations by other EGFRIs, such as Erlotinib, Gefitinib, Osimertinib, had similar phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a dense inflammatory infiltrate with a marked clustering of CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages, CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD11b<sup>+</sup> immune cells, and mast cells in the dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>).

The thickness of the dWAT layer decreased with an increase in the rash grade, and skin lipid levels also decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). A significant decrease in the number of cells stained with the adipocyte surface protein Caveolin-1 was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A recent study described the importance of hair eruption on rash occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klufa et al., 2019</xref>). In our rat model, there was a similar situation that the skin rash occurred earlier and was more severe on shaved back skin than on the unshaved area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). This result indicates that shaving-induced hair eruption has an important impact on rash progress during the EGFR inhibitor treatment. The unshaved area still developed abnormal erythema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and showed dWAT reduction after long-term Afa treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>).</p><p>Changes in dWAT were examined by performing a detailed morphometric analysis. The attenuation of intradermal adipocytes was due to a decrease in both size and number, and time-course studies revealed that the size change occurred prior to the change in adipocyte number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, a positive correlation existed between dWAT thickness and rash grade throughout Afa treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This correlation suggests that changes in the dWAT layer in response to a process associated with EGFRI affected skin function. In addition to the dermal adipose layer, skin-associated adipose tissue also includes back subcutaneous adipocytes (sWAT), inguinal adipocytes (iWAT) and brown adipocytes (BAT), which are all adjacent to the back skin. Although clear evidence of anatomically and functionally distinct skin adipose depots in rodents has been reported, for example, the dWAT layer was separated by a distinct muscle layer known as the panniculus carnosus and verified to develop independently of sWAT, these two layers are not quite physically and functionally demarcated in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wojciechowicz et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we also monitored the weight change of sWAT and other skin adipose depots, and found that iWAT and BAT also showed a decreasing trend at late time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), whereas sWAT represented a more similar response to dWAT during rash occurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>).</p><p>The reduction in the size and number of adipocytes in the dWAT layer at the rash site suggested that adipocytes may be modulated by the inhibition of differentiation and an increase in lipolysis. To examine whether the differentiation of dermal adipocyte was affected, we first compared the expression of differentiation-associated genes in Afa-treated skin with that in vehicle-treated skin using quantitative PCR. The expressions of general adipocyte marker genes were significantly decreased at the end of the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Reduced expression of PPARγ and Perilinpin-2 were also detected in skin samples from rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A, B</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the loss of dermal adipocytes is a characteristic hallmark of EGFRI-induced skin toxicity, and this process might be modulated by PPAR-mediated differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>EGFRI stimulation induces the dedifferentiation of dWAT</title><p>A loss of dWAT was also reported to be a prominent feature of systemic sclerosis in humans, a disease with disturbed skin homeostasis and dermal fibrosis. The adipocyte–myofibroblast transition is the primary event in the pathogenesis of cutaneous fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Varga and Marangoni, 2017</xref>). Additionally, dermal adipocyte dedifferentiation and subsequent conversion to myofibroblasts have been verified in skin injury and are necessary for efficient tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shook et al., 2020</xref>). To characterize dermal adipocyte differentiation, we first performed Masson’s trichrome staining for collagen to characterize dermal adipocyte differentiation. Rats receiving daily Afa treatments showed a time-dependent progressive decrease in dWAT thickness associated with a slightly thicker dermis and collagen deposition in the early stage of rash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). We next analyzed the expression of fibrotic genes in dWAT before and after rash to evaluate the adipocyte to fibroblast transdifferentiation process. However, dermal adipocytes isolated from the back skin of Afa-treated rats only exhibited slight fibrotic potential in the early stage that diminished quickly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), whereas the expression of general adipocyte markers represented a continuous and obvious decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The same trend was also observed in sWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).

Upon EGFRI stimulation, we found that attached adipocytes began to decrease the size of lipid droplets and the cells formed spindle-like shapes on day four after Afa treatment. Then, they gradually elongated, lost intracellular lipids and proliferated as fully dedifferentiated PDGFRα + fibrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In comparison, adipocytes cultured under control experimental conditions attached much fewer and still retained lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). Based on our evidence, the expression of genes related to the function of mature adipocytes, such as <italic>Pparg</italic>, <italic>Adipoq</italic>, and <italic>Fabp4,</italic> was downregulated after EGFRI treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The gene enrichment analysis highlighted the significance of PPAR signaling in the pathology of EGFRI-induced skin toxicity. The blockade of PPARγ produces defective adipocytes and exerts a negative effect on skin wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schmidt and Horsley, 2013</xref>). In contrast, rosiglitazone (Rosi), a PPARγ agonist, abrogates bleomycin-induced scleroderma and blocks profibrotic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that PPARγ activation might reverse adipocyte dedifferentiation in response to EGFR inhibition through a compensatory mechanism. We evaluated the effect of Rosi on Afa-treated dermal adipocytes to directly test this hypothesis. Application of Rosi reversed the dedifferentiation of dermal adipocytes induced by Afa, and cells cultured in the presence of Rosi displayed little attachment until 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). Correspondingly, the transcriptional level of <italic>Pparg</italic> was downregulated by Afa and upregulated by Rosi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In summary, these results suggest that an EGFR signaling deficiency, caused by treatment with EGFRI, triggers the dermal adipocyte-myofibroblast transition at an early stage and significant dedifferentiation, and the PPARγ agonist Rosi effectively rescues this phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Differentiation of adipocyte precursors are suppressed during EGFR inhibition</title><p>Dermal adipocyte precursor cells (APs) were recently identified in the skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Festa et al., 2011</xref>; moreover, recent genetic and molecular research revealed that the activation of APs depends on the PDGFRA-PI3K-AKT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rivera-Gonzalez et al., 2016</xref>). The AKT pathway is a key downstream target of EGFR kinase, which also modulates proliferation and survival. To determine whether the loss of mature dWAT cells was caused by EGFR inhibition on APs, we isolated dFBs from the skin dermis and treated them with Afa for 3, 6 and 9 days during adipogenic differentiation in vitro. Consistent with our hypothesis, the differentiation of dFBs in the presence of Afa was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), and the concentration of Afa used in this experiment had little antiproliferative effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Notably, the addition of Rosi circumvented the inhibition of adipogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Next, we aimed to define the molecular pathways affected by EGFR inhibition in dermal adipogenic cells. The gene signature induced by Afa in APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) was similar to the changes in gene expression observed in mature adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Adipocytes have been shown to express a variety of pattern recognition receptors and cytokine receptors, including TLR1-9, NOD1-2, TNFR, IL4R, and IL6R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deiuliis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sindhu et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the expression levels of many of these receptors were increased during Afa treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating the proinflammatory potential of adipocytes upon EGFR inhibition. Additionally, we analyzed the levels of PDGFRα and phosphorylated AKT. Significantly increased levels of PDGFRα were detected on days 6 and 9, indicating a retardation of AP differentiation. Phospho-AKT1 and phospho-AKT2 levels were also affected by Afa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Cotreatment with the PPARγ agonist Rosi and the EGFR inhibitor Afa completely abrogated the inhibition of APs differentiation. Notably, the addition of Rosi significantly activated both AKT1 and AKT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). We next examined the number of APs in EGFRI-treated rats. Using FACS, we found that APs (CD31<sup>-</sup>, CD45<sup>-</sup>, CD34<sup>+</sup>, CD29<sup>+</sup>) were absent after EGFR inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>).

To examine whether lipolysis occurs after EGFR inhibition, isolated dermal adipocytes were assessed using transmission electron microscopy, and the expression of lipolysis-activated markers, the rate-limiting enzyme ATGL and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (pHSL) were detected. We observed increased levels of ATGL and pHSL in dWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Consistent with these changes, multiple smaller droplets adjacent to large lipid droplets were detected in Afa-treated rats, whereas only large, unilocular lipids were retained in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, in sWAT, lipolysis-induced glycerol production was not increase in either sWAT isolated from Afa-treated rats or Afa stimulation of sWAT from Ctrl-treated rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We performed lipidomics on isolated dermal adipocytes from Ctrl- or Afa-treated rats to characterize the composition of fatty acids (FAs). The fatty acid composition of adipocytes from Afa- or Ctrl-treated rats did not show any significant differences, and the only significantly changed medium-chain FA was decanoic acid (10:0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Notably, the most abundant FAs were mainly C18 fatty acids, including methyl oleate (18:1), methyl elaidate (18:1T), methyl linoleate (18:2) and methyl linoelaidate (18:2T) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating the extensive release of these types of FAs to the cell matrix during lipolysis. Correspondingly, the free fatty acid (FFA) in the skin homogenates showed an enrichment in Afa-treated rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

In contrast, we did not observe differences in the expression of these genes in dWAT cells isolated from the skin of Ctrl- and Afa-treated rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J</xref>). However, treatment of adipocytes by homogenates from rat skin revealed obvious upregulation of lipase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), thus indicating that cytokines secreted by other skin cells might contribute to lipolysis. According to recent studies, EGFR-inhibited or EGFR-depleted skin epidermal keratinocytes,regulate key factors involved in skin inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lichtenberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mascia et al., 2013</xref>). We doubted whether epidermal HaCaT cells regulated adipose lipolysis by releasing inflammatory cytokines. Consistent with previous findings, Afa-stimulated HaCaT cells exhibited higher expression levels of <italic>IL6</italic>, but not <italic>TNFα</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Notably, the addition of Rosi exerted an obvious inhibitory effect on the transcription of <italic>IL6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We designed several coculture experiments to characterize the roles of Afa and Rosi on adipocytes in inflammation and lipolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). First, we added Afa to epidermal HaCaT cells to stimulate <italic>IL6</italic> transcription, then treated differentiated-dFBs with the supernatants from HaCaT cells, and finally collected dFB supernatants for monocyte chemotactic assays. Multiple small lipid droplets formed in the Afa-treated dFB, while larger lipids maintained in the Ctrl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). The number of migrated monocytes was also significantly increased in the Afa group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J and K</xref>). Notably, addition of Rosi simultaneously with Afa suppressed both the lipolysis and monocyte migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–K</xref>), indicating that the production of inflammatory cytokines was inhibited by Rosi at the initial stage. Consistent with the transcriptional level, secreted IL6 was increased after Afa treatment both in rat skin homogenates and HaCaT supernatants, and decreased with the addition of Rosi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1K, L</xref>). We next performed the stimulation of IL6 on differentiated-dFB, the lipolysis enhanced by increased level of lipase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1M</xref>), suggesting that the IL6 secreted by keratinocytes induced lipolysis of adipocytes.</p><p>Activation of PPARγ was reported to stimulate lipid reabsorption, reduce FFA secretion and improve lipid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). To evaluate the direct effect of Rosi on adipocytes during lipolysis, we treated adipocytes with Rosi in the presence of supernatant from Afa-treated HaCaT cells. The lipid stability was improved with the existence of Rosi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). Although not as significant as the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J and K</xref>, the elevated chemotaxis of monocytes was also attenuated by Rosi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M and N</xref>). Given the importance of lipolysis in inflammation, we then dissected whether the participation of adipocytes amplified the inflammatory response. Compared with stimulation of undifferentiated dFBs, the induction of inflammation was remarkable in differentiated dFBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O and P</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that the EGFRI induced dermal adipocyte lipolysis, whereas the production of lipolytic cytokines was not induced by the direct stimulation of adipocytes but occurred in keratinocytes. The increased levels of FAs, especially 18:2, are likely to induce monocyte migration. Rosi treatment alleviated lipolysis and the inflammatory response by acting on both the epidermis and adipocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Expansion and ablation of dWAT reveal its important roles in the rash process</title><p>To directly examine the roles of dermal adipocytes in skin rash during EGFR inhibition while avoiding systemic obese phenotypes or loss of other adipocytes, we established a short-term HFD-induced dWAT expansion model and a pharmacological dWAT ablation model.</p><p>Recent reports described the substantial expansion of the dWAT layer in HFD-fed obese mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kasza et al., 2016</xref>; additionally, increased proliferation of total stromal vascular fraction cells in WAT after long-term HFD feeding and activation of APs at the onset of obesity have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jeffery et al., 2015</xref>).

The active ingredient DCA is structurally identical to endogenous deoxycholate, which serves to solubilize dietary diet; therefore, DCA is designed to disrupt the lipid bilayer of cell membranes and induce cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schuller-Petrovic et al., 2008</xref>). Based on the function of DCA, we established a dWAT ablation model by administering an intradermal DCA injection.

In addition, other skin-related adipocyte depots, such as sWAT, iWAT, and BAT, remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>). After dWAT ablation, we examined the skin rash process induced by Afa oral gavage in control and DCA rats.

The severity of rash is commonly considered a factor associated with a better prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peréz-Soler and Saltz, 2005</xref>). The pathogenesis of rash is multifactorial. Recent clinical and experimental findings have described EGFRI-induced rash as an inflammatory disease. Several epidermis-targeted genetic mouse models have revealed the relationship of epidermal EGFR with local immune cell activation, keratinocyte differentiation, hair eruption and microbiota outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klufa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lichtenberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mascia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Satoh et al., 2020</xref>). Mice lacking EGFR in the epidermis developed the same phenotypes of skin lesions as patients treated with EGFRIs: neutrophilic pustules, initial infiltration of macrophages and mast cells, subsequent T cell infiltration, hair follicle destruction, keratin plugs and bacterial invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mascia et al., 2013</xref>). In humans and mice, the recruitment of inflammatory cells is attributed to the production of proinflammatory chemokines such as CCL5 and CCL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lichtenberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mascia et al., 2013</xref>). However, crossing EGFR<sup>Δep</sup> mice with CCR2<sup>-/-</sup>, MyD88<sup>-/-</sup>, TNFR<sup>-/-</sup> or NOS2<sup>-/-</sup> mice did not ameliorate the skin phenotype, while the depletion of macrophages or mast cells only slightly improved the skin phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lichtenberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mascia et al., 2013</xref>). These results reveal the complexity of the inflammatory response and various cell-cell interactions following EGFR blockade. The interference of a single-cell type or a particular signaling pathway may not be sufficient to explain the abnormal skin phenotypes, which include hair follicles, sebaceous glands, dermal immune cells, and blood vessels. Current reports described dermal adipose tissue as a composite tissue maintaining skin functions. dWAT participates in hair cycling, wound healing, thermogenesis, fibrosis and scarring, and immune modulation. Notably, we first noticed that the dWAT layer was diminished in animal models with either genetic EGFR ablation or pharmacological inhibition, and hair follicles were arrested in catagen phase and located far away from the dWAT layer. However, researchers have not determined how dermal adipocytes respond to EGFR inhibition. Moreover, the effect of modulating dWAT on this pathological condition requires further investigation.</p><p>Here, we show that a reduction in dermal adipocytes is an early response to EGFR inhibition and leads to the disorder of cutaneous homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Impaired adipogenesis decreased the skin defense against <italic>S. aureus</italic>, as well as the signaling interactions with hair follicles. In addition, increased migration of monocytes was associated with lipolysis in adipocytes characterized by increased lipase activity. Activation of lipolysis in dermal fat occurs as a response to skin wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schmidt and Horsley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shook et al., 2020</xref>). Although macrophages recruited during wound healing by lipolysis were reported to promote revascularization and re-epithelialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shook et al., 2020</xref>), increased macrophage numbers and free fatty acid contents may also stimulate inflammatory responses via various pattern recognition receptors and cytokine receptors in adipocytes, subsequently inducing cytokine expression and increasing chemoattractant activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). The infiltration of macrophages in adipose tissue coincided with circulating FFA concentrations and adipose lipolysis, and pharmacologically induced lipolysis by a β3-adrenergic agonist increased macrophage accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kosteli et al., 2010</xref>). Correspondingly, our data also showed a causal relationship among macrophage infiltration, FFA secretion and lipolysis following EGFRI treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>), and the lipids released by disrupting adipocyte cell membranes in the DCA model indicated an accumulation of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2J</xref>). Notably, we showed that dermal adipocytes amplified inflammatory responses from epithelial cells primed with EGFRI treatment. Although epithelial keratinocytes alone secreted chemokines and induced inflammatory infiltration, the participation of dermal fat enhanced this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M and N</xref>). The ability of dermal lipids to costimulate keratinocyte-generated cellular responses represents a novel pathway for the amplification of innate immunity and inflammation. Based on these data, local lipid fluxes are central regulators of the inflammatory response in EGFRI-affected dermal adipose tissue. In this study, we also found a distinction between dermal and subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Although both of these tissues respond early and decrease in size after EGFR inhibition, the expression of adipogenic and fibrotic genes shows different trends; additionally, lipolysis does not occur in subcutaneous fat. These results indicate that the dermal adipose layer is distinct from subcutaneous adipocytes and has a unique role in skin modulation.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>dWAT contributes to skin homeostasis during anti-EGFR therapy.</title><p>Reduction of dWAT is a hallmark of EGFRi-induced cutaneous toxicity.

In addition, lipolysis is activated by the up-regulation of the lipolytic cytokine IL6 through epidermal keratinocytes, leading to the infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages. Lack of dWAT also impairs skin host defense and hair follicle growth. Activation of PPARγ by Rosi could both alleviate the block of differentiation and suppress the increased lipolysis through transcription inhibition of IL6, thus relieving the abnormal skin phenotypes in vivo.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72443-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Innate immunity of dermal adipose tissue mediated by the release of antimicrobial peptides protects many organs from bacterial infection, such as the skin, peritoneum, endocardium and colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dokoshi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Impaired adipogenesis induced by the PPARγ inhibitors GW9662 and BADGE results in an increased bacterial infection in the skin and colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dokoshi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, a recent study observed that retinoids enhance and sustain Camp levels in developing preadipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liggins et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, retinoids are therapeutically useful against acne, a disorder driven partly by bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chivot, 2005</xref>). This correlation might also be beneficial to treat acneiform lesions in patients with EGFRI-associated skin disorders. Another skin-related disorder called scarring alopecia is caused by a specific <italic>Pparg</italic> depletion in hair follicle stem cells, and immunohistochemical staining showed proinflammatory lipid and cell accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karnik et al., 2009</xref>). The interplay between dWAT and hair follicles also involves the modulation of the stem cell niche. Follicular stem cell activation was verified to be associated with dermal adipocytes, and hair follicles of mice treated with BADGE or GW9662 did not enter anagen phase and were blocked in telogen phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rivera-Gonzalez et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>PPARγ acts directly to negatively regulate the expression of inflammatory genes in a ligand-dependent manner by antagonizing the activities of transcription factors, such as members of the NF-κB and AP-1 families. PPARγ stimulation in rodents has been shown to ameliorate several inflammatory diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and acne vulgaris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ramot et al., 2015</xref>). However, previous studies did not obtain evidence of the effect of PPARγ modulation on epidermal functions perturbed by an EGFRI. Here, we show that dWAT plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of cutaneous toxicities induced by EGFR inhibition. Experiments with HFD feeding and DCA injection have shown that dWAT is required to maintain skin homeostasis during EGFR inhibition. Indeed, topical application of rosiglitazone to EGFRI-treated rats prevents the onset of rash and ameliorates the symptoms. Additionally, based on the results obtained from the tumor-bearing nude mice, topical application of rosiglitazone gel did not alter the antitumor effect of afatinib. Therefore, PPARγ agonists may represent a promising new therapeutic strategy in the treatment of EGFRI-related skin disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

What is the percentage of rats developing rash grade 1, 2 or 3? Are there any other side effects of Afa treatment (diarrhea, lethality)?</p><p>Figure 1: The authors need to better describe their skin inflammation model. Is the rash hair follicle bound? What is the composition and location of the immune cell infiltrate and which cytokines and chemokines are dominant in the skin? Does the rash occur also with an specific EGFR inhibitor instead of the broad ErbB family inhibitor Afa (e.g. Erlotinib). Moreover, does the rash develop only in shaved areas or also in unshaved areas of the back skin? This should be clarified as a recent study associated EGFRi-mediated skin rash development with hair regrowth (Klufa et.)</p><p>Figure 1G: The authors show a correlation between rash grade and dWAT thickness. Is there a correlation to body weight? Rats show reduced food intake after Afa treatment (Suppl. Figure 1B). Could this be the cause for the reduction in dWAT? How does dWAT in rats react to fasting?</p><p>Does shaving have any effect on Afa induced dWAT reduction? Are similar changes observed in unshaved skin?</p><p>Figure 1 E,F, Suppl. Figure 1C,-R: In these figures the labelling is unclear. The authors are labelling the columns Grade 0-3. Have all these animals been harvested on day 10 as mentioned in the methods section? Does grade 0 mean &quot;before&quot; Afa? What do the &quot;control&quot; samples then correspond to, since they also are assigned to rash grades?</p><p>Figure 1H-J: PPARγ is strongly downregulated in the skin of Afa treated rats, but the KEGG Pparg signaling pathway is among the top 10 enriched pathways. How do the authors explain this discrepancy? It would be helpful to show all gene changes of the pathway and verify some gene changes on the protein level (e.g.: IHC). Where are these data from? No explanation or citation to a previous study can be found in the manuscript.</p><p>Figure 2C and D: How do the authors take samples one day before the rash during the 10 day Afa treatment? How long have the rats been treated with Afa at the 1 day after rash timepoint?</p><p>Figure 2E: Authors should show the full timeline of the pictures (also the controls) and provide a quantification of adipocytes from each timepoint.</p><p>Figure 3A: These experiments need to be quantified in addition to the representative pictures.</p><p>Figure 3C: How often has this experiment been repeated? Some changes are difficult to see. All the Western Blots throughout the manuscript should be quantified to be able to interpret these results: e.g. the claimed reduction of pAkt is not really visible and is also seen in the controls at day 9.</p><p>Figure 3D: The population of adipocyte progenitors is not very well demarcated. It has been shown that among the CD34+CD29+ cells in the skin only a subpopulation is adipogenic, and this proportion is also depending on the hair cycle (Festa et al.,). The authors should stain also for CD24 and/or Sca1 to more precisely specify the proportion of adipogenic cells. The same accounts for Figure S7 B, D. (Figure S7D: it does not make sense to depict cells that are not there as MFI = 0):</p><p>Figure 3F: The authors claim that <italic>S. aureus</italic> outgrowth is because of impaired adipogenesis (text line 418). This is however an overstatement since a large number of cells (especially keratinocytes) in the skin have been shown to be able to produce antimicrobial factors that might cause this result. S. aureus outgrowth is a hallmark of EGFR-I induced skin inflammation and atopic dermatitis in general. The authors have no mechanistic claim that adipocytes are influencing the bacterial superinfection in this setting. The results are merely a correlation and a comparison of rodents with skin inflammation and without.</p><p>Figure 3G: Same as with Figure 3F: This represents a correlation with the general skin inflammation rather than a mechanistic explanation involving the adipocytes. Both statements (Figure 3G and H) should be ideally checked using a adipocyte specific cre line in a mouse model. Furthermore EGFR deletion in keratinocytes alone using K5-cre was enough to induce a dramatic <italic>S. aureus</italic> mediated dysbiosis and hair loss in mice (Klufa et al.,). The loss of adipocytes might still contribute to these effects but are not necessary.</p><p>Figure 3H: here EGFR, pEGFR and ERK staining of adipocytes and their respective reduction after Afa treatment should also be shown.</p><p>Figure 3I: the quantification is missing. how many HFs have been counted to be able to make this statement?</p><p>Figure S4C: In the text (line 444) the authors claim that there is a correlation between high levels of C18 FAs and increased lipolysis without showing any difference in the levels of this FA. This statement should be corrected. The same accounts for the statement in lines 526-7.</p><p>Figure 4H-K: Here the authors show in a complex in vitro series of assays that supernatants of Afa treated HaCat cells induce activation of dFB and their supernatant then induces monocyte migration. These results support the main hypothesis of the authors. However, an important information is missing about how this experiment has been performed. Have the supernatants been transferred directly or diluted? Would the supernatant of HaCat cells be able to induce migration directly?</p><p>Figure 5: In this figure the authors show that pre-treatment with HFD can rescue rats from the weight loss phenotype and partially rescue from the rash phenotype of Afa induced dWAT loss. The authors show here that this also results in changes in the immune cell composition in blood. To confirm the hypothesis of the authors, analysis of the immune cell infiltrate of the skin should be performed by FACS and IHC. This also accounts for Figure S6. In addition to cytokine receptors a cytokine and chemokine profile would give more information about rash severity.</p><p>The labelling of Figure 5 in the text and figure legend is not in correctly assigned</p><p>Figure 6: Here the authors show that prophylactic treatment of rats with Rosi can partially rescue from skin rash. These data are very promising. However, a more specific analysis of the parameters that have been shown before to be relevant for the skin rash such as IL-6 or monocyte infiltrate is missing. A therapeutic rather than prophylactic approach would also be an interesting and clinically relevant addition to this figure.</p><p>Figure S8: To show whether changes in rash severity would correspond to alterations in the anti-tumor response the authors treated nude mice bearing s.c. tumors with Afa or Afa + Rosi, could however detect no difference. However, the authors do not show, whether there was any induction of rash in this model, they only show weight loss. It has been published that EGFRi does not induce rash in adult mice. Therefore a similar experiment should be performed in rats.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72443.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Figure 1: A timeline of the development of rash after Afa treatment is missing at the beginning.

In the revised manuscript, we added the development process and rash grade percentages in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C based on seven experiments. The total number of rats was 39. According to our data, rats began to develop rash at day 3, while 28.21% of rats had grade 1 rash at day 4. Until day 7, almost all rats developed rash, 23.08% of which were grade 2. Grade 3 rash started to come out at day 8 and became more prevalent in the next two days.</p><p>Diarrhea is very common in Afa-treated rats (100%), corresponding to the high incidence rate in clinical patients (70%-95%) (Park et al., 2016; Sequist et al., 2013; Soria et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2014). According to our statistical data, the incidence rate of lethality was only 2.56% (1 out of 39).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1: The authors need to better describe their skin inflammation model.

We have conducted additional experiments to better describe the skin rash model, especially the hair eruption effect.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we provided IHC results of several immune cells reported playing important roles in EGFRi-induced skin inflammation, including macrophage, mast cell, monocyte, and T cell. Consistent with the phenotypes in human skin biopsies and EGFR knockout mice models (Lichtenberger et al., 2013; Mascia et al., 2013), the rats’ skin showed enrichment of multiple inflammatory cells in the dermis (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F). The cytokine expression file also showed a similar tendency with human biopsies and mouse models (Lichtenberger et al., 2013; Mascia et al., 2013). As shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1G, Afa dramatically increased the expression of proinflammatory chemokines such as <italic>Ccl2</italic>, <italic>Ccl5</italic>, <italic>Cxcl1</italic>, <italic>Cxcl2</italic>, and <italic>Cxcl3</italic>.</p><p>The rash can also be induced by many specific Erbb1 inhibitors. All three generations of EGFR inhibitors in the clinic have very high incidence rates of cutaneous toxicity (Supplementary file 1). In the revised version, we provided rash models induced by both first-generation EGFRi, Erlotinib, Gefitinib, and the third-generation EGFRi, Osimertinib. As shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, the rash caused by Erlotinib, Gefitinib, and Osimertinib had the same phenotypes with Afatinib-induced rash.</p><p>In a recent study focusing on the effect of hair eruption on rash occurrence (Klufa et al., 2019), hair eruption-caused barrier defects have an important role in inducing rash phenotypes. Using waxing and tape stripping to remove the hair of mice could immediately induce de novo hair eruption. Mice with hair-removing had abnormal phenotypes of rash, including hair growth retardation and increased cytokine expression, whereas normal adult mice couldn’t show any barrier defects and inflammation during Erlotinib treatment. We conducted additional experiments (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). In our rat model, there was a similar situation. Shaving also had a significant impact on rash progress that the skin rash occurred earlier and the skin rash was more severe on shaved back skin than on the unshaved area (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Nevertheless, the unshaved area still developed abnormal erythema (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A) upon the Afatinib administration. These results show that the rat model shares the similar symptoms and disease development time course with rash in humans and other rodent models, which provided a feasible model to study EGFRi-induced cutaneous toxicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1G: The authors show a correlation between rash grade and dWAT thickness.

However, there is no research focusing on the effect of fasting/weight loss treatment on dWAT. One research studied the effect of fasting on perigonadal adipose tissue found that fasting-induced lipolysis and decreased the adipocyte size (Kosteli et al., 2010). Decreased body weight and appetite could accompany with EGFRi therapy (supplementary file 1) (Park et al., 2016; Sequist et al., 2013; Soria et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2014). It could be a systematic effect caused by EGFRi or a result of multiple side effects including rash, diarrhea, vomiting, and stomatitis, etc. In addition, epidermal knockout EGFR mice showed a congenital dWAT reduction (Mascia et al., 2013). Thus, we think it is reasonable to hypothesize that body weight/food intake change had effects on dWAT, but it is inadequate to establish a direct and clear connection in the setting of EGFRi treatment.</p><p>There is evidence that dWAT plays an important role in maintaining thermal homeostasis. Mice housed at 31°C for 5 days displaced thinner dWAT layers compared to mice housed at constant temperature (21°C), while the cold stress imposed by housing at 4°C did not increase the dWAT layer (Kasza et al., 2014). In the revised manuscript, we provided additional experiments. We conducted histopathological examinations to investigate the effect of shaving on dWAT. In the unshaved areas, it seemed like their dWAT was a bit thinner at the initial time but without significant difference compared to the shaved areas (Figure 1—figure supplement 2C, D). This result might be due to the shaving-induced cold stress. In addition, the cold stress simultaneously began with the Afa treatment. We noted that dWAT in the unshaved areas also showed a similar decrease trend under long-term Afa treatment (Figure 1—figure supplement 2C, D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 E,F, Suppl. Figure 1C,-R: In these figures the labelling is unclear. The authors are labelling the columns Grade 0-3. Have all these animals been harvested on day 10 as mentioned in the methods section? Does grade 0 mean &quot;before&quot; Afa? What do the &quot;control&quot; samples then correspond to, since they also are assigned to rash grades?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the labelling issue. To make it clearer, we supplemented a treatment scheme (Figure 1—figure supplement 1H). All animals received Afa treatment on Day 1, three rats were harvested at each rash grade time point. The time points of different rash grades were confirmed by statistical data from seven separate experiments (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). In this figure, rats in grade 0 mean the control rats, they were harvested at day 0 without Afa treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1H-J: PPARγ is strongly downregulated in the skin of Afa treated rats, but the KEGG Pparg signaling pathway is among the top 10 enriched pathways. How do the authors explain this discrepancy? It would be helpful to show all gene changes of the pathway and verify some gene changes on the protein level (e.g.: IHC). Where are these data from? No explanation or citation to a previous study can be found in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The KEGG enrichment represents the most significant changed 10 pathways. It doesn’t distinguish whether one pathway is upregulated or downregulated. To support the transcriptome data, we also conducted IHC staining of two important genes in PPAR signaling. The results showed that the protein level of PPARγ and Perilipin-2 agreed with the gene changes (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). The transcriptome data is from a previous study which is still under review, so it cannot be cited yet. Thus, we decided to remove Figure 1I and 1J.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2C and D: How do the authors take samples one day before the rash during the 10 day Afa treatment? How long have the rats been treated with Afa at the 1 day after rash timepoint?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the lack of experimental details. We added the method at line 614. We harvested the rats according to our statistical data (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). The mean time for rash occurrence is day 4, so we sacrificed rats one day before rash at day 3, and one day after rash at day 5 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1H). All rats received a 10-day treatment except rats that have been sacrificed previously.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2E: Authors should show the full timeline of the pictures (also the controls) and provide a quantification of adipocytes from each timepoint.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this advice. In the revised manuscript, we provided the full timeline for all three groups (Ctrl, Afa, Afa+Rosi) and the quantification of both attached and dedifferentiated cells (Figure 2E to 2G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3A: These experiments need to be quantified in addition to the representative pictures.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for reminding us about the quantification. In the revised version, we supplemented the area quantification of oil red (Figure 3B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3C: How often has this experiment been repeated? Some changes are difficult to see. All the Western Blots throughout the manuscript should be quantified to be able to interpret these results: e.g. the claimed reduction of pAkt is not really visible and is also seen in the controls at day 9.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We repeated this experiment five to eight times, replaced the previous data with obvious blots, and quantified the western blots. The inhibition and activation effects of Afa and Rosi on pAKT1 and pAKT2 were not synchronal with each other (Figure 3D and 3E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3D: The population of adipocyte progenitors is not very well demarcated. It has been shown that among the CD34+CD29+ cells in the skin only a subpopulation is adipogenic, and this proportion is also depending on the hair cycle (Festa et al.,). The authors should stain also for CD24 and/or Sca1 to more precisely specify the proportion of adipogenic cells. The same accounts for Figure S7 B, D. (Figure S7D: it does not make sense to depict cells that are not there as MFI = 0):</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that among CD34+CD29+ cells there is only a subpopulation that is adipogenic. But there are no applicable FACS antibodies of Sca1 and CD24 for rats, and no research about dWAT has been reported on rats yet. However, there was a research using CD34+CD45-CD31- profile to identify the adipocyte precursor cells from retroperitoneal AT of rats (Spinedi and Giovambattista, 2016). Therefore, we had to use the CD31- CD45- CD34+ CD29+ subgroup to roughly evaluate the APs. For MFI evaluation, we thank the reviewer for pointing out that MFI=0 is not appropriate to describe cells without any fluorescence signals, so we deleted this figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3F: The authors claim that <italic>S. aureus</italic> outgrowth is because of impaired adipogenesis (text line 418). This is however an overstatement since a large number of cells (especially keratinocytes) in the skin have been shown to be able to produce antimicrobial factors that might cause this result. S. aureus outgrowth is a hallmark of EGFR-I induced skin inflammation and atopic dermatitis in general. The authors have no mechanistic claim that adipocytes are influencing the bacterial superinfection in this setting. The results are merely a correlation and a comparison of rodents with skin inflammation and without.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for pointing this important point out. We tried to establish the relationship between <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection and EGFRi-induced rash based on a well-accepted study from Lingjuan Zhang (Zhang et al., 2015). They reported that adipose precursor cells secret antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin during differentiation to against <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. Mice with impaired adipogenesis were more susceptible to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. This conclusion gave us some insights into the relationship between <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection and EGFRi-induced skin inflammation. Unfortunately, the anti-CAMP antibody was made by the author’s lab and there are no mature products that can recognize CAMP in rats. To provide more mechanistic evidences, we conducted qPCR experiments to study the transcriptional level of the <italic>Camp</italic> gene both in dWAT and dFB cells isolated from rat skin (Figure 3I and 3J). dWAT in Afa group showed a lower expression level of <italic>Camp</italic> compared with control group. In addition, in different differentiation stages of dFB in vitro, transcriptional levels of <italic>Camp</italic> were decreased by Afa treatment while increased by Rosi. In summary, the data we collected depending on the currently available technologies could justify the causal relationship between EGFRi-induced dWAT reduction and <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection to some extent. However, we agree with the reviewer that this conclusion needs more direct evidence. Thus, in the revised manuscript, we have edited our writing to make the statement not that strong (line 281).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3G: Same as with Figure 3F: This represents a correlation with the general skin inflammation rather than a mechanistic explanation involving the adipocytes. Both statements (Figure 3G and H) should be ideally checked using a adipocyte specific cre line in a mouse model. Furthermore EGFR deletion in keratinocytes alone using K5-cre was enough to induce a dramatic <italic>S. aureus</italic> mediated dysbiosis and hair loss in mice (Klufa et al.,). The loss of adipocytes might still contribute to these effects but are not necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment that adipocyte-specific knockout mouse model will be more appropriate to study the role of adipocytes. The results and conclusions of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection and hair follicles were mostly based on previous research. These results need more specific and direct experiments to verify the causality with EGFR inhibition. We are seeking the opportunity for cooperation to build a dermal adipocyte knockout mouse model platform and hope to investigate the specific roles of dermal adipocytes in the future.</p><p>As for the epidermal EGFR deleted mice models, they represented similar cutaneous phenotypes with EGFRi-induced skin toxicity. There were hair follicles growth retardation, neutrophilic pustules, keratin plugs, microbiome outgrowth, etc. But the disadvantages of this mice model are the immense abnormal symptoms and high lethality. Most EGFR<sup>△ep</sup> mutant mice died shortly after birth, and only less than 10% lived longer than 3 weeks (Lichtenberger et al., 2013). In addition, from the histopathological examination, we noticed that KO mice also showed a decrease of dWAT layer (Mascia et al., 2013). Combined with our finding that the inflammatory epidermis can promote lipolysis of dWAT. Therefore, we think that skin disease caused by EGFRi is a multifactorial condition, both keratinocytes and adipocytes contribute to its process, and maybe a mutual connection between these two cell types also plays an important role.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3H: here EGFR, pEGFR and ERK staining of adipocytes and their respective reduction after Afa treatment should also be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.

We performed a mass spectrometry analysis of skin tissues from Ctrl and Afa groups after 3-day treatment to confirm the releasing of C18 FFAs. The result showed an increased tendency of C18:2 and other FFAs in the Afa group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). However, this increase had no significant statistic difference. This might due to the interference of sebaceous gland and dermal adipocytes. Therefore, we also adjusted the descriptions in the revised manuscript to make this statement not that strong (line 395).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>C18 concentrations in skin tissues from Ctrl and Afa groups after 3-day treatment.</title><p><italic>n</italic>=3.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72443-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4H-K: Here the authors show in a complex in vitro series of assays that supernatants of Afa treated HaCat cells induce activation of dFB and their supernatant then induces monocyte migration. These results support the main hypothesis of the authors. However, an important information is missing about how this experiment has been performed. Have the supernatants been transferred directly or diluted? Would the supernatant of HaCat cells be able to induce migration directly?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. In the revised submission, we added more details of this experiment (Figure 4 legend, lines 324-326). The supernatants were transferred directly to the dFB-cultured wells. To ensure the nutrients for cell growth, we replaced a new culture medium of HaCaT cells before adding drugs. After 24 h treatment, the medium was transferred to dFB for another 24 h incubation. Thus, the total time for this culture medium was 48 h. In addition, the media used for HaCaT and dFB cell culture were both DMEM/high glucose, so it could be directly transferred. The supernatant of HaCat cells was able to induce migration directly. We performed the migration experiment treated directly by supernatants of Afa-treated HaCaT cells, it increased the monocyte migration. Nevertheless, we also used the undifferentiated-dFB to make a comparison with differentiated-dFB, the undifferentiated-dFB could approximately represent the effect of HaCaT alone. Compared with undifferentiated dFBs, the induction of migration was remarkable in differentiated dFBs (Figure 4O and 4P).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: In this figure the authors show that pre-treatment with HFD can rescue rats from the weight loss phenotype and partially rescue from the rash phenotype of Afa induced dWAT loss. The authors show here that this also results in changes in the immune cell composition in blood. To confirm the hypothesis of the authors, analysis of the immune cell infiltrate of the skin should be performed by FACS and IHC. This also accounts for Figure S6. In addition to cytokine receptors a cytokine and chemokine profile would give more information about rash severity.</p></disp-quote><p>For the revised manuscript, we performed additional immune cell and cytokine IHC for both HFD and DCA experiments. The results have been incorporated into the revised manuscript. As shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, the infiltration of macrophages, mast cells, monocytes, and T cells was decreased in HFD-fed rats. The expression of some inflammatory cytokines, such as IL6 and CCL2 showed a lower level in HFD-treated rats (Figure 5—figure supplement 1E). In the DCA experiment, infiltration of macrophages and monocytes showed a significant increase in DCA group, while the difference of T cells and mastocytes between vehicle and DCA was not very obvious (Figure 5—figure supplement 2J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The labelling of Figure 5 in the text and figure legend is not in correctly assigned</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. In the revised manuscript, we corrected this kind of mistakes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6: Here the authors show that prophylactic treatment of rats with Rosi can partially rescue from skin rash. These data are very promising. However, a more specific analysis of the parameters that have been shown before to be relevant for the skin rash such as IL-6 or monocyte infiltrate is missing. A therapeutic rather than prophylactic approach would also be an interesting and clinically relevant addition to this figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the advice. We conducted additional experiments, including the T cell infiltration, mastocyte cell infiltration, and IL6 infiltration. As shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1G, Rosi could significantly reduce the inflammatory infiltration. We also performed a transcriptional experiment of inflammatory cytokines, Rosi showed obvious transcription inhibition on these genes (Figure 6—figure supplement 1F).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the therapeutic treatment has very promising application potential in the clinic. Therefore, we performed a therapeutic experiment in the revised version. After rats developed grade 1 rash, Rosi or Vehicle gel began to apply to the back skin of the rats. After nine-day treatment, rats that received Rosi had lower grade rash and higher body weight than the Vehicle group (Figure 6—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S8: To show whether changes in rash severity would correspond to alterations in the anti-tumor response the authors treated nude mice bearing s.c. tumors with Afa or Afa + Rosi, could however detect no difference. However, the authors do not show, whether there was any induction of rash in this model, they only show weight loss. It has been published that EGFRi does not induce rash in adult mice. Therefore a similar experiment should be performed in rats.</p></disp-quote><p>The tumor study was performed in immunodeficient hosts and the immune-mediated process is important to induce cutaneous toxicity. Thus, the effect of Rosi on blocking rash could not be assessed. In addition, there are no suitable immune-deficient rat species, and normal rat species need rat-derived tumor cells to develop tumors, which is also very challenging to access. Considering the purpose of this study is to directly investigate the effect on the tumor, we applied Afa and Rosi treatment on nude mice.</p><p>References</p><p>Kasza I, Hernando D, Roldán-Alzate A, Alexander CM, Reeder SB. 2016.
