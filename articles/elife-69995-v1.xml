Higher-than-expected <italic>brain age</italic> is thought partially to reflect above-average rate of brain aging. Here, we explicitly tested this assumption in two independent large test datasets (UK Biobank [main] and Lifebrain [replication]; longitudinal observations ≈ 2750 and 4200) by assessing the relationship between cross-sectional and longitudinal estimates of <italic>brain age. Brain age</italic> models were estimated in two different training datasets (n ≈ 38,000 [main] and 1800 individuals [replication]) based on brain structural features. The results showed no association between cross-sectional <italic>brain age</italic> and the rate of brain change measured longitudinally. Rather, <italic>brain age</italic> in adulthood was associated with the congenital factors of birth weight and polygenic scores of <italic>brain age,</italic> assumed to reflect a constant, lifelong influence on brain structure from early life. The results call for nuanced interpretations of cross-sectional indices of the aging brain and question their validity as markers of ongoing within-person changes of the aging brain. Longitudinal imaging data should be preferred whenever the goal is to understand individual change trajectories of brain and cognition in aging.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Scientists who study the brain and aging are keen to find an effective way to measure brain health, which could help identify people at risk for dementia or memory problems. One popular marker is ‘brain age’. This measurement uses a brain scan to estimate a person’s chronological age, then compares the estimated brain age to the person’s actual age to determine whether their brain is aging faster or slower than expected for their age.</p><p>However, since brain age relies on one brain scan taken at one point in time, it is not clear whether it really measures brain aging or if it might capture brain differences that have been present throughout the individual’s life. Studies comparing individual brain scans over several years would be necessary to know for sure.</p><p>Now, Vidal-Piñeiro et al. show that the brain-age measurement does not reflect faster brain aging. In the experiments, the researchers compared repeated brain scans of thousands of individuals over 40 years of age. The experiments showed that deviations from normative brain age detected in a single scan reflected early life differences more than changes in the brain over time. For example, people with older-looking brains were more likely to have had a low birth weight or to have a combination of genes associated with having an older looking brain.</p><p>Vidal-Piñeiro et al. show that brain age mostly reflects a pre-existing brain condition rather than brain aging. The experiments also suggest that genetics and early brain development likely have a strong impact on brain health throughout life. Future studies trying to test or develop brain-aging measurements should use serial measurements to track brain changes over time.</p></abstract><kwd-group

used to capture interindividual differences in the structure, function, and neurochemistry of the aging brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cole and Franke, 2017</xref>). The biological age of the brain is estimated typically by applying machine learning to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to predict chronological age. The difference between predicted <italic>brain age</italic> and actuackal chronological age (<italic>brain age delta</italic>) reflects the deviation from the expected norm and is often used to index brain health. <italic>Brain age delta</italic> has been related to brain, mental, and cognitive health, and proved valuable in predicting outcomes such as mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cole et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cole and Franke, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elliott et al., 2019</xref>). To different degrees, it is assumed that <italic>brain age delta</italic> reflects past and ongoing neurobiological aging processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cole and Franke, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elliott et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franke and Gaser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, it is common to interpret positive <italic>brain age deltas</italic> as reflecting a steeper rate of brain aging; often dubbed as accelerated aging (here both terms are used interchangeably) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cole and Franke, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franke and Gaser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The assumption that <italic>brain age delta</italic> reflects an ongoing process of faster or slower neurobiological aging implies that there should be a relationship between cross-sectional and longitudinal estimates of <italic>brain age</italic>. Alternatively, individual deviations from the expected <italic>brain age</italic> could capture constant interindividual differences in brain structure that remain stable throughout the lifespan, reflecting early genetic and environmental influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deary, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elliott et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walhovd et al., 2016</xref>). These perspectives offer fundamentally divergent interpretations of higher <italic>brain age (delta</italic>) in groups experiencing specific life events, brain disorders, and other medical problems. Here, we tested whether <italic>brain age</italic> – derived from structural T1-weighted (T1w) morphological features – is related to accelerated brain aging, early-life factors, or a combination of both.</p><p>If interindividual variations of <italic>brain age</italic> reflect variations in rates of ongoing brain aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), cross-sectional <italic>brain age delta</italic> should be positively associated with brain decline measured longitudinally. Here, we quantified individual brain change as the annual rate of change of <italic>brain age delta</italic> (<italic>brain age delta<sub>long</sub></italic>). In addition, we also assessed brain change with a composite score of structural brain change as obtained using principal component (PC) analysis of change and change in the different <italic>raw</italic> structural brain features. These analyses were performed in two independent cohorts, both divided into a cross-sectional model generation (training) and a longitudinal, hypothesis testing (test) dataset. If cross-sectional variations in <italic>brain age</italic> reflect differences in brain structure established early in life, one should observe a relationship between <italic>brain age</italic> and influences associated with stable, lifelong effects on brain structure. Here, we selected two congenital factors: self-reported birth weight and polygenic scores for <italic>brain age</italic> (PGS-BA), for which lifelong effects on age-related phenotypes have been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Walhovd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walhovd et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Birth weight reflects normal variation in body (and brain) size as well as prenatal conditions, whereas PGS-BA quantifies genetic liability of having a higher brain age.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Theoretical expectations and study characteristics.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Three hypothetical trajectories leading to higher <italic>brain age delta</italic>.

Rather, <italic>brain age</italic> seems to reflect early-life influences on brain structure, and only to a very modest degree reflects actual rate of brain change in middle and old adulthood. A lack of relationship between <italic>brain age</italic> and rate of brain aging could potentially be explained – although not investigated in the present study – by the effect of circumscribed events such as isolated insults or detrimental lifestyles that occurred in the past, resulting in higher, but not accelerating, <italic>brain age</italic>. Yet, variations in <italic>brain age</italic> could equally reflect congenital and early-life differences and show lifelong stability. Cross-sectional <italic>brain age</italic> studies are ill-suited to disentangle these sources of variation but are often interpreted in line with the former. This assumes that variation in <italic>brain age</italic> largely results from the accumulation of damage and insults during the lifespan, with similar starting points for everyone. An exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elliott et al., 2019</xref>, who found that middle-aged individuals with higher <italic>brain age</italic> already exhibited poorer cognitive function and brain health at age 3 years. This fits a robust corpus of literature showing effects of lifelong, stable influences as indexed by childhood IQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karama et al., 2014</xref>), genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walhovd et al., 2020</xref>), and neonatal characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walhovd et al., 2016</xref>) on brain and cognitive variation in old age.</p><p>It has been argued that at a population level <italic>brain age</italic> captures modest <italic>rate of aging</italic> effects because <italic>brain age delta</italic> spreads with increasing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we found a similar degree of <italic>delta</italic> spreading in our <italic>brain age</italic> metrics. Likewise, our secondary analyses suggested <italic>brain age</italic> related to change in a few specific neuroimaging features, that is, ventricular expansion and white matter hypointensities, though not to any composite score. Thus, both results are compatible and converge towards <italic>brain age</italic> as a real but relatively modest metric for capturing ongoing brain change. The largest part of interindividual variation in <italic>brain age delta</italic>, instead, largely originates before the sample lower bound (⪝ 18 and 45 years for the Lifebrain and UK Biobank datasets). Also, associations of <italic>brain age</italic> with other bodily markers of aging or with cognitive decline have yielded mixed support for cross-sectional <italic>brain age</italic> as a marker of individual differences in brain aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cole et al., 2018</xref>, p. 201; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elliott et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franke and Gaser, 2012</xref>). Other multivariate approaches might be better equipped for capturing the dynamics of the aging brain. Using independent component analysis, a recent study found that – compared to a single <italic>brain age</italic> score – distinct modes of multimodal brain variation better reflect both the genetic make-up and ongoing aging effects, with a subset of <italic>modes</italic> showing significant spreading of <italic>delta</italic> with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2020</xref>). The degree to which <italic>brain age</italic> reflects ongoing effects of aging likely depends on the specific features, modalities, and algorithms employed, and is constrained by model properties such as prediction accuracy and homoscedasticity. Yet, without longitudinal imaging, one should not interpret brain age as accelerated aging. Our results align with theoretical claims and empirical observations that covariance structures capturing differences between individuals do not necessarily generalize to covariance structures within individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Molenaar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schmiedek et al., 2020</xref>). From a measurement theory perspective, our results suggest that cross-sectional <italic>brain age</italic> has low validity as an index of brain aging – despite having high reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franke and Gaser, 2012</xref>) – as only a small portion of variance is associated with the trait of interest alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zuo et al., 2019</xref>). Most variance is rather associated with other factors that vary systematically across individuals, some of which are already present at birth.</p><p>The results further showed that birth weight, which reflects differences in genetic propensities and prenatal environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gielen et al., 2008</xref>), explained a modest portion of the variance in <italic>brain age</italic>. Subtle variations in birth weight are associated with brain structure early in life and present throughout the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walhovd et al., 2016</xref>). This association should be considered as <italic>proof of concept</italic> that the metric of <italic>brain age</italic> reflects the past more than presently ongoing events in the morphological structure of the brain. This was confirmed by the consistent association between PGS-BA and <italic>brain age delta</italic> but not with <italic>brain age delta</italic> change. Since PGS-BA was computed based on cross-sectional <italic>brain age delta</italic>, this relationship may not be surprising, but still suggests a different genetic foundation for longitudinal <italic>brain age</italic>. These findings link with evidence that brain development is strongly influenced by a genetic architecture that, in interaction with environmental factors, leads to substantial, longlasting effects on brain structure. By contrast, aging mechanisms seem to be more related to limitations of maintenance and repair functions and have a more stochastic nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kirkwood, 2005</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations and technical considerations</title><p>We used large training datasets to estimate the <italic>brain age</italic> models and the PGS scores leading to robust PGS-BA and <italic>brain age</italic> estimates. Self-reported birth weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nilsen et al., 2017</xref>) and cross-sectional <italic>brain age</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franke and Gaser, 2012</xref>) are highly reliable measures; thus, our analyses are well-powered to detect small effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zuo et al., 2019</xref>). The reliability of <italic>brain age delta<sub>long</sub></italic> is, however, unknown. Strictly speaking, <italic>brain age delta</italic> is a prediction error from a model that maximizes the prediction of age in cross-sectional data and thus partially also reflects noise. Given that <italic>delta</italic><sub><italic>long</italic></sub> is estimated as the difference between two <italic>delta</italic><sub><italic>cross</italic></sub> estimates, it will hence have higher noise than the cross-sectional estimates, reducing the power in identifying potential associations between longitudinal and cross-sectional delta. This may be compounded by the relatively short interscan interval in the UK Biobank (≈2 years). However, our sample size (n &gt; 1200) ensures that the tests performed in this study are well-powered to detect small effects, even if <italic>delta<sub>long</sub></italic> has mediocre reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zuo et al., 2019</xref>). Further, replication of our null results in the Lifebrain sample with more observations and longer follow-up times reduces the likelihood of noise as the main factor behind the lack of relationship. Furthermore, previous studies have found that changes in <italic>brain age</italic> are partly heritable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brouwer et al., 2021</xref>) and relate to, for instance, cardiometabolic risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beck, 2021</xref>), suggesting that it captures biologically relevant signals (i.e., has predictive validity), although with substantially different origins from cross-sectional <italic>brain age</italic>. Although the reliability of <italic>delta<sub>long</sub></italic> needs to be formally tested, the null relationship between <italic>delta<sub>cross</sub></italic> and <italic>delta<sub>long</sub></italic> does not seem to be a result of a low-powered test.</p><p>We speculate that our results partially generalize to other normative and residual-based modeling approaches, as well as to developmental samples. There is considerable evidence in the literature that birth weight and genetic risk for neurodegenerative conditions affect brain structure from early life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raznahan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walhovd et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walhovd et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Brain age</italic> models are related to other models such as normative brain charts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bethlehem, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2020</xref>) – akin to normative anthropometric charts – the main difference being that <italic>brain age</italic> models predict, rather than control for, age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marquand et al., 2019</xref>). Both types of models produce normative brain scores, which are uncorrelated with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butler et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, caution is required when interpreting these scores as indices of brain aging without availability of longitudinal data. Developmental samples may, however, reflect slightly stronger relationships between cross-sectional <italic>brain age delta</italic> and ongoing brain change as brain changes during early-life development typically occur at a faster pace than in middle or later life. Similarly, for specific disease groups such as Alzheimer’s disease patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franke and Gaser, 2012</xref>), interindividual brain variation in <italic>brain age</italic> might reflect to a greater extent prevailing loss of brain structure. Moreover, the variance associated with factors other than ongoing development/aging might be more limited in early than later age since influences leading to interindividual variations in brain structure have a shorter span to accumulate. That is, as time from birth increases, chronological age as a marker of individual development is reduced.</p><p>Finally, many genetic and environmental factors relate to lifelong stable differences in <italic>brain age</italic> beyond birth weight and PGS-BA. However, both variables are congenital and show stable associations through the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raznahan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walhovd et al., 2020</xref>) without strong evidence that they relate to brain change after adolescence. Thus, birth weight and PGS-BA are paradigmatic for showing how interindividual differences in <italic>brain age</italic> emerge early in life. The present study does not provide a systematic understanding of these influences but presents a framework for interpreting the impact such measures may exert on age-related phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results call for caution in interpreting brain-derived indices of aging based on cross-sectional MRI data and underscore the need to rely on longitudinal data whenever the goal is to understand the trajectories of brain and cognition in aging.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R Project for Statistical Computing</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001905">SCR_001905</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 3.6.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FreeSurfer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001847">SCR_001847</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 6.0</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants and samples</title><p>The main sample was drawn from the UK Biobank neuroimaging branch (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2016</xref>). 38,682 individuals had MRI available at a single time point and were used as the training dataset. 1372 individuals had longitudinal data and were used as the test dataset.

It revealed that BrainAge scores did not predict within-person aging of the brain taken from the longitudinal data, but did correlate with metrics already occurring at birth, namely birth weight and polygenetic scores. This calls cautions in interpreting cross-sectional BrainAge indices as well as concluding their validity as markers of individual-level brain aging process.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Individual variations in &quot;Brain age&quot; relate to early life factors more than to longitudinal brain change&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Büchel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Xi-Nian Zuo (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Improve terminology precision and interpretation (e.g. early life influence).</p><p>2) Improve manuscript readability significantly (including figures).</p><p>3) Add study limitations and future work (including developing brain).</p><p>4) Introduce measurement theory of individual differences.</p><p>5) Clarify the relationship between brainage and other metrics.</p><p>6) Discuss/clarify the effect size and the possible implications.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Beyond what was summarized in the Public Review, here I note some errors in figures and text so that the authors can fix those, and suggestions for edits that should help with clarity.</p><p>As already mentioned, the purpose of this study is to be applauded as mis- and over-interpretation of cross-sectional data findings as generalizing to true longitudinal change within individuals is a major problem in our field. The increasingly popular use of BrainAge as a metric has only increased this problem. The authors attempt to tests these assumptions was much needed.</p><p>The format of the submission made the manuscript very difficult to parse (and I work immediately in this exact field). Primarily driving this difficult to understand the details of the paper are (1) the extreme brevity of the background/introduction and (2) the unfortunate reverse order of the manuscript sections -- it is always difficult when the results come before the methods or description of variables, but in this particular case, it was extremely disadvantageous. If this is the required journal format, then I guess not much van be done, but it is a hindrance to understanding the study. I found I could not read the Results section on its own and had to flip through to simultaneously read the Methods and Supplements. This was exhausting. Some readers may simply give up. One suggestion (highly recommended) is to utilize the Abstract to at least introduce some specifics about the study, like the variables to be used (morphological structural features instead of brain integrity or brain decline – no one can tell what the study will use as written). Similarly I did not know what polygenic scores were based on or what genetic amalgamation they represented until very far into the paper. Also portions of the intro were not clear on the first read, and only made sense after I finished the whole paper and supplemental info. Some word changes may help?</p><p>Discussion: I thought that calling birth weight and genetics &quot;early-life influences&quot; throughout the paper a bit of an overstatement. Because this calls to mind many environmental things one experiences as a developing child/adolescent and was misleading (esp since things are not defined until very late in the sections, like Method at the end). A more accurate thing to call this would be something that made it clear that these variables represented &quot;at birth indices&quot;. I do think this is a VERY important distinction and keeps the authors from leading the readers into a concept that is vague and perhaps not what is expected from that terminology.</p><p>Some study limitations are always warranted and a thoughtful inclusion. There really aren't any provided here to speak of. As a small example, I wondered what the impact is of very different sample sizes in different tests, but then comparisons across those analyses being made (as in the 770 for the birth weight, vs the 38k and 1372 for the other tests).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Measurement theory of individual differences should be included somewhere to clarify different focuses in terms of its two components: inter-individual (between-subject) variability and intra-individual (within-subject) variability. In theory, cross-sectional data is not enough to separate the two components and thus not good enough for any studies of individual differences, which call longitudinal data in ideal experimental design, to ensure both reliability and validity. Please see some comments in a recent publication (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0655-x).</p><p>2. BrainAge is a recently developed method for normative aging research. What is the relationship between BrainAge and those metrics derived from the growth charts (e.g., height and weight).</p><p>3. I noticed that the effect sizes detected are all small (e.g., the R2 &lt; 0.01). In such large sample, how these weak associations are interpreted in terms of the measurement reliability and validity? What is the potential factors with impacts on the ability of detecting such small effect size?</p><p>4. This work is demonstrated for aging samples, but should be generalizable for developing samples. Please discuss about this point more comprehensively. Some recent work (e.g., https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095927320304965) may be of values.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69995.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Improve terminology precision and interpretation (e.g. early life influence).</p></disp-quote><p>Clarification of terminology is discussed in our response to Reviewer #1, comment #8. Briefly, in the revised version of the manuscript, the term “early-life influences” is replaced with “congenital factors” when referring to birth weight and polygenic scores.

This is explained in detail in the response to Reviewer #1, comment #1.

The relationship between cross-sectional and longitudinal brain age can be understood in the context of the measurement theory of individual differences. Following this account, the results indicate cross-sectional brain age has low validity – despite high reliability – rather reflecting variance related to factors that vary systematically across individuals and that are present early in life.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Clarify the relationship between brainage and other metrics.</p></disp-quote><p>This issue is discussed in response to Reviewer #2, comment #2. Normative brain aging charts are analogous to normative anthropometric growth charts used in pediatrics. Brain age models can be considered a special case of normative brain modeling. The main difference between brain age and normative modeling is that the latter uses the demographic variables to predict – a priori-defined – brain features. The degree to which our results can be extended to normative brain charts is discussed in detail in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Discuss/clarify the effect size and the possible implications.</p></disp-quote><p>This issue is discussed in response to Reviewer #2, comment #3. All the main tests are well-powered to detect small effect sizes and use variables with high reliability. Reliability for longitudinal brain age delta is, however, unknown (and it has to be lower than cross-sectional brain age delta). Even assuming mediocre reliabilities, the tests would have enough power to detect small effect sizes – set aside that most research assumes a moderate-to-high relationship between cross-sectional brain age δ and brain aging. We now discuss the effect sizes and possible power issues in detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Beyond what was summarized in the Public Review, here I note some errors in figures and text so that the authors can fix those, and suggestions for edits that should help with clarity.</p><p>As already mentioned, the purpose of this study is to be applauded as mis- and over-interpretation of cross-sectional data findings as generalizing to true longitudinal change within individuals is a major problem in our field.

The format of the journal specifies an Introduction-Results-Discussion-Methods format. However, the revised version of the manuscript includes your suggestions in the abstract and introduction sections as an attempt to increase readability. The abstract now defines the variables used (“brain structure features”), identifies the test and training datasets, and defines birth weight and polygenic scores of brain age as two congenital factors thought to reflect constant, lifelong influences emerging in early life.

Because this calls to mind many environmental things one experiences as a developing child/adolescent and was misleading (esp since things are not defined until very late in the sections, like Method at the end). A more accurate thing to call this would be something that made it clear that these variables represented &quot;at birth indices&quot;. I do think this is a VERY important distinction and keeps the authors from leading the readers into a concept that is vague and perhaps not what is expected from that terminology.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We agree it is important to disambiguate both terms and that “early-life influences” may be vague. We have replaced it with “congenital factors/indices'' as they refer to traits present from birth. However, both indices represent a proof-of-concept that interindividual variations in cross-sectional brain age delta reflect lifelong influences rooted in the distant past more than presently ongoing events, and thus to some extent can be generalizable to other non-studied factors that may exert a stable influence on age-related brain phenotypes rather than affect the slope of decline. The revised version disambiguates both concepts and discusses to which point the relationship between cross-sectional brain age and the congenital factors can be extrapolated to other congenital and early-life variables.</p><p>In p. 5 (Abstract): “Rather, brain age in adulthood was associated with the congenital factors of birth weight and polygenic scores of brain age, assumed to reflect a constant, lifelong influence on brain structure from early life.”</p><p>In p. 7 (Introduction): “If cross-sectional variations in brain age reflect differences in brain structure established early in life, one should observe a relationship between brain age and influences associated with stable, lifelong effects on brain structure.

A lack of relationship between brain age and rate of brain aging can potentially be explained - although not investigated in the present study - by the effect of circumscribed events such as isolated insults or detrimental lifestyles that occurred in the past resulting in higher, but not accelerating, brain age. Yet, variations in brain age can equally reflect congenital and early-life differences and show lifelong stability.”</p><p>In p. 19 (Discussion): “Finally, many genetic and environmental factors relate to lifelong stable differences in brain age beyond birth weight and PGS-BA.

Thus, birth weight and PGS-BA are paradigmatic for showing how interindividual differences in brain age emerge early in life.

There really aren't any provided here to speak of. As a small example, I wondered what the impact is of very different sample sizes in different tests, but then comparisons across those analyses being made (as in the 770 for the birth weight, vs the 38k and 1372 for the other tests).</p></disp-quote><p>We now include a “Limitations” section. In this section, we discuss the following issues: (1) whether the analyses are well-powered; (2) the extent to which our results can be generalized to other normative modeling approaches and developmental samples (see Reviewer #2, comments #2, #4 for a wider discussion), and (3) whether the relationship between brain age and congenital factors PGS-BA and birth weight can be extended to other congenital and early life factors.</p><p>In pp. 17-9 (Discussion): “We used large training datasets to estimate the brain age models and the PGS scores leading to robust PGS-BA and brain age estimates. Self-reported birth weight (Nilsen et al., 2017) and cross-sectional brain age (Franke and Gaser, 2012) are highly reliable measures; thus, our analyses are well powered to detect small effects (Zuo et al., 2019). The reliability of brain age delta<sub>long</sub> is, however, unknown. Strictly speaking, brain age delta is a prediction error from a model that maximizes the prediction of age in cross-sectional data and thus partially also reflects noise. Given that delta<sub>long</sub> is estimated as the difference between two delta<sub>cross</sub> estimates, it will hence have higher noise than the cross-sectional estimates reducing the power in identifying potential associations between longitudinal and cross-sectional delta; note also the relatively short interscan interval in UK Biobank (≈2y). However, our sample size (n &gt; 1,200) ensures that the tests performed in this study are well-powered to detect small effects, even if delta<sub>long</sub> has mediocre reliability (Zuo et al., 2019). Further, replication of our null results in the Lifebrain sample with more observations and longer follow-up times reduces the likelihood of noise as the main factor behind the lack of relationship. Furthermore, previous studies have found that changes in brain age are partly heritable (Brouwer et al., 2021) and relate to for instance cardiometabolic risk factors (Beck et al., 2021), suggesting that it captures biologically relevant signals (i.e. has predictive validity), although with substantially different origins from cross-sectional brain age. Although the reliability of delta<sub>long</sub> needs to be formally tested, the null relationship between delta<sub>cross</sub> and delta<sub>long</sub> does not seem to be a result of a low-powered test.</p><p>We speculate that our results partially generalize to other normative and residual-based modeling approaches as well as to developmental samples. There is considerable evidence in the literature that birth weight and genetic risk for neurodegenerative conditions affects brain structure from early life (Raznahan et al., 2012; Walhovd et al., 2020, 2016, 2012b). Brain age models are related to other models such as normative brain charts (Bethlehem et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2020) - akin to normative anthropometric charts - the main difference being that brain age models predict, rather than control for, age (Marquand et al., 2019). Both types of models produce normative brain scores, which are uncorrelated with age (Butler et al., 2021). Thus, caution is required when interpreting these scores as indices of brain aging without availability of longitudinal data. Developmental samples may, however, reflect slightly stronger relationships between cross-sectional brain age delta and ongoing brain change as brain changes during early-life development typically occur at a faster pace than in middle or later life. Similarly, for specific disease groups such as Alzheimer’s disease patients (Franke and Gaser, 2012), interindividual brain variation in brain age might reflect to a greater extent prevailing loss of brain structure. Moreover, the variance associated with factors other than ongoing development/aging might be more limited in early than later age, since influences leading to interindividual variations in brain structure have a shorter span to accumulate. That is, as time from birth increases, chronological age as a marker of individual development is reduced.</p><p>Finally, many genetic and environmental factors relate to lifelong stable differences in brain age beyond birth weight and PGS-BA. However, both variables are congenital and show stable associations through the lifespan (Raznahan et al., 2012; Walhovd et al., 2020, 2016) without strong evidence that they relate to brain change after adolescence.

Measurement theory of individual differences should be included somewhere to clarify different focuses in terms of its two components: inter-individual (between-subject) variability and intra-individual (within-subject) variability. In theory, cross-sectional data is not enough to separate the two components and thus not good enough for any studies of individual differences, which call longitudinal data in ideal experimental design, to ensure both reliability and validity. Please see some comments in a recent publication (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0655-x).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. Indeed, the relationship between cross-sectional and longitudinal brain age can be understood in the context of the measurement theory of individual differences (Brandmaier et al., 2018; Zuo et al., 2019). Previous work has shown that cross-sectional brain age is highly reliable (Franke and Gaser, 2012) but its validity – i.e. the proportion of the total variance attributed to the trait of interest alone, that is brain aging – has only been indirectly assessed. In this account, longitudinal brain change can be considered a “gold standard” criterion. We now discuss the findings under the framework of the measurement theory of individual differences.</p><p>p. 16 (discussion): “From a measurement theory perspective, our results suggest that cross-sectional brain age has low validity as an index of brain aging – despite having high reliability (Franke and Gaser, 2012) – as only a small portion of variance is associated with the trait of interest alone (Zuo et al., 2019). Most variance is rather associated with other factors that vary systematically across individuals, some of which are already present at birth.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. BrainAge is a recently developed method for normative aging research. What is the relationship between BrainAge and those metrics derived from the growth charts (e.g., height and weight).</p></disp-quote><p>Normative brain aging charts are analogous to normative anthropometric growth charts used in pediatrics. Brain age models can be considered a special case of normative brain modeling. The main difference between brain age and normative modeling is that the latter uses the demographic variables to predict a priori-defined brain features. Instead, Brain age models invert the approach, predicting age from several brain measures. Traditional normative charts are more easily interpretable than brain age whereas brain age models lead to simple outputs as they condense brain data into a single score (Marquand et al., 2019).</p><p>Both methods lead to scores that characterize the brain features of a given participant with respect to his/her peers (i.e. normative scores). Because age is invariably used in any normative model, both lead to brain measures that are uncorrelated with age (Butler et al., 2021). Researchers often interpret these measures as markers of ongoing brain change. We focused on brain age models as the interpretation of norm-deviation variations as accelerated/delayed aging is more pervasive, possibly due to:</p><p>a) Semantics, and that</p><p>b) The biological variables are selected and weighted based on their association with age. Thus, it is important to determine to which degree all these different metrics quantify advanced or delayed aging. Moreover, our call for caution interpreting these measures is generalizable. We now acknowledge the similarity between brain age models and normative brain models and discuss to what extent our word of caution can be extrapolated across models.</p><p>p. 18 (discussion): “We speculate that our results partially generalize to other normative and residual-based modeling approaches as well as to developmental samples.

I noticed that the effect sizes detected are all small (e.g., the R2 &lt; 0.01). In such large sample, how these weak associations are interpreted in terms of the measurement reliability and validity? What is the potential factors with impacts on the ability of detecting such small effect size?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the question. Your assessment is correct. The significant relationships of birth weight and polygenic risk scores on brain age delta had an effect size of r2 ≈.009 and.02. The effect size of the non-significant relationship between cross-sectional and longitudinal brain age delta was r2 ≤ 0.001. We have little doubt these values stem from true positive and negative tests for the following reasons:</p><p>1) We used cross-sectional brain age delta, polygenic scores (PGS) of brain age, and self-reported birth weight as independent variables. Brain age δ and self-reported birth weight are highly reliable (Franke and Gaser, 2012; Nilsen et al., 2017); thus, not risking regression dilution effects.</p><p>2) We used cross-sectional and longitudinal brain age delta as dependent variables. The cross-sectional brain age delta has very high reliability. To our knowledge, there are no reports of the reliability of the longitudinal brain age delta. However, even if longitudinal brain age delta has a mediocre reliability for (≈ 0.4) – reliability for delta change certainly will be lower than for cross-sectional data – our test would still have enough power to detect small effects due to a relatively large sample size in both the main and the analyses (n &gt; 1.200) (Zuo et al., 2019). The remaining tests use relatively large samples and involve measures with high reliability and thus are well-powered to detect very small effects.</p><p>Regarding the validity of the variables, longitudinal brain age delta has high validity as a measure of brain change while the validity of cross-sectional brain age delta as an index of brain aging is precisely a research question of the present study as discussed in Reviewer #1, comment #1. Likewise, the validity of PGS of brain age and self-reported birth weight as congenital factors is also high. Of course, both indices only capture a tiny fraction of the genetic and environmental influences that lead to interindividual differences in brain structure already in early life. Thus, the PGS and birth weight tests offer proof-of-concept that interindividual variance in brain age delta is more influenced by early life factors than by ongoing processes, rather than quantifying or approximating the total amount of variance in brain age delta that is explained by congenital factors. We now include a succinct summary of this explanation in the limitations section.</p><p>In pp 17-8 (discussion): “We used large training datasets to estimate the brain age models and the PGS scores leading to robust PGS-BA and brain age estimates.

This work is demonstrated for aging samples, but should be generalizable for developing samples. Please discuss about this point more comprehensively. Some recent work (e.g., https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095927320304965) may be of values.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed. Both congenital factors (PGS of brain age δ and birth weight) will be associated with cross-sectional brain age delta in developmental samples. Previous research has found that other congenital indices such as preterm birth relate to brain age during childhood and adolescence. Other studies have found stable, lifelong effects of birth weight on brain structural features (Raznahan et al., 2012; Walhovd et al., 2012; Wheater et al., 2021), and stable effects of genetic factors of Alzheimer’s Disease on hippocampus volume during the entire lifespan (Walhovd et al., 2020).</p><p>Likewise, we also believe our caution when interpreting cross-sectional residual-based indices as accelerated/delayed maturation is extendable to developmental research. Yet, it is also likely that in development samples, brain age reflects ongoing changes to a greater degree than in aging for the following reasons: (1) During developmental interindividual differences in brain change are higher than in middle-age or aging; thus, changes in brain structure are generally steeper in development than in aging. This feature might also apply to specific disease groups in aging such as in Alzheimer’s disease patients. (2) Variance associated with variables other than ongoing brain change that systematically vary across individuals, should be lower than in older adults where a longer lifespan should lead to a wider and higher accumulation of effects on the individuals’ brain structure. Thus, as time from birth increases, chronological age as a marker of individual development is reduced. Whereas present knowledge allows us to extend our call for caution to a developmental context, the degree to which brain age delta reflects ongoing development in younger samples, needs to be formally tested. The revised version of the manuscript includes a brief version of the present argumentation.</p><p>In p. 18 (discussion): “We speculate that our results partially generalize to other normative and residual-based modeling approaches as well as to developmental samples.
