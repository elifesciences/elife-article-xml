generalized model for tetrapod limb development, urodeles deviate from anurans and amniotes in at least two key respects: their limbs exhibit preaxial skeletal differentiation and do not develop an apical ectodermal ridge (AER). Here, we investigated how <italic>Sonic hedgehog</italic> (<italic>Shh</italic>) and <italic>Fibroblast growth factor</italic> (<italic>Fgf</italic>) signaling regulate limb development in the axolotl. We found that <italic>Shh</italic>-expressing cells contributed to the most posterior digit, and that inhibiting Shh-signaling inhibited <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression, anteroposterior patterning, and distal cell proliferation. In addition to lack of a morphological AER, we found that salamander limbs also lack a molecular AER. We found that amniote and anuran AER-specific <italic>Fgfs</italic> and their cognate receptors were expressed entirely in the mesenchyme. Broad inhibition of Fgf-signaling demonstrated that this pathway regulates cell proliferation across all three limb axes, in contrast to anurans and amniotes where Fgf-signaling regulates cell survival and proximodistal patterning.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Salamanders are a group of amphibians that are well-known for their ability to regenerate lost limbs and other body parts. At the turn of the twentieth century, researchers used salamander embryos as models to understand the basic concepts of how limbs develop in other four-limbed animals, including amphibians, mammals and birds, which are collectively known as “tetrapods”. However, the salamander’s amazing powers of regeneration made it difficult to carry out certain experiments, so researchers switched to using the embryos of other tetrapods – namely chickens and mice – instead.</p><p>Studies in chickens, later confirmed in mice and frogs, established that there are two major signaling centers that control how the limbs of tetrapod embryos form and grow: a small group of cells known as the “zone of polarizing activity” within a structure called the “limb bud mesenchyme”; and an overlying, thin ridge of cells called the “apical ectodermal ridge”. Both of these centers release potent signaling molecules that act on cells in the limbs. The cells in the zone of polarizing activity produce a molecule often called Sonic hedgehog, or Shh for short. The apical ectodermal ridge produces another group of signals commonly known as fibroblast growth factors, or simply Fgfs.</p><p>Several older studies reported that salamander embryos do not have an apical ectodermal ridge suggesting that these amphibian’s limbs may form differently to other tetrapods. Yet, contemporary models in developmental biology treated salamander limbs like those of chicks and mice. To address this apparent discrepancy, Purushothaman et al. studied how the forelimbs develop in a salamander known as the axolotl.</p><p>The experiments showed that, along with lacking an apical ectodermal ridge, axolotls did not produce fibroblast growth factors normally found in this tissue. Instead, these factors were only found in the limb bud mesenchyme. Purushothaman et al. also found that fibroblast growth factors played a different role in axolotls than previously reported in chick, frog and mouse embryos. On the other hand, the pattern and function of Shh activity in the axolotl limb bud was similar to that previously observed in chicks and mice.</p><p>These findings show that not all limbs develop in the same way and open up questions for evolutionary biologists regarding the evolution of limbs. Future studies that examine limb development in other animals that regenerate tissues, such as other amphibians and lungfish, will help answer these questions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>limb development</kwd><kwd>Sonic hedgehog</kwd><kwd>fibroblast growth factor</kwd><kwd>salamander</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS -1353713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seifert</surname><given-names>Ashley W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>While movement of Fgf-signaling to the limb mesenchyme accompanied a shift in function, the ultimate outcome remains a convergent tetrapod limb phenotype.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Limb development is an ideal model to investigate how cellular and molecular networks exhibit plasticity or resilience during tetrapod evolution. Since the turn of the twentieth century the limb has endured as a fundamental model to investigate morphogenesis, cellular growth, and differentiation during embryonic development. From studies spanning comparative embryology through developmental genetics, limb development has provided deep insight into mechanisms underlying pattern formation, genotype-phenotype relationships, and the complexity of molecular networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Swett, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wolpert, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zeller et al., 2009</xref>). Perhaps equally studied as a fully developed structure, the limb has also served as a model for evolutionary biologists seeking to reconstruct tetrapod ancestry and how micro- and macro-evolutionary changes might explain major events in vertebrate evolution such as the fin to limb transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fröbisch and Shubin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shubin and Alberch, 1986</xref>).</p><p>The two most important embryonic models for modern limb development studies have been chicken and mice. Chicken embryos were integral to our understanding of limb bud outgrowth and morphogenesis aided by the availability of genetic limb mutants and the ability to discern skeletal defects in the wing caused by surgical manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saunders, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Summerbell et al., 1973</xref>). With the advent of stable transgenesis, mice became the model of choice to investigate the molecular basis of limb development. Together, data from chicken, mice and frogs have been synthesized into contemporary models covering limb development in tetrapods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zeller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zuniga, 2015</xref>). In these models, all vertebrate limb buds utilize the same molecular network (e.g. <italic>Shh, Fgfs, Bmps, Wnts</italic> and retinoic acid) governed by <italic>Hox</italic> genes and controlled by two major signaling centers; the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) and the apical ectodermal ridge (AER).</p><p>And then there are the urodeles. With tetrapod monophyly solidly supported by molecular and morphological data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahlberg and Milner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marjanović and Laurin, 2013</xref>), for scientists investigating the evolution and development of vertebrate limbs, salamanders and newts have longed proved problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holmgren, 1933</xref>). Although salamander and newt embryos were used to uncover key principles regarding specification of the prospective limb field and establishment of the primary limb axes (i.e., proximal-distal, anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harrison, 1918</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stocum and Fallon, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Swett, 1937</xref>), it was also observed that urodele limb development deviated from anurans and amniotes in at least two key respects: skeletal specification exhibited preaxial dominance (anterior elements form before posterior elements) rather than postaxial dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shubin and Alberch, 1986</xref>) and urodele limb buds did not form an apical ectodermal ridge (AER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sturdee and Connock, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tank et al., 1977</xref>). In addition to these important developmental differences, adult urodeles differ from anurans and amniotes in their ability to completely regenerate an amputated limb. With these ideas in mind, we sought to investigate limb development in salamanders to determine whether morphological and molecular data support a unified model of limb development that includes or excludes urodeles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Digit specification and differentiation are uncoupled during axolotl forelimb development</title><p>In order to study axolotl limb outgrowth and axis specification, we first staged developing limbs on the basis of external morphology and skeletal chondrification at 20–21°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As the limb bud emerged from the flank, limb mesenchyme expanded directly above the body wall musculature and at no time during limb development did we observe an AER or thickening of the limb ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In agreement with previous work in salamanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holmgren, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nye et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shubin and Alberch, 1986</xref>), we found that cartilage condensations of the limb skeleton formed proximal to distal, and within the zeugopod and autopod, anterior to posterior (preaxial dominance) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). While this was strictly true for the radius and ulna, alcian blue staining always demonstrated digit I and II forming together between stages 47 and 48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To further examine chondrogenesis in the limb, we identified axolotl <italic>Sox9</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and used its expression to analyze condensing mesenchymal cells prior to cartilage formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wright et al., 1995</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We first observed <italic>Sox9</italic> expression at stage 45 in a broad proximal area of the axolotl forelimb bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). <italic>Sox9</italic> expression at stage 46 appeared in a centrally located domain corresponding to the future radius, ulna and carpals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). However, in contrast to the Alcian blue staining pattern, <italic>Sox9</italic> expression in the presumptive digits appeared sequentially II-I-III-IV and this result was consistent across 13/15 (86.66%) limbs analyzed across stage 48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). At stage 49, <italic>Sox9</italic> expression expanded to clearly mark digit I along with digit II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, although chondrification of the limb skeleton proceeds anterior to posterior in the zeugopod, digit specification as marked by <italic>Sox9</italic> expression in the autopod exhibits a pre-pattern that first emerges along the central axis marked by digit II.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Skeletal chondrification proceeds anterior to posterior within the zeugopod and autopod during axolotl forelimb development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Box plot depicting post-hatching limb stages at 20°C (n = 35 total).

For this, we optimized wholemount in situ hybridization such that we could accurately identify mesenchymal and ectodermal expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). During limb initiation in other tetrapods, <italic>Sonic hedgehog</italic> (<italic>Shh</italic>) is induced in the posterior limb mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Riddle et al., 1993</xref>). Using an antisense-probe (~1000 bp) that was a gift from the Tanaka lab (IMP, Austria), we determined that <italic>Shh</italic> was first expressed at stage 45 in a posteriorly restricted domain and persisted through stage 49 in a posterior-proximal position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Interestingly, while <italic>Gremlin1</italic> is inhibited by AER-Fgf-signaling in amniotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Merino et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Verheyden and Sun, 2008</xref>), we found that <italic>Gremlin1</italic> expression was virtually eliminated in SU5042-treated limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>).</p><p>Loss of AER-Fgf-signaling during mouse limb development does not affect cell proliferation, but produces smaller limbs and proximal truncation due to increased proximal cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mariani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sun et al., 2002</xref>). We used Lysotracker to mark dying cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mariani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seifert et al., 2009</xref>) and during normal limb development we did not detect any dying cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, when we inhibited Fgf-signaling we did not detect dying cells in limb buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We next assessed if smaller limbs might have resulted from alterations in cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>). Inhibiting Fgf-signaling as above, we examined actively proliferating cells (EdU+) in treated and control stage 46 limb buds using lightsheet microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>). We calculated the proliferative population as a fraction of total limb volume and observed an 83% decrease in actively proliferating cells (one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). While the decrease in proliferating cells appeared proportionally across the anteroposterior axis, we noted that proliferating cells were nearly absent from the proximal limb bud and from a small distal domain in treated limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).</p><p>To determine the ultimate effect of Fgf inhibition on limb development, we assessed the effect of treating embryos from before limb outgrowth until all four digits appeared in control limbs at stage 54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–K</xref>). Analyzing the forelimb skeleton, we found that inhibiting Fgf-signaling led to smaller, but nearly complete limbs which generally lacked posterior digit IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–K</xref>). Specifically, 73.5% of SU5402-treated embryos exhibited this phenotype (25/34) while ~11% (4/34) had fewer than three digits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). In those cases where more than one digit was lost, the missing digits were the next most posterior in sequence. These results reveal that Fgf-signaling regulates mesenchymal proliferation, but not cell survival during axolotl limb development. Thus, inhibiting Fgf-signaling leads to smaller limbs and loss of posterior digits, a result consistent with colchicine treatment of developing axolotl and <italic>Xenopus</italic> larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberch and Gale, 1983</xref>). Lastly, Fgf-signaling regulates <italic>Gremlin1</italic> expression, whereas Shh-signaling is relatively independent of Fgf-signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title><italic>Sonic hedgehog</italic> signaling regulates <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression during axolotl limb development</title><p>While our results above suggest that a Shh-Grem-Fgf signaling loop does occur during axolotl limb development, we sought to examine if Fgf-signaling was reliant on Shh-signaling. Using cyclopamine to inhibit Shh signal transduction, previous work showed that Shh-signaling controls anterior-posterior patterning of the zeugopod and autopod during axolotl limb development, a role consistent with ZPA function in other tetrapods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stopper and Wagner, 2007</xref>).

To analyze the interaction of Shh- and Fgf-signaling during limb bud outgrowth, we treated stage 39 larvae with cyclopamine for 10 days and analyzed the limb buds at stages 45 and 46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Limb buds harvested at stage 45 did not show a significant difference in limb size between treatment and control animals (one-tailed student’s t-test, <italic>T</italic> = 1.43, p=0.909) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), whereas at stage 46, limb buds from cyclopamine-treated larvae were significantly smaller compared to control treated limbs (one-tailed student’s t-test, <italic>T</italic> = 8.36, p&lt;0.0001) and this effect was independent of (<italic>T</italic> = 0.03, p=0.975) a small, but significant decrease in animal length (one-tailed student’s t-test, <italic>T</italic> = 3.87, p&lt;0.0016) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Analyzing <italic>Ptch1</italic> expression by qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization, we found that cyclopamine treatment efficiently inhibited hedgehog signaling in limb buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). Using qRT-PCR we saw a significant reduction in <italic>Fgf8</italic> and <italic>Gremlin1</italic> expression at stage 46 and using in situ we were unable to detect these genes at either stage 45 or 46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>). These data place <italic>Fgf8</italic> and <italic>Gremlin1</italic> downstream of Shh-signaling during axolotl limb development. We also tested whether Shh-signaling controlled cell survival and cell proliferation. Similar to our results using SU5042, when we inhibited Shh-signaling we did not observe cell death in developing limb buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, we did find that loss of Shh-signaling led to a 53% reduction in cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–G</xref>).

Although chick and mouse embryos largely replaced urodeles as model systems to study limb development, a perpetual fascination with understanding the molecular basis of limb regeneration has resurrected interest into amphibian limb development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keenan and Beck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stocum, 1975</xref>). Elucidating the cellular and molecular basis of limb development in urodeles and other amphibians also has important implications for our understanding of how limbs evolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberch and Gale, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fröbisch and Shubin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stopper and Wagner, 2005</xref>). Despite deep homology among tetrapod limbs, biologists have long recognized several unique aspects of urodele limb development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holmgren, 1933</xref>). For example, although the limb field in urodeles is established in the gastrula, the limb bud does not emerge from the flank until much later in a free-swimming larva. Unlike amniotes, this situation demonstrates a level of autonomous development that is temporally de-coupled from limb specification and patterning of the main body axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stocum and Fallon, 1982</xref>). Retinoic acid (RA) generated from the somites in chicks and mice diffuses into the lateral plate mesoderm where it permits correct spatiotemporal induction of <italic>Tbx5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cunningham et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nishimoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stephens and McNulty, 1981</xref>). In contrast, during anuran limb bud development which occurs in larval animals (similar to urodeles), retinoic acid (RA) appears to be generated autonomously in the forelimb bud with <italic>raldh2</italic> expressed proximally and <italic>cyp26b</italic> distally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McEwan et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to limb heterochrony, urodele limb buds do not form an apical ectodermal ridge (AER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sturdee and Connock, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tank et al., 1977</xref>) and exhibit preaxial dominance of the limb skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shubin and Alberch, 1986</xref>). Lastly, urodeles can regenerate an entire limb, something no other group of tetrapods can do as adults (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, while these aspects of urodele limb development challenge our notion of an inclusive vertebrate limb development model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zeller et al., 2009</xref>) they also beg the question; does the molecular machinery directing limb morphogenesis exhibit critical differences when compared to amniotes and anurans?</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Salient features of forelimb development between axolotl, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, chicken and mouse.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Feature</th><th valign="top">Axolotl</th><th valign="top"><italic>Xenopus</italic></th><th valign="top">Chicken</th><th valign="top">Mouse</th><th valign="top">References</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Autopod skeletal differentiation</td><td valign="top">Preaxial dominance<bold><sup>1</sup></bold></td><td valign="top">Postaxial dominance<bold><sup>1</sup></bold></td><td valign="top">Postaxial dominance<bold><sup>1</sup></bold></td><td valign="top">Postaxial dominance<bold><sup>1</sup></bold></td><td valign="top"><bold><sup>1</sup></bold> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shubin and Alberch, 1986</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Location of ZPA domain</td><td valign="top">Posterior.

several key aspects of salamander limb development as they relate to patterning and outgrowth of the tetrapod limb. In doing so, we considered salient features of salamander forelimb development as they compare to <italic>Xenopus</italic>, chickens and mice (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). First, we confirm previous reports that axolotls lack a morphological AER. Second, using <italic>Sox9</italic> expression, we show that digit specification occurs first along the metapterygial axis of the limb with digit II, and then proceeds postaxial with digits I, III and IV. However, using Alcian blue staining as a proxy for cartilage condensation, we show that digits I and II differentiate simultaneously and are followed in sequence by digits III and IV. Thirdly, we show that <italic>Shh</italic> is restricted posteriorly, and although <italic>Shh</italic> expression does not overlap with the autopod, ZPA cells contribute to digit IV. Together with cyclopamine experiments these data support Shh-signaling as a key mediator of anterior-posterior patterning. Fourthly, we focused on the cellular source of Fgf-signaling and find that, in contrast to anurans and amniotes where reciprocal signaling is compartmentalized between the limb ectoderm and mesenchyme, <italic>Fgf</italic> ligands (<italic>Fgf8, 9, 17, 10</italic>) and receptors (<italic>FgfR1-4</italic>) are all expressed solely in the mesenchyme. By functionally testing the requirement for Fgf-signaling using a broad Fgf-receptor antagonist (SU5042), we demonstrate that Fgf-signaling regulates limb size by controlling cell proliferation across all three limb axes. Again, this stands in contrast to anurans and amniotes where Fgf-signaling regulates cell survival and cellular differentiation along the proximal-distal axis. Another key finding from these experiments is that Fgf-signaling regulates <italic>Gremlin1,</italic> whereas Shh-signaling is maintained in the face of Fgf-inhibition. While these results strongly suggest that a Shh-Grem-Fgf signaling loop is not present during salamander limb development, they do show that <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression is dependent on Shh-signaling. Together, our results show Shh-signaling from the ZPA has maintained its core function while de-coupling itself from Fgf-signaling and that Fgf-signaling has evolved to regulate cell proliferation in the limb.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Skeletal differentiation during axolotl forelimb development</title><p>Our analysis of skeletogenesis shows that axolotl digits appear to be specified in a different order than they differentiate. Taking advantage of subtle variations in within animal and between animal staging, our analysis using <italic>Sox9</italic> expression shows a 2&gt;1&gt;3&gt;4 pattern of digit specification. However, when we observed digit differentiation using Alcian blue to label condensing cartilage we always found digit I and II appearing together followed in sequence by digits III and IV. This pattern of digit differentiation is consistent with that observed by other investigators using histological preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fröbisch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shubin and Alberch, 1986</xref>) or Alcian blue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nye et al., 2003</xref>). These findings support independent molecular control of digit specification and differentiation and hint at the wide diversity in ontogenetic and heterochronic shifts that have occurred in the limb during urodele evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanco and Alberch, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franssen et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Sox9</italic> expression shows spatiotemporal variability across urodeles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kerney et al., 2018</xref>) and this underscores the need for more comparative limb studies to better understand the ancestral condition. While preaxial vs. postaxial dominance of skeletal formation clearly separates urodele limb development from anurans and amniotes, it is likely this difference points to alterations in the upstream genetic control of digit specification involving <italic>Fgfs</italic>, <italic>Bmps</italic>, and retinoic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Montero et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">ten Berge et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A conserved role for <italic>Sonic hedgehog</italic> signaling during vertebrate limb development</title><p>With respect to anterior-posterior patterning, our data show that the members of the hedgehog signaling pathway are expressed in a mesenchymal pattern consistent with other tetrapods studied to date. However, our results also reveal three important differences. First, our data reveals that <italic>Shh</italic> expression appears relatively late during limb bud outgrowth and after <italic>Fgf8</italic> and <italic>Hoxd11</italic> are expressed. Second, salamander forelimb buds exhibit a proximal-anterior domain of <italic>Shh</italic> expression that emerges as the axolotl limb bud begins to bend posteriorly; a domain which is not found during normal limb development in amniotes and anurans. Third, posterior <italic>Shh</italic> expression corresponding to the ZPA remains in a relatively small proximal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Torok et al., 1999</xref>) rather than the elongated expression domain found in other tetrapods that extends the proximal-distal length of the autopod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsubara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Riddle et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shapiro et al., 2003</xref>). With respect to the first point, previous work has demonstrated that flank tissue surrounding the limb field plays an important role in specifying the anteroposterior axis and thus, the temporal appearance of <italic>Shh</italic> expression may be less important than its posterior induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stocum and Fallon, 1982</xref>). In chick limbs, <italic>Hoxd11</italic> can be induced by <italic>Shh,</italic> but only in proximity to the AER or in the presence of AER-<italic>Fgfs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laufer et al., 1994</xref>) and in <italic>Shh</italic> KO mice <italic>Hoxd11</italic> is still expressed in the limb bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiang et al., 2001</xref>). While intriguing, the transient appearance of an anterior <italic>Shh</italic> domain is difficult to explain. We did not detect an anterior necrotic zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), and <italic>Shh</italic> inhibition did not lead to increased cell death in this region. Moreover, <italic>Shh</italic> inhibition produced phenotypes consistent with other amniote models of limb development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scherz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stopper and Wagner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Towers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vargas and Wagner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). When Shh-signaling is inhibited in axolotls with cyclopamine, zeugopodial and autopodial skeletal elements are lost in a posterior to anterior direction that is dependent on when cyclopamine is administered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stopper and Wagner, 2007</xref>). A similar phenotype occurs in chick embryos where elegant work demonstrated that Shh-signaling controls digit progenitor specification and limb bud growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Towers et al., 2008</xref>). When coupled with the results of <italic>Shh</italic> inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stopper and Wagner, 2007</xref>), our observations that Shh-signaling controls distal cell proliferation and that <italic>Shh</italic>-expressing cells contribute to digit IV, our findings support a conserved role for Shh-signaling as it pertains to specifying digit progenitors during limb development across all tetrapods. Future experiments ectopically expressing Shh using beads or virus will serve as a means to test downstream targets of Shh-signaling, as will transgenic elimination of <italic>Shh</italic> during development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Developing urodele limbs lack a morphological and molecular AER</title><p>In amniotes and anurans, limb bud outgrowth and proximal-distal patterning are controlled by the AER via expression of specific <italic>Fgf</italic> ligands (e.g. <italic>Fgf4, 8, 9, 17</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohn et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lewandoski et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mariani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ohuchi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sun et al., 2002</xref>).

Furthermore, <italic>Gremlin1</italic> acts as an intermediary between these signaling centers where it relays signals from the ZPA to control Bmp-signaling and maintain the AER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zeller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zuniga, 2015</xref>). In stark contrast to anurans and amniotes, our data represents the first instance of a tetrapod lacking <italic>Fgf</italic> ligand and receptor expression in the developing limb bud ectoderm. Although previous studies suggested that <italic>Fgf8</italic> was expressed early in salamander limb bud ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2001</xref>), a result consistent with studies in <italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doroba and Sears, 2010</xref>) and <italic>Eleutherodactylus coqui</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gross et al., 2011</xref>) which lack an AER but exhibit ectodermal <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression, our findings during development show this is not the case. Moreover, our expression patterns for <italic>Fgf8</italic> are consistent with recent data from regenerating axolotl limbs where <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression was found restricted to the mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nacu et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with our spatiotemporal expression results, analysis of scRNA-seq data from stage 45 axolotl limb buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerber et al., 2018</xref>) showed similar patterns along a modeled proximodistal axis. Co-expression analysis of <italic>Fgf</italic> ligands and receptors at stage 45 provide evidence that some cells expressing <italic>FgfR1</italic> also express several <italic>Fgf</italic> ligands. Given the relatively small number of cells analyzed in this dataset (&lt;200), a more complete scRNA-seq analysis across multiple time points will help address the complexity of Fgf-signaling and whether mesenchymal cells secreting <italic>Fgf</italic> ligands respond in an autocrine fashion. Our experiments also call into question what role, if any, the ectoderm plays during urodele limb development. For instance, experiments in <italic>Pleurodeles waltl</italic> showed that early stage forelimb bud mesoderm could autonomously develop a fully formed limb when grafted under heterologous flank epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lauthier, 1985</xref>). A clear functional role of the ectoderm awaits genetic manipulation since manual removal of the ectoderm results in rapid regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Fgf-signaling regulates cell proliferation and limb size</title><p>Our experiments using the <italic>Fgf</italic> receptor antagonist SU5402 sought to test if spatial re-location of <italic>Fgf</italic> ligands and receptors affected the established function of Fgf-signaling during anuran and amniote limb bud development. SU5402 inhibition (beginning before limb bud outgrowth) revealed that the primary function of Fgf-signaling in axolotl limb development is to regulate cell proliferation throughout the limb bud. It does not, however, appear to control cellular differentiation, cell survival or proximodistal patterning. Removal of the AER in chickens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saunders, 1948</xref>) leads to a stage dependent loss of skeletal elements in a proximal to distal direction and combined genetic deletion of <italic>Fgf8/Fgf4/Fgf9</italic> in the mouse AER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mariani et al., 2008</xref>) leads to a complete loss of the stylopod, zeugopod and autopod. In contrast, broadly inhibiting Fgf-signaling from the outset of axolotl limb development phenocopies urodele limbs treated with the mitotic inhibitor colchicine where in both cases, the most posterior digit fails to form in an otherwise smaller, but normal limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberch and Gale, 1983</xref>). These results echo experiments in chickens where pharmacological inhibition of cell proliferation using trichostatin A, colchicine, or vinblastine leads to loss of anterior digits, which are the last to form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Towers et al., 2008</xref>). Broadly inhibiting Fgf-signaling also shows that <italic>Shh</italic> operates independently of Fgf-signaling, while our cyclopamine experiments show that Shh-signaling regulates <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression. In addition, our finding that <italic>Gremlin1</italic> is regulated by Fgf-signaling suggests further rearrangement of genetic interactions observed in amniotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lewandoski et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sun et al., 2002</xref>). Together, these data show that while the role of Shh-signaling from the ZPA is conserved in salamander limb development, movement of amniote/anuran AER-Fgf ligands to the mesenchyme was accompanied by a change in how Fgf-signaling regulates limb development. Ultimately, our findings support similar molecular players being deployed during limb development across tetrapods but demonstrate that a divergent molecular program in urodeles resides predominantly in one cellular compartment: the limb mesenchyme.</p><p>While it is tempting to speculate that mesenchymal compartmentalization of limb developmental signaling is somehow causally related to regenerative ability, available data suggests otherwise. Data from basal Actinopterygians (paddlefish), Chondrichthyians (catfish) and anurans show ectodermal-mesenchymal segregation of the Shh- and Fgf-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christen and Slack, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tulenko et al., 2017</xref>). Pectoral fin regeneration is an ancient feature of Actinopterygians, Sarcopterygians and Chondrichthyians suggesting that mesenchymal core signaling alone is not exclusive to regenerating species. On the flip side, anurans show subtle molecular differences during limb development compared to amniotes, especially along the dorsoventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christen and Slack, 1998</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that ectodermal-mesodermal compartmentalization was the first step toward developmental canalization that ultimately increased robustness in the limb program, specifically in the autopod. Future limb development studies using a diverse array of anurans and lungfish will help shed light on these questions as will continued studies in salamanders and newts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and tissue harvest</title><p>Axolotls (<italic>Ambystoma mexicanum</italic>) were acquired from the Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center (Lexington, KY) and from our own laboratory colony.

Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.

Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in its current form.</p><p>As you can see below, both reviewers agree that the work is of potentially great importance. In our discussions, we all agreed that your work is an ambitious effort to examine in axolotls at least 4 aspects of limb development (AER signaling, ZPA signaling, dorsoventral patterning, and cartilage differentiation) that have each been studied for decades in chick and mouse. The data presented indicate a number of major differences in the mode and mechanisms of limb formation in salamander relative to chick, mouse, and other research organisms, challenging a number of current paradigms of limb development. Our problem with these findings is that the conclusions are overly bold given the relative superficiality of the analyses. For example, our biggest concern is that only Fgf8 was looked at when it has been shown by many that multiple Fgfs are involved in AER signaling. Because the argument about loss of ectodermal FGF signaling is central to the paper, it strikes us as essential to look at expression of the Fgfs that are involved in AER signaling (Fgf4/8/9/17) at minimum, and probably to look at distribution of the 4 FGF receptors., so they need to be thorough in their analysis.</p><p>We appreciate that addressing the points above is a significant amount of work. If you choose to address these and the other comments raised below and submit a more in-depth manuscript later on, we would be happy to re-examine the work. If, on the other hand, you would prefer to have the work published elsewhere as is we are enclosing the full text of the reviews, which we hope you will find useful. As you will see, both reviewers concurred on many aspects. To facilitate your evaluation of the enclosed reviews, we have identified those comments which are essentially the same.

An intriguing implication of this claim is that a difference in developmental program may be related to the ability of axolotls to regenerate limbs. The study covers a wide variety of features: (1) The morphology of the limb bud, including whether or not an AER forms, (2) the order of deposition of an Alcian blue positive matrix and the expression of Sox 9, Ihh; (3) order of digit formation, (4) Proximal distal patterning (via Fgf8 expression, SU5402 treatment) (5) A/P specification (via Shh expression, cyclopamine treatment) (6) Relationship between the P/D and A/P regulatory loops (via Grem. Ptch1 regulation), and (7) D/V patterning (via Wnt, En1 expression etc).</p><p>Unfortunately, the study handles each of these issues very superficially considering that there are at least 100 major studies examining each of these topics using chicken or mouse model systems over the course of the last 25 years. As a consequence, this reviewer believes that the bold conclusions drawn based on the data collected so far, while intriguing, are much too premature.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Just because there is no distal pseudo-stratified epithelial thickening (AER) doesn't mean an ectodermal signaling center is not there. There are other examples of amphibians that have no AER and still have AER-FGF expression.</p><p>2) Typically condensation is defined by histological coalescing of cells, however this study does not use histology to determine the order of digit condensation. If condensation is defined by proxies for cartilage differentiation the authors need to explain the variation in Alcian blue intensity for digits (order = 2?1? or vice versa, not clear from images 3, 4), sox 9 (2,1, 3, 4), and Ihh (1, 2? 3, 4). The authors should compare their more careful findings with those of Sue Mackem and colleagues (PMID: 18410737 and 21509901). Axolotls have 4 digits, is it digit 1 that is missing or digit 5?</p><p>3) The authors should be aware that colormetric RNA in situ hybridization is not as sensitive as other RNA detection methods (FISH or RNAscope). Thus, lack of color deposition, especially using whole mount preps, does not necessarily mean that no expression is present. For example, it may be the case that there is an early distal swath of <italic>Sox9</italic> expression but that it present at too low levels to detect give the method used.</p><p>4) There are at least 22 Fgfs and 4 FGF receptors. In many comparisons between species, related growth factors have been shown to substitute for each other. For example, Sox10 appears to provide the function of mouse <italic>Sox9</italic> in zebrafish. The expression pattern for Fgf8 shown in this study is reminiscent of the pattern of Fgf10 expression in chicken/mouse embryos. Without examining at least a handful of the most well-known FGF genes (Fgf4, Fgf10, <italic>Fgf9</italic>, Fgf2, <italic>Fgfr1, Fgfr2</italic>), it is premature to claim that axolotl limbs develop without needing an ectodermal source of FGFs.</p><p>5) SU5402 treatments typically result in a mild phenotype but based on their table of results CAN result in more severe digit loss phenotypes. This suggests that either the dose or timing of administration can be modulated to achieve phenotypes that match mouse KO phenotypes.</p><p>(Perhaps best compared to <italic>Fgfr1</italic>/2 combo KOs). In addition, given the long period between establishment of the limb field and limb outgrowth, it may be that one would need to administer SU5402 much earlier (prior to limb bud outgrowth) to inhibit proximal specification in these species.</p><p>6) The observation that Shh is also expressed in an anterior domain is interesting and should be examined. Given that cyclopamine administration gives the expected results, is this anterior domain not significant? Does the location of Shh expression correlate with areas of cell death at the anterior and posterior autopod margins?</p><p>7) The authors make the major claim that the FGF and Hh regulatory loops are not interlinked. This is based on examining a few read-outs by whole mount RNA in situ hybridization and is not comprehensively or quantitatively assessed. Furthermore, analysis of cell death is not presented, nor are genes or proliferation rates examined PRIOR to differences in limb bud size being evident.</p><p>8) Finally the analysis of D/V patterning genes seems tacked on and could be eliminated from the paper.</p><p>In its current state this reviewer recommends rejection of the paper as a thorough examination of the above issues would certainly take longer than the 2-3 months typically allotted for <italic>eLife</italic> submissions. Should the bold claims hold after more detailed analysis, (suggest focusing on FGF and HH pathways as most interesting and critical, while describing the order of condensation/differentiation is likely less revelatory), the study could be of great interest and significance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this fascinating paper, Purushothaman and Seifert examine limb development in the axolotl, a salamander that has long been the primary model for studies limb regeneration but has been largely overlooked for developmental studies. The lack of data on how axolotl limbs develop, compared to the developmental workhorses of chick and mouse, is a major problem because the data on axolotl limb regeneration are usually compared/contrasted with data on chick and mouse limb development, with an underlying assumption that limb development is similar across these species. Thus, the importance of the data presented here, which identifies a number of major differences in the mode and mechanisms of limb formation in salamander relative to chick, mouse, and other model and non-model organisms, is difficult to overstate. Their results not only highlight the manner in which developmental mechanisms have evolved in salamanders, but they also challenge some current paradigms of limb development that are based on work in chick and mouse, and they provide a developmental baseline for comparison with regeneration studies in the same species.</p><p>The authors begin by examining skeletal development and they validate some earlier work that showed differences in the spatiotemporal pattern of digit formation. They confirm the earlier observation of Sturdee and Connock, (1975) that the axolotl limb bud lacks an AER, and they go on to show that, unlike several other tetrapods that have been reported to lack an AER, axolotls show no ectodermal expression of Fgf8. This contrasts with the results of Han et al., (2001), who reported that Fgf8 is expressed in both the ectoderm and mesenchyme. Purushothaman and Seifert go to great lengths to detect Fgf8 in both tissues and they show, unequivocally in my opinion, that the Fgf8 expression domain is entirely mesenchymal.</p><p>Based on current models of limb development from mouse and chick, multiple FGFs (from the AER) positively regulate Shh, which then signals to the AER (directly) to maintain FGF expression, and to the limb mesenchyme, where it induces Gremlin1 expression. Mesenchymal Gremlin1 antagonizes Bmps in order to maintain FGF expression in the AER. The authors report that in axolotl limb buds, Shh expression was unaffected by suppression of FGF signaling using an FGF receptor antagonist, SU5402, which is a surprising finding because chick/mouse limb experiments would predict that near-complete suppression of FGF signaling would lead to reduced Shh expression. This result is made even more interesting by their discovery that Grem1 expression is virtually eliminated in SU5402-treated limbs. When Hedgehog signaling is blocked by cyclopamine treatment, Gremlin1 and Fgf8 expression is reduced, and the limb buds are smaller. The authors conclude that, in axolotl limb buds, FGF signaling is not required for Shh expression but is required for Gremlin expression and limb size, and that SHH controls distal limb patterning and growth by regulating Grem1 and Fgf8.</p><p>Finally, they turn to dorsoventral patterning and show that Wnt7a/Radical fringe and Engrailed1, which mark, respectively, the dorsal and ventral ectoderm in chick and mouse limbs, are expressed throughout the limb mesenchyme. This is another major difference between axolotl and the major model systems, and opens many new questions about the roles of those genes in dorsovental patterning of limb structures. Although not discussed, loss of dorsoventrally polarized expression also fits with loss of the AER. Polarized expression of these genes in limb ectoderm establishes the AER at the tip of the limb bud in chick and mouse. Furthermore, chick &quot;Wingless&quot; mutants form and then lose the AER, after which the dorsoventral markers lose their restricted expression (Ohuchi et al., 1997). It would be worth discussing whether the authors think that the dorsoventral change is a cause or consequence of the loss of an AER.</p><p>They conclude that the mesenchymal-epithelial (Shh-Grem-Fgf8) feedback loop that controls limb development in other tetrapods has been re-arranged in axolotls, where it is entirely mesenchymal and has evolved different regulatory interactions. In a rich but short discussion, the authors explore the implications of these findings for understanding genetic interactions in the limb, evolution of developmental mechanisms, and molecular control of regeneration. The brevity of the discussion does a disservice to the many sacred cows that this paper has toppled, and I would encourage them to break apart the results and discussion so that a proper airing of these ideas can be presented. Overall, the data are clear and convincing and the discoveries are likely to be of interest to a broad group of biologists in the areas of development, regeneration and evolution.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Shh expression pattern is quite interesting and makes one whether the cells that form the digits ever see the Shh signal. Although the initial domain in the posterior part of the limb is typical of early limb buds of tetrapods and fishes, the subsequent domains are very different from the patterns reported for other tetrapods. They state, &quot;Posterior expression is never detected in the autopod&quot; (Figure 2 legend). If the digits progenitors arise from (or near) the Shh domain, then the role of Shh in digit development could be conserved. If the cells of the Shh domain are distant from the digit progenitors, then this would challenge the current paradigm of digit development. This could be tested quite easily by labeling the initial Shh domain (at stage 45) with an injection (or carefully applied crystals) of an indocarbocyanine dye, like DiI, and then examining the distribution of labeled cells several stages later in order to determine whether those cells contribute to the digits. Determining whether digit progenitors reside within the Shh domain would allow the authors to make a direct comparison with the Shh-expressing (ZPA) cells of mouse and chick limb buds, which contribute to posterior digits.</p><p>2) Because the SU5402 treatments show that FGF signaling does not appear to maintain Shh in axolotls, is there really is a FGF-Shh feedback loop in axolotl limb bud mesenchyme?</p><p>3) Do the authors think that the same mesenchyme cells that are expressing Fgf8 are also responding to Fgf8? Do they express an appropriate receptor? How does the topological shift in the position of the ligand, Fgf8, relate to the ability of SU5402, a FGF receptor antagonist, to produce such different outcomes in axolotl vs chick and mouse limbs? Do the authors think that there is combinatorial FGF signaling in axolotls (as there is in chick and mouse), but the ligands are produced and received by the mesenchyme? If so, then can they suggest an explanation for how the same Fgfs could regulate Shh when secreted by the AER(as in chick/mouse) but do not regulate Shh when produced by the mesenchyme? Chick experiments in which the AER is removed and FGF beads are implanted into the limb bud mesenchyme suggests that the source of the ligand is irrelevant. Have they considered the possibility that Fgf8 acquired a novel function during axolotl limb evolution and lost its roles as a Shh regulator and an outgrowth signal? The proliferation data suggest that at least some of these roles are conserved.</p><p>4) In several places, the Fgf8 result is generalized to the other Fgfs involved in AER signaling (e.g., Results and Discussion section: &quot;Taken together, our expression data clearly shows that the Shh-Grem-FGF feedback loop is entirely expressed within the mesenchymal compartment during salamander limb development.&quot;). In chick and mouse limbs, at least 4 Fgfs (Fgf4, Fgf8, <italic>Fgf9</italic>, and Fgf17) are expressed in the AER and signal through mesenchymal FGF receptors. Whilst it would be informative to examine the expression patterns of these other Fgfs in axolotl limb buds to determine whether the Shh-FGF feedback loop is entirely in the mesenchyme (or if some of the Fgfs have remained in the epithelium) if they choose not to examine the expression of these other Fgfs, then they should tailor the discussion accordingly and at least mention the alternate possibilities. For example, they show that Fgf8 is expressed in the mesenchyme, but it is unknown whether or where other Fgfs are expressed in the limb. Thus, several scenarios are possible, including (a) Fgf8 is mesenchymal but Fgf4, <italic>Fgf9</italic>, and Fgf17 are expressed in the epithelium, (b) All 4 Fgfs are mesenchymal, (c) Fgf8 is mesenchymal and the other 3 Fgfs are not expressed. Without knowing which of these scenarios is true, one must be cautious and clear with the interpretation the SU5402 results since SU5402 treatment probably suppresses all FGF signaling. For example, scenarios (b) and (c) would support &quot;a topological rearrangement of the Shh-Grem1-FGF loop&quot;, but scenario (a) would not because 3 of the 4 Fgfs would be expressed in ectoderm. To be clear, I am not insisting that the authors examine every FGF and FGF receptor in axolotl limbs, but they need to consider the complexity of FGF signaling in amniotes in their interpretation of the results. They could also cite other experimental work that supports their argument that the critical FGF signal is mesenchymal, such as the work of Lauthier (1985), who showed that newt limbs can develop even when the apical epithelium is removed from the mesenchyme.</p><p>5) Figure 1C. Looking at the alcian blue stained limbs, there are no visible digit condensations at stage 47, and at stage 48, three distinct digit condensations are stained. At stage 49, these 3 condensations remain visible (only I and II are labeled in the figure, but digit III is also stained). The initial condensation of digit IV is also visible at stage 49. Given that no digits are visible at stage 47, and three digits (I, II, III) appear at stage 48, what is the basis for the argument that digits form from anterior to posterior? (see the following point for continued discussion of this issue)</p><p>6) Figure 1E. I found the <italic>Sox9</italic> in situ hybridizations to be less informative than the alcian blue preparations, possibly due to the level of background staining, although this could also be a result of slight staging differences between the alcian blue and <italic>Sox9</italic> limbs. For example, although one can see three digits in the alcian blue limb at stage 48, only digit II is obvious in the <italic>Sox9</italic> in situ hybridization at the same stage. Is the latter a slightly younger limb, or is the in situ just not as clear as the alcian blue preparation?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;FGF-signaling is compartmentalized within the mesenchyme and controls proliferation during salamander limb development&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

If you cannot address certain comments, please explain why.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this revised submission, Purushothaman et al., compare limb development in the axolotl salamander to classical findings in chicken and mouse embryos. Some findings confirmed previous studies using more refined techniques, other findings were new. Most striking were the numerous differences seen in axolotl including pre-axial condensation, condensation first along the metapterygial axis, lack of a morphological AER, lack of AER-FGF expression (instead found at the distal mesenchyme), no requirement for FGF signaling for Prox./Distal patterning or cell death, anterior expression of Shh, requirement of Shh for distal proliferation but not cell death. These observations are carefully presented and clearly discussed and very interesting, however, Although the authors responded to many of the criticisms in the first round with additional experiments, I am conflicted as to whether this is a collection of interesting descriptive phenomena vs. a comprehensive mechanistic conceptual advance in the field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be nice to see some RNA-ISH that is positive in the overlying ectoderm just to rule out the possibility that lack of staining is not due simply to a technical problem with doing RNA-ISH on axolotl ectoderm (some permeability problem). Another method would be to do RNA-ISH on a section.</p><p>2) Please show Fgf4 RNA-ISH and other 'data not shown' such as cell death assays even if not very high.</p><p>3) How come only scSeq in mesenchyme is shown? Could an analysis of the ectoderm be included? In no FGF ligands detected in this data set, this would be nice to report.</p><p>4) Lysotracker and TUNEL are coincident in mouse/chick. Are they in axolotol? Could cells be dying but this is not visible due to failure of phagocytic bodies?</p><p>5) The second paragraph of the Discussion section does a better job at summarizing the paper than Abstract, perhaps the abstract could be enhanced with some of the ideas here.</p><p>6) Even for the limb bud aficionado it would be useful to have a chart comparing mouse/chick results to findings in axolotl.</p><p>7) In Figure 5H and Figure 6—figure supplement 1 panel F, I can't tell which of the red patches are positive above background. Also, in the mid-sagittal slice the control limb bud shows almost all cells as positive, is this correct?</p><p>8) Why are Christensen et al., 2002; Han et al., 2001 incorrect in their observation of FGF expression in the AER?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors are to be congratulated for the quality and scope of the revised manuscript. It is a rigorous and extremely thorough study. All of my concerns have been addressed satisfactorily.</p><p>The DiI results are quite interesting. They injected DiI into the early Shh domain of the limb bud and then let it grow, examining the localization of labeled cells at different stages. This allowed them to map the spatiotemporal movements of the initial Shh domain and to determine whether the putative ZPA cells end up in the digits (and if so, which digits). This was very informative. Relative to chick and mouse, axolotl limbs have somewhat crazy fingers and gene expression patterns, but this experiment identifies a deeply conserved feature – the contribution of Shh-expressing cells to the posterior digit(s).</p><p>Expansion of the FGF analysis to include all of the Fgfs expressed in the AER of amniotes (FGF 4, 8, 9, 17) as well as Fgf10 and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and <italic>Fgfr2</italic>, provides definitive evidence that the &quot;AER Fgfs&quot; of amniotes are expressed in the mesoderm of axolotl limb buds (with the possible exception of Fgf4, which was variable but never in the ectoderm). This is an unequivocal demonstration that axolotl limb buds lack the ectodermal domains of Fgfs that are found in the AER of amniotes.</p><p>The authors note that the proximal-distal segregation of FGF ligand and receptor expression is puzzling, but the results are clear. Moreover, the in situ hybridization patterns are validated by the scRNAseq data. It is also interesting to see that where <italic>Fgfr1</italic> does extend into the distal domain, it is either in or near the cells expressing FGF ligands.</p><p>I am impressed by the manner in which the authors responded to the reviewers' criticism that some conclusions were overly broad in the previous version of the paper. Rather than just removing conclusions that were not entirely supported by the results, they investigated whether those conclusions would stand up to further testing. In some places, they were just a half step away from having data that would address the question, but in other cases, they went to great lengths to carry out the appropriate experiments. Where the results provided clear support for the hypothesis (e.g., the AER Fgfs are expressed in the mesenchyme of axolotls), they say so, and where more than one interpretation is possible, they provide conservative conclusions and acknowledge the open questions that remain. I very much like this version of the paper and think that it will be a valuable contribution of the fields of limb development and limb evo-devo, and it will provide important developmental context for regenerative studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48507.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] We appreciate that addressing the points above is a significant amount of work.

An intriguing implication of this claim is that a difference in developmental program may be related to the ability of axolotls to regenerate limbs. The study covers a wide variety of features: (1) The morphology of the limb bud, including whether or not an AER forms, (2) the order of deposition of an Alcian blue positive matrix and the expression of Sox 9, Ihh; (3) order of digit formation, (4) Proximal distal patterning (via Fgf8 expression, SU5402 treatment) (5) A/P specification (via Shh expression, cyclopamine treatment) (6) Relationship between the P/D and A/P regulatory loops (via Grem. Ptch1 regulation), and (7) D/V patterning (via Wnt, En1 expression etc).</p><p>Unfortunately, the study handles each of these issues very superficially considering that there are at least 100 major studies examining each of these topics using chicken or mouse model systems over the course of the last 25 years. As a consequence, this reviewer believes that the bold conclusions drawn based on the data collected so far, while intriguing, are much too premature.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully appreciate all the detailed studies that have been done in chicken and mouse examining each of these issues during limb development. In light of this general comment, and the more detailed comments outlined below, we have expanded our analysis of FGF- and Shh-signaling in much greater detail and have reserved the D/V information for an additional paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Just because there is no distal pseudo-stratified epithelial thickening (AER) doesn't mean an ectodermal signaling center is not there. There are other examples of amphibians that have no AER and still have AER-FGF expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this point. In the original submission we refer to the cases of <italic>Eleutherodactylus coqui</italic> (direct-developing frog) and <italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic> (opossum), both of which lack a morphological AER but demonstrate ectodermal <italic>FGF</italic> expression. In response to the comment, we have now been more careful with our language and clearly link <italic>FGF</italic>-expression where we are discussing the AER and highlight the two examples of the above-mentioned animals not having an AER, but still possessing an ectodermal signaling center (subsection “Amniote and anuran AER-specific <italic>FGF</italic> ligands (<italic>8, 9, 17</italic>) are expressed exclusively in axolotl limb mesenchyme” and Discussion section). We also believe data showing expression for FGF ligands and receptors further addresses this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Typically, condensation is defined by histological coalescing of cells, however this study does not use histology to determine the order of digit condensation. If condensation is defined by proxies for cartilage differentiation the authors need to explain the variation in Alcian blue intensity for digits (order = 2?1? or vice versa, not clear from images 3, 4), sox 9 (2,1, 3, 4), and Ihh (1, 2? 3, 4). The authors should compare their more careful findings with those of Sue Mackem and colleagues (PMID: 18410737 and 21509901). Axolotls have 4 digits, is it digit 1 that is missing or digit 5?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer, we attempted to further analyze coalescing cells in developing axolotl limb buds using paraffin sections and semi-thin resin embedded sections but were unable to produce sections that could resolve the issues raised by in situ and Alcian blue samples. Instead, we revisited each and every limb stained for <italic>Sox9</italic> which we now present to the reader in a new supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). This data shows (pretty clearly in our opinion) that <italic>Sox9</italic> expression specifies digit II before digit I which appears shortly afterwards. In fact, <italic>Sox9</italic> expression can be seen emerging in the area of digit I in late stage 48 limb buds. The two digits are clearly stained at stage 49 for reference. In contrast, revisiting all of our Alcian blue stained limbs across these and later stages, we were unable to find an instance where digit II was differentiating before digit I. Therefore, we now present this data and draw the conclusion that the digits are specified in a slightly different temporal sequence than when they differentiate. Said another way, digits I and II differentiate at the same time even though digit I is specified before digit II. Rather than compare to the two Susan Mackem papers (which we are familiar with), we discuss how our findings support ontogenetic and heterchronic shifts that have occurred during urodele limb evolution. There is precedent for variation in the pattern of digit differentiation across urodeles, although no one has looked across many species using <italic>Sox9</italic>. With respect to the final point in this comment regarding digit identity, it is not our intention to get drawn into the controversy of digit identity, a debate which continues and is likely unresolvable without molecular markers for individual digits (see Towers et al., 2011). Thus, we have chosen not to address this in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should be aware that colormetric RNA in situ hybridization is not as sensitive as other RNA detection methods (FISH or RNAscope). Thus, lack of color deposition, especially using whole mount preps, does not necessarily mean that no expression is present. For example, it may be the case that there is an early distal swath of Sox9 expression but that it present at too low levels to detect give the method used.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that FISH and RNAscope have increased sensitivity compared to WISH. We also note that these methods have increased noise that creates problems when trying to demonstrate the absence of signal. With respect to the <italic>Sox9</italic> result, while our new supplementary figure presenting all <italic>Sox9</italic>-stained limbs for stages 47-49 cannot rule out a faint swath of expression in digit I as it is being expressed in digit II, we would expect that the same faint signal would be present prior to our observation of <italic>Sox9</italic> in digit II at stage 47. Thus, we do not believe that implementing an additional (and very costly) method would bring appreciable clarity to this point. We have been careful not to overstate our result which we believe should address this comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are at least 22 Fgfs and 4 FGF receptors. In many comparisons between species, related growth factors have been shown to substitute for each other. For example, Sox10 appears to provide the function of mouse Sox9 in zebrafish. The expression pattern for Fgf8 shown in this study is reminiscent of the pattern of Fgf10 expression in chicken/mouse embryos. Without examining at least a handful of the most well-known FGF genes (Fgf4, Fgf10, Fgf9, Fgf2, Fgfr1, Fgfr2), it is premature to claim that axolotl limbs develop without needing an ectodermal source of FGFs.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted by the other reviewer we agree with this point. We now include WISH staining and scRNA-seq data for all the requested FGF ligands and receptors. Our data shows quite conclusively that none of the ligands or receptors are expressed in the ectoderm. These data also provide insight into segregation across the proximodistal and anteroposterior axes. We were unable to detect Fgf4 using in situ or in the scRNA-seq dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) SU5402 treatments typically result in a mild phenotype but based on their table of results CAN result in more severe digit loss phenotypes. This suggests that either the dose or timing of administration can be modulated to achieve phenotypes that match mouse KO phenotypes.</p><p>(Perhaps best compared to Fgfr1/2 combo KOs). In addition, given the long period between establishment of the limb field and limb outgrowth, it may be that one would need to administer SU5402 much earlier (prior to limb bud outgrowth) to inhibit proximal specification in these species.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the point raised here which is a result reminiscent of so many chick limb studies using pharmacological agents. Although a result can be robust, sometimes unseen effects to animal health or growth can have an additive effect on the ultimate phenotype. We administered SU5402 based on a dose-response study and selected the max dose that was not toxic and did not appreciable effect total growth of the animals. We administered SU5402 at stage 39 which is prior to limb bud outgrowth when the limb bud is not visible in an effort to inhibit FGF-signaling as soon as it began. Lastly, even in the 4/34 cases where additional elements were lost (“more severe phenotypes as referred to in the comment”), the missing elements were lost in the same posterior to anterior direction, rather than the proximal truncation predicted from AER loss of function studies in chicken and mouse. Furthermore, our new data showing that FGF-signaling regulates cell proliferation throughout the limb provides additional supporting evidence for our SU5042 results. Thus, our results are perfectly consistent with results from salamanders, anurans and chickens that show digit loss as a consequence of inhibiting cell proliferation (Discussion section). In our interpretation, loss of additional elements in a few (4/34) cases likely resulted from the small additive effect of a reduction in whole animal growth that was independent of FGF-signal inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The observation that Shh is also expressed in an anterior domain is interesting and should be examined. Given that cyclopamine administration gives the expected results, is this anterior domain not significant? Does the location of Shh expression correlate with areas of cell death at the anterior and posterior autopod margins?</p></disp-quote><p>We too find the anterior domain of <italic>Shh</italic> expression intriguing which is why we were careful to look for additional anterior expression of <italic>Ptch1</italic> and <italic>Gli1</italic>. These support that region as real expression. However, they do not speak to function. Therefore, at the suggestion of the reviewer, we used Lysotracker to analyze cell death throughout limb development. We did not, however, detect cell death in either the posterior or anterior domains. Likewise, our cell proliferation data does not show anything that specifically correlates with the anterior domain. In light of the cyclopamine results, we cannot at present assign a specific function to the anterior domain. It is feasible that the expression contributes to limb growth, but that when Shh-signaling is inhibited the effect is swamped out by the more serious effect on AP patterning and specification of skeletal progenitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors make the major claim that the FGF and Hh regulatory loops are not interlinked. This is based on examining a few read-outs by whole mount RNA in situ hybridization and is not comprehensively or quantitatively assessed. Furthermore, analysis of cell death is not presented, nor are genes or proliferation rates examined PRIOR to differences in limb bud size being evident.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our initial assessment could benefit from a deeper analysis. We now present additional evidence to determine if an FGF-Shh regulatory loop exists in salamander limbs. First, the reviewer makes a good point that we should have analyzed the limb buds for altered gene expression <italic><underline>prior</underline></italic> to differences in limb bud size. Thus, as the limb buds emerge from the flank at stage 44, we now present an analysis of stage 45 limb buds (Figure 5C,F and Figure 6D). In response to FGF inhibition (using SU5042) we show that <italic>Etv1, Etv4</italic> and <italic>Gremlin1</italic> expression are not present. In contrast, we show that <italic>Ptch1</italic> expression persists in a domain almost identical to the control limb. This data mimics our results at stage 46 (when the limb size is reduced). In addition to WISH, we now quantify gene expression changes at stage 46 and show that <italic>Etv1, Etv4, Gremlin1</italic> and <italic>Shh</italic> expression are significantly down-regulated. Again, our qRT-PCR data shows that <italic>Ptch1</italic> expression does not decrease (and in fact is trending towards a significant increase). This shows that Shh-signaling is not regulated by FGF-signaling. We present the same type of analysis using cyclopamine to inhibit Shh-signaling (Figure 6A-E). Our qualitative (WISH) and quantitative (qRT-PCR) analysis shows that <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression is regulated by Shh-signaling, as is <italic>Gremlin1</italic> expression. In addition to expression analysis, we now include functional assessment of cell death and cell proliferation. Cell death did not change in response to either treatment. Our cell proliferation analysis, however, showed that FGF-signaling regulated this process throughout the limb. This demonstrates that in contrast to anurans and amniotes where FGF-signaling controls cell survival and differentiation, in urodeles FGF-signaling controls cell proliferation instead. We obtained similar data for cyclopamine accept that Shh-signaling appeared to regulate cell proliferation to a lesser extent than FGF-signaling and that this control was more concentrated in the distal mesenchyme where <italic>Fgf8</italic> is expressed. In addition to presenting new data, we also discuss the implications for our findings in an expanded Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Finally, the analysis of D/V patterning genes seems tacked on and could be eliminated from the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have removed this data from the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In its current state this reviewer recommends rejection of the paper as a thorough examination of the above issues would certainly take longer than typically allotted for eLife submissions.

Although the initial domain in the posterior part of the limb is typical of early limb buds of tetrapods and fishes, the subsequent domains are very different from the patterns reported for other tetrapods. They state, &quot;Posterior expression is never detected in the autopod&quot; (Figure 2 legend). If the digits progenitors arise from (or near) the Shh domain, then the role of Shh in digit development could be conserved. If the cells of the Shh domain are distant from the digit progenitors, then this would challenge the current paradigm of digit development. This could be tested quite easily by labeling the initial Shh domain (at stage 45) with an injection (or carefully applied crystals) of an indocarbocyanine dye, like DiI, and then examining the distribution of labeled cells several stages later in order to determine whether those cells contribute to the digits. Determining whether digit progenitors reside within the Shh domain would allow the authors to make a direct comparison with the Shh-expressing (ZPA) cells of mouse and chick limb buds, which contribute to posterior digits.</p></disp-quote><p>We have responded above to the comment about the anterior domain of <italic>Shh</italic> in comment reviewer 1, comment 6. We present data in a series of in situs (summarized in a schematic) showing the posterior expression domain of <italic>Shh</italic> relative to similar stages in chick and mouse (Figure 2C). This shows that in salamanders, <italic>Shh</italic> expression remains outside of the autopod after limb bud elongation. While the functional significance of this extended expression remains unclear, we appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to use DiL as a way to investigate conservation of the posterior domain with respect to establishing digit progenitors. We performed the suggested experiment by injecting DiL at stage 45 when <italic>Shh</italic> is first expressed in the posterior and then tracked the labeled cells in limbs until all the digits had formed at stage 53. We present this data in a new figure alongside expression for <italic>Shh, Ptch1, Gli1</italic> and <italic>Gli3</italic> (Figure 2). Our results mirror similar experiments in chick limbs showing that the region expressing <italic>Shh</italic> gives rise to the most posterior digit and that later Shh-signaling controls growth of the autopod. When viewed alongside our data using cyclopamine (and that previously published by Stopper and Wagner, 2007), it appears Shh-signaling controls digit progenitor specification and later distal cell proliferation. Similar to mouse and chick, digit 1 specification in salamanders is not regulated by Shh-signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Because the SU5402 treatments show that FGF signaling does not appear to maintain Shh in axolotls, is there really is a FGF-Shh feedback loop in axolotl limb bud mesenchyme?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We have revised our manuscript accordingly. We still refer to the feedback loop as it applies to anurans and tetrapods and where we refer to the interaction of Shh and FGF in salamanders indicate that it is not a loop.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Do the authors think that the same mesenchyme cells that are expressing Fgf8 are also responding to Fgf8? Do they express an appropriate receptor? How does the topological shift in the position of the ligand, Fgf8, relate to the ability of SU5402, a FGF receptor antagonist, to produce such different outcomes in axolotl vs chick and mouse limbs? Do the authors think that there is combinatorial FGF signaling in axolotls (as there is in chick and mouse), but the ligands are produced and received by the mesenchyme? If so, then can they suggest an explanation for how the same Fgfs could regulate Shh when secreted by the AER(as in chick/mouse) but do not regulate Shh when produced by the mesenchyme? Chick experiments in which the AER is removed and FGF beads are implanted into the limb bud mesenchyme suggests that the source of the ligand is irrelevant. Have they considered the possibility that Fgf8 acquired a novel function during axolotl limb evolution and lost its roles as a Shh regulator and an outgrowth signal? The proliferation data suggest that at least some of these roles are conserved.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises good points with respect to signal source and receiver. In an attempt to clarify what is happening during salamander limb development with respect to FGF-signaling, we took two additional approaches. First, we used in situ hybridization to detect additional FGF ligands that act as AER signals in chick and mouse (i.e., <italic>Fgf4, 9</italic> and <italic>17</italic>) and the two primary FGF receptors (i.e., <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>). We also looked at <italic>Fgf10</italic> since it is normally expressed in the mesenchyme, but signals to <italic>FgfR2iiib</italic> expressed in the ectoderm. We now present all of this data in a new Figure 3. Two things are apparent from this data: (1) all of the ligands (except <italic>Fgf4</italic> which we could not detect) are expressed in the distal mesenchyme and none are expressed in the ectoderm and (2) the cognate receptors are expressed mostly in proximal cells that do not appear to overlap with the ligands. One exception is <italic>Fgfr1</italic> which appears to be expressed more broadly at stages 44 and 45, although even then it is restricted from the most distal mesenchyme. Second, we tried to address localization of FGF-signaling in the limb and whether the same mesenchymal cells that are expressing <italic>FGF</italic> ligands are also responding to FGF-signaling. To do this we analyzed a single cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) dataset generated for two early stages of axolotl limb development that corresponded to our stages 44 and 45 (Gerber et al., 2019). We present the results from this analysis in a new Figure 4, and two supplementary figures. Using this dataset, we conducted a principal component analysis of the sequenced cells and used known genetic markers of the proximodistal axis to discover if a principal component could accurately model the proximodistal axis. This analysis revealed a proximodistal axis as defined by expression of <italic>Meis1</italic> and <italic>Meis2</italic> (proximal markers) and <italic>Hoxd11</italic> (distal) (presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Next, we conducted a co-expression analysis which showed that the FGF ligands and receptors are in fact, not co-expressed along the modeled proximodistal axis. This data is now presented alongside the in situs in Figure 4. We also asked whether <italic>Fgf8, 9, 10</italic> and <italic>17</italic> were co-expressed in cells that also expressed any of the four <italic>FGF</italic> receptors. This analysis is presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 and shows that some cells expressing <italic>Fgfr1</italic> also express these four ligands. However, few to no cells co-express the ligands and other receptors. Together, we believe these approaches present compelling evidence that distal mesenchyme cells expressing ligands are signaling to more proximally expressed receptors, but that some distal mesenchymal cells may be able to respond in an autocrine fashion.</p><p>With respect to the second point regarding an explanation for breaking the Shh-FGF feedback loop; as discussed above, Shh-signaling appears to maintain a conserved function with regard to anteroposterior patterning, specification of digit progenitor cells, and distal growth of the autopod. Presumably, movement of FGF-signaling to the mesenchyme occurred after the divergence of urodeles and anurans and our cell proliferation and cell death data suggest that FGF-signaling adopted a novel function in supporting growth of the limb rather than controlling cell survival and proximodistal pattern. We discuss this in relation to results from salamanders, anurans, and amniotes which show similar phenotypes when cell proliferation is broadly inhibited. How this happened in the context of evolution is much more difficult to answer and we are not sure it can be, at least not in the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In several places, the Fgf8 result is generalized to the other Fgfs involved in AER signaling (e.g., Results and Discussion section: &quot;Taken together, our expression data clearly shows that the Shh-Grem-FGF feedback loop is entirely expressed within the mesenchymal compartment during salamander limb development.&quot;). In chick and mouse limbs, at least 4 Fgfs (Fgf4, Fgf8, Fgf9, and Fgf17) are expressed in the AER and signal through mesenchymal FGF receptors. Whilst it would be informative to examine the expression patterns of these other Fgfs in axolotl limb buds to determine whether the Shh-FGF feedback loop is entirely in the mesenchyme (or if some of the Fgfs have remained in the epithelium) if they choose not to examine the expression of these other Fgfs, then they should tailor the discussion accordingly and at least mention the alternate possibilities. For example, they show that Fgf8 is expressed in the mesenchyme, but it is unknown whether or where other Fgfs are expressed in the limb. Thus, several scenarios are possible, including (a) Fgf8 is mesenchymal but Fgf4, Fgf9, and Fgf17 are expressed in the epithelium, (b) All 4 Fgfs are mesenchymal, (c) Fgf8 is mesenchymal and the other 3 Fgfs are not expressed. Without knowing which of these scenarios is true, one must be cautious and clear with the interpretation the SU5402 results since SU5402 treatment probably suppresses all FGF signaling. For example, scenarios (b) and (c) would support &quot;a topological rearrangement of the Shh-Grem1-FGF loop&quot;, but scenario (a) would not because 3 of the 4 Fgfs would be expressed in ectoderm. To be clear, I am not insisting that the authors examine every FGF and FGF receptor in axolotl limbs, but they need to consider the complexity of FGF signaling in amniotes in their interpretation of the results. They could also cite other experimental work that supports their argument that the critical FGF signal is mesenchymal, such as the work of Lauthier (1985), who showed that newt limbs can develop even when the apical epithelium is removed from the mesenchyme.</p></disp-quote><p>We direct the reviewer to our responses reviewer 1, comment 4 and reviewer 1, comment 5 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 1C. Looking at the alcian blue stained limbs, there are no visible digit condensations at stage 47, and at stage 48, three distinct digit condensations are stained. At stage 49, these 3 condensations remain visible (only I and II are labeled in the figure, but digit III is also stained). The initial condensation of digit IV is also visible at stage 49. Given that no digits are visible at stage 47, and three digits (I, II, III) appear at stage 48, what is the basis for the argument that digits form from anterior to posterior? (see the following point for continued discussion of this issue)</p><p>6) Figure 1E. I found the Sox9 in situ hybridizations to be less informative than the alcian blue preparations, possibly due to the level of background staining, although this could also be a result of slight staging differences between the alcian blue and Sox9 limbs. For example, although one can see three digits in the alcian blue limb at stage 48, only digit II is obvious in the Sox9 in situ hybridization at the same stage. Is the latter a slightly younger limb, or is the in situ just not as clear as the alcian blue preparation?</p></disp-quote><p>We direct the reviewer to our response to reviewer 1, comment 2</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please break the Discussion section into subsections, including one that compares the findings in axolotl with chick and mouse.</p><p>2) Please add a table that compares limb development in axolotl with mouse/chick.</p><p>3) Please try, if possible, within a reasonable time frame, to address the reviewer comments below, though some were deemed non-essential (e.g. scRNAseq of limb ectoderm; re-imaging the immunofluorescence).

Han et al., 2001 present whole mount expression data and state that “Fgf8 is expressed in limb bud epidermis and mesenchyme of the budding limb”. They go on to state in their discussion, “In the present study, we have found that the FGF-8 expression domain is translocated from epidermis to mesenchyme gradually as limb development proceeds”. We simply state that this is not what we found because at no time do we observer ectodermal expression of any FGF ligands. The quality of their images makes it impossible to determine in what compartments Fgf8 is or is not expressed. So all we are left with is what they state in their paper. Christensen et al., 2002 state, “Fgf8 and 10, highly expressed in the amniote developing limb AER and mesoderm, respectively (Crossley et al., 1996; Ohuchi et al., 1997), were accordingly also expressed in axolotl developing and regenerating limbs”. Thus, they imply that Fgf8 is expressed in axolotl limb ectoderm. However, they do not actually show an in situ for developing limbs in that paper. Therefore, it is inappropriate to cite Christensen et al., 2002 since they do not present data to support or refute our data. Thus, we have removed the Christensen et al., 2002 citation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
