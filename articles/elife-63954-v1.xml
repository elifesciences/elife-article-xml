alleviate opioid dependence. However, MMT possibly increases the risk of motor vehicle collisions. The current study investigated preliminary estimation of motor vehicle collision incidence rates. Furthermore, in this population-based retrospective cohort study with frequency-matched controls, opiate adults receiving MMT (cases) and those not receiving MMT (controls) were identified at a 1:2 ratio by linking data from several nationwide administrative registry databases. From 2009 to 2016, the crude incidence rate of motor vehicle collisions was the lowest in the general adult population, followed by that in opiate adults, and it was the highest in adults receiving MMT. The incidence rates of motor vehicle collisions were significantly higher in opiate users receiving MMT than in those not receiving MMT. Kaplan–Meier curves of the incidence of motor vehicle collisions differed significantly between groups, with a significant increased risk during the first 90 days of follow-up. In conclusion, drivers receiving MMT have higher motor vehicle collision risk than those not receiving MMT in opiate users, and it is worthy of noticing road safety in such drivers, particularly during the first 90 days of MMT.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In 2019, 58 million people were estimated to use opioids – a group of substances that include drugs like heroin and morphine.

Iatrogenic opioid dependence has become an epidemic in many developed countries, particularly the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson, 2017</xref>); in other countries, the number of people using heroin is steadily increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2018</xref>). Opioid dependence clearly presents a public health challenge worldwide. Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is a primary medication-assisted treatment for opioid dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hall et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kleber, 2008</xref>).

Hence, older research described little or no difference in cognitive functioning between MMT patients and healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gordon, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gritz et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Appel and Gordon, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grevert et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Appel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robinson and Moskowitz, 1985</xref>).Given such trends, it is likely that when compared with a higher dose of methadone, MMT patients using a stable dose non-significantly impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moskowitz and Robinson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kelley et al., 1978</xref>).

However, MMT itself may elevate the motor vehicle collision risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bramness et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corsenac et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leveille et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Thus far, few observational epidemiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bramness et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corsenac et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leveille et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babst et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blomberg and Preusser, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maddux et al., 1977</xref>) have been published on the relationship between motor vehicle collisions and MMT; of these, three were performed in the 1970s and used a case-comparison design to investigate drivers receiving MMT in the United States in small-to-medium-sized cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babst et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blomberg and Preusser, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maddux et al., 1977</xref>). Their results indicated no significant differences in the rate of motor vehicle collisions between drivers receiving MMT and healthy controls. By contrast, three more recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bramness et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corsenac et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leveille et al., 1994</xref>) found that patients receiving buprenorphine maintenance treatment or MMT had a significantly increased incidence of motor vehicle collisions. Although these studies used medium-to-large-sized cohorts, they neglected some potential risk factors for motor vehicle collisions among drivers receiving MMT, particularly opiate use. Most patients receiving MMT in the aforementioned studies had a history of opioid or heroin dependence. Analgesic opioid users have a 1.8 times higher motor vehicle collision risk than do nonusers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leveille et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, heroin users have higher motor vehicle collision risk than do healthy people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edwards and Quartaro, 1978</xref>). Thus, opiate use history must be identified when estimating motor vehicle collision risks related to MMT use. Few studies have proposed effective measures for motor vehicle collision prevention in drivers receiving MMT.</p><p>To investigate whether drivers receiving MMT have an increased motor vehicle collision risk, we analyzed nationwide motor vehicle collision incidence rate in three groups as preliminary data: general adult population, adult opiate users, and adults receiving MMT. Furthermore, by using these data, we created population-based matched retrospective cohorts of new opiate users receiving and not receiving MMT. Moreover, we should provide some suggestions for early prevention of motor vehicle collisions in opiate users receiving MMT.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Data source</title><p>Data were retrieved from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu and Lee, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2019</xref>) and six Taiwanese population-based administrative registries, namely the management information system of substitution maintenance therapy, Ministry of Health and Welfare, the road accident registry of injurious crashes, National Police Agency, Ministry of the Interior, and four independent management information systems at the Ministry of Justice, Republic of China (Taiwan).

In the 7-year cohort study with frequency-matched controls, the motor vehicle collision incidence rate among opiate users was significantly higher in those receiving MMT than in those not receiving MMT. This rate drastically increased in opiate users receiving MMT during the first 90 days of follow-up. Rural area residents had increased motor vehicle collision risk. Although the occurrences of motor vehicle collisions in drivers under the influence of current opiate use, current opiate use during opiate withdrawal, BZD, and alcohol are higher than those receiving MMT, these factors (such as the history of BZD, antidepressants, and alcohol exposed) were nonsignificantly increased risk of motor vehicle collisions in opiate users receiving MMT.</p><p>In the preliminary analysis based on the nationwide CIRs of motor vehicle collisions, the CIRs in the general and opiate-using adult populations slowly increased toward a peak, followed by a slight decline. By contrast, the CIR in adults receiving MMT remained high, without such fluctuation. The risk of motor vehicle collisions was 1.45–1.62 times higher in adult opiate users and 1.66–2.34 times higher in adults receiving MMT than in the general adult population. Thus, adults receiving MMT had a consistently higher rate of motor vehicle collisions than did the general adult population. These findings corroborate those of three observational studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bramness et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corsenac et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leveille et al., 1994</xref>). These results do not eliminate the effects of interfering factors such as opiate use because most of the participants used opiates before receiving MMT. Furthermore, we included a retrospective cohort of opiate users receiving and not receiving MMT to eliminate such effects.</p><p>In this cohort study, among 3036 opiate users, those receiving MMT had a significantly higher motor vehicle collision risk than did those without such treatment. The percentage of opiate users with a motor vehicle collision event was approximately three times higher in the participants receiving MMT than in those not receiving MMT (6.5% vs. 2.2%). Compared with opiate users not receiving MMT, those receiving MMT had an increased risk of BZD (Z-drug) or antidepressant use, a result consistent with those of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bramness et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corsenac et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bramness and Kornør, 2007</xref>). Univariate analysis showed that factors predictive of motor vehicle collisions in opiate users included a history of DUI, antidepressant use, BZD (Z-drug) use, and motor vehicle collisions. We found no significant difference in the incidence rate of motor vehicle collisions between the opiate user groups with respect to history of motor vehicle collisions, DUI, antidepressant use, and BZD (Z-drug) use. These findings suggest that these risk factors for motor vehicle collisions in the general population may nonsignificantly affect motor vehicle collisions in adult opiate users receiving MMT. Our results corroborate those of previous studies, demonstrating a positive correlation between motor vehicle collision risk and drivers’ exposure to methadone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bramness et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corsenac et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leveille et al., 1994</xref>). In addition, our findings underscore the importance of considering motor vehicle collision risk during the first 90 days of methadone treatment. Authorities, physicians, and methadone users and their families should be educated regarding the elevated risk to prevent motor vehicle collisions. Further studies are needed to determine whether a policy forbidding driving during the first 90 days of MMT could effectively reduce motor vehicle collision risk.</p><p>The cause underlying the correlation between motor vehicle collisions and MMT use remains controversial. Studies have shown that methadone causes no or only slight impairment of psychomotor performance, particularly in chronic MMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Specka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rothenberg et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Curran et al., 2001</xref>). By contrast, other studies have shown that methadone-maintained patients experience cognitive deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Specka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Staak et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dittert et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Darke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mintzer et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, following 6 months of MMT compared to the first month, improved visuospatial construction and executive function, but no change in memory or attention performance, were found in a cross-sectional study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soyka et al., 2010</xref>). Our results clearly demonstrate an elevated risk of motor vehicle collisions in drivers receiving MMT, particularly during the first 90 days of treatment. One possible explanation for this result is that MMT causes cognitive impairment only during the early stages of treatment.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The major strength of our study is the use of a population-based sample of nationwide motor vehicle collision incidences and a case-comparison cohort for motor vehicle collisions. The findings may provide the basis for designing measures to prevent motor vehicle collisions during MTT, particularly in ethnic Chinese populations. Most observational studies showed different risks of motor vehicle collisions between two populations (the general population and the MMT population). We not only added the third population (the opiate-using population) in the preliminary study but also controlled for the potentially contributing factor of opioid use in the cohort study of opiate users receiving MMT and those not receiving. Furthermore, the data are not subject to reporting or recall bias because we used high-quality data from six administrative registries and the NHIRD. Nevertheless, we acknowledge several limitations. First, the administrative data was the lack of information on road exposure (driven hours or distances in a given period) because unobservable differences between the road exposure may confound the relationship of interest. Motor vehicle collisions in the study were assessed using the police registry. Hence, unreported or minor motor vehicle collisions may not be included in our analysis. Second, the number of opiate users and duration of opiate use may be underestimated. Opiate use is often underreported because it is illegal in Taiwan. Moreover, opioid doses were recognized much higher risks among MMT users than among non-MMT opioid users; hence, opiate dose was uncaptured because it was unavailable in our database. The data about enrollment in a nongovernmental organization institution for rehabilitation and severity of opiate use were lacking. Third, data from drivers’ licenses were lacking in our registry. Although motor vehicle collision risk may be underestimated in the study, we excluded participants aged &lt;20 years to diminish underestimation. Fourth, the degree of exposure to unfavorable road conditions and information regarding unsafe road infrastructure, inadequate traffic laws, car speed, driver fatigue, talking on cell phones, and unsafe vehicles was unavailable in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">World Health Organization, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engeland et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">World Health Organization, 2004</xref>). Finally, the NHIRD only provides information regarding the dispensing of prescribed medications. Because nonadherence is considered a potential confounder, caution should be exercised when comparing our findings with the results reported by other groups in which data are collected from clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engeland et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">World Health Organization, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babst et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blomberg and Preusser, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maddux et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edwards and Quartaro, 1978</xref>).</p><p>In line with previous findings, we provided compelling evidence that opiate users on MTT have a significantly increased motor vehicle collision risk. Individuals receiving MMT should be informed of this risk, so that they can take appropriate measures to prevent motor vehicle collisions, particularly during the first 90 days of MMT and if living in rural areas.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Miss Mei-Hsin Ho for her assistance and reference management.

The results indicate that rates of motor vehicle collisions are increased in adults on methadone maintenance compared even with opiate users not on methadone maintenance. This study is of growing importance as the opioid misuse crisis continues world-wide and as methadone maintenance therapy is made more broadly available to a growing population with opioid use disorders.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Risk of motor vehicle accidents after methadone use&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Michael Taffe as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The methods are not described sufficiently for a full evaluation of the study. It is essential to address all the comments made by the reviewers regarding how the subjects were selected, matched, defined, etc. These characteristics of the sample then need to be addressed in the Discussion.</p><p>2) The manuscript does not go far enough in addressing the potential impact of intoxicants, of severity of OUD, of trying to account for accident rates in active users, etc. Additional methodological details and correlates such as the time of day of the accidents may address some of these concerns.</p><p>3) The conclusions should be carefully contextualized in terms of the magnitude of any risks, the context of enhanced rates of accidents, the risks of untreated OUD patients, etc. These results are likely to inform MMT practices and as such the manuscript should discuss these implications thoughtfully and carefully.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Tsai and colleagues report a study of the rate of motor vehicle accidents in populations of opioid users on methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) versus those not on MMT and matched control non-opioid users. In the context of the ongoing opioid use crisis in many countries around the world, and the growing efforts to treat users with methadone maintenance therapy (MMT), it is critical to understand the risks and benefits of such therapies. This study addresses motor vehicle accident rates in opioid users in MMT as compared with the general adult population but also includes assessment of opioid users who are not on MMT. This inclusion is a key advance of understanding the risks of MMT. The study captures national statistics in Taiwan for a 7 year period (2009-2016) which include 3036 opioid users of which 1012 were in MMT. The first approach was to compare the incidence of motor vehicle accidents in each population in each year of the data interval. These data show the highest rates in MMT users and the lowest in the general population for each year of study. Most importantly, by tracking individuals after an index date of the first MMT dose in this group, and a matched date for the non-MMT controls, this study shows the cumulative probability of a motor vehicle accident increases more rapidly in the MMT opioid group versus the non-MMT opioid group in the first 100 days after the index date.</p><p>Major strengths of this study include the capture of a large number of individuals through national databases, the comparison of MMT and non-MMT opioid users groups and the determination of the latency of motor vehicle accidents after the initiation of therapy. Minor strengths are captured by the inclusion of covariates such as a prior history of motor vehicle accidents, driving under the influence and benzodiazepine use.</p><p>One major limitation of this study, as presented, lies in a lack of clarity about the opioid use history of the subjects as the approach only captures their first interaction with law enforcement. Relatedly, the manuscript is unclear about the matching of non-MMT and MMT subjects in terms of their opioid use history and other characteristics. The Discussion does not address this with any indication of the factors in Taiwan that determine whether an opioid users is placed on MMT or not, particularly with respect to opioid use intensity and longevity of the pattern, and does not address how this may have affected the results. Minor limitations of the study are that the MMT group had significantly lower education level and more exposure to benzodiazepines and less to antidepressants compared with the non-MMT control group, but the study does not describe the likely magnitude of the contribution of these factors to accident rates. The study has largely achieved the aims of the authors by investigating the risks posed by MMT for motor vehicle accidents. The results presented confirm increased risk and show that it develops over the first 100 days. These results potentially contribute to reduce public harm by suggesting increased caution for MMT patients in the several months after initiation of therapy.</p><p>1. Results, Page 11: The final paragraph is confusing, perhaps because it is not well described in the methods or the results that this analysis (and that in the lower panel of Figure 3) focuses on the sub-populations who did eventually get in a motor vehicle accident. This is not directly stated anywhere so if this is not true, then it is even less clear what is being depicted in Figure 3.</p><p>2. Figure 3: It is unclear from the legend and the labels on the axes what is being shown in the upper panel of Figure 3. The legend should be revised to make this very clear.</p><p>3. Discussion Page 13: &quot;this rate declined drastically…during the first 90 days.&quot; This appears to be referring to the lower panel of Figure 3 in which the cumulative rate of motor vehicle accidents <italic>increased</italic> over the first 90 days. This all needs to be better clarified, particularly with respect to the year intervals reported in Figure 3, upper panel.</p><p>4. Discussion Page 14: It appears from the Introduction comment that the &quot;3 observational studies&quot; cited did not feature a non-MMT group with an opioid use history? If that is the case it should be re-emphasized here since this appears to be a strength of this manuscript.</p><p>5.

Methods, Page 18-19: It appears to be the case that all opioid users would have to have a conviction for use of illicit drugs.

The treatment with MMT play an important successful role for control HIV infection in Taiwan patient with OUD, and OUD patient must regular take methadone every day.</p><p>4. Opiate users not receiving MMT may be just discharged from jail or enrolled in a NGO institution for rehabilitation, or their current severity of opiate use may not met the OUD criteria, or the current severity in non-MMT group may less than receiving MMT group (because received MMT case must met the criteria of OUD, and most case presents in severe degree). In addition, persistent opiate user may more high risk of MVA and other accident if not receiving any treatment, because persistent current opiate (heroin) user shows high craving for drug, or presents in withdrawal state.

Individuals were eligible for inclusion if they were new users of opioids between 2010 and 2016. Individuals were excluded if they: were registered as new opioid users prior to age 20 years; used opioids prior to 2010 (I believe the washout period was 2007 – 2009); had incomplete information on age, sex, or &quot;multiplicity&quot; (I did not understand the final term and wonder if the authors intended to use another word); or if they were subsequently incarcerated.</p><p>The index date for the MMT group was the date of first MMT administration. I had difficulty understanding the index date for the control group. The primary outcome of interest was subsequent police-reported motor vehicle collision (MVC). Individuals were followed until MVC, death, end of follow-up in registry records, or end of study interval.</p><p>Using a proportional hazards model to assess MVC-free survival, researchers report that the hazards of MVC were significantly higher among MMT users than among controls (crude hazard ratio, 3.0). After adjustment for income level, urbanity, education status, history of motor vehicle accidents, prior alcohol-impaired driving, prescription Z-drug exposure, and antidepressant use, researchers report that the adjusted hazard ratio for MVC was 2.8-fold higher among individuals receiving MMT relative to individuals receiving non-methadone opioids. The researchers conclude that MMT is associated with subsequent MVC.</p><p>The manuscript has a number of strengths. First, the researchers aim to examine an important question that has implications for clinicians, patients, family members and motor transport administrators. Second, the use of administrative data can generate large sample sizes and might make results more reflective of real-world experience. Third, use of police-reported crash data can avoid the social desirability bias that afflicts studies based on self-report.</p><p>However, the manuscript also has a number of major limitations:</p><p>– The unusual organization and writing style of the manuscript made it difficult for me to understand the methods and results, which in turn made it difficult to assess the manuscript strengths and weaknesses. The writing requires substantial revision before readers could reasonably be expected to fairly assess the data that is presented. In terms of organization, I was surprized to see that &quot;Materials and methods&quot; followed &quot;Discussion&quot;.</p><p>– What population were the new MMT users drawn from? Figure 1 suggests these individuals are justice system data rather than from medical data. Were these individuals compelled to undertake MMT as part of a criminal conviction? It was surprizing that there were only 1012 individuals with new MMT starts over a period of 7 years in a country of 23 million people. Indeed, the box for the SMT database in Figure 1 suggests almost 36,000 individuals started MMT between 2007 and 2016. A more fulsome discussion of the data sets and their inclusion criteria might help readers understand these issues better.</p><p>– Similarly, who were the control individuals? Were these new users of <italic>prescription</italic> non-methadone opioids? Did they have acute pain (e.g. after a surgery) or chronic pain (e.g. osteoarthritis)? Were the non-methadone opioids prescribed as opioid agonist therapy (e.g. MS Contin, suboxone)? Were they <italic>illicit</italic> opioids? If there was a medical indication for opioid use, why were these individuals in data sets from the justice system? Readers will need to understand the control group better in order to interpret the results.</p><p>– As mentioned above, I did not understand how the index date for the control group was established. The manuscript would benefit from a clearer explanation of this point.</p><p>– A major weakness of analyses that use administrative data is the lack of information on road exposure (hours or distance driven in a given period). Unobservable differences in road exposure can confound the relationship of interest. For example, if the control group contains many people prescribed opioids after major surgery, it is plausible that many of these individuals would not be driving and therefore not at risk of crash as they recovered from surgery. They would therefore be an unfair control group. This reiterates the importance of understanding the sampling frame from which the control group is drawn.</p><p>– The authors used a proportional hazards model, but their results suggest the proportional hazards assumption was violated. Another method might be more appropriate.</p><p>– How did researchers build their model? Why did they include MVC history, history of alcohol-impaired driving, antidepressant use and Z-drug use in their final model if they were not significant on adjusted analysis? Is there a reason to believe these are confounders?</p><p>My main points and suggestions are captured above. However, I would like to encourage the researchers to publish their work after more clearly describing their methods and potentially after revising their analysis. The topic is interesting, timely and important. Their data sources are extensive and easily linked. I think a substantially revised manuscript might contribute substantially to the literature on this topic.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Risk of motor vehicle accidents after methadone use&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The old abbreviation MVAs is wrong because it is not equal to the current motor vehicle collision item! motor vehicle accident (MVA)</p><p>2. The conclusion continues to be too arbitrary, because the study suggests that we should prohibit from driving during MMT. However, in actual clinical practice, driving during heroin use or in a heroin withdrawal state may be more dangerous. The retrospective data analysis could not explain the patient severity or patient's condition. In general concept, patient with severe opiate use disorder (OUD) need MMT than mild or moderate opiate users, and the occasional/ or mild opiate users do not require MMT. Therefore, the severity of OUD may be the main factor affecting motor vehicle accident (collision) as in the figure 2 and 3.</p><p>3. The method remain unclear such as what reason that the punitive administrative system for the use of Category 3 or 4 Narcotics only. what this study do not used the Category 1 or 2? and Which category of narcotics does opiate belong to in Taiwan?</p><p>4. In figure 1, the Substitution maintenance therapy (SMT) is same the Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) ?</p><p>5. The case number is unclear such as the new registry of opiate users between 2010 and 2016 (N=15996), but the new registry of opiate users with MMT (N=1145) and without MMT (N=14158), and 1145+14158 unequal to 15996. The opiate number in management information system of SMT have 35927 peoples from 2007-2016, but 2010-2016 only remain 1145, the proportion and frequency are inappropriate.</p><p>6. The number of exclusion criteria (N-153, and N=540) is also unclear, during Patient with OUD received SMT (2007-2016, N=35927) in figure 1. These data will confuse the readers.</p><p>7. The Ethics Statement that the study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (TSMH IRB No.: 17-010-B1 and 18-049-B), but the statement shows Important flaws/ Disadvantage, because the IRB from TSMH IRB (TSMH is a local hospital, this institute have not FERCAP and AAHRPP approved) and all author affiliations do not from this hospital. However, the corresponding authors affiliations such as National Taiwan University and Kaohsiung Medical University IRB were approved by FERCAP and AAHRPP. the three corresponding authors affiliations (Jui-Hsiu Tsai affiliation: Dalin Tzu Chi Hospital/ Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hung-Yi Chuang affiliation: Kaohsiung Medical University, Yue Leon Guo affiliation: National Taiwan University, and first author affiliations (Ya-Hui Yang) : Fooyin University, Kaohsiung</p><p>8. Data were retrieved from NHRID, and 6 Taiwanese population-based administrative registries (such as Ministry of Health and Welfare, the road accident registry of injurious crashes, National Police Agency, Ministry of the Interior, and Ministry of Justice), this scientific study should provide the approved document from these 6 population-based administrative registries. In addition, the NHRID do not the data of National Police Agency, Ministry of the Interior, and Ministry of Justice.

They would therefore be an unfair control group.

These authorities imported related data into HWDC after they agreed with us.</p><p>Second, we applied and provided the document by a local hospital (TSMH IRB).</p><p>Third, we submitted the above 2 documents to the Health and Welfare Data Science Center (HWDC), Ministry of Health and Welfare (Line the last 1 Page 9 and Line 1 Page 10) for applying for use of these database. HWDC provide a research platform to connect different database data by unique national identification numbers (ID).</p><p>Finally, we performed data analysis and statistical analysis in the HWDC.</p><p>For the consideration of privacy protection, all of the personal identifications are recorded, only authorized researchers are permitted to process databases in a separated designate area, and only statistical results are allowed to be carried out for publications.</p><p>So we provided and quoted the paper because HWDC and NHRID were detailed in this paper (Line 2 Page 10 and Line the last 2-4 Page 29). You should see the Data availability section on Page 25.</p><p>We also added this sentence (below) in the Material and methods section on Line 4-7 Page 10.</p><p>“Data from different systems were linked using the unique national identification numbers assigned to each citizen in Taiwan. […] Personal identifiers were removed after the linkage and before the analysis.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
