Among the molecular mediators shown to regulate this form of plasticity, synaptic signaling through retinoic acid (RA) and its receptor, RARα, has been shown to be critically involved in the homeostatic adjustment of synaptic transmission in both hippocampus and sensory cortices. In this study, we explore the molecular mechanism through which postsynaptic RA and RARα regulates presynaptic neurotransmitter release during prolonged synaptic inactivity at mouse glutamatertic synapses. We show that RARα binds to a subset of dendritically sorted brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<italic>Bdnf</italic>) mRNA splice isoforms and represses their translation. The RA-mediated translational de-repression of postsynaptic BDNF results in the retrograde activation of presynaptic tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptors, facilitating presynaptic homeostatic compensation through enhanced presynaptic release. Together, our study illustrates an RA-mediated retrograde synaptic signaling pathway through which postsynaptic protein synthesis during synaptic inactivity drives compensatory changes at the presynaptic site.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>homeostatic plasticity</kwd><kwd>retrograde synaptic signaling</kwd><kwd>RARα</kwd><kwd>presynaptic function</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH086403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS11566001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD104458</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Synaptic silencing-induced homeostatic enhancement of presynaptic glutamate release is mediated by the postsynaptic retinoic acid-dependent brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) synthesis from dendritically targeted BDNF transcripts, leading to retrograde activation of presynaptic tropomyosin receptor kinase B receptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Activity in neural circuits is highly dynamic and is continuously subjected to experience-dependent changes due to synaptic plasticity. Information processing that optimally interprets the external world is vital for the survival of an organism and requires precisely timed and well-orchestrated excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in neural circuits. Hebbian plasticity is considered to be the cellular mechanism underwriting memory formation. By contrast, homeostatic synaptic plasticity counters the self-reinforcing nature of Hebbian plasticity, thus maintaining network stability while preserving its capacity for information processing. Retinoic acid (RA), a well-documented developmental morphogen, has emerged in recent studies as a critical molecular component in homeostatic synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Chronic synaptic inactivity at glutamatergic synapses triggers RA synthesis in neuronal dendrites, which in turn drives local synthesis and synaptic incorporation of GluA1 containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and concomitant removal of γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) from inhibitory synapses, thus restoring synaptic excitatory/inhibitory balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aoto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sarti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maghsoodi et al., 2008</xref>). The RA receptor RARα is a nuclear receptor that mediates RA-dependent transcriptional activation during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chambon, 1996</xref>). In mature neurons, however, RARα translocates out of the nucleus and acts as a molecular mediator for RA-dependent de novo protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Poon and Chen, 2008</xref>). In the context of homeostatic synaptic plasticity, RARα has been shown to bind to mRNAs via specific sequence motifs, and mediate the translation of these mRNAs in an RA-dependent manner. For example, activation of GluA1 synthesis upon chronic synaptic activity blockade has been demonstrated to require both RA synthesis and normal RARα expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aoto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maghsoodi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Several aspects of RA-mediated homeostatic regulation of postsynaptic function have been addressed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sarti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maghsoodi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Poon and Chen, 2008</xref>). Additionally, changes in presynaptic functions (i.e. release probability) as part of homeostatic synaptic mechanism have also been documented in multiple organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lindskog et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Thiagarajan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Davis and Müller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Murthy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jakawich et al., 2010</xref>). Compared to <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junctions (a type of glutamatergic synapse exhibiting robust presynaptic homeostatic plasticity), less is known about the signaling pathways involved in the homeostatic presynaptic changes at mammalian synapses. One of the classical synaptic retrograde messengers, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), was found to be involved in the homeostatic regulation of presynaptic release in cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jakawich et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, both postsynaptic AMPAR blockade-induced activation of RA signaling and the phospholipase D (PLD)-mTORC1 signaling pathway have been implicated in dendritic protein synthesis in the context of homeostatic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Henry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Henry et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we explore whether and how synaptic RA/RARα signaling modulates postsynaptic BDNF synthesis during chronic synaptic inactivity in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We show that RARα is directly associated with specific dendritically localized <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA isoforms. This enables RA-induced translational de-repression of BDNF synthesis in dendrites, resulting in retrograde activation of presynaptic tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptors and upregulation of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequencies.

We have previously shown that in older (21 days in vitro [DIV]) but not younger (14 DIV) cultured primary hippocampal neurons, chronic treatment with postsynaptic activity blockers such as the AMPAR antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) or L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) inhibitor nifedipine results in a significant increase in both mEPSC frequency and mEPSC amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, consistent with the literature, while the increase in mEPSC amplitude is observed in both young and old cultured neurons, the enhancement in frequency is only present in the older cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, this increase in both mEPSC frequency and amplitude requires RA synthesis as pharmacological inhibition of RA synthesis blocks the increase in both parameters. Additionally, RA synthesis in postsynaptic neurons triggers presynaptic changes in a cell-autonomous manner as sparse expression of a dihydropyridine-insensitive L-VDCC, which specifically blocks RA synthesis in transfected postsynaptic neurons, prevented the nifedipine-induced homeostatic increase in mEPSC frequency. However, what remains unanswered is where and through what molecular signaling pathway RA acts to trigger presynaptic changes.</p><p>To first establish that RA also increases mEPSC frequency in older organotypic cultured hippocampal slices, we measured mEPSCs in WT neurons from 21–25 DIV slice cultures after acute RA treatment (10 μM, 4 hr). A significant increase in both mEPSC amplitude and frequency in CA1 pyramidal neurons was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), replicating our previous findings in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). To further understand the cellular mechanisms driving mEPSC frequency changes, we measured paired-pulse ratios (PPRs) of the evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs). RA treatment significantly reduced the PPRs, suggesting potential enhancement of presynaptic function by RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We have previously reported the induction of silent synapses during tetrodotoxin (TTX)-induced homeostatic synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arendt et al., 2013</xref>). To understand whether activation of silent synapses may be contributing to the mEPSC frequency increases by RA, we measured eEPSC failure rate at both –60 and +40 mV using a minimal stimulation protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arendt et al., 2013</xref>). The failure rates were comparable between –60 and +40 mV in both DMSO- and RA-treated slices, indicating little if any presence of postsynaptic silent synapses in these slices, and that activation of postsynaptic silent synapses is not a contributing factor to the mEPSC frequency changes observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, given that the mEPSC frequency increase only occurs in older slices, but not in younger ones where synaptogenesis is more robust, we think it is unlikely that new synapse formation underlies frequency increase. Taken together, these results are consistent with previous findings from both rodent and <italic>Drosophila</italic> studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Davis and Müller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jakawich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Subramanian and Dickman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bergquist et al., 2010</xref>) and demonstrate that modification of presynaptic release is a conserved homeostatic mechanism operating at glutamatergic synapses across species.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Postsynaptic RARα expression is required for presynaptic homeostatic plasticity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example traces of mEPSCs recorded from hippocampal pyramidal neurons in organotypic slices from WT (uninfected), presynaptic RARα KO (Cre expression in CA3) and postsynaptic RARα KO (Cre expression in CA1) groups treated with DMSO or RA (10 μM, 4 hr).

We injected Cre-expressing AAVs into either the CA3 or CA1 regions of the hippocampus to achieve pre- or postsynaptic-specific deletion of RARα in the Schaeffer collateral-CA1 synapses. Care was taken to achieve high infection efficiency in CA3 regions to ensure appropriate interpretation of results from presynaptic Cre-dependent deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Selective deletion of RARα in postsynaptic neurons (Cre expressed in CA1 neurons), but not presynaptic neurons (Cre expressed in CA3 neurons), blocked RA-induced homeostatic increases in both mEPSC amplitude and frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). Importantly, these results were also observed when homeostatic plasticity was induced with chronic synaptic activity blocker CNQX (20 µM, 36 hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which has been shown to induce de novo RA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).

Acute RA treatment in 21–25 DIV cultured slices significantly reduced mIPSC amplitudes as has been shown in younger slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sarti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, unlike those in younger neurons, the mIPSC frequency in these older neurons was also reduced by RA. These changes in inhibitory synaptic transmission were blocked by postsynaptic RARα deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This result is consistent with our previous observations showing that visual deprivation reduces both mIPSC amplitude and frequency in post-critical period layer 2/3 visual cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhong et al., 2018</xref>), indicating that the impact of RA on inhibitory synaptic transmission may be conserved across different brain regions. Given the differences in the nature of RA’s action on the presynaptic function of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, we focused the rest of the study on molecular mechanisms by which RA drives the enhancement of presynaptic function at excitatory synapses in the hippocampal neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RA activates BDNF synthesis through direct association between RARα and specific splice isoforms of dendritically localized <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNAs</title><p>A postsynaptically initiated mechanism of translational regulation mediated by RA-RARα signaling modulating presynaptic neurotransmitter release suggests the existence of a retrograde messenger molecule.

Specifically, the carboxyl-terminal F domain of RARα mediates direct binding to substrate mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This mRNA-binding ability is specific to RARα as another RA receptor family member RARβ, which has a different amino acid sequence in the F domain, shows only minimal association with dendritic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Poon and Chen, 2008</xref>). We first performed in vitro RNA-binding assay in which RARα LBD domain (including the F domain) was fused to GST and immobilized on glutathione Sepharose beads. GST alone, GST-tagged RARα LBD lacking F-domain (RARα LBD ΔF), and RARβ LBD were used as negative controls. Total RNAs pooled from 3- to 4-week-old whole hippocampi were used in the binding assay. GST and all fusion proteins showed comparable expression and binding to the beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). RT-PCR was used to test the relative enrichment of selected mRNAs by RARα. <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcripts containing exon 2 or exon 6 exhibited selective enrichment through binding to RARα LBD, along with <italic>Gria1</italic> mRNAs, an mRNA substrate of RARα identified in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Poon and Chen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

To address this, we examined RA-induced local translation of BDNF in synaptoneurosomes prepared from 3- to 4-week-old mouse hippocampi. The purity of synaptoneurosomal fraction was verified by the enrichment of synaptic protein PSD95 and the absence of nuclear protein histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). A brief treatment of synaptoneurosomes with 1 μM RA for 30 min at 37°C significantly increased GluA1 protein levels and demonstrated the translational competency of the synaptoneurosomal preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aoto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

To this end, we prepared organotypic hippocampal slice cultures from conditional knockout mice for either BDNF or TrkB, which allowed for dissection of the loci of action (pre vs. postsynaptic) for these two key players. Injection of Cre-expressing AAVs into either the CA3 or CA1 regions of the hippocampus achieved pre- or postsynaptic-specific deletion of target proteins in the Schaeffer collateral-CA1 synapses. Acute RA treatment or prolonged CNQX treatment significantly increased both mEPSC amplitudes and frequencies in uninfected control slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). While presynaptic deletion of BDNF did not impair either of these changes in mEPSCs, postsynaptic deletion of BDNF prevented the increase in mEPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>). By contrast, presynaptic, but not postsynaptic deletion of TrkB blocked the increase in frequency induced by either RA or CNQX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). Deletion of either BDNF or TrkB pre- or postsynaptically did not affect the homeostatic increase in mEPSC amplitude, indicating that BDNF/TrkB signaling is exclusively involved in regulation of presynaptic function. The locations of action for BDNF and TrkB are consistent with the postsynaptic initiation of RA synthesis followed by RARα-mediated translational regulation supporting the notion that retrograde BDNF signaling through presynaptic TrkB drives presynaptic changes during homeostatic synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Retrograde BDNF signalling is required for RARα-mediated regulation of presynaptic homeostatic scaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example traces of mEPSCs recorded from hippocampal pyramidal neurons in organotypic slices from WT (uninfected), presynaptic BDNF KO (Cre expression in CA3) and postsynaptic BDNF KO (Cre expression in CA1) groups treated with DMSO or RA (10 μM, 4 hr).

In visual cortical pyramidal neurons, exogenous BDNF blocks homeostatic upscaling induced by chronic synaptic inactivity while BDNF depletion with TrkB-IgG scales up mEPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rutherford et al., 1998</xref>). While these results suggest a potential involvement of BDNF signaling in cortical pyramidal neuron homeostatic plasticity, chronic treatment of BDNF does not downscale mEPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Leslie et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, BDNF’s effect on basal synaptic transmission seems to be cell type- and region-specific. Different from its effect on cortical pyramidal cells, BDNF increases mEPSC amplitudes in visual cortical interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rutherford et al., 1998</xref>). In the hippocampus, BDNF enhances mEPSC amplitudes without affecting their frequencies, but increases mIPSC frequency and sizes of GABAergic synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bolton et al., 2000</xref>).

Paradoxically, in the case of synaptic upscaling, postsynaptic release of BDNF as a retrograde messenger was also required in synaptic activity blockade-induced homeostatic increase in presynaptic vesicle turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lindskog et al., 2010</xref>) and mEPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jakawich et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, rapid activation of dendritic mTORC1 signaling was proposed to be a molecular mechanism for protein synthesis-dependent release of postsynaptic BDNF to mediate presynaptic homeostatic compensation under prolonged inactivation of postsynaptic AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Henry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Henry et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction, where robust homeostatic increase in presynaptic release occurs in response to reduced postsynaptic responsiveness, postsynaptic TOR activation is also required for the retrograde signaling that initiates the presynaptic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Penney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goel et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, although retrograde messenger systems participating in presynaptic homeostatic plasticity are likely distinct between vertebrate and invertebrate synapses, they nonetheless share a common requirement of upstream TOR/mTOR-dependent translational activation in the postsynaptic compartment, and a common functional outcome – the enhanced presynaptic release probability. Does the mTOR-dependent translational regulation acts in parallel to the RARα-dependent pathway? A previous study unexpectedly discovered that RARα clamps mTOR’s activity level during neuronal activation through inhibition of ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it remains to be explored as how the RA/RARα- and the mTOR-dependent pathways interact/integrate in the context of synaptic plasticity to achieve a concerted adjustment of pre- and postsynaptic changes.</p><p>How does the same synaptic signaling molecule (BDNF) act in seemingly opposite biological processes? The vastly diverse functions of BDNF in the nervous system have been attributed to tight spatial, temporal, and stimulus-dependent regulation of BDNF expression from its complex gene structure. Using a combination of individual promoters (served by initial eight non-coding exons in rodents) and polyadenylation sites, a single <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene could give rise to several different transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aid et al., 2007</xref>). Although it is widely accepted that most of these individual <italic>Bdnf</italic> promoters respond differentially to neuronal activity, the specific functional roles of most of these transcripts remain elusive. For instance, multiple studies have shown that promoter/exon IV is robustly involved in activity-dependent BDNF expression in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Timmusk et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sakata et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Martinowich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ratnu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hong et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, BDNF expression driven by promoter/exon I, III, and VI has been shown to be regulated by AP1 transcription factors and by TrkB signaling in a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">West, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tuvikene et al., 2016</xref>). However, how synaptic inactivity modulates specific exon-derived BDNF expression and which regulatory exons/promoters of the <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene respond to synaptic inactivity has never been explored. Further, how specific <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcripts contribute to homeostatic scaling is largely unknown. Our study focuses on the involvement of different <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcripts in synaptic inactivity-induced presynaptic upscaling. We found that dendritically localized <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcripts containing exon II and VI are subjected to RA/RARα-mediated regulation of synthesis in the postsynaptic compartment under chronic synaptic activity blockade. These newly synthesized BDNF acts retrogradely on presynaptic TrkB receptors to mediate homeostatic modulation of presynaptic function. An increase in <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcription and enhanced dendritic targeting of specific <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcripts have been associated with increased neuronal and synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Miyasaka and Yamamoto, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Horvath et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shimada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tongiorgi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">An et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Verpelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>). Our study shows that by acting on specific dendritically targeted <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcripts, RA/RARα selectively activates BDNF synthesis in postsynaptic compartments during synaptic inactivity, thus further extending the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying BDNF signaling in synaptic inactivity-induced synaptic plasticity.</p><p>Similar to the rodent <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene, the human <italic>BDNF</italic> gene has a complex structure with multiple transcription initiation sites and alternative transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pruunsild et al., 2007</xref>), and is implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Autry and Monteggia, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cattaneo et al., 2016</xref>). The involvement of synaptic RA/RARα signaling in various neuropsychiatric diseases has begun to emerge in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Crofton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Suzuki, 2021</xref>). In particular, the absence of RA-RARα-regulated homeostatic plasticity mechanisms have been established in both <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout mice (a mouse model for fragile X syndrome [FXS]) and human neurons differentiated from FXS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Soden and Chen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhong et al., 2018</xref>). The convergence of BDNF signaling and RA signaling for synaptic functions and homeostatic plasticity highlights the importance of understanding the intersections of various synaptic signaling pathways

All graphs represent average values ± SEM. Statistical differences were calculated according to parametric or nonparametric tests (indicated in figure legends). Comparisons between multiple groups were performed either with one-way ANOVA or with the two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test. When significant differences were observed, p values for pairwise comparisons were calculated according to two-tailed Mann-Whitney tests (for unpaired data) or Wilcoxon tests (for paired data). Comparisons between cumulative distributions were performed according to two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. p values are indicated in each figure.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Senior editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All mouse studies were performed according to protocols approved by the Stanford University Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care (#29679) .

acid-dependent signaling in response to synaptic inactivity drives the local synthesis of the neurotrophin BDNF in dendrites, which in turn is released to adaptively modify neurotransmitter release

BDNF has important roles in synaptic plasticity, but how retrograde BDNF signaling is controlled following synaptic inactivity is unclear. The authors use genetic tools to localize the action of different components of the pathway to pre- or post-synaptic compartments and use biochemical approaches to define a molecular link between retinoic acid and local translation of distinct BDNF transcripts. The findings presented here fill a gap in our knowledge regarding how presynaptic function is adaptively modulated by BDNF by highlighting the role of RA in this process. The experiments have been well-executed and the data provide compelling support for the model proposed by the authors. There are, however, some important issues to address:</p><p>1) Evaluate the relative infection efficiency in CA3 neurons: This is critical in interpreting the negative result with RARa deltion. The pre-synaptic Cre expression would require a high percentage of CA3 neurons infected. From Figure 3, it appears this is achieved, but some information on this point would be helpful. Also in the results text for Figure 1, it should mention the use of AAV to express Cre (this is mentioned for Figure 3 but not Figure 1).</p><p>2) Define and discuss what the change in mEPSC frequency means: Changes in mEPSC frequency may reflect multiple synaptic adaptations – changes in presynaptic release probability or alterations in synapse numbers. The experiments done clearly delineate pre- and/or postsynaptic roles for RARα, BDNF, and TrkB, but alone, mEPSC frequency changes could reflect either enhanced release probability, growth of new synaptic contacts, or AMPAR recruitment to silent synapses. The authors should explicitly address these potential alternative interpretations early on in the paper. There is substantial evidence from other studies that the mEPSC frequency changes under these conditions reflect altered presynaptic release as the authors suggest, and making contact with this literature would make the conclusions of this paper that much more compelling.</p><p>3) Discuss discrepancies with previous studies: The issue of age (of culture and animals) on whether this form of pre-synaptic plasticity occurs is important (although was also established in the earlier Wang paper). Some papers have reported frequency changes during HSP but many have reported no changes (including several from the Chen lab). Age/DIV seems to explain at least some of the difference, but I haven't gone through all the papers to check. It does seem that BDNF levels are increased even by 14DIV for slice cultures (Figure 2A). What age of slice cultures were used in early papers (like Aoto, 2008; this information was missing from that paper)? This has been a contentious issue over the years, and since this offers a potential resolution to the discrepancies, more discussion of it is warranted.</p><p>4) Assess mIPSC changes: It is noted in the discussion that BDNF can increase mIPSC frequency. Does this happen here? During HSP, at least post-synaptically, excitatory and inhibitory synapses are inversely regulated. But it is possible miniature frequency is increased for both types. Or maybe not – either way, it would be interesting to define. Perhaps mIPSC amplitude goes down, but maybe that also hasn't been shown at these older ages/DIV. Looking at mIPSCs would extend impact and improve the paper.</p><p>5) Improved discussion and integration with previous work in the field: The results demonstrate a role for RA in controlling local dendritic BDNF synthesis and suggest RARα binding as a mechanism. As the authors note, previous work has similarly implicated the mTORC1 signaling pathway in local BDNF translation in response to synaptic inactivity. Parallel findings have been observed at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction. The authors may want to speculate in the discussion on whether these two pathways work together or in parallel during homeostatic plasticity.</p><p>6) Respond to several points of clarification:</p><p>– Figures 1 and 3 include mEPSC traces where the background has been sharded to color coordinate with the respective histograms. This was likely done to make the figures easier to read, but the shading is somewhat distracting and really does the opposite. This is not a major issue as it does not affect the data or its interpretation, but the figures would be improved if either the traces themselves are colored or the shading is simply removed.</p><p>– The authors should consider superimposing the individual data points over the histograms for the electrophysiology data shown in Figure 1B-C and Figure 3B-F</p><p>– The model shown in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 very nicely summarizes the RA pathway, but could also be used to include other work in the field that implicates other pathways (e.g., the mTORC1 pathway).</p><p>– In the introduction, the phrase 'runaway tendency' is vague and not obvious as to its meaning. Perhaps another phrase would be better.</p><p>– The figure labels could be improved. Pre-KO and post-KO can be misinterpreted –</p><p>&quot;Pre-KO&quot; could be misinterpreted as being before the Cre expression manifested. Maybe &quot;pre-syn KO&quot; and &quot;post-syn KO&quot; would be easier to understand when initially looking at the figures?</p><p>– The e-phys figures probably should show the data points (in the modern style) instead of just being bar graphs. And shouldn't the ephys statistics be 2-way ANOVAs instead of just t-tests? This likely won't impact the results but would be better.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall these findings fill a gap in our knowledge regarding how presynaptic function is adaptively modulated following postsynaptic inhibition and the connection between RA and BDNF in this process. The experiments in Figure 2 are well controlled and provide compelling evidence that RARalpha binds to BDNF mRNA transcripts, while Figures 1 and 3 localize activity in pre- vs post-synaptic compartments. A plausible model is presented in Figure S3 to describe how chronic inactivity at synapses initiates retrograde homeostatic signaling through RA and BDNF. This is a relatively brief manuscript and a question is raised about whether the specific results regarding RARalpha binding to BDNF mRNA to provide a sufficient enough advance beyond what was already known. However, the real advance here is in connecting RA to the previous work on retrograde BDNF signaling at presynaptic terminals, and separating this from what is known about postsynaptic control of AMPAR synthesis and receptor scaling. This provides an important foundation to understand the signaling systems that orchestrate pre- and post-synaptic responses to synaptic inactivity. Below are some important questions and experiments for the authors to consider.</p><p>1. Overall, the authors provide very good controls, both positive and negative, for BDNF mRNA binding to RARalpha. That being said, it seems a good control could be performed using their synaptoneurosome preparation: Add RA to synaptoneurosome preparations from the pre vs. postsynaptic RARalpha cKOs in Figure 1 to determine whether BDNF is still increased. This would be a great confirmation that postsynaptic RARalpha is necessary.</p><p>2. Can the authors further refine and/or separate the postsynaptic actions of glutamate receptor blockade/chronic inactivity between RA/RARalpha-mediated responses protein synthesis more generally? In terms of the presynaptic plasticity studied in this manuscript, both RA and BDNF seem to function in the same pathway, requiring modulation of BDNF protein synthesis by RARalpha. This retrograde signaling by BDNF is clearly distinct from the pathways that control postsynaptic homeostatic responses to inactivity, such as AMPAR synthesis and receptor scaling. Can the authors determine or define what responses are protein synthesis-dependent, RA/RARalpha-independent in the postsynaptic compartment?</p><p>3. Do the authors have any insights into what the increase in mEPSC frequency actually means for how presynaptic function is changing due to retrograde BDNF signaling gated by RA?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper examines the role of retinoic acid (RA) in regulating feedback control of presynaptic neurotransmitter release via postsynaptic synthesis and release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The authors show that deletion of RA receptor α (RARα) in CA1 neurons of organotypic slices prevents the increase in mEPSC frequency that accompanies RA administration or chronic block of AMPA receptors in these cells. Importantly, deletion in presynaptic CA3 neurons has no effect, indicating a postsynaptic role for RARα. The authors then demonstrate that RARα (but not RARβ) binds specific BDNF transcripts (containing exons 2 and 6) that have been shown by previous studies to localize to distal dendrites, and that RA administration drives BDNF synthesis in isolated synaptic fractions (synaptoneurosomes). Finally, through conditional deletion experiments targeting either the pre- or postsynaptic compartment, the authors demonstrate a postsynaptic role for BDNF and a presynaptic role for its receptor TrkB in presynaptic compensation driven by RA or AMPAR blockade, revealing a transsynaptic feedback mechanism requiring postsynaptic release of BDNF and presynaptic BDNF-TrkB signaling.</p><p>The experiments have all been well executed with appropriate controls and the data provide compelling support for the conclusions of the paper. These results are important, as they reveal a homeostatic control mechanism regulating presynaptic function mediated by RA signaling that appears to operate in parallel with the well-established postsynaptic compensation mechanism first described by this group and validated by others. The findings have broad implications for our understanding of homeostatic regulation at synapses and are of significant general interest. I have just a few suggestions for the authors to consider in revising their paper.</p><p>1) Strictly speaking, changes in mEPSC frequency may reflect multiple synaptic adaptations – changes in presynaptic release probability or alterations in synapse numbers. The experiments done clearly delineate pre- and/or postsynaptic roles for RARα, BDNF, and TrkB, but alone, mEPSC frequency changes could reflect either enhanced release probability, growth of new synaptic contacts, or AMPAR recruitment to silent synapses.

This is not a major issue as it does not affect the data or its interpretation, but I think the figures would be improved if either the traces themselves are colored or the shading is simply removed.</p><p>4) If possible, the authors should consider superimposing the individual data points over the histograms for the electrophysiology data shown in Figure 1B-C and Figure 3B-F.</p><p>5) The model shown in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 very nicely summarizes the RA pathway, but could also be used to include other work in the field that implicates other pathways (e.g., the mTORC1 pathway).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The main issue is one of novelty. The basic findings have been made before, with this lab already showing the activity blockade increase in mEPSC frequency is RA dependent (and age dependent), and other papers (cited in the text but maybe underemphasized; Jakawich and Lindskog) have shown that this increase in frequency was BDNF dependent, released post-synaptically and signaling pre-synaptically. And the RAR is a known transcriptional regulator. This paper nicely links these elements together but it is confirming what is expected. The specific BDNF transcript involved (exon II and IV) is the novel finding.</p><p>However, it is noted that in the discussion that BDNF can increase mIPSC frequency. Does this happen here?

Here the CNQX treatment was for 36 hours. Is this longer time necessary? Is RA induction slower at 21DIV? Or is only the frequency change slow and the amplitude change faster? Some explanation of this would be appropriate.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79863.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This manuscript probes the mechanism of postsynaptic retinoic acid (RA) signaling on presynaptic function.

Only slices infected with high titer AAV-Cre viruses and showed more than 90% infection efficacy in CA3 and no infection in CA1 were used for recordings (an example is shown in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1C). Additionally, for the data presented in the original submission, we used the same batch of AAV-Cre viruses (made in house) for the injection in all three types of cKO slices, thus the positive results in the presynaptic-TrkB KO slices served as quality control for our negative results in the presynaptic KO of RARα and BDNF.</p><p>We have added clear description of AAV-Cre injection scheme in the result text for Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Define and discuss what the change in mEPSC frequency means: Changes in mEPSC frequency may reflect multiple synaptic adaptations – changes in presynaptic release probability or alterations in synapse numbers.

Synaptogenesis, on the other hand, is most prominent during the first two weeks of culture. Thus, if no new synapse formation is induced by RA at 14 DIV, it is unlikely that it is induced in older and more mature cultures (see also Aoto et al., Neuron 2008, where we showed in Figure S1 that RA treatment does not induce new spine formation). (2) Newly formed synapses tend to be smaller in size with smaller unitary mEPSC amplitudes and will bring down the average mEPSC amplitudes. We have consistently observed the mEPSC amplitude increases in older cultures at a magnitude comparable to those observed in younger cultures. Thus, we concluded that new synapse formation is unlikely a mechanism contributing to the increase in mEPSC frequency.</p><p>To examine possible changes in release probability, we performed paired-pulse ratio measurement of the evoked EPSCs at the CA3-CA1 synapses. We found that RA indeed decreased PPF. This is consistent with the results reported in Jakawich et al., 2010. We concluded that an increase in presynaptic release probability is likely a main mechanism driving increased mEPSC frequencies. This new data is included in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1A.</p><p>To examine possible silent synapse involvement, we also measured failure rate using minimal stimulation protocol before and after RA treatment in the older cultures. We found no significant decrease in failure rate as a result of RA treatment. This new data is included in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1B. Additionally, similar to our argument against new synapse formation, newly activated silent synapses tend to have smaller mEPSC amplitudes and their involvement would lead to less or no increase in mean mEPSC amplitudes averaged from all synapses. Instead, we have observed robust increase in both amplitude and frequency of mEPSCs. Lastly, using presynaptic TrkB KO, we show unequivocally the involvement of presynaptic signaling while turning on silent synapses typically requires postsynaptic signaling mechanisms. [1]</p><p>Taken together, we believe that the main mechanisms contributing to RA-induced mEPSC frequency increase is the enhanced release probability. We have added some discussions in the text to cover these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Discuss discrepancies with previous studies: The issue of age (of culture and animals) on whether this form of pre-synaptic plasticity occurs is important (although was also established in the earlier Wang paper).

Our standard primary hippocampal cultures are made from P0 mouse or rat pups and experiments are usually conducted in DIV 12-14 neurons. This practice is widely adopted by many labs in the field, and was used by many of our early studies (and many other labs) in homeostatic plasticity because we were not aware of the age-dependent changes in presynaptic function at the time (Aoto et al., 2008; Turrigiano et al., 1998; Arendt et al., 2015; Kim and Ziff, 2014; to name a few). The mEPSC frequency increases were generally reported in studies using older primary cultures (DIV 17- 21). For example, in our hands and also in the studies by the Sutton lab, we observed frequency changes reliably in DIV21 culture (Jakawich et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011). The Tsien lab has reported it in 17 DIV culture made from P2-P4 rat pups (Thiagarajan et al., 200). Note that depending on the exact culture protocol (serum-free Neurobasal media-based vs. serum-rich MEM-based media) and the age of pups used for culture preparation (E18, P0 or P4), the synaptic maturation course can be different in different studies at a given DIV time point. But overall, it is consistent across many studies that the frequency responses in synaptic homeostatic plasticity occurs in older and more mature cultures.</p><p>For this particular study, we had to ‘age’ the cultures in order to observe homeostatic presynaptic mEPSC increases. Specifically, DIV 21 primary cultured neurons made from P0-P1 mouse pups and DIV 21-25 organotypic slice culture made from P7-P8 mouse pups were used.</p><p>We have added more discussion on this part in the first paragraph of the result section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Assess mIPSC changes: It is noted in the discussion that BDNF can increase mIPSC frequency.

Looking at mIPSCs would extend impact and improve the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The positive effect of BDNF on mIPSC reported in Bolton et al., 2000 was observed with treatment of BDNF in 3 DIV hippocampal cultures. At this age, no endogenous BDNF is available yet, so the effect likely reflects the developmental effect by exogenous BDNF in speeding up the GABAergic synapse development and maturation.</p><p>In response to reviewers’ inquiry, we examined RA’s effect on mIPSCs in 21 DIV hippocampal cultured slices, and found that both the amplitude and frequency of mIPSCs are significantly reduced by RA. Interestingly, we observed similar changes in mIPSCs in the post-critical period visual cortical circuit after visual deprivation or acute RA treatment (Zhong et al., J. Neurosci. 2018). This change is in the opposite direction to those observed for mEPSCs, and is consistent with the notion that synaptic silencing induces homeostatic increase of E/I ratio. This new data is included in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1D.</p><p>Next, to examine the effect of endogenous BDNF on basal inhibitory transmission and homeostatic plasticity, we measured mIPSCs in postsynaptic BDNF KO CA1 neurons in 23-25 DIV slice cultures. We observed a significant reduction in mIPSC amplitude in the cKO neurons. The mIPSC frequency showed a small trend of decrease (p = 0.06) in the cKO neurons. Treatment of RA did not further change the mIPSCs (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We believe this observation is consistent with the reported function of BDNF in inhibitory synapse development. Given the confounding developmental effect of BDNF on mIPSCs, we find it difficult to interpret the results of blocked mIPSC homeostatic plasticity in BDNF cKO neurons. Thus, we decided to leave the mIPSC data from the BDNF cKO neurons out of the current study and hope the reviewers will support our decision.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of RA and postsynaptic BDNF deletion on mIPSCs.</title><p>Quantification of mEPSC amplitudes (left) and frequencies (right) recorded from WT and postsynaptic BDNF KO neurons treated with DMSO or RA. **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001, two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test.
