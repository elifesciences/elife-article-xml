evolution and tumorigenesis. We aimed to investigate the potential for vertical DNA transmission within maternal endometrial EVs to the pre-implantation embryo and describe any effect on embryo bioenergetics. We discovered that the human endometrium secretes all three general subtypes of EV - apoptotic bodies (ABs), microvesicles (MVs), and exosomes (EXOs) - into the human endometrial fluid (EF) within the uterine cavity. EVs become uniformly secreted into the EF during the menstrual cycle, with the proportion of different EV populations remaining constant; however, MVs contain significantly higher levels of mitochondrial (mt)DNA than ABs or EXOs. During the window of implantation, MVs contain an eleven-fold higher level of mtDNA when compared to cells-of-origin within the receptive endometrium, which possesses a lower mtDNA content and displays the upregulated expression of mitophagy-related genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the internalization of EV-derived nuclear-encoded (n)DNA/mtDNA by trophoblast cells of murine embryos, which associates with a reduction in mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. These findings suggest that the maternal endometrium suffers a reduction in mtDNA content during the preconceptional period, that nDNA/mtDNA become packaged into secreted EVs that the embryo uptakes, and that the transfer of DNA to the embryo within EVs occurs alongside the modulation of bioenergetics during implantation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>maternal-embryonic crosstalk</kwd><kwd>endometrium</kwd><kwd>exosomes</kwd><kwd>extracellular vesicles</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial DNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004587</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PI18/00957</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vilella</surname><given-names>Felipe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004587</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PI21/00528</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vilella</surname><given-names>Felipe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004587</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PI21/00235</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moreno</surname><given-names>Inmaculada</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003176</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FPU15/02248</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bolumar</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004587</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FI19/00159</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonzalez-Fernandez</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004587</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CPII18/00020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vilella</surname><given-names>Felipe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vitro analyses reveal how vertical DNA transmission from the mother to the pre-implantation embryo via endometrial extracellular vesicles can impact embryo bioenergetics.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The release and uptake of membrane-enclosed compartments with specific cargos, commonly known as extracellular vesicles (EVs), represents a critical cell-to-cell communication mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>).

Micro(mi)RNAs represent the human endometrium’s most widely studied EV cargo. The Salomonsen group first identified miRNAs as a cargo of endometrial epithelium-secreted EXOs, with the contained miRNAs found to target genes involved in embryonic implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ng et al., 2013</xref>). Our studies revealed that the human endometrium secretes EXOs containing miRNAs with distinct menstrual cycle phase-related profiles into the EF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vilella et al., 2015</xref>). We discovered that miR-30d uptake by the embryo promotes the expression of genes encoding factors involved in embryo adhesion. Additional studies suggest that both the embryo and the maternal endometrium release specific sets of miRNAs with transcriptional/epigenetic-modifying potential that participate in embryo viability, implantation, and uterus preparation during the preconception period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashary et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gross et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Evidence regarding DNA transmission through EVs also suggests that specific sorting of DNA molecules may occur depending on the cell type, EV subpopulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lázaro-Ibáñez et al., 2014</xref>), and ability of EVs to carry DNA to target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Waldenström et al., 2012</xref>). EVs contain single- and double-stranded DNA in varying relative abundances depending on the cell and vesicle type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Thakur et al., 2014</xref>). The vertical transmission of EV-derived DNA has been proposed as a novel genetic material transfer mechanism that impacts genome evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawamura et al., 2017</xref>). In support of this proposal, studies have indicated the involvement of the horizontal transfer of EV-derived DNA (especially involving retrotransposons) in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawamura et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, EVs also transport mitochondrial (mt)DNA, constituting a mechanism to transmit normal or mutant mtDNA associated with specific pathologies from cell to cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guescini et al., 2010</xref>). For example, T-cell-derived EXOs secreted upon antigen-dependent contact with dendritic cells can transfer nuclear-encoded (n)DNA and mtDNA unidirectionally to dendritic cells, triggering resistance to subsequent viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Torralba et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated the vertical transmission of DNA encapsulated within EVs secreted from cells of the endometrium to the embryo and explored the possible consequences of this process. Our data demonstrate that all EV subtypes encapsulate nDNA and mtDNA and that the endometrium releases MVs that specifically encapsulate an elevated amount of mtDNA during the receptive phase of the menstrual cycle. Embryos display evidence of EV-derived DNA uptake during the periconceptional period, which associates with an increased metabolic rate of the embryos and suggests a role in bioenergetic modulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Morphological, molecular, and nanoparticle tracking-mediated identification of endometrial EV populations secreted into the endometrial fluid</title><p>We first isolated EV subpopulations from EF samples obtained at distinct time points during the female menstrual cycle to investigate those EVs secreted by the endometrium.

We primarily observed the substantial reduction of ATP content when co-culturing murine embryos with isolated EXOs, suggesting that a combination of contents (e.g. DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids) controls the metabolic state of embryos. Additional studies will aim to fully explore each EV cargo’s potential contribution. We next studied the OCR of the embryos treated with EXOs and MVs from the pre-receptive and receptive phases (we removed ABs from this analysis due to their heterogeneity and methodological difficulties). We observed that EXOs obtained from receptive but not pre-receptive endometria appeared to reduce basal respiration (while not reaching significance), similar to the changes to ATP levels when treating embryos with ‘All EVs’ or EXOs. Again, future studies with more samples may reveal the real significance of these effects and decipher the exact role of each EV subtype and their cargos.</p><p>We suggest EVs as vectors for transporting nDNA and mtDNA into the pre-implantation embryo; this maternal DNA vertical transfer mechanism could influence embryo metabolism during the periconceptional period, suggesting that the mother sends signals to the embryo to aid the implantation process.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>EF samples were collected from women undergoing natural (healthy volunteers aged 18–35) cycles and women undergoing hormonal replacement therapy.

Only samples that accomplished a minimum of 0.03 ng/µL of DNA in all the vesicle populations from the same EF were chosen for library construction. A lower threshold was chosen based on our previous experience. Samples over 0.2 ng/µL were adjusted to this concentration with nuclease-free water. To analyze the effect of lowering the DNA input amount for libraries construction (samples with initial limiting input DNA), those samples with DNA excess from the DNase evaluation assay (i.e. DNase untreated EXOs and ABs) were used to create serial dilutions for library construction. The resulting libraries containing an initial 0.05 ng/µL DNA and those in the ideal concentration range (0.2 ng/µL and 0.15 ng/µL for ABs and EXOs, respectively) were chosen to evaluate the effect of reducing DNA input for sequencing.

In Bolumar, Moncayo-Arlandi et al. the authors explore whether endometrium-derived extracellular vesicles contribute DNA to embryos and therefore influence embryo metabolism and respiration. The manuscript combines techniques for isolating different populations of extracellular vesicles, DNA sequencing, embryo culture, and respiration assays performed on human endometrial samples and mouse embryos.</p><p>Vesicle isolation is technically difficult and therefore collection from human samples is commendable. Also, the influence of maternally derived DNA on the bioenergetics of embryos is unknown and therefore novel. However, several experiments presented in the manuscript fail to reach statistical significance, likely due to the small sample sizes. This manuscript is a good but incomplete start as to the potential function of maternal DNA transfer via vesicles.</p><p>In my opinion the manuscript supports the following of the authors' claims:</p><p>1. Different amounts of nDNA and mtDNA are shed in human endometrial extracellular vesicles during different phases of the menstrual cycle.</p><p>2. Endometrial microvesicles are more enriched for mitochondrial DNA sequences compared to other types of vesicles present in the human samples.</p><p>3. Fluorescently labelled DNA from extracellular vesicles derived from an endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line can be incorporated into hatched mouse embryos.</p><p>4. Culture of mouse embryos with endometrial extracellular vesicles can influence embryo respiration and the effect is greater when cultured with isolated exosomes compared to other isolated microvesicles.</p><p>My main concerns with the manuscript:</p><p>1. Several experiments presented fail to reach statistical significance or are qualitative.</p><p>2. The definitive experiments presented in the manuscript are limited to the transfer of DNA in general not mtDNA. Therefore a strong connection with metabolism is missing, diminishing the significance of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>A2. We thank you for your detailed feedback. While we acknowledge the reviewer's concerns regarding sample sizes, we emphasize that this study was intentionally designed as a pilot study and was approved by the IRB with a specific sample size to serve as proof of concept. We fully agree that further research is essential for a more comprehensive understanding of the novel biological process described in this manuscript. When this manuscript is finally accepted, we can submit a new IRB application to obtain a larger sample size, allowing us to delve deeper into demonstrating the connection with metabolism</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Q3.

Thank you for your consideration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The authors have made several changes that have improved the manuscript. However, I still have some concerns.</p><p>Q4. The title is still too definitive. Something like &quot;Vertical transmission of maternal DNA through extracellular vesicles is associated with changes in embryo bioenergetics during the periconception period&quot; would be more appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>A4. As mentioned earlier in the response to the editors, we acknowledge the concerns regarding the manuscript's title.</p><p>Following your recommendation, the proposed new title of the manuscript is “Vertical transmission of maternal DNA through extracellular vesicles associates with altered embryo bioenergetics during the periconception period.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q5. I am confused by the incorporation of the new experiment (supplementary figure 7) where embryos are cultured in free-floating synthesized mtDNA. If these sequences were not encapsulated in vesicles I don't think the experiment is relevant. If they were similarly prepared as in the section &quot;Tagged-DNA production and EV internalization by murine embryos&quot; I stand corrected but please clarify or omit. Otherwise, the new data/figure in response to Q11 showing co-localization of mitochondria and EdU-tagged DNA from MVs from Ishikawa cells is more compelling. However, this doesn't separate the uptake of mtDNA alone from the potential uptake of mitochondria, which this manuscript is not focused on.</p></disp-quote><p>A5. We apologize for any confusion that may have arisen for the reviewer. We conducted this experiment in response to question Q4 posed by the same reviewer, which specifically inquired about the detection of internalized mtDNA by the embryos.</p><p>As previously stated in the revised manuscript, the EdU system does not selectively label mtDNA; instead, it labels any newly synthesized DNA, both nuclear and mitochondrial. We have not found a system that specifically labels mtDNA for subsequent tracing inside EVs or for encapsulation within artificial EVs (which falls outside our expertise). Therefore, we employed labeled mtDNA that we could trace after the embryos' internalization.</p><p>While we acknowledge that this approach is not perfect, it does demonstrate the internalization of mtDNA sequences within the embryo. We have revised the manuscript to eliminate any potential sources of confusion. If the reviewer or editors still have concerns about the experiment's suitability, we are open to removing it from the final version of the manuscript. Please refer to page 9 and lines 234-238 for more details.&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
