The low-dimensional latent subspace that underlies large-scale neural dynamics and the relationships of these dynamics to cognitive and attentional states, however, are unknown. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging as human participants performed attention tasks, watched comedy sitcom episodes and an educational documentary, and rested. Whole-brain dynamics traversed a common set of latent states that spanned canonical gradients of functional brain organization, with global desynchronization among functional networks modulating state transitions. Neural state dynamics were synchronized across people during engaging movie watching and aligned to narrative event structures. Neural state dynamics reflected attention fluctuations such that different states indicated engaged attention in task and naturalistic contexts, whereas a common state indicated attention lapses in both contexts. Together, these results demonstrate that traversals along large-scale gradients of human brain organization reflect cognitive and attentional dynamics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>brain states</kwd><kwd>dynamical systems</kwd><kwd>functional networks</kwd><kwd>event boundaries</kwd><kwd>attention</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010446</institution-id><institution>Institute for Basic Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R015-D1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shim</surname><given-names>Won Mok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2019M3E5D2A01060299</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shim</surname><given-names>Won Mok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2019R1A2C1085566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shim</surname><given-names>Won Mok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BCS-2043740</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenberg</surname><given-names>Monica D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>People’s neural activity travels between a small number of brain states based on what they are thinking and paying attention to.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A central goal in cognitive neuroscience is understanding how cognition arises from the dynamic interplay of neural systems. To understand how interactions occur at the level of large-scale functional systems, studies have characterized neural dynamics as a trajectory in a latent state space where each dimension corresponds to the activity of a functional network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Breakspear, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Gu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">John et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shine et al., 2019a</xref>). This dynamical systems approach revealed two major insights. First, neural dynamics operate on a low-dimensional manifold. That is, neural dynamics can be captured by a small number of independent latent components due to covariation of neural activity within a system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cunningham and Yu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shine et al., 2019b</xref>). Second, neural activity does not just continuously flow along a manifold, but rather systematically transitions between recurring latent ‘states,’ or hidden clusters, within the state space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Vidaurre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Vidaurre et al., 2017</xref>). Initial work used resting-state neuroimaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Betzel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Liu and Duyn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Yousefi and Keilholz, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zalesky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>) and data simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Deco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Deco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Friston, 1997</xref>) to describe dynamic interactions among brain regions in terms of systematic transitions between brain states.</p><p>Less is known about how our mental states—which constantly ebb and flow over time—arise from these brain state transitions. Recent work in human neuroimaging suggests that brain state changes reflect cognitive and attentional state changes in specific contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shine et al., 2019a</xref>). For example, work has identified neural states during a sustained attention task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yamashita et al., 2021</xref>) or a working memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cornblath et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Taghia et al., 2018</xref>). Dataset-specific latent states occurred during different task blocks as well as moments of successful and unsuccessful behavioral performance. Another line of work identified latent states during naturalistic movie watching and demonstrated how neural dynamics relate to contents of the movies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">van der Meer et al., 2020</xref>) or participants’ ongoing comprehension states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Song et al., 2021b</xref>). An open question is whether the <italic>same</italic> latent states underlie cognitive states across all contexts. For example, does the same brain state underlie successful attention task performance and engaged movie watching? If brain activity traverses a common set of latent states in different contexts, to what extent do the functional roles of these states also generalize?</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shine et al., 2019a</xref> demonstrated that neural activity traverse a common low-dimensional manifold across seven cognitive tasks. The dynamics within this common manifold were aligned to exogenous task blocks and related to individual differences in cognitive traits. Here we expand on this work by probing a common set of latent states that explain neural dynamics during task, rest, and naturalistic contexts in five independent datasets. We also identify the nature of this shared latent manifold by relating it to the canonical gradients of functional brain connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, we relate neural state dynamics to <italic>ongoing</italic> changes in cognitive and attentional states to probe how neural dynamics are adaptively modulated from stimulus-driven and internal state changes.</p><p>We collected human fMRI data, the <italic>SitcOm, Nature documentary, Gradual-onset continuous performance task (SONG) neuroimaging dataset</italic>, as 27 participants rested, performed attention tasks, and watched movies. We characterized latent state dynamics that underlie large-scale brain activity in these contexts and related them to changes in cognition and attention measured with dense behavioral sampling. Each participant performed seven fMRI runs over 2 d: two eye-fixated resting-state runs, two gradual-onset continuous performance task (gradCPT) runs with either face or scene images, two runs of comedy sitcom watching, and a single run of educational documentary watching. The gradCPT measures fluctuations of sustained attention over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Esterman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rosenberg et al., 2013</xref>) as participants respond to images (every 1 s) from a frequent category (90% of trials) and inhibit response to images from an infrequent category (10%). The sitcom episodes were the first and second episodes of a South Korean comedy sitcom, <italic>High Kick Through the Roof</italic>. The educational documentary described the geography and history of Korean rivers.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Functional brain activity transitions between states in a common latent manifold</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Large-scale neural activity transitions between discrete latent states</title><p>To infer latent state dynamics, we fit a hidden Markov model (HMM) to probabilistically infer a sequence of discrete latent states from observed fMRI activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rabiner and Juang, 1986</xref>). The observed variables here were the BOLD signal time series from 25 parcels in a whole-brain parcellation of the cortex (17 functional networks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>) and subcortex (8 regions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tian et al., 2020</xref>) sampled at a 1 s TR resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left). Parcel time courses were <italic>z</italic>-normalized within each participant and concatenated across all fMRI runs from all participants.

Specifically, the HMM was trained on data from all participants but one to estimate parameters: emission and transition probabilities. The model was then applied to decode the latent state sequence of the held-out participant.

Here, we test the robustness of the four latent states by using 200 cortical and 50 subcortical parcels, but applied dimensionality reduction to these 250 parcel time series prior to using them as inputs to the HMM. The matrices were randomly projected to 25-dimensional time series matrices by multiplying the time-by-250 matrix with the randomly generated 250-by-25 matrices. Random projection is a validated dimensionality reduction tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bingham and Mannila, 2001</xref>) that does not impose any constraints on how the latent dimensions should be (e.g., the principal component analysis should find latent dimensions that maximize explained variance and are orthogonal to one another). The HMM fit was conducted 500 times. For each iteration, after the HMM fit, we inverse-projected 25-dimensional mean activation patterns to 250 dimensions. The decoded latent state sequence of each iteration was compared to the decoded state sequence of the 25-parcel time series that we report in the manuscript. By finding the latent state sequence that shows the highest sequence similarity (mean 40.7 ± 3.45%, given a chance of 25%), we reordered the estimated mean activations and averaged across 500 iterations.

To test this idea, we situated the mean activity values of the four latent states along the gradients defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Margulies et al., 2016</xref> (see ‘Materials and methods’). The brain states tiled the two-dimensional gradient space with the base state at the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). The Euclidean distances between these four states were maximized in the two-dimensional gradient space compared to a chance where the four states were inferred from circular-shifted time series (p&lt;0.001).

For the HCP dataset, the DMN and DAN states fell at more extreme positions on the primary gradient (both FDR-p values=0.004; SM and base states, FDR-p values=0.076).

Despite these differences, the SONG-specific gradients closely resembled the predefined gradients, with Pearson’s correlations observed for the first (<italic>r</italic> = 0.876) and second (<italic>r</italic> = 0.877) gradient embeddings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>).

We restricted our analysis to the first two gradients because the two gradients together explained roughly 50% of the variance of the functional brain connectome (SONG: 46.94%; HCP: 52.08%), and the explained variance dropped drastically from the third gradients (more than 1/3 drop compared to the second gradients). The degrees to which the first two predefined gradients explained whole-brain fMRI time series (SONG: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> = 0.097; HCP: 0.084) were comparable to the amount of variance explained by the first two data-specific gradients (SONG: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> = 0.100; HCP: 0.086; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>).

The result suggests that the base state acts as a hub in neural state transitions, replicating a past finding of the base state as a transitional hub in resting-state fMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Given that global desynchrony indicates moments of neural state transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we used this measure to validate the role of the base state as a ‘transition-prone’ state. Cofluctuation between every pair of parcels was computed at every TR, which was averaged across parcel pairs to represent a time-resolved measure of global cofluctuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). When comparing the degree of global cofluctuation across the four latent states, we found that the base state exhibited the lowest degree of global cofluctuation (paired <italic>t</italic>-tests comparing cofluctuation in base state vs. DMN, DAN, and SM states, SONG: <italic>t</italic>(187) &gt; 61, HCP: <italic>t</italic>(3093) &gt; 170, FDR-p-values&lt;0.001), which was significantly below chance (FDR-p-values&lt;0.001). This suggests that the base state was the most desynchronized state among the four, potentially operating as a transition-prone state. Low global synchrony during the base state was not driven by spurious head motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, the base state, situated at the center of the gradient space, is a flexible ‘hub’ state with a high degree of freedom to transition to other functionally specialized states.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Neural state dynamics are modulated by ongoing cognitive and attentional states</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Latent state dynamics differ across contexts and are synchronized during movie watching</title><p>We identified four latent states that recur during rest, task performance, and movie watching.

Thus, although the base state typically acts as a transitional hub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), neural state transitions at event boundaries are more likely to occur directly from the DAN or SM state to the DMN state without passing through the base state due to the DMN state’s functional role at event boundaries.

Neural states spanned predefined gradients of functional brain organization, with the state at the center functioning as a transitional hub. These gradients explained significant variance in neural dynamics, suggesting their role as a general latent manifold shared across cognitive processes. Global desynchronization marked moments of neural state transitions, with decreases in cofluctuation of the pairwise functional networks preceding state changes. The same latent states recurred across fMRI runs and independent datasets, with distinct state-traversal patterns during rest, task, and naturalistic conditions. Neural state dynamics were synchronized across participants during movie watching and temporally aligned to narrative event boundaries. Whereas different neural states were involved in attentionally engaged states in task and naturalistic contexts, a common neural state indicated inattention in both contexts. Together, our findings suggest that human cognition and attention arise from neural dynamics that traverse latent states in a shared low-dimensional gradient space.</p><p>Taking a dynamical systems approach, systems neuroscientists have theorized that hierarchically modular systems of the brain communicate and process information dynamically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Breakspear, 2017</xref>). This framework, which characterizes the dynamics of systems-level interactions as a trajectory within a state space, has opened a new avenue to understanding the functional brain beyond what could be revealed from the univariate activity of local brain regions or their pairwise connections alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">John et al., 2022</xref>). Although a dynamical systems approach has been adopted in non-human animal studies to understand behavior during targeted tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mante et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sohn et al., 2019</xref>), there is still a lack of understanding of how human cognition arises from brain-wide interactions, with a particularly sparse understanding of what gives rise to naturalistic, real-world cognition.</p><p>Using fMRI data collected in rest, task, and naturalistic contexts, we identified four latent states that tile the principal gradient axes of functional brain connectome. Are these latent states—the DMN, DAN, SM, and base states—generalizable states of the human brain? When the HMM was applied to data from each condition separately, the inferred latent states differed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, when the HMM was applied to datasets including diverse fMRI conditions like the SONG and HCP, the four states consistently reappeared, regardless of analytical choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>). We propose a framework that can unify these observations and theories: large-scale neural dynamics traverse canonical latent states in a low-dimensional manifold captured by the principal gradients of functional brain organization.</p><p>This perspective is supported by previous work that has used different methods to capture recurring low-dimensional states from spontaneous fMRI activity during rest. For example, to extract time-averaged latent states, early resting-state analyses identified task-positive and task-negative networks using seed-based correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Fox et al., 2005</xref>). Dimensionality reduction algorithms such as independent component analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Smith et al., 2009</xref>) extracted latent components that explain the largest variance in fMRI time series. Other lines of work used time-resolved analyses to capture latent state dynamics. For example, variants of clustering algorithms, such as co-activation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Liu and Duyn, 2013</xref>), k-means clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2014</xref>), and HMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Vidaurre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Vidaurre et al., 2017</xref>), characterized fMRI time series as recurrences of and transitions between a small number of states. Time-lag analysis was used to identify quasiperiodic spatiotemporal patterns of propagating brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Yousefi and Keilholz, 2021</xref>). A recent study extensively compared these different algorithms and showed that they all report qualitatively similar latent states or components when applied to fMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolt et al., 2022</xref>). While these studies used different algorithms to probe data-specific brain states, this work and ours report common latent axes that follow a long-standing theory of large-scale human functional systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mesulam, 1998</xref>). Neural dynamics span principal axes that dissociate unimodal to transmodal and sensory to motor information processing systems.</p><p>Prior systems neuroscience research on low-dimensional brain states was primarily performed on data from rest or a single task. Thus, the extent to which a latent manifold underlying brain states is common or different across contexts was unknown. It was also unclear how brain states reflected cognitive dynamics. Our results show that neural dynamics in different cognitive contexts can be coarsely understood as traversals between latent states in a context-general manifold. However, the state dynamics, or most likely ‘paths’ between states, differ with context and functional demands, potentially giving rise to our diverse and flexible cognitive processes.</p><p>Our study adopted the assumption of low dimensionality of large-scale neural systems, which led us to intentionally identify only a small number of states underlying whole-brain dynamics. Importantly, however, we do not claim that the four states will be the optimal set of states in every dataset and participant population. Instead, latent states and patterns of state occurrence may vary as a function of individuals and tasks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Likewise, while the lowest dimensions of the manifold (i.e., the first two gradients) were largely shared across datasets tested here, we do not argue that it will always be identical. If individuals and tasks deviate significantly from what was tested here, the manifold may also differ along with changes in latent states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Samara et al., 2023</xref>). Brain systems operate at different dimensionalities and spatiotemporal scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Greene et al., 2023</xref>), which may have different consequences for cognition. Asking how brain states and manifolds—probed at different dimensionalities and scales—flexibly reconfigure (or not) with changes in contexts and mental states is an important research question for understanding complex human cognition.</p><p>Previous studies reported functional relevance of latent state dynamics during controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cornblath et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Reddy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shine et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Taghia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yamashita et al., 2021</xref>) and naturalistic tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Song et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">van der Meer et al., 2020</xref>). The current study aimed to unify these findings by generalizing the latent state model to multiple fMRI runs and datasets spanning rest, task, and naturalistic contexts. Intriguingly, the latent states commonly occurred in every scan type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), but their functional roles differed depending on context. For example, during monotonous tasks that required constant exertion of sustained attention, the DMN state accompanied successful, stable performance whereas the DAN state characterized suboptimal performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). The antagonistic activity and functional relationship between the DMN and DAN has been reported in past studies that used resting-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buckner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Fox et al., 2005</xref>) or task fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Esterman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kucyi et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, in naturalistic contexts, the DMN state indicated low attentional engagement to narratives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>) and tended to follow event boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). The DAN state, on the other hand, indicated high attentional engagement during documentary watching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) and was not modulated by event boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our results indicate that the functional relationship between the DMN and DAN states shows more nuanced dependence to contexts. (Though our observations align with previous work on the functional roles of the default mode and dorsal attention networks, it is important to keep in mind that the two states are not just characterized by activation of these networks but by patterns of activation and covariation of the whole brain networks. They should be interpreted as ‘states’ rather than isolated functional networks.) The findings highlight the need to probe both the controlled and naturalistic tasks with dense behavioral sampling to fully characterize the functional roles of these neural states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Song and Rosenberg, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the context-specific DMN and DAN states, the SM state consistently indicated inattention or disengagement. The SM state occurred during poor task performance and low narrative engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) as well as during intermittent task breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The result implies that whereas the optimal neural state may vary with information processing demands, a suboptimal state is shared across contexts.</p><p>Previous work showed that time-resolved whole-brain functional connectivity (i.e., paired interactions of more than a hundred parcels) predicts changes in attention during task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rosenberg et al., 2020</xref>) as well as movie watching and story listening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Song et al., 2021a</xref>). Future work could investigate whether functional connectivity and the HMM capture the same underlying ‘brain states’ to bridge the results from the two literatures. Furthermore, though the current study provided evidence of neural state dynamics reflecting attention, the same neural states may, in part, reflect fluctuations in arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Complementing behavioral studies that demonstrated a nonlinear relationship between attention and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Esterman and Rothlein, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Unsworth and Robison, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Unsworth and Robison, 2016</xref>), future studies collecting behavioral and physiological measures of arousal can assess the extent to which attention explains neural state dynamics beyond what can be explained by arousal fluctuations.</p><p>Past resting-state fMRI studies have reported the existence of the base state. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chen et al., 2016</xref> used the HMM to detect a state that had ‘less apparent activation or deactivation patterns in known networks compared with other states.’ This state had the highest occurrence probability among the inferred latent states, was consistently detected by the model, and was most likely to transition to and from other states, all of which mirror our findings here. The authors interpret this state as an ‘intermediate transient state that appears when the brain is switching between other more reproducible brain states.’ The observation of the base state was not confined to studies using HMMs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Saggar et al., 2022</xref> used topological data analysis to represent a low-dimensional manifold of resting-state whole-brain dynamics as a graph, where each node corresponds to brain activity patterns of a cluster of time points. Topologically focal ‘hub’ nodes were represented uniformly by all functional networks, meaning that no characteristic activation above or below the mean was detected, similar to what we observe with the base state. The transition probability from other states to the hub state was the highest, demonstrating its role as a putative transition state.</p><p>However, the functional relevance of the base state to human cognition had not been explored previously. We propose that the base state, a transitional hub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) positioned at the center of the gradient subspace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), functions as a state of natural equilibrium. Transitioning to the DMN, DAN, or SM states reflects incursion away from natural equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Deco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Gu et al., 2015</xref>), as the brain enters a functionally modular state. Notably, the base state indicated high attentional engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>) and exhibited the highest occurrence proportion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) as well as the longest dwell times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) during naturalistic movie watching, whereas its functional involvement was comparatively minor during controlled tasks. This significant relevance to behavior verifies that the base state cannot simply be a by-product of the model. We speculate that susceptibility to both external and internal information is maximized in the base state—allowing for roughly equal weighting of both sides so that they can be integrated to form a coherent representation of the world—at the expense of the stability of a certain functional network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cocchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fagerholm et al., 2015</xref>). When processing rich narratives, particularly when a person is fully immersed without having to exert cognitive effort, a less modular state with high degrees of freedom to reach other states may be more likely to be involved. The role of the base state should be further investigated in future studies.</p><p>This work provides a framework for understanding large-scale human brain dynamics and their relevance to cognition and behavior. Neural dynamics can be construed as traversals across latent states along the low-dimensional gradients, driven by interactions between functional networks. The traversals occur adaptively to external and internal demands, reflecting ongoing changes of cognition and attention in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s5-1"><title>SitcOm, Nature documentary, Gradual-onset continuous performance task (SONG) neuroimaging dataset</title><sec id="s5-1-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-seven participants were recruited in Korea (all native Korean speakers; two left-handed, 15 females; age range 18–30 y with mean age 23 ± 3.16 y).

In cases when two responses were recorded but the response for the previous trial was not missing, or when the response for a single response trial happened before 40% of image coherence, we chose a response that favored a correct response. For trials where there were errors in image presentation (two participants during gradCPT scene runs: 1 trial and 18 consecutive trials out of 360 trials) or participants did not respond for consecutive trials (one participant during gradCPT face run: 66 trials out of 500 trials), the accuracy and response times for that trials were treated as NaNs.</p></sec><sec id="s5-2-4"><title>Response time variability</title><p>To calculate an RT variability time course for each gradCPT run, the response times for incorrect and no-response trials were treated as NaNs, which were then filled by 1D linear interpolation. The response time course was linearly detrended, and RT variability was calculated by taking the deviance from the mean RT at every TR. Because the trial duration of the gradCPT scene runs was 1.2 s, the RT variability time course was resampled to match the TR resolution of 1 s. Each participant’s mean RT variability was appended as the value corresponding to the first TR. The RT variability time course was <italic>z</italic>-normalized across time within run and convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function to be related with the neural state dynamics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5-3"><title>FMRI image acquisition and preprocessing</title><p>Participants were scanned with a 3T scanner (Magnetom Prisma; Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) with a 64-channel head coil. Anatomical images were acquired using a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo pulse sequence (repetition time [TR] = 2200 ms, echo time [TE] = 2.44 ms, field of view = 256 mm × 256 mm, and 1 mm isotropic voxels). Functional images were acquired using a T2*-weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR = 1000 ms, TE = 30 ms, multiband factor = 3, field of view = 240 mm × 240 mm, and 3 mm isotropic voxels, with 48 slices covering the whole brain). The number of TRs per run are as follows: resting-state run 1 (602 TR) and run 2 (602 TR), gradCPT with face (513 TR) and scene images (445 TR), sitcom episode 1 (1516 TR), episode 2 (1495 TR), and documentary (1303 TR). Visual stimuli were projected from a Propixx projector (vPixx Technologies, Bruno, Canada), with a resolution of 1920 × 1080 pixels and a refresh rate of 60 Hz. Auditory stimuli were delivered by MRI compatible in-ear headphones (MR Confon; Cambridge Research Systems, Rochester, UK).</p><p>Structural images were bias-field corrected and spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using FSL. The first two images of the resting-state and gradCPT runs, 30 for sitcom episodes and 22 for documentary were discarded to allow the MR signal to achieve T1 equilibration. Functional images were motion-corrected using the six rigid-body transformation parameters. The functional images were intensity-normalized, and the FMRIB’s ICA-based X-noiseifier (FIX) was applied to automatically identify and remove noise components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Griffanti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Griffanti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Salimi-Khorshidi et al., 2014</xref>).

The mean distance between all pairs of states was compared to a chance distribution where the null latent states were derived from HMM inferences on the circular-shifted 25 parcel time series (1000 iterations, two-tailed non-parametric permutation tests). Furthermore, to test whether the latent states were positioned at more extreme ends of the gradients than expected by chance, we situated the same null latent states in the gradient space.

Cofluctuation was computed for every pair of parcels, resulting in a time-resolved, 25 (parcel) × 25 × T (number of TRs) matrix for each fMRI run, with a symmetric matrix at every time point.</p><p>We categorized the 25-parcel pairs to cortico-cortical (136 pairs), cortico-subcortical (136 pairs), and subcortico-subcortical (28 pairs) connection categories. The cofluctuation time courses were time-aligned to multiple moments of state transitions indicated by the HMM inference, which were averaged within a participant. The time-aligned mean cofluctuation of each pair was then averaged across all runs of the entire participants.</p><p>The chance distributions were created in two ways. First, cofluctuation time courses were time-aligned to the circular-shifted indices of neural state transitions (1000 iterations; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Second, we circular-shifted the 25-parcel time series, thereby disrupting their covariance structure, and conducted HMM inference on these null time series (1000 iterations; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The time-aligned cofluctuation of every pair of parcels was averaged per category and was compared to chance distributions using <italic>z</italic>-statistics and two-tailed non-parametric permutation tests. The significance at each time point was FDR-corrected for the number of time points (i.e., –3 to 3 from the onset of new latent states). Furthermore, to compare the degrees of cofluctuation change between cortico-cortical, cortico-subcortical, and subcortico-subcortical connection categories, mean cofluctuation difference at time <italic>t-1</italic> and <italic>t+3</italic> was taken per category and the values were compared across categories using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (FDR-corrected for three pairwise comparisons).</p></sec><sec id="s5-8"><title>Neural state transition probabilities</title><p>The <italic>T-1</italic> number of transitions in each participant’s latent state sequence were categorized based on which state it transitioned from (at <italic>t-1</italic>) and which state it transitioned to (at <italic>t</italic>) as a 4 (‘from’ state) × 4 (‘to’ state) transition-count matrix. We controlled for the number of state occurrences by either dividing each element by the sum of each row, which identified the probabilities of transitioning ‘to’ one of the four latent states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), or dividing by the sum of each column, which identified the probabilities of transitioning ‘from’ one of the four latent states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The transition probability matrices estimated from every participant’s every run were averaged. The chance distribution was created by conducting the HMM fits on the circular-shifted 25 parcel time series (1000 iterations).

This global cofluctuation measure at every TR was categorized based on the HMM latent state identification, which was then averaged per state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Cofluctuation values of the base state of all participants’ entire runs were compared with the DMN, DAN, and SM states’ using the paired <italic>t</italic>-tests (FDR-corrected for three comparisons). The values at each latent state were averaged and compared to a chance distribution in which the analysis was repeated with a circular-shifted latent state sequence (1000 iterations, two-tailed non-parametric permutation tests, FDR-corrected for the number of states).</p></sec><sec id="s5-10"><title>Fractional occupancy of the latent states</title><p>Using the HMM-derived latent state sequence, we calculated fractional occupancy of the latent states for all participants’ every run. Fractional occupancy is the probability of latent state occurrence over the entire fMRI scan sequence, with a chance value of 25% when K = 4. The mean of all participants’ fractional occupancy values was bootstrapped (10,000 iterations) for visualization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s5-11"><title>Pairwise participant similarity of the latent state sequence</title><p>The similarity between pairs of participants’ latent state sequences was computed as the ratio of the times when the same state occurred over the entire time course.

To compare the degree of synchrony across conditions, we bootstrapped the same pairs of participants with replacement <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf57"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> iterations, where N = number of participants) in paired conditions and took the differences of bootstrapped participant pairs’ latent state sequence similarities. The median of these differences was extracted 1000 times, and the distribution was compared to 0 non-parametrically.</p></sec><sec id="s5-12"><title>Neural state dynamics at narrative event boundaries</title><p>Narrative event boundaries were marked by the experimenter at moments in the sitcom episodes when an event of a storyline transitioned to another event of a different story. Both sitcom episodes comprised 13 events (seven events of story A and six events of story B), and thus 12 event boundaries. The latent state sequences at <italic>t-2</italic> and <italic>t+20</italic> TRs from each of the 12 event boundaries were extracted, and the mean probability of state occurrence across these event boundaries was computed for every latent state within a participant. The probabilities were then averaged across participants. The state occurrence probability at every time step was compared to a chance distribution that was created by relating neural state dynamics to circular-shifted moments of event boundaries (1000 times, two-tailed non-parametric permutation tests, FDR-corrected for number of time points). An audio-story listening data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chang et al., 2021b</xref> comprised 45 interleaved events. Because TR resolution (TR = 1.5 s) was different from the SONG dataset, latent neural states from <italic>t-2</italic> to <italic>t+16</italic> TRs from event boundaries were used in analysis.</p><p>Next, we compared transitions made to the DMN state at event boundaries to transitions made to the DMN state at moments other than event boundaries. We categorized every transition to the DMN state (i.e., from the DAN, SM, or base state) based on whether it occurred 5–15 TRs (for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chang et al., 2021b</xref>, 4–12 TRs) after a narrative event boundary or not. The proportions of DAN-to-DMN, SM-to-DMN, and base-to-DMN state transitions at event boundaries and non-event boundaries were compared using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (FDR-corrected for three comparisons). The interaction between the DMN-preceding latent states and event boundary conditions was tested using the repeated-measures ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s5-13"><title>Neural state dynamics related to attention dynamics</title><p>We measured participants’ attention fluctuations during gradCPT and movie-watching fMRI scans. Fluctuations during gradCPT performance were inferred from the inverted RT variability time course (<italic>z</italic>-normalized) collected concurrently during the gradCPT scans with face and scene images, as well as during gradCPT in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rosenberg et al., 2016</xref> dataset. Continuous engagement rating time courses (<italic>z</italic>-normalized) collected after the sitcom episode and documentary watching scans were used to infer changes in the degree to which the naturalistic stimuli were engaging over time. Engagement ratings of the Sherlock dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) were collected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Song et al., 2021a</xref> from an independent group of participants.</p><p>To relate attentional dynamics to the occurrence of neural states, we categorized each person’s attention measure at every TR based on the HMM latent state identification, which was averaged per state. The mean attention measures of the four states were averaged across participants and compared to a chance distribution in which the attention measures were circular-shifted to be related to the latent state dynamics (1000 iterations, two-tailed non-parametric permutation tests, FDR-corrected for the number of states). For Sherlock dataset only, a single group-average engagement time course was related to the latent state sequence of each fMRI participant because we did not have fMRI participant-specific behavioral ratings.</p><p>Linear mixed-effects models were conducted on the seven fMRI runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–G</xref>), where the model predicted attention measure at every time step from the inferred HMM state indices and head motion (framewise displacement computed after fMRI preprocessing). The participant index was treated as a random effect. The significance of the two main effects and their interaction were computed using ANOVA.</p><p>To investigate the role of the SM state, we analyzed the gradCPT data collected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rosenberg et al., 2016</xref> and two sessions of the HCP working memory task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rosenberg et al., 2016</xref> dataset (N = 25) included gradCPT task blocks separated by intervening fixation blocks. The working memory task run of the HCP dataset included 2-back and 0-back working memory task blocks and fixation blocks (N = 119). Nine participants’ left-to-right phase encoding runs and 11 participants’ right-to-left phase encoding runs in the HCP working memory dataset were discarded in the analysis either because their block orders differed from the other HCP participants’ or because the experiment log was not saved in the dataset repository. Latent state fractional occupancy values were computed for each task block within a participant. Comparisons of a state’s fractional occupancies across block types were based on paired <italic>t</italic>-tests (FDR-corrected for the number of states). The interaction between latent neural states and task block types was tested using repeated-measures ANOVA.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s6"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Informed consent and consent to publish were obtained from the participants prior to the experiments, and the possible consequences of the study were explained.

Is there another term that the authors could use?</p><p>Figure 5 – the authors may wish to consider changing the box plots to a measure that more transparently plots the individual data points, such as a raincloud or violin plot</p><p>General – it would interesting to hear the authors' thoughts on what kinds of organising principles in the brain could provide the means to flexibly shift between these different low-dimensional modes. We have been testing the hypothesis that different arms of the ascending arousal system play a crucial role in this process (e.g., Munn et al., Nature Communications, 2021), and others have shown that similar links between low-dimensional brain state dynamics and arousal exist in whole-brain neuroimaging (e.g., Zhang et al., NeuroImage, 2022).</p><p>General – the 'base state' that the authors' report is reminiscent of the results from Saggar et al.

It would be interesting to hear the authors' thoughts on the similarities/differences to the interpretation associated with this approach.</p><p>General – I was surprised that the study by Viduarre et al. (PNAS, 2017) was not cited, as it used a similar methodological approach (HMM) on resting-state data to infer the underlying dynamical structure of the data.

We highlight previous findings of the “base state” as a transitional hub. We also discuss work that related arousal fluctuations to brain states, and work that used different clustering or dimensionality reduction algorithms to capture a common set of brain states. By addressing past and recent work on human systems neuroscience, we better situate our findings in the literature and clarify what our work adds: insights into how brain states reflect cognitive and attentional dynamics in diverse contexts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please respond to Rev 2's concern that features of the analysis algorithms render some similarities inevitable.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to Reviewer 2, we conducted additional analyses to ask whether the HMM and functional connectivity gradients share algorithmic similarities that would make the alignment of states to gradient axes inevitable. A shared null model was created for the two algorithms, which allowed us to directly compare the two. By comparing data-specific gradients to data-specific latent states, we show that latent states fall at more extreme positions on the low-dimensional gradient axes than expected by chance. By comparing data-specific gradients to predefined gradients from resting-state fMRI, we demonstrate that a low-dimensional manifold of neural dynamics is shared across contexts.

For the four states defined here, the covariance matrices included both positive and negative edges (Figure 1B). We expected that if the absolute covariance weights of the edges were high, the variance would be high as well. As we expected, the variance of covariance matrices scaled with the covariance strength, such that the values followed the order of the SM state being the highest, DMN and DAN states being comparable, and the base state being the lowest (SM &gt; DMN = DAN &gt; base states). The variance of the across-network covariance values (lower half of the triangle, without values in the diagonal) was: DMN: 0.0261, DAN: 0.0264, SM: 0.0495, base: 0.0138. Because this result mirrored that of the covariance strength measures (SM &gt; DMN = DAN &gt; base states), we did not include this additional information in the manuscript but are happy to add it at the reviewer's or editor’s request.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P7L13 – the authors state that the overlap between the results of the HMM and the gradient analysis is 'intriguing', however, I wonder whether there is a mathematical equivalence to this result. Could the authors conduct both analyses on surrogate data to determine whether similar results were an inevitable by-product of the algorithmic similarities?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this important question—whether the alignment between the HMM and gradients is an inevitable byproduct due to their algorithmic similarities. With our original analysis, we could not test this because, as the reviewer pointed out, the null model was created only with the HMM but not with gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). That is, the predefined gradients were held intact while we conducted null HMMs on the circular-shifted 25 parcel time series. To test for a possibility of the null HMM states aligning to null gradients due to algorithmic similarities, we created a shared null model for both the HMM and gradients, as was suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>To create a shared null model, we needed to estimate gradients specific to our SONG dataset. To directly calculate gradients from the SONG data time series, we (1) extracted the BOLD time series of all voxels, (2) applied 1054 ROI parcellation (1000 cortical parcels of the Schaefer et al. (2018) atlas and 54 subcortical parcels of the Tian et al. (2020) atlas) to extract the mean time series of each parcel, (3) calculated ROI-by-ROI functional connectivity matrix per participant, which was averaged across all participants, (4) and applied the same diffusion embedding algorithm as in Margulies et al. (2016). This resulted in the SONG data-specific gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). The second SONG gradient was similar to the first predefined gradient (<italic>r</italic> = 0.876) and the first SONG gradient was similar to the second predefined gradient (<italic>r</italic> = 0.877). Importantly, to generate null distributions, we circular-shifted all voxel time series separately to which we applied the 1054 ROI and 25 ROI parcellations (1,000 iterations). The <italic>z</italic>-normalized time series of the 1054 parcels were used to create null gradients. The corresponding <italic>z</italic>-normalized time series of the 25 parcels were used to create null HMM latent states. This allowed us to directly compare the null models of the gradients and HMMs. Calculating gradients on the null time series resulted in extracting non-meaningful gradients. Projecting the HMM states on the non-meaningful axes resulted in the four states being located near zero for all null iterations, which created sharp null distributions of the latent state positions centered around zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>).</p><p>The positions of the HMM states on the actual gradients were significantly at more extreme positions compared to the positions of the null HMM states on the null gradients. The results suggest the correspondence between the HMM and gradient results is not inevitable. However, these results also suggest that projecting HMM states on non-meaningful gradient axes is almost guaranteed to converge to zero. That is, the HMM states tile the gradients of brain connectome only when the fMRI time series meaningfully covary over time. Thus, our response to reviewer is that, even with the shared null model, the possibility of “inevitable alignment” of the two analyses cannot be directly ruled out because aligning HMM states to non-meaningful axes of the gradient space (due to disrupted functional connectivity matrix) becomes non-meaningful.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Test for the alignment between the latent states and the predefined and data-specific gradients.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Left) Visualization of the top 2 gradients of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>.

(Right) Colored lines show the four states (HMM on the 25 parcel time series of the SONG dataset) situated on the top 2 gradient axes (gradients estimated from the 25 parcel time series of the SONG dataset). A shared null model was generated by circular-shifting 25 parcel time series.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85487-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our analysis depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref> entailed one potential limitation. When circular-shifting voxel time series to generate a null model, similarity structure between nearby voxels (inherent spatial smoothness) are disrupted. Thus, the averaged voxel time series for each ROI may not have similar properties (e.g., in frequency or amplitude) as the actual ROI time series.</p><p>Thus, we performed a secondary analysis in which we compared the SONG gradients and SONG HMM states, both using 25 parcels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). Null distributions were created by circular-shifting parcel time series rather than voxel time series as before. This retains temporal properties of fMRI time series of each parcel while disrupting covariance structure across parcels. Here, because the 25 x 25 functional connectivity matrix was already small, we did not threshold functional connectivity matrix at 90% (row-wise) for sparsity. Instead, all negative values in the functional connectivity matrix were zeroed prior to computing the affinity matrix.</p><p>Surprisingly, even with a small number of parcels, the top 2 gradients were replicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). Again, the second SONG gradient was similar to the first predefined gradient (<italic>r</italic> = 0.845) and the first SONG gradient was similar to the second predefined gradient (<italic>r</italic> = 0.832). Gradient embedding similarity was calculated with Pearson’s correlations of the 25 parcel patterns. Replicating our findings with the 1054 parcels, the null HMM states situated on the null gradients converged to near zero. The actual HMM states fell at more extreme positions on the actual gradient axes than would be expected by chance. The first gradient dissociated the SM state from the DMN and DAN states, the second gradient dissociated the DMN state from the DAN and SM states, and the base state was consistently situated near zero.</p><p>Together, by creating a shared null model for HMM and gradient analyses, we partially addressed the reviewer’s question. Given that the positions of the HMM states on the actual gradients were at more extreme positions compared to chance, we demonstrated robustness and statistical significance of our findings. However, when gradients themselves were disrupted, aligning the HMM states to these non-meaningful gradients also became non-meaningful, thus converging to zero. Therefore, we demonstrated that states do not always fall at the extremes of gradient axes but could not directly test for mathematical equivalence between two algorithms using the null model.</p><p>While we could not assess mathematical equivalence between the algorithms, we note that HMM is applied to fMRI time series to infer latent state dynamics whereas gradient analysis is applied to static functional connectivity (which collapses variance over time) to capture low-dimensional axes that explain the most variances in the functional connectome. Given these differences, we found it surprising that the HMM states tile the gradient space defined from a different dataset. As proposed by Brown et al. (2021), this evidence supports that the functional architecture (gradients) constrains the range of brain activity dynamics (latent state dynamics).</p><p>These analyses and results were added to the Results, Methods, and Figure 1—figure supplement 8. Because Reviewer 3 also raised a concern that the principal component analysis is not a fair comparison to the predefined gradients, we replaced the PCA results with the dataspecific gradient results in the revised manuscript. Here, we attach changes to the Results section and the addition of Figure 1—figure supplement 8.</p><p>Manuscript, page 5-6</p><p>“We hypothesized that the spatial gradients reported by Margulies et al. (2016) act as a lowdimensional manifold over which large-scale dynamics operate (Bolt et al., 2022; Brown et al., 2021; Karapanagiotidis et al., 2020; Turnbull et al., 2020), such that traversals within this manifold explain large variance in neural dynamics and, consequently, cognition and behavior (Figure 1C). To test this idea, we situated the mean activity values of the four latent states along the gradients defined by Margulies et al. (2016) (see <italic>Methods</italic>). The brain states tiled the two-dimensional gradient space with the base state at the center (Figure 1D; Figure1—figure supplement 7). The Euclidean distances between these four states were maximized in the two-dimensional gradient space, compared to a chance where the four states were inferred from circular-shifted time series (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). For the SONG dataset, the DMN and SM states fell at more extreme positions of the primary gradient than expected by chance (both FDR-<italic>p</italic> values = 0.004; DAN and SM states, FDR<italic>p</italic> values = 0.171). For the HCP dataset, the DMN and DAN states fell at more extreme positions on the primary gradient (both FDR-<italic>p</italic> values = 0.004; SM and base states, FDR-<italic>p</italic> values = 0.076). No state was consistently found at the extremes of the secondary gradient (all FDR-<italic>p</italic> values &gt; 0.021).</p><p>We asked whether the predefined gradients explain as much variance in neural dynamics as latent subspace optimized for the SONG dataset. To do so, we applied the same nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm to the SONG dataset’s ROI time series. Of note, the SONG dataset includes 18.95% rest, 15.07% task, and 65.98% movie-watching data whereas the data used by Margulies et al. (2016) was 100% rest. Despite these differences, the SONG-specific gradients closely resembled the predefined gradients, with significant Pearson’s correlations observed for the first (<italic>r</italic> = 0.876) and second (<italic>r</italic> = 0.877) gradient embeddings (Figure 1—figure supplement 8). Gradients identified with the HCP data also recapitulated Margulies et al.’s (2016) first (<italic>r</italic> = 0.880) and second (<italic>r</italic> = 0.871) gradients. We restricted our analysis to the first two gradients because the two gradients together explained roughly 50% of the entire variance of functional brain connectome (SONG: 46.94%, HCP: 52.08%), and the explained variance dropped drastically from the third gradients (more than 1/3 drop compared to the second gradients). The degrees to which the first two predefined gradients explained whole-brain fMRI time series (SONG: <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.097, HCP: 0.084) were comparable to the amount of variance explained by the first two data-specific gradients (SONG: <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.100, HCP: 0.086; Figure 1—figure supplement 8). Thus, the low-dimensional manifold captured by Margulies et al. (2016) gradients is highly replicable, explaining brain activity dynamics as well as data-specific gradients, and is largely shared across contexts and datasets. This suggests that the state space of whole-brain <italic>dynamics</italic> closely recapitulates low-dimensional gradients of the <italic>static</italic> functional brain connectome.”</p><p>“Figure 1—figure supplement 8.</p><p>Comparisons between predefined and data-specific gradients.

We have been testing the hypothesis that different arms of the ascending arousal system play a crucial role in this process (e.g., Munn et al., Nature Communications, 2021), and others have shown that similar links between low-dimensional brain state dynamics and arousal exist in whole-brain neuroimaging (e.g., Zhang et al., NeuroImage, 2022).</p></disp-quote><p>As with the reviewer, we also wondered what drives flexible, macroscopic changes in neural states. We will share a story of how our thoughts and analyses progressed as we conducted the study.</p><p>After conducting the HMM (Figure 1), we were curious about what causes the transient change in the metastable brain states (i.e., transition to a different HMM state in the latent state sequence). Our initial hypothesis was that a <italic>selective</italic> set of cortico-subcortical interactions would drive global neural state transitions. This hypothesis was motivated by Munn et al. (2021) and Shine (2019), which argued that the neuromodulatory signals from the ascending arousal system, passing the thalamus, alter the low-dimensional energy landscape of cortical dynamics. We were also inspired by Greene et al. (2020), which categorized zones of functional network integration and specificity in the subcortex from its interactions with the cortical networks.</p><p>Because our imaging protocol did not allow us to directly investigate signals from smaller deep brain regions such as locus coeruleus as in Munn et al. (2021), we instead investigated thalamus activity and its interaction with large-scale cortical networks. We hypothesized that the higher-order area of the thalamus may trigger neural state transitions, in which case we expected a phasic increase in this region’s cofluctuation with cortical network regions.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Schematics of the initial hypothesis and the observed result.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of the initial hypothesis.

(2011) cortical networks. We calculated the cofluctuation time series of the 272 corticothalamic pairs. We then applied a new HMM to the time series of the 17 cortical networks only (instead of the 25 cortical and subcortical parcels we used in our main manuscript analysis). The four states inferred by this cortex-only HMM were similar to the results with the 25 parcels, with the mean activity pattern correlation <italic>r</italic>=0.988 for the DMN state, <italic>r</italic>=0.999 for the DAN state, <italic>r</italic>=0.989 for the SM state, and <italic>r</italic>=0.985 for the base state.</p><p>We then extracted cofluctuation values at each time point between [<italic>t-3</italic>, <italic>t</italic>+3] centered on new state onsets at time <italic>t</italic>. We averaged these values across every state transition for each participant. For every fMRI run, we tested whether any of the corticothalamic pairs consistently increased their cofluctuation prior to state transitions (i.e., higher cofluctuation values at time <italic>t</italic>-1, compared to <italic>t</italic>+3, compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Across all runs, <italic>none</italic> of the pairs exhibited increased cofluctuation prior to state transitions. On the contrary, <italic>most</italic> of the pairs exhibited significant decreases in cofluctuation at time <italic>t</italic>-1, as observed in Figure 2 in the manuscript and schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B</xref>. Thus, instead of a transient increase in cofluctuation of corticothalamic edges, a transient and global decrease in cofluctuation better explained neural state transitions detected by the HMM.</p><p>Another possibility we considered was that the thalamus received indirect signals from the brainstem and basal forebrain, as these regions show phasic bursts in activity (Munn et al., 2021). If this were the case, we predicted that thalamic activity would increase 200-300ms after signal bursts in the deep brain regions (Shine, 2019).</p><p>To test this second hypothesis, we time-aligned 16 thalamic regions’ BOLD activity to [<italic>t-3</italic>, <italic>t</italic>+3] time windows centered on the new state onsets at <italic>t</italic>. When we compared the averaged time-aligned BOLD activity (<italic>z</italic>) to the null distribution where we circular-shifted the HMM latent state sequence, none of the 16 thalamic regions showed significant differences in BOLD activity compared to chance. Our analysis did not detect modulation of thalamic BOLD activity that was aligned to HMM state transitions.</p><p>Because of our methodological limitation in probing deeper brain area activity and lack of support for the hypothesis that corticothalamic interactions drive state transitions, we did not make strong claims about the role of the ascending arousal system in our manuscript. Nonetheless, we strongly agree that continuing to explore what causes macroscale state transitions will provide significant insights into cognitive, attentional, and arousal dynamics and is an important direction for future work. We further hope our reports on global desynchronization preceding brain state transitions may inspire future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General – the 'base state' that the authors' report is reminiscent of the results from Saggar et al.

We were not aware of previous findings of the base state at the time of writing the manuscript, so it was reassuring to see consistent findings. In the Discussion, we highlighted the findings of Chen et al. (2016) and Saggar et al. (2022). Both these studies highlighted the role of the base state as a “hub”-like transition state. However, as the reviewer noted, these studies did not address the functional relevance of this state to cognitive states because both were based on resting-state fMRI.</p><p>In our revised Discussion, we write that our work <italic>replicates</italic> previous findings of the base state that consistently acted as a transitional hub state in macroscopic brain dynamics.

The base state’s functional involvement was comparatively minor during controlled tasks.</p><p>Manuscript, page 17-18</p><p>“Past resting-state fMRI studies have reported the existence of the base state. Chen et al. (2016) used the HMM to detect a state that had ‘less apparent activation or deactivation patterns in known networks compared with other states.’ This state had the highest occurrence probability among the inferred latent states, was consistently detected by the model, and was most likely to transition to and from other states, all of which mirror our findings here. The authors interpret this state as an ‘intermediate transient state that appears when the brain is switching between other more reproducible brain states.’ The observation of the base state was not confined to studies using HMMs. Saggar et al. (2022) used topological data analysis to represent a low-dimensional manifold of resting-state whole-brain dynamics as a graph, where each node corresponds to brain activity patterns of a cluster of time points. Topologically focal ‘hub’ nodes were represented uniformly by all functional networks, meaning that no characteristic activation above or below the mean was detected, similar to what we observe with the base state. The transition probability from other states to the hub state was the highest, demonstrating its role as a putative transition state.</p><p>However, the functional relevance of the base state to human cognition had not been explored previously. We propose that the base state, a transitional hub (Figure 2B) positioned at the center of the gradient subspace (Figure 1D), functions as a state of natural equilibrium. Transitioning to the DMN, DAN, or SM states reflects incursion away from natural equilibrium (Deco et al., 2017; Gu et al., 2015), as the brain enters a functionally modular state. Notably, the base state indicated high attentional engagement (Figure 5E and F) and exhibited the highest occurrence proportion (Figure 3B) as well as the longest dwell times (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) during naturalistic movie watching, whereas its functional involvement was comparatively minor during controlled tasks. This significant relevance to behavior verifies that the base state cannot simply be a byproduct of the model. We speculate that susceptibility to both external and internal information is maximized in the base state—allowing for roughly equal weighting of both sides so that they can be integrated to form a coherent representation of the world—at the expense of the stability of a certain functional network (Cocchi et al., 2017; Fagerholm et al., 2015). When processing rich narratives, particularly when a person is fully immersed without having to exert cognitive effort, a less modular state with high degrees of freedom to reach other states may be more likely to be involved. The role of the base state should be further investigated in future studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General – I was surprised that the study by Viduarre et al. (PNAS, 2017) was not cited, as it used a similar methodological approach (HMM) on resting-state data to infer the underlying dynamical structure of the data.

We agree with the reviewer about noting the similarities and differences of our results from this paper, and have added this to the Discussion.</p><p>Manuscript, page 15-16</p><p>“This perspective is supported by previous work that has used different methods to capture recurring low-dimensional states from spontaneous fMRI activity during rest. For example, to extract time-averaged latent states, early resting-state analyses identified task-positive and tasknegative networks using seed-based correlation (Fox et al., 2005). Dimensionality reduction algorithms such as independent component analysis (Smith et al., 2009) extracted latent components that explain the largest variance in fMRI time series. Other lines of work used timeresolved analyses to capture latent state dynamics. For example, variants of clustering algorithms, such as co-activation patterns (Liu et al., 2018; Liu and Duyn, 2013), k-means clustering (Allen et al., 2014), and HMM (Baker et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2016; Vidaurre et al., 2018, 2017), characterized fMRI time series as recurrences of and transitions between a small number of states. Time-lag analysis was used to identify quasiperiodic spatiotemporal patterns of propagating brain activity (Abbas et al., 2019; Yousefi and Keilholz, 2021). A recent study extensively compared these different algorithms and showed that they all report qualitatively similar latent states or components when applied to fMRI data (Bolt et al., 2022). While these studies used different algorithms to probe data-specific brain states, this work and ours report common latent axes that follow a long-standing theory of large-scale human functional systems (Mesulam, 1998). Neural dynamics span principal axes that dissociate unimodal to transmodal and sensory to motor information processing systems.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Page 5 L46 why do they use the top-5 components</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point.
