In this study, we used the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) model as the major analysis method to perform hypothesis-free Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis on the data from MRC IEU OpenGWAS (18,097 exposure traits and 16 AD outcome traits), and conducted sensitivity analysis with six models, to assess the robustness of the IVW results, to identify various classes of risk or protective factors for AD, early-onset AD, and late-onset AD. We generated 400,274 data entries in total, among which the major analysis method of the IVW model consists of 73,129 records with 4840 exposure traits, which fall into 10 categories: Disease, Medical laboratory science, Imaging, Anthropometric, Treatment, Molecular trait, Gut microbiota, Past history, Family history, and Lifestyle trait. More importantly, a freely accessed online platform called MRAD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gwasmrad.com/mrad/">https://gwasmrad.com/mrad/</ext-link>) has been developed using the Shiny package with MR analysis results. Additionally, novel potential AD therapeutic targets (CD33, TBCA, VPS29, GNAI3, PSME1) are identified, among which CD33 was positively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with both EOAD and LOAD. TBCA and VPS29 were negatively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with both EOAD and LOAD. GNAI3 and PSME1 were negatively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with LOAD, but had no significant causal association with EOAD. The findings of our research advance our understanding of the etiology of AD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>mendelian randomization</kwd><kwd>interactive platform</kwd><kwd>causal association</kwd><kwd>therapeutic target</kwd><kwd>genome-wide association study</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82302872</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Meishuang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019013</institution-id><institution>Changchun Science and Technology Planning Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21ZY18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new online data analysis platform, Mendelian Randomization for Alzheimer’s Disease (MRAD), enables the identification of risk or protective factors for Alzheimer’s disease.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>AD is a progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system, characterized by cognitive impairment, reduced functional capacity for daily living, and behavioral changes. It can be divided into two types: early-onset AD (EOAD, age of onset ≤65 years) and late-onset AD (LOAD, age of onset &gt;65 years); the proportion of LOAD in patients with AD is approximately 95%, with LOAD having a stronger genetic predisposition than EOAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Godyń et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ransohoff and El Khoury, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zou et al., 2014</xref>). According to the latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO), the population with AD is currently over 50 million worldwide and is expected to rise to 115 million by 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">GBD and Dementia Forecasting Collaborators, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anonymous, 2022</xref>). With the increasing aging population, the incidence of AD continues to rise, making AD the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. Given that AD is a chronic complex disorder involving multiple pathophysiological changes, it is likely caused by the joint action of various factors in a multifaceted pathological process, and this intricate nature of AD contributes to the current challenges in its diagnosis and treatment, such as low consultation rates, high rates of misdiagnosis at initial consultations, and low rates of long-term standardized treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">World Alzheimer Report, 2022</xref>), thereby making AD one of the most perplexing diseases. Consequently, examining the pathogenic mechanisms of AD, identifying its risk factors, and conducting timely and effective early screening and diagnosis are of utmost importance.</p><p>Traditional epidemiological studies have reported common risk factors for AD. Some metabolic co-morbidities are highly associated with AD, such as cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Falsetti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Femminella et al., 2018</xref>), obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pegueroles et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anstey et al., 2013</xref>), and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jayaraman and Pike, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vagelatos and Eslick, 2013</xref>). Serological parameters such as C-reactive protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 2023</xref>), lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>), and vitamin levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lopes da Silva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Douaud et al., 2013</xref> have been previously reported as potential biomarkers for AD. In addition, some factors related to lifestyle, family history, education, economic level, and environment correlate with AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kivipelto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Livingston et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Livingston et al., 2020</xref>). However, most epidemiological studies are insufficient to draw definitive conclusions on causal association due to the potential for reverse causality and confounding bias.</p><p>MR analysis is an emerging method to explore the causal association between AD and various factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Williams et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2022</xref>). MR analysis reduces confounding and reverse causality due to the segregation and independent assortment of genes passed from parents to offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hingorani and Humphries, 2005</xref>). In the absence of pleiotropy (that is, genetic variation related to a disease via other pathways) and demographic stratification, MR can present a clear estimate of risk of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Emdin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davey Smith and Hemani, 2014</xref>). MR analysis is increasingly used to determine a causal relationship between potentially modifiable risk factors and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davies et al., 2018</xref>). These advantages make MR a valuable tool to better elucidate the potential risk or protective factors for AD.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2023</xref> used MR analysis to reveal the causal relationship between AD and factors including sociodemographic and early life status. However, the study revealed they are restricted by the available variables from the UKB database, which leads to variables such as air pollution, blood glucose measures, and so on were not included. And also, due to the high degree of heterogeneity present in AD subtypes, EOAD and LOAD have different biological and genetic characteristics. Our study uses the MRC IEU OpenGWAS database as the sample source for MR analysis to address the aforementioned limitations. The MRC IEU OpenGWAS database, the largest open GWAS database globally, has compiled 42,335 GWAS summary datasets from sources such as the UK Biobank, FinnGen Biobank, and Biobank Japan. Analyzing large-scale datasets will break new ground for MR research on AD.</p><p>MR requires a combination of background knowledge in biology, computer science, software studies, and statistics, which often leads to a dilemma where biologists are not well-versed in computer and statistical fields, while computer science experts struggle to adopt a medical biology mindset. Consequently, the vast majority of available GWAS data have not been effectively utilized through MR. Therefore, the construction of a multi-level data platform specifically for AD based on MR analysis of massive GWAS data is of great strategic significance, and it will facilitate researchers and clinicians worldwide to conveniently and rapidly obtain risk factors that are causally associated with AD.</p><p>In summary, in this work we attempt to identify risk or protective factors causally associated with AD from a holistic and systematic perspective, thereby providing new ideas for understanding the AD pathogenesis, achieving early diagnosis, and developing clinical drugs. In the first place, this study uses a hypothesis-free data mining approach to studying the possible etiology of Alzheimer’s disease based on MR, with specific attention to different AD subtypes (EOAD and LOAD). Based on this, we developed an online open integrated platform, MRAD (Mendelian randomization for Alzheimer’s disease, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gwasmrad.com/mrad/">https://gwasmrad.com/mrad/</ext-link>). Moreover, the platform was further enriched by including related targets’ information such as functions and pathways retrieved from the public database Uniprot. The platform is the first multi-dimensional, integrated, shared, and interactive comprehensive platform for AD MR research to date.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Results of hypothesis-free Mendelian randomization analysis for Alzheimer’s disease</title><p>Based on hypothesis-free Mendelian randomization analysis for Alzheimer’s disease, this study generated a total of 400,274 data points.

Users can enter search terms, such as exposure (e.g. LDL cholesterol) or id.exposure (e.g. ebi-a-GCST000759), in the search box. The search interface includes 20 control widgets, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. Among these control widgets, there are eight select boxes, including Classification I, Classification II, Classification III, id.outcome, method, effect_direction, Consortium, and Sex, allowing users to make single or multiple selections to filter the data. The control widgets also include two text input boxes, id.exposure and exposure, which allow users to search by text input (case-insensitive). The control widgets Min pval and Max pval allow users to search by numerical input (initial values: Min pval = 0, Max pval = 1). The Heterogeneity test and MR-Egger intercept test checkboxes provide users with a single-click option to obtain data results that have passed heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy tests (p&gt;0.05). The Year range slider helps users to filter data based on the year of publication (range: 2007–2022).

This study carried out hypothesis-free Mendelian randomization analysis for Alzheimer’s disease, which provided a thorough and comprehensive evaluation with regard to risk or protective factors for AD. This MR study covers most exposure traits that are causally associated with AD outcome traits, including diseases, medical laboratory science items, imaging items, anthropometric items, treatments, molecular traits, gut microbiota, past histories, family histories, and lifestyle traits, and reveals the causal associations between these exposure traits and different AD subtypes.</p><p>Based on this, for the convenience of display and operation, a user-friendly prediction platform was built online called MRAD. The MRAD provides a one-stop online analysis service for researchers worldwide, including data retrieval → visualization → personalized analysis → data download. Users can obtain analysis results of different MR models (the main IVW model and six sensitivity analysis models) on 18,097 exposure traits and 16 AD outcome traits, totaling 400,274 records, and are allowed to set personalized parameters to meet different analysis needs. Additionally, the MRAD provides interactive visualization interfaces and download functions for the above results.</p><p>MRAD platform provides a unique resource for systematically identifying risk or protective factors of AD, which facilitates early identification, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment, with significant clinical and social value. It could have several strengths: (i) The current methods for identifying AD mainly rely on assessment scales, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations, and brain PET/MRI. However, assessment scales can be biased by factors such as the anxiety and nervousness of the subjects. CSF examinations require an invasive lumbar puncture, leading to low patient acceptance. PET/MRI scans are expensive and have limited equipment accessibility. These limitations restrict early AD identification. Thus, there is a pressing clinical need for readily available, time- and cost-effective, and accurate detection methods. In this study, the Medical laboratory science and Molecular trait used could be less expensive, faster to detect, easier to operate, and more accessible for widespread adoption. They hold great value for early AD identification and have the potential to become crucial tools for identifying AD in the future. (ii) Imaging acts as a powerful assistive tool for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. Traditional imaging examinations mainly depict changes in the brain’s macroscopic structure, while research on microstructural changes in disease-related areas is relatively limited. Studies have demonstrated that microstructural neurodegenerative processes are extensive and pronounced during AD progression. Our study results cover traditional macroscopic neuroimaging results and reveal numerous potential causal relationships between brain microstructure and AD. The combination of macroscopic and microstructural insights will provide more valuable information for clinical diagnosis. (iii) Clarifying the patient’s disease, past history, and family history can aid in preventing AD at an early stage, and prevention of AD could be attained through monitoring anthropometric indicators, improving gut microbiota, and adjusting lifestyle traits. (iv) Currently, the development of new drugs for AD is mainly underscored by Aβ, Tau, and other inhibitors. Since 2000, global pharmaceutical companies have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in the development of new drugs for AD, and these drugs have not yielded successful results. AD drug development has thus been perceived as having the highest failure rate of all drug research, reaching 99.6%. Hence, further research on molecular traits to find new targets and develop new drugs for these targets will provide new pathways for AD treatment.</p><p>To briefly demonstrate the performance of MRAD, we explored the IVW model-identified exposure traits that had significantl consistentl effect across all the three main outcome traits of AD.</p><p>The association of lipids and lipoproteins, C-reactive protein, family histories, neurological disorders, glutamine, and education level with AD has been widely reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Picard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caramelli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kuo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raygani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Takechi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takechi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nordestgaard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wingo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hartmann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tynkkynen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hashemi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Treiber-Held et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zarrouk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zuin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Button et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cannon-Albright et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Letenneur et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stern et al., 1994</xref>) and is consistent with the results of this study. Moreover, given that the prevalence of LOAD is about 95% in patients with AD and that LOAD has a stronger genetic predisposition than EOAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Godyń et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ransohoff and El Khoury, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zou et al., 2014</xref>), identifying new risk genes for LOAD is crucial for understanding its potential etiology. Therefore, this study further explored the relationships between these traits and different AD subtypes, leading to the following findings: (i) apolipoprotein B, cholesterol, total, LDL cholesterol, Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, total cholesterol in LDL, total cholesterol in medium LDL, cholesterol to total lipids ratio in large LDL, free cholesterol in large LDL, free cholesterol in LDL, phospholipids in small LDL, parental or family history of AD, parental longevity (mother’s attained age), dementia, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, other degenerative diseases of the nervous system, and organic, including symptomatic, mental disorders were all positively associated with LOAD; (ii) apolipoprotein A-I, phospholipids to total lipids ratio in chylomicrons and extremely large VLDL, C-reactive protein, parental longevity (both parents in top 10%), and qualifications: A levels/AS levels or equivalent were all negatively associated with LOAD. These findings suggest that the above traits may have critical impacts on LOAD.</p><p>Moreover, some novel potential therapeutic targets of AD were identified as follows: CD33 on Monocytic Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells, CD33 on CD33 + HLA DR +CD14 dim, CD33 on CD33 + HLA DR+, CD33 on CD33 + HLA DR + CD14-, CD33 on CD33dim HLA DR -, CD33 on CD33dim HLA DR + CD11b-, and Myeloid cell surface antigen CD33 were positively associated with all the three main outcome traits of AD and the risk of LOAD. It has been reported that CD33 is a 67 kDa glycosylated transmembrane protein, a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins family (SIGLECS family), which is an important receptor for cell growth and survival, as well as a critical receptor for the clathrin-independent endocytosis pathway and the innate and adaptive immune system functions. CD33 is mainly expressed in microglia, which are a type of glial cells in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Villegas-Llerena et al., 2016</xref>). Meanwhile, the splicing efficiency of CD33 affects microglia activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Malik et al., 2013</xref>). Several genome-wide association studies have demonstrated that CD33 is a high-risk gene for AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hollingworth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gu et al., 2022</xref>). In animal models, knockdown of CD33 significantly reduced amyloid plaque levels and knockout mice did not exhibit other health defects. Sialylated glycoproteins and glycolipids on amyloid plaques bind to CD33, which is most likely the cause of the amyloid ‘immune escape’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Griciuc et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, polymorphisms in CD33 can increase the risk of AD by causing neuronal degeneration in the hippocampal and parahippocampal regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Downregulation of the sialic acid-binding domain of CD33 can reduce the risk of developing AD. Therefore, inhibiting CD33 is an effective approach to inhibiting the development of AD, and the sialic acid-binding site on CD33 is a promising pharmacophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miles et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Tubulin-specific chaperone A (TBCA) was negatively associated with all the three main outcome traits of AD, as well as EOAD and LOAD (pval is significant at the Bonferroni threshold). TBCA is an important member of the tubulin-specific chaperones (TBCs) family. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nolasco et al., 2005</xref> demonstrated that TBCA can regulate the proportion of α and β-tubulin, enabling them to correctly aggregate into cellular microtubules. Cellular microtubules play important roles in many biological functions, especially in cell movement, cell division, intracellular transport, and cell structure. After silencing TBCA, abnormal microtubule aggregation occurs in mammalian cells, and the cells cannot grow and divide normally, ultimately leading to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaitanos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cormier et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, studies have shown that TBCA plays a crucial role in correct β-tubulin folding and α/β-tubulin heterodimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellmunt et al., 2009</xref>). Protein misfolding can lead to many diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, higher levels of TBCA are significantly associated with lower AD risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hillary et al., 2022</xref>). These findings suggest that TBCA may serve as a potential protective factor against AD.</p><p>Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 29 (VPS29) was negatively associated with all the three main outcome traits of AD, as well as EOAD and LOAD (pval is significant at the Bonferroni threshold). VPS29 is a component of the retromer complex and is highly expressed in the brain, heart, and kidneys, playing an essential role in retromer functions such as synaptic transmission, survival, and movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ye et al., 2020</xref>). Retromer mainly consists of the VPS26-VPS29-VPS35 trimer and Sorting Nexins (SNXs), and its defects are closely related to various human diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ye et al., 2020</xref>). Studies have reported that VPS29 knockdown leads to reduced levels of VPS35 and VPS26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fuse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jimenez-Orgaz et al., 2018</xref>), which regulates the localization of retromer within neurons and is essential for the aging nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ye et al., 2020</xref>). The retromer complex has been found to regulate the transport of a variety of substances, including amyloid precursor protein (APP), β-secretase, and phagocytic receptors on microglia. The retromer complex regulates the production of amyloid-β (Aβ) by regulating the transport of relevant carrier proteins, thus playing a role in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). When the retromer complex malfunctions, the pathway for the reverse transport of APP and β-secretase to the trans-Golgi network is disrupted, resulting in an increase in the production of Aβ, which accelerates the pathological process of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seaman, 2021</xref>). Meanwhile, the reduction of phagocytic receptors on the surface of microglia weakens the clearance and protective functions of microglia. Recent studies have shown that stabilizing the retromer complex through chaperone proteins can limit the amyloid processing of APP to reduce the production of Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). These findings suggest that the retromer complex can serve as a new therapeutic target to intervene in the pathological progression of AD.</p><p>Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(k) subunit alpha (GNAI3) was negatively associated with the three main outcome traits of AD and the risk of LOAD. G proteins are a class of signal transduction proteins that can bind with guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and have guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis activity; they have more than 40 types, consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits with a total molecular weight of about 100 kDa, with the alpha subunit having the greatest variation and determining the specificity of the G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heese, 2013</xref>). G proteins are intracellular membrane proteins that shuttle between receptors and effector proteins, acting as signal transducers and playing an absolute dominant role in transmembrane cell signaling in the body. All cellular activities are related to signals, and signals are the initiating factors of all cell activities, while physiological responses are only the final results of signals acting on cells. After receiving external stimuli, cells respond by implementing signal transduction through a set of specific mechanisms to ultimately regulate the expression of specific genes, and the whole process is referred to as a cellular signaling pathway. In the pathogenesis of AD, the abnormal content and distribution of multiple signaling molecules, as well as the abnormality of signa transmission pathways, play an important role in AD pathological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fowler et al., 1995</xref>), suggesting that gaining insights into signal transduction mechanisms may provide a potential new pathway to explore the pathogenesis of AD.</p><p>Proteasome activator complex subunit 1 (PSME1) was negatively associated with all the three main outcome traits of AD and the risk of LOAD. PSME1 is the encoding gene of the 11 s proteasome activator subunit (also known as PA28α) and is located on human chromosome 14q11.2. PA28α is an activator of the proteasome, which mainly increases the protein degradation activity of 20 S proteasome and participates in MHC-I (major histocompatibility complex I) restricted antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelöf et al., 2018</xref>). Studies have shown that PA28α overexpression in the brain of female mice can effectively prevent protein aggregation in the hippocampus, thereby reducing depression-like behavior and enhancing learning and memory ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donggui, 2021</xref>). Related studies have shown that proteasome function and PA28α expression are inhibited in the brains of diabetic rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donggui, 2021</xref>). The PA28 expression in the diabetic brain has a certain regulatory effect on protein metabolism caused by oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donggui, 2021</xref>). As suggested above, PSME1 may be a new potential therapeutic target for AD and deserves further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, this is one of the most comprehensive studies to provide important insight into the genetic etiology underlying AD based on hypothesis-free Mendelian randomization analysis. In the meantime, we developed the first MR platform for AD, of great clinical and scientific significance that provided a thorough and comprehensive evaluation with regard to risk or protective factors for AD. It also provided physicians and scientists with a very convenient, free as well as user-friendly tool for further scientific investigation. It is important to notice that we recognized CD33, TBCA, VPS29, GNAI3, and PSME1 as novel potential therapeutic targets for AD that deserve further investigation in more detail. However, in this study, since the GWAS datasets for both the exposure and the outcome traits (AD) selected were obtained from the public database (MRC IEU OpenGWAS), where the GWAS datasets for AD are only of European population, and since we use the TwoSampleMR, which requires that the populations for the exposure traits and the outcome traits be the same to satisfy the requirement for a control variable, this study currently has certain limitations in terms of population. We initiated a Mendelian randomization study on AD at clinical hospitals in China and are currently in the sample collection stage to address the limitations. In the future, we will integrate data from more populations and continuously update new advances in AD research to explore its potential differences in different populations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MRC IEU OpenGWAS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elsworth et al., 2020</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/">https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">UniProt</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">UniProt Consortium, 2018</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org/">https://www.uniprot.org/</ext-link><break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002380">SCR_002380</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EVenn</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tong et al., 2022</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ehbio.com/test/venn/">http://www.ehbio.com/test/venn/</ext-link>#/</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R (version 4.1.2) software</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Simon Urbanek et al.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link><break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001905">SCR_001905</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TwoSampleMR (version 0.5.8)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hemani et al., 2018</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR">https://github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR</ext-link><break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_019010">SCR_019010</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TwoSampleMR package in the R (version 4.1.2) software</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Shiny (version 1.8.0)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">rstudio</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://shiny.posit.co/">https://shiny.posit.co/</ext-link><break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001626">SCR_001626</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Shiny package in R (version 4.1.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MRAD</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">this paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gwasmrad.com/mrad/">https://gwasmrad.com/mrad/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper, a new online data analysis platform for identifying the risk or protective factors for AD called MRAD.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Database and software</title><p>The following databases and software packages were used in this study: MRC IEU OpenGWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elsworth et al., 2020</xref>;

The random-effects IVW model is the gold standard for MR studies, its principle is to calculate the inverse of the variance of each IV as its weight, assuming all IVs are valid. The regression does not include an intercept term, and the final result is the weighted average of the effect estimates from all IVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bowden et al., 2017</xref>). This model indicates that the true effect values may vary across different studies due to both sampling error and the heterogeneity of the true effect. The weight of each study is jointly determined by its inverse variance and the estimated heterogeneity variance. Thus, as long as there is no pleiotropy, even when there is significant heterogeneity (p&lt;0.05), this method is preferred.</p><p>To assess the robustness of the IVW results, sensitivity analysis was performed using six additional models: (i) MR-Egger: MR-Egger’s biggest difference from IVW is that it considers the intercept term during regression to evaluate bias caused by horizontal pleiotropy. The intercept represents the magnitude of horizontal pleiotropy, with a value close to 0 indicating minimal pleiotropy. The primary purpose is to detect and correct for horizontal pleiotropy. Thus, when significant horizontal pleiotropy is observed (p&lt;0.05), this method is preferred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgess and Thompson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Slob et al., 2017</xref>). (ii) Weighted median: The weighted median method is a technique for evaluating causal relationships using a majority of genetic variants (SNPs). If at least 50% of the SNPs are valid IVs, the median of the causal estimates will tend toward the true causal effect. This method provides an unbiased estimate (i.e. the ‘majority validity’ assumption) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowden et al., 2016</xref>). (iii) Simple mode: Involves comparing the frequencies or proportions of genotypes or phenotypes between control and experimental groups. Moreover, it can illustrate whether the observed differences in genotypes or phenotypes between the two groups are statistically significant. (iv) Weighted mode: The weighted mode method is a technique for combining multiple Mendelian randomization estimates. This method assigns weights to the causal effect estimates of different genetic variants on the trait and then takes the weighted mode as the final estimate of the causal effect. In genetic variant estimates, the method can decrease bias caused by outliers. (v) Maximum likelihood: This method is used when it is known that a random sample follows a particular probability distribution; however, the specific parameters of that distribution remain unknown, and it involves conducting multiple experiments, observing the results, and using those results to infer the approximate values of the parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xue et al., 2021</xref>). (vi) Penalized weighted median: An enhanced version of the weighted median estimate that provides a consistent estimate of the causal effect. (vii) Heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy assessment use the heterogeneity tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Higgins et al., 2003</xref>) and Egger intercept tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowden et al., 2015</xref>), respectively.</p><p>The above analyses were performed using the TwoSampleMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hemani et al., 2018</xref>) package in the R (version 4.1.2) software. Association of exposures with outcomes was assessed using odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI), with OR &gt;1 indicating a positive association (risk factor) and 0&lt;OR &lt; 1 indicating a negative association (protective factor). Differences with a two-sided p&lt;.05 were considered statistically significant. Furthermore, owing to the relatively large number of exposure and outcome traits included in this study, the multiple testing correction method Bonferroni correction was added to identify significant hits, the threshold for Bonferroni-corrected was 0.05 divided by 289,552 tests (p&lt;1.727e-07).</p><sec id="s4-3-4-1"><title>Building the MRAD platform</title><p>In this study, the online MRAD platform was developed using the Shiny package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shiny, 2024</xref> in R (version 4.1.2) and hosted on an Ubuntu 20.04 server.

The random-effects IVW model as the gold standard for MR studies, its principle is to calculate the inverse of the variance of each IV as its weight, assuming all IVs are valid. The regression does not include an intercept term, and the final result is the weighted average of the effect estimates from all IVs [34]. This model indicates that the true effect values may vary across different studies due to both sampling error and the heterogeneity of the true effect. The weight of each study is jointly determined by its inverse variance and the estimated heterogeneity variance. Thus, as long as there is no pleiotropy, even when there is significant heterogeneity (p &lt; 0.05), this method remains the best MR model.</p><p>To assess the robustness of the IVW results, sensitivity analysis was performed using six additional models: (i) MR-Egger: MR-Egger’s biggest difference from IVW is that it considers the intercept term during regression to evaluate bias caused by horizontal pleiotropy. The intercept represents the magnitude of horizontal pleiotropy, with a value close to 0 indicating minimal pleiotropy. The primary purpose is to detect and correct for horizontal pleiotropy. Thus, when significant horizontal pleiotropy is observed (p &lt; 0.05), this method is preferred [35,36]. (ii) Weighted median: The weighted median method is a technique for evaluating causal relationships using a majority of genetic variants (SNPs). If at least 50% of the SNPs are valid IVs, the median of the causal estimates will tend toward the true causal effect. This method provides an unbiased estimate (i.e., the “majority validity” assumption) [37]. (iii) Simple mode: Involves comparing the frequencies or proportions of genotypes or phenotypes between control and experimental groups. Moreover, it can illustrate whether the observed differences in genotypes or phenotypes between the two groups are statistically significant. (iv) Weighted mode: The weighted mode method is a technique for combining multiple Mendelian randomization estimates. This method assigns weights to the causal effect estimates of different genetic variants on the trait and then takes the weighted mode as the final estimate of the causal effect. In genetic variant estimates, the method can decrease bias caused by outliers. (v) Maximum likelihood: This method is used when it is known that a random sample follows a particular probability distribution; however, the specific parameters of that distribution remain unknown, and it involves conducting multiple experiments, observing the results, and using those results to infer the approximate values of the parameters [38]. (vi) Penalized weighted median: An enhanced version of the weighted median estimate that provides a consistent estimate of the causal effect. (vii) Heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy assessment use the heterogeneity tests [39] and Egger intercept tests [40], respectively.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Comment: While the authors mention that the MRAD database offers interactive visualization interfaces, the paper lacks detailed information on how to interpret and understand these visual results.

The paper should articulate how MRAD can contribute to the early identification, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of AD and its potential societal and clinical value more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. In the Discussion section of the revised manuscript, we have now added how MRAD can contribute to the early identification, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of AD and its potential societal as well as clinical value. And we reorganized the structure of Discussion section to make the text easier to understand, which could be helpful to further clarify the significance of MRAD. (page 15)</p><p>The newly added text describing the practical applications and potential clinical significance of the MRAD database is as follows:</p><p>“(i) The current methods for identifying AD mainly rely on assessment scales, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations, and brain PET/MRI. However, assessment scales can be biased by factors such as the anxiety and nervousness of the subjects. CSF examinations require an invasive lumbar puncture, leading to low patient acceptance. PET/MRI scans are expensive and have limited equipment accessibility. These limitations restrict early AD identification. Thus, there is a pressing clinical need for readily available, time- and cost-effective, and accurate detection methods. In this study, the Medical laboratory science and Molecular trait used could be less expensive, faster to detect, easier to operate, and more accessible for widespread adoption. They hold great value for early AD identification and have the potential to become crucial tools for identifying AD in the future. (ii) Imaging acts as a powerful assistive tool for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. Traditional imaging examinations mainly depict changes in the brain’s macroscopic structure, while research on microstructural changes in disease-related areas is relatively limited. Studies have demonstrated that microstructural neurodegenerative processes are extensive and pronounced during AD progression. Our study results cover traditional macroscopic neuroimaging results and reveal numerous potential causal relationships between brain microstructure and AD. The combination of macroscopic and microstructural insights will provide more valuable information for clinical diagnosis. (iii) Clarifying patient’s disease, past history, and family history can aid in preventing AD at an early stage, and prevention of AD could be attained through monitoring anthropometric indicators, improving gut microbiota, and adjusting lifestyle traits. (iv) Currently, the development of new drugs for AD is mainly underscored by Aβ, Tau, and other inhibitors. Since 2000, global pharmaceutical companies have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in the development of new drugs for AD, and these drugs have not yielded successful results. AD drug development has thus been perceived as having the highest failure rate of all drug research, reaching 99.6%. Hence, further research on molecular traits to find new targets and develop new drugs for these targets will provide new pathways for AD treatment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Comment: Grammar and Spelling Errors: There are several spelling and grammar errors in the paper.

However, each method has its own assumption, and IVW is only robust when pleiotropy and heterogeneity are not severe. Rather than using IVW imprudently across all associations, it would be more appropriate to choose the best MR method for each association based on heterogeneity/Egger intercept tests. This customized approach, based on tests of MR assumption violations, yields more stable and reliable results. For reference, please follow up on work by Milad et al. (EHJ - &quot;Plasma lipids and risk of aortic valve stenosis: a Mendelian randomization study&quot;). This study selected the best MR model for each association based on pleiotropy and heterogeneity tests. Given the large number of tests in this work, I suggest initially screening significant signals using IVW, as done, and then validating the results using multiple MR methods for those signals. It is common for MR estimates from different methods to vary significantly (with some being statistically significant and others not), and in such cases, the MR estimates from the best-fitted model should be trusted and highlighted.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your professional comments. We agree that our description of the Statistical models for causal effect inference was not specific enough. Therefore, we have included a new text describing more details about each method’s assumption and supplied a predefined approach to select the best statistical estimation from these methods in the Statistical models for causal effect inference section of Methods section (page 9-10). However, we would like to clarify our analysis method. In this study, the main analysis method used is the IVW random effects model instead of the IVW fixed effects model. The IVW random effects model indicates that the true effect values of different studies may vary, including both sampling error and heterogeneity of the true effect. The weight of each study is jointly determined by its inverse variance and the estimated heterogeneity variance. Thus, as long as there is no pleiotropy, even when there is significant heterogeneity (p &lt; 0.05), this method is still the best MR model.

Also, due to the high degree of heterogeneity present in AD subtypes, which have different biological and genetic characteristics. Thus, the previous studies cannot offer a systematic and complete viewpoint.&quot;. This statement overlooks a similar study published in Molecular Psychiatry (&quot;A Phenome-wide Association and Mendelian Randomization Study for Alzheimer's Disease: A Prospective Cohort Study of 502,493&quot;), which rigorously assessed the effects of 4171 factors spanning 10 different categories on AD using observational analysis and MR. The authors should revise their statement on the novelty of their study type throughout the manuscript and discuss how their work differs from and potentially strengthens previous studies.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for directing us to this literature. We have read this article carefully. This study shares some similarities with our study but there are significant differences with regards to sample sources and research fields. The study, as mentioned by the reviewer, used the UKB database as its sample source, and analyzed the association between 10 categories (comprising 4,171 factors) and AD, which were sociodemographic, physical measures, lifestyle and environment, health conditions, mental health, medications and operations, cognitive function, sex-specific factors, employment, and early-life factors. However, the study revealed they are restricted by the available variables from the UKB database, which lead to variables such as air pollution, blood glucose measures and so on were not included. Conversely, our study used samples from the MRC IEU OpenGWAS database, the largest open GWAS database globally. Furthermore, our research focus differs, as we primarily investigate the causal relationship between the following 10 categories (comprising 18,097 traits) and AD, which were Disease, Medical laboratory science, Imaging, Anthropometric, Treatment, Molecular trait, Gut microbiota, Past history, Family history, and Lifestyle trait. Most importantly, we have established a database encompassing all MR analysis results, allowing researchers and clinicians worldwide to conveniently and rapidly retrieve AD-associated risk factors via an online open integrated platform (MRAD, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gwasmrad.com/mrad/">https://gwasmrad.com/mrad/</ext-link>).We have now added a new text in the Background section (page 6-7) describing the differences and potential strengthens towards previous studies.</p><p>The newly added text describing the differences and novelty towards previous studies is as follows:</p><p>“Chen et al. [30] used MR analysis to reveal the causal relationship between AD and factors including sociodemographic and early life status. However, the study revealed they are restricted by the available variables from the UKB database, which lead to variables such as air pollution, blood glucose measures and so on were not included. And also, due to the high degree of heterogeneity present in AD subtypes, which have different biological and genetic characteristics. Thus, the previous studies cannot offer a systematic and complete viewpoint. Our study uses the MRC IEU OpenGWAS database as the sample source for MR analysis to address the aforementioned limitations. The MRC IEU OpenGWAS database, the largest open GWAS database globally, has compiled 42,335 GWAS summary datasets from sources such as the UK Biobank, FinnGen Biobank, and Biobank Japan. Analyzing large-scale datasets will break new ground for MR research on AD.</p><p>MR requires a combination of background knowledge in biology, computer science, software studies, and statistics, which often leads to a dilemma where biologists are not well-versed in computer and statistical fields, while computer science experts struggle to adopt a medical biology mindset. Consequently, the vast majority of available GWAS data have not been effectively utilized through MR. Therefore, the construction of a multi-level data platform specifically for AD based on MR analysis of massive GWAS data is of great strategic significance, and it will facilitate researchers and clinicians worldwide to conveniently and rapidly obtain risk factors that are causally associated with AD.”</p><p>Reference:</p><p>[30] Chen SD, Zhang W, Li YZ, et al.

These corresponding id.exposure are shown in red font with a yellow highlight. (iii) Moreover, according to the customized best-fitted model, when there is pleiotropy, MR-Egger is the best model. These corresponding id.exposure are shown in red font with a green highlight.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Comment: Figures S4-S10: These figures are screenshots of web browsers and may not be worth showing.

In this study, Figures S4-S10 are screenshots related to the user guide. We sincerely appreciate the reviewer’s feedback and have revised the subheading of this section to MRAD User Guide to clarify its purpose. Demonstrating both text and figures in this section, we aim to help users understand ways to operate MRAD more intuitively and easily.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Comment: Additionally, please show upfront or highlight results from MR analyses based on R packages, as the author mentioned in the method section. Somehow it's difficult to find results from MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, weighted mode, maximum likelihood, and penalized weighted median, along with heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy tests in the supplementary materials. Apologies if I missed them. Please ensure these results are clearly presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your comments and suggestions for improving our manuscript. Thank you for pointing this out. We have added the results of the sensitivity analysis based on R packages (as shown in Figure 5, Figure S1-S7, and Table S2).</p></body></sub-article></article>
