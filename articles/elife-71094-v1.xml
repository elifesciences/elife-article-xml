[25(OH)D] concentrations are associated with maternal and fetal health outcomes. Using physiological human placental perfusion and villous explants, we investigate the role of the placenta in regulating the relationships between maternal 25(OH)D and fetal physiology. We demonstrate active placental uptake of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> by endocytosis, placental metabolism of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> into 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> and active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>], with subsequent release of these metabolites into both the maternal and fetal circulations. Active placental transport of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and synthesis of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> demonstrate that fetal supply is dependent on placental function rather than simply the availability of maternal 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>. We demonstrate that 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> exposure induces rapid effects on the placental transcriptome and proteome. These map to multiple pathways central to placental function and thereby fetal development, independent of vitamin D transfer. Our data suggest that the underlying epigenetic landscape helps dictate the transcriptional response to vitamin D treatment. This is the first quantitative study demonstrating vitamin D transfer and metabolism by the human placenta, with widespread effects on the placenta itself. These data demonstrate a complex interplay between vitamin D and the placenta and will inform future interventions using vitamin D to support fetal development and maternal adaptations to pregnancy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>placenta</kwd><kwd>Vitamin D</kwd><kwd>fetal

fetus, so maternal vitamin D or its biologically significant metabolites 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and/or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D] must be transferred across the placenta. This transfer is important for both fetal and lifelong health. Indeed, maternal 25(OH)D concentrations are positively associated with fetal bone growth and birth weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harvey et al., 2014c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mahon et al., 2010</xref>), and associations with bone health and body composition persist into postnatal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crozier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Javaid et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooper et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harvey et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, understanding the regulatory mechanisms and rate-limiting steps of placental vitamin D transfer is a prerequisite for identifying options for targeted intervention to improve pregnancy outcomes. It is unclear whether the benefits of vitamin D and its metabolites are due to direct transfer to the fetus or indirect effects on the placenta. Fundamental questions need to be answered: (1) Does placental metabolism generate substantial quantities of vitamin D metabolites that contribute to the maternal or fetal circulation? (2) How are these vitamin D metabolites taken up by placenta? (3) Do vitamin D metabolites affect the placenta itself? This third question is particularly important as changes in placental function could subsequently influence the fetus independently of vitamin D transfer.</p><p>Maternal 25(OH)D was previously thought to diffuse passively across the placenta, and to be hydroxylated in the fetus to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, as fetal metabolite levels relate to maternal levels for 25(OH)D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouillon et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delvin et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Markestad et al., 1984</xref>) but not for 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fleischman et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hollis and Pittard, 1984</xref>). We challenge this idea as work in the kidney questions the role of passive diffusion as a mechanism of vitamin D uptake and demonstrates that renal vitamin D uptake is driven primarily by receptor-mediated endocytosis of vitamin D bound to vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">White and Cooke, 2000</xref>) or albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bikle et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bikle et al., 1986</xref>). We propose a similar endocytic uptake mechanism for vitamin D [25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D] in the placenta, indicating an active role for the placenta in regulating fetal 25(OH)D delivery. Furthermore, placental metabolism of maternal 25(OH)D, either by placental 1α-hydroxylase (<italic>CYP27B1</italic>) metabolism into 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D or 24-hydroxylase (<italic>CYP24A1</italic>)-mediated breakdown, will influence the quantity and form of vitamin D metabolite reaching the fetus. In human placenta, both enzymes are localized to the syncytiotrophoblast, which is the primary barrier to maternal-fetal exchange. Whether the activity of these placental enzymes generates substantial quantities of vitamin D metabolites that significantly contribute to the maternal or fetal circulations is unknown.</p><p>Placental uptake and metabolism of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D will determine the availability of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D for inducing transcriptional changes within the placenta via the vitamin D receptor (VDR), retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRA) receptor dimer. Placental 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D may therefore regulate gene pathways involved in placental functions that influence fetal growth and risk of lifelong poor health. Indeed, we have shown that maternal 25(OH)D and DBP concentrations relate to expression of placental genes, including those associated with fetal and postnatal lean mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cleal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cleal et al., 2011</xref>). The effects of vitamin D, thought to be via the 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D form, on placental gene expression are not clear as these are cell/tissue specific and depend on the chromatin state and DNA-binding proteins available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zeitelhofer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fetahu et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, vitamin D may induce epigenetic regulation of gene expression. For example, in immune cells ligand-bound VDR exerts epigenetic effects via interaction with chromatin modifiers and coactivator or corepressor proteins, such as histone modifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zeitelhofer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fetahu et al., 2014</xref>). Changes to DNA methylation have also been reported with vitamin D cellular incubation, patient supplementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fetahu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Curtis et al., 2019</xref>), or in association with vitamin D status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harvey et al., 2014b</xref>), supporting a role of VDR in altering DNA methylation.</p><p>The current study was designed to establish how 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> is taken up, metabolized, and mediates gene expression within the human placenta using the more physiological perfusion model and intact villous explant culture systems, contrasting with the cell model approach of previous studies. We show novel active mechanisms of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> uptake by the human placenta and placental metabolism of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> influencing fetal and maternal levels. Furthermore, 25(OH)D induces placental-specific effects on the transcriptome, the native and in vivo modified proteome expressed in patterns relevant to placental function and therefore fetal development, independent of vitamin D transfer. These effects are dependent on the underlying epigenetic landscape. By discovering the mechanisms underlying the complex interactions between maternal vitamin D levels, placental vitamin D handling, and genetic/epigenetic processes in the placenta, our findings inform the identification of functional biomarkers that relate to fetal growth and the risk of disease across the life course.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> is taken up by the human placenta and both metabolized and transferred into the fetal circulation</title><p>The use of <sup>13</sup>C-labeled 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> in the maternal circulation of the ex vivo placental perfusion model allowed actual quantification of the placental metabolism of <sup>13</sup>C-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and transfer of this <sup>13</sup>C-25(OH)D and its metabolites from the maternal to fetal circulation in the term placenta.

We investigated the metabolism of <sup>13</sup>C-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> within placental tissue and transfer across the placenta using the whole placental cotelydon perfusion open loop methodology as adapted in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cleal et al., 2011</xref>). Using five fresh placentas, <sup>13</sup>C-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> (plus albumin as a binding protein) was perfused for 5 hr into the maternal circulation of a single isolated cotyledon and the amount transferred into the placenta and fetal circulation quantified using liquid chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The amount of each specific vitamin D metabolite transferred into the fetal and maternal circulation was also quantified using LC-MS/MS or enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Following 5 hr of placental perfusion, there was loss of maternal <sup>13</sup>C-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> from the maternal circulation indicative of placental uptake (27.4% ± 6.3% of maternal stock) and release into the fetal circulation (5.1% ± 1.5<italic>%</italic> of maternal stock; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). These amounts are consistent with the levels taken up by the kidney via active mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nykjaer et al., 1999</xref>). The transfer rate of <sup>13</sup>C-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> into the placenta was 3.01 ± 1.12 pmol/min/g, with 0.45 ± 0.27 pmol/min/g stored in placental tissue, 2.25 ± 0.97 pmol/min/g metabolized, and 0.30 ± 0.10 pmol/min/g transferred to the fetal circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). However, there was no correlation between <sup>13</sup>C-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> levels in the maternal and fetal circulations of this open loop placental perfusion system: a system that identifies delivery, but not build-up, of substrates in either circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the placenta plays an important role in determining the amount of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> transferred to the fetus and also stores and uses 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> for its own cellular needs.

There was direct evidence of 24-hydroxylase action in the placental tissue with metabolism of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> into <sup>13</sup>C-24,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>) but no detectable epi25(OH)D<sub>3.</sub> Placental <sup>13</sup>C-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and <sup>13</sup>C-24,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels were positively correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.998, p=0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Of this <sup>13</sup>C-24,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, 16.78% ± 7.20% (0.50 ± 0.30 pmol/min/g) was stored in the placental tissue, 20.4% ± 3.21% (0.71 ± 0.10 pmol/min/g) was transferred into the fetal circulation, and 66.56% ± 6.31% (2.05 ± 0.35 pmol/min/g) was transferred into the maternal circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>). There was also evidence of placental 1α-hydroxylase activity with metabolism of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> into 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>). Transfer of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> into both the maternal (0.20 ± 0.05 fmol/min/g) and fetal (0.04 ± 0.01 fmol/min/g) circulations occurred over the 5 hr experiment with direct evidence of placental metabolism of <sup>13</sup>C-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> into <sup>13</sup>C-1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (0.49 fmol/min/g, n = 1 due to detection limits). These data provide evidence that once within the placenta 25(OH)D can be metabolized into downstream products that could have effects within the placenta itself including VDR-mediated transcription. These findings demonstrate that the human placenta does produce 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and release it into the maternal circulation at levels anticipated to increase overall circulating concentrations of this metabolite in the mother. However, the placental contribution is likely to be a smaller proportion of overall 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> concentration in the maternal circulation as most of this metabolite is produced by the maternal kidney. Case reports of pregnant women with impaired renal function showed that circulating 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels increased during pregnancy but at levels much lower than normal pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greer et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Turner et al., 1988</xref>). Furthermore, high levels of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D (uncoupled to DBP levels) are observed throughout pregnancy without hypercalciuria or hypercalcemia. This could be of placental origin, but is most likely via renal 1α-hydroxylase that is uncoupled from feedback control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hollis et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We observed greater release of <sup>13</sup>C-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> metabolites into the maternal circulation compared with the fetal circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The transfer of <sup>13</sup>C-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and its metabolites in the placenta to fetal direction may be more challenging, and in particular, diffusion across the water-filled villous stroma may prove a barrier to their diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), consistent with recent observations on placental cortisol transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stirrat et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, positive correlations between fetal <sup>13</sup>C-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and <sup>13</sup>C-24,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D concentrations (<italic>r</italic> = 0.913, p=0.03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>) suggest similar or limited transfer processes for these metabolites in the placental to fetal direction. This is supported by the fact that placental to maternal transfer rates were higher, prioritizing maternal supply, and that placental and maternal <sup>13</sup>C-24,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels positively correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.966, p=0.03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). The greater amount of <sup>13</sup>C-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> metabolites released into the maternal circulation, compared with the fetal circulation, also indicates a potential role of the placenta in vitamin D-mediated maternal adaptations to pregnancy. These data substantiate a role for placental metabolism and transfer mechanisms being important for fetal vitamin D metabolite levels. These experiments therefore show that the placenta can produce substantial quantities of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> metabolites, which can contribute to both the maternal and fetal circulating levels and highlights the importance of placental expression of the vitamin D-metabolizing enzymes 24-hydroxylase (gene <italic>CYP24A1</italic>) and 1α-hydroxylase (gene <italic>CYP27B1</italic>).</p><p>Placental <italic>CYP24A1</italic> gene expression (which is induced by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>) was significantly increased following perfusion with <sup>13</sup>C-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>), providing further evidence that 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> is converted to active 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> by 1α-hydroxylase in human placenta. In a subset of term human placentas taken from the Southampton Women’s Survey (SWS, n = 102), we did not observe an association between maternal 34-week pregnancy plasma 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> levels and <italic>CYP24A1</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = –0.15, p=0.18) or <italic>CYP27B1</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = 0.14, p=0.20) gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cleal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Inskip et al., 2006</xref>).

This suggests that factors other than vitamin D levels, such as maternal body composition, may regulate baseline levels of this gene. The fact that the placenta can produce 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3,</sub> which induces expression of the degradation enzyme <italic>CYP24A1,</italic> suggests homeostatic regulation of placental vitamin D activity and potentially its transfer to the fetus. This has implications for the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Uptake of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and albumin into the placenta is prevented by inhibition of endocytosis</title><p>To explore the mechanisms of placental 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> uptake, fresh term human placental villous fragments were incubated for 8 hr with 20 µM 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> plus the binding protein albumin.

The application of a range of endocytic inhibitors, which target different aspects of endocytic uptake, aimed to pinpoint the discrete machinery required for the uptake of this particular cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooke et al., 2021</xref>). The vitamin D-mediated upregulation of <italic>CYP24A1</italic> mRNA expression was significantly reduced by amiloride, cytochalasin D, and RAP in the presence of albumin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Although the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange inhibitor amiloride was used in our study to inhibit pinocytosis, it has been shown to also inhibit clathrin-mediated uptake in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ivanov et al., 2004</xref>) and receptor-mediated uptake in kidney cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gekle et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that our observed inhibitory effects of amiloride may be due to nonselective blockage of endocytosis via modulation of the actin cytoskeleton. The inhibitory effect of cytochalasin D suggests that 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> is taken up by the human placenta using a clathrin-dependent endocytic mechanism, and specifically blocking this mechanism by RAP indicates a role for binding protein-mediated uptake via specific megalin receptor binding. These observations suggest that vitamin D is transported into the placenta by a selective and controlled active mechanism, not by simple diffusion as previously thought, which has potential implications for the effectiveness of maternal vitamin D supplementation and its bioavailability to the fetus.</p><p>The gene expression of megalin/<italic>LRP2</italic> and cubilin/<italic>CUBN</italic> was investigated in term human placentas from the SWS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Inskip et al., 2006</xref>). Both showed no association with maternal 34-week pregnancy plasma 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> levels (data not shown) and positive associations with measures of fetal size; <italic>LRP2</italic> mRNA expression related to crown-rump length at 11 weeks’ gestation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.23, p=0.05, n = 51) and birth weight (<italic>r</italic> = 0.20, p=0.05, n = 102); <italic>CUBN</italic> mRNA expression related to birth head circumference (<italic>r</italic> = 0.22, p=0.03, n = 102) and crown-heel length (<italic>r</italic> = 0.21, p=0.04, n = 102). This supports a role for the placenta in mediating the amount of vitamin D transferred to the fetus, which will be determined by placental uptake capacity, which in turn effects fetal size. We suggest that the placenta may be playing an active role in mediating the supply of vitamin D to the fetus, thus contributing to its regulation and effects on development.</p><p>Vitamin D-induced gene expression changes in the placenta could also mediate fetal development by altering placental function. Placental uptake and metabolism of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> will ultimately determine the amount of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> available within the placenta for activation of the VDR and initiation of transcription. Interestingly, in SWS placentas we see associations between VDR mRNA expression and measures of fetal size, suggesting that vitamin D-mediated transcription is important for regulating aspects of placental function that affect fetal size. Placental <italic>VDR</italic> mRNA levels associate negatively with measures of fetal and neonatal size and body composition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table1sdata1">Table 1—source data 1</xref>), and <italic>RXRA</italic> mRNA levels associate negatively with 4-year lean mass (<italic>r</italic> = –0.27, p=0.005) and fat mass (<italic>r</italic> = –0.34, p=0.03). The placental levels of VDR and RXR may therefore determine the utilization of available 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D by the placenta via VDR binding. Increased VDR/RXR levels will result in activation of the <italic>CYP24A1</italic> gene encoding the enzyme that breaks down 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, reducing the quantities of the two metabolites available for transfer to the fetus for mediating effects on growth.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Associations of offspring size and vitamin D receptor relative mRNA expression in the Southampton Women’s Survey.</title><p><supplementary-material id="table1sdata1"><label>Table 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>qPCR vitamin D receptor data.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-71094-table1-data1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"><break/></th><th align="left" colspan="3" valign="bottom">VDR mRNA expression</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>r</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>p</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>n</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Size z-scores</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><break/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">19-week HC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.20</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.25</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">58</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">19-week AC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.03</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.83</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">58</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">19-week FL</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.05</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.74</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">58</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">34-week HC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.33</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.001</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">59</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">34-week AC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.32</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.02</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">59</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">34-week FL</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.28</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.04</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">59</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Birth data</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><break/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Placenta weight (g)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.22</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.03</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">101</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Birth weight (g)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.19</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.06</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">102</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">CHL (cm)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.22</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.03</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">102</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">DXA lean mass (g)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.24</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.02</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">102</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">DXA fat mass (g)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.22</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.03</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">102</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>4-year data</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><break/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">DXA lean mass (kg)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.42</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.005</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">46</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">DXA fat mass (kg)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.35</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.02</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">46</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Weight (kg)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.32</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.02</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">56</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>AC: abdominal circumference;

Effects of vitamin D on the machinery that regulates wider gene expression provide a mechanism for vitamin D to have extensive effects on placental function. This supports the actions of vitamin D in terms of increased cellular growth and upregulated functions that would support increased fetal growth. Vitamin D metabolites may therefore regulate gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms or be determined by the underlying epigenetic landscape and chromatin state in a tissue-specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first quantitative study demonstrating 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> transfer and metabolism by the human placenta, with widespread effects on the placenta itself.

In support of this, we see associations between placental expression levels of key vitamin D handling and metabolic genes and aspects of fetal size in our cohort study. Placental transfer of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> metabolites may contribute to the increased maternal 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> concentrations during gestation, which contribute to maternal physiological adaptations that support pregnancy. Effects of vitamin D on fetal development may also be mediated via effects on the placenta itself. Indeed, we show that 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> exposure differentially affects the expression of placental genes and proteins, which together map to multiple gene pathways critical for the placenta’s role in pregnancy. Epigenetic analyses suggest that the underlying epigenetic landscape helps to dictate the placental transcriptional response to vitamin D treatment, raising the possibility that environmentally induced epigenetic alterations may reshape the vitamin D response.</p><p>These data demonstrate a complex interplay between vitamin D and the placenta to ensure that they can both play optimal roles in supporting fetal growth and maternal adaptations to pregnancy. These data are generated from term placenta and so may not represent differences in function, gene expression, and DNA methylation across gestation, and future studies are needed to determine how our findings relate to earlier stages of gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simner et al., 2017</xref>). Although we know that key mediators of this interplay, such as <italic>CYP27B1/CYP24A1/VDR</italic>, have higher expression levels earlier in pregnancy, indicating these effects will be important throughout gestation. This work therefore strongly suggests a role for placental transport and metabolism in mediating the balance of vitamin D distribution and utilization throughout pregnancy. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms and rate-limiting steps in the relationship between vitamin D and the placenta will be a prerequisite for identifying options for targeted intervention to improve pregnancy outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

At 66 hr, matched cell samples had control media or 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> added to a final concentration of 20 μM and were cultured for a period of 24 hr before collection at 90 hr. β-Human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) released by cultured cytotrophoblast cells into the culture media was measured as a marker of syncytialization using a β-hCG ELISA Kit (DRG Diagnostics, Germany). Increasing levels of β-hCG production were observed by 66 hr of culture; average β-hCG levels in the 90 hr culture media were 413.13 mIU ml<sup>–1</sup>. At 90 hr, media were removed, cells were washed in PBS, and fixed in methanol.

Both mother and fetus (in terms of skeletal development and birth weight) are heavily dependent on sufficient 25(OH) vitamin D and its conversion to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> vitamin D. This interesting work concentrates on the central role of placental function and not maternal physiology to the uptake of 25(OH) vitamin D and its transformation to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> vitamin D in determining the availability of vitamin D metabolites to the fetus in pregnancy.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involves in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bruce Hollis (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. These studies are well designed, however there are a few areas where the use of controls would strengthen the conclusions and where discussion of the data should be clarified.</p><p>2. In Figure 3 it would have been useful to show FITC albumin images that correlate with the experimental paradigm shown in 3D, ie the effect of the blocker on Villus FITC albumin. Additionally, it seems unlikely that blocking three independent methods of uptake (pinocytosis, classical clathrin-dependent endocytosis and megalin-mediated endocytosis) specifically block 25D uptake. How do the authors interpret this data? One would think that if all three pathways were important as suggested by their inhibition of Cyp24a1 expression, that the other two pathways would compensate when the third is blocked. This is not consistent with their claim that megalin plays a major role, based on RAP inhibition of Cyp24a1 expression.</p><p>3. The discussion of the studies shown in Figure 5 should be simplified to state that at baseline the methylation of the upregulated and downregulated genes differs, but that vitamin D has no effect nor does vitamin D alter H3K27ac and H3K4 me3. The way it is currently presented suggests that vitamin D does have an effect, which is very misleading.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have performed an elaborate and detailed study with respect to vitamin D metabolism during pregnancy using placental perfusion technology. This in itself provides a very unique study in vitro. However, the authors need to reconcile an observation from this work with actual human physiology. The authors suggest that placental production of 1,25OHD has a positive effect on the maternal circulating level of that compound. However a study by Greer F et al., J Pediatrics 1984 would suggest otherwise. In that study a pregnancy women with normal placental function but dysfunctional renal 1- hydroxylase activity failed to increase her circulating level of 1,25OHD while receiving 100,000 IU/d vitamin D2 maintenance of serum calcium. Also in that case, fetal levels of 1,25OHD were normal presumably from normal fetal 1-hydroxylase activity. These in vivo observations suggest that placental production of 1,25OHD is not of importance at sustaining maternal levels of that vitamin D metabolite and a normal functional renal hydroxylase would be, a function that this women did not have.<italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Some data elements require further clarification and should be expounded upon.</p><p>1) Further clarification of study results, including validation of transcriptomic and proteomic data with quantitative PCR and Western blotting for some deferentially expressed genes, and the use of VDR knockdown as a control, if possible.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71094.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Following our initial FITC-albumin uptake experiments, it was clear that we needed a more direct measure of vitamin D uptake. For this reason, we moved to using the expression of a vitamin D responsive gene (<italic>CYP24A1</italic>) as our output for the subsequent experiments using blockers. This provides evidence that the vitamin D itself had entered the cell and not just the binding protein (albumin).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, it seems unlikely that blocking three independent methods of uptake (pinocytosis, classical clathrin-dependent endocytosis and megalin-mediated endocytosis) specifically block 25D uptake.

We have therefore expanded the text to explain this.</p><p>The following has been added to line 208 page 7 of the manuscript:</p><p>“The application of a range of endocytic inhibitors, which target different aspects of endocytic uptake, aimed to pinpoint the discrete machinery required for the uptake of this particular cargo.”</p><p>Amiloride may induce global cellular effects as it inhibits Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange, disrupting the actin cytoskeleton (GTPases involved in actin remodeling are highly sensitive to submembranous pH, leading to impaired actin polymerization), which is required for several endocytic pathways involving invagination.</p><p>The following has been explained on line 212 page 7:</p><p>“Although the Na+/H<sup>+</sup> exchange inhibitor amiloride was used in our study to inhibit pinocytosis, it has been shown to also inhibit clatherin mediated uptake in epithelial cells [34 Ivanov et al., 2004] and receptor mediated uptake in kidney cells [35 Gekle et al., 2001], suggesting our observed inhibitory effects of amiloride may be due to nonselective blockage of endocytosis via modulation of the actin cytoskeleton.”</p><p>This therefore tells us that the vitamin D uptake is via a form of endocytosis or pinocytosis.</p><p>Both cytochalasin D and Receptor Associated Protein (RAP) block an aspect of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Cytochalasin D caps actin filaments inducing their disassembly and inhibits fluid-phase clathrin-mediated uptake. Receptor Associated Protein (RAP), which blocks binding to megalin and cubilin is the most specific blocker and supports a role for megalin-binding mediated uptake (a class of clathrin-mediated uptake).</p><p>The following has been explained on line 216 page 7:</p><p>“The inhibitory effect of cytochalasin D suggests that 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> is taken up by the human placenta using a clathrin-dependent endocytic mechanism, and specifically blocking this mechanism by RAP indicates a role for binding protein mediated uptake via specific megalin receptor binding.”</p><p>To make it clear that they are not independent mechanisms the following has been added on line 208 page 7:</p><p>“megalin-mediated endocytosis (one type of clathrin-dependent endocytosis).”</p><p>It is also stated on line 201 page 7:</p><p>“megalin (LDL-related protein 2 (LRP2)) and cubilin (CUBN), which mediate vitamin D internalisation by clathrin-dependant endocytosis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We also note that measurement techniques for 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D are now generally vastly improved. Consistent with our findings, a second case study of women with renal disease shows that despite impaired renal function there are increased 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels during pregnancy, although they are lower than normal (Reference [27] M. Turner, <italic>et al.,</italic> 1988).</p><p>The findings of our study demonstrate that the human placenta does produce 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D and releases it into the maternal circulation. The levels of placental 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D secretion observed here would be expected to increase maternal vitamin D levels but would be a modest proportion of overall vitamin D. We have the benefit of using an open loop perfusion system so that we can measure direct release by the placenta before any maternal uptake or metabolism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Some data elements require further clarification and should be expounded upon.</p><p>1) Further clarification of study results, including validation of transcriptomic and proteomic data with quantitative PCR and Western blotting for some deferentially expressed genes, and the use of VDR knockdown as a control, if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. For the transcriptomic data, we have demonstrated replication of changes in specific genes in another cohort, as shown in Supplementary Figure 1. To provide validation, for a selection of genes that were either increased, decreased or unchanged in the RNA-seq experiment (Supplementary Figure 1) we have added qPCR measures of mRNA expression change and now refer to this on line 256 page 8.</p><p>For the proteomic data, western blotting is a semi-quantitative approach at best, and we do not feel that validation using this is necessary or appropriate. LCMS demonstrates a high level of analysis specificity, sensitivity and selectivity with an analytical confidence above 99% (vs 70-75% of Western blotting, at best).</p><p>Furthermore, a strength of this study is that we have measured changes at the gene and protein levels and we can have high confidence where these both change together.</p><p>A VDR knockdown would be an interesting control experiment that would demonstrate that vitamin D is acting via the canonical VDR pathway in the placenta rather than a novel non-canonical VDR independent mechanism. While a novel non-canonical pathway for vitamin D signalling would be highly interesting there is no evidence to suggest that it is likely be the case and addressing this question would be a study in itself. Answering this question is not central to the current paper and is not something that can easily be achieved.</p></body></sub-article></article>
