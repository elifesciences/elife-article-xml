Although the basal ganglia and cerebellum have been implicated in monitoring of supra- and sub-second intervals, respectively, the underlying neuronal mechanism remains unclear.

Conversely, neuronal correlates of trial-by-trial variation of self-timing emerged earlier in the cerebellum than the striatum.

To make timely movements, elapsed time often needs to be monitored and the timing of upcoming events needs to be accurately predicted. Previous studies have shown that, in addition to the cerebral cortex, both the basal ganglia and the cerebellum are implicated in this function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buhusi and Meck, 2005</xref>). In humans, the underlying neural mechanism of self-timing has been examined by recording scalp potentials that develop gradually over the medial frontal cortex in anticipation of task-relevant events (contingent negative variation or CNV: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Macar and Vidal, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Rijn et al., 2011</xref>). However, CNV sometimes provides only a poor indication of event timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kononowicz and van Rijn, 2011</xref>), possibly because it contains multiple components. In fact, the magnitudes of CNV are known to be correlated with neural activity in the thalamus, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nagai et al., 2004</xref>), indicating that the ramping-up of neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex is likely to be regulated by different signals arising from multiple subcortical structures.</p><p>More direct evidence for the role of subcortical signals in motor preparation has come from animal experiments. In monkeys, neurons in the motor thalamus exhibit a gradual rise in firing rate that predicts the timing of self-initiated movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costello et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka, 2007</xref>), and their inactivation causes delayed self-timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Donkelaar et al., 2000</xref>). Recent studies in rodents have demonstrated that direct inputs from the thalamus are necessary for generating preparatory activity in the premotor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2017</xref>), while signals in the cortical network are also essential for generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murakami et al., 2014</xref>) and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2016</xref>) of ramping activity. Because the thalamus transmits signals from both the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, elucidation of the neuronal activity in these subcortical structures will address specific roles of respective cortico-subcortical loops in self-timing.</p><p>A prevailing hypothesis regarding subcortical contribution to timing is that the basal ganglia process supra-second interval timing while the cerebellum is involved in sub-second timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ivry and Spencer, 2004</xref>). Our recent analysis in monkeys showed that neurons in the cerebellar dentate nucleus exhibited preparatory activity only about a half second before self-initiated saccades, irrespective of the length of the mandatory delay interval that ranged from 400 to 2400 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohmae et al., 2017</xref>). These results indicate that neurons outside of the cerebellum must keep track of elapsed time to make temporally accurate movements in trials with supra-second delay intervals. Because neurons in the striatum are known to exhibit ramping activity during motor preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schultz and Romo, 1992</xref>), signals in the cortico-basal ganglia loop might play this role.</p><p>To understand the roles of the basal ganglia and the cerebellum in self-timing, we compared activity of single neurons in the anterior part of the striatum (caudate nucleus) with those in the posterior part of the cerebellar dentate nucleus in monkeys performing the self-timed saccade task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashmore and Sommer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kunimatsu and Tanaka, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2007</xref>). Because the previous studies have demonstrated that these subcortical regions have common anatomical connections with the medial and lateral frontal cortices involved in temporal processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dum and Strick, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McFarland and Haber, 2001</xref>), we reasoned that these areas might have functional interactions. Although the previous studies of eye blink conditioning suggest that plasticity in the cerebellar cortex rather than the deep cerebellar nuclei plays a role in the learning of motor timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia and Mauk, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perrett et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raymond et al., 1996</xref>), neurons in the nuclei encode timing signals originated in the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ten Brinke et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we explored signals in the dentate nucleus in this study because any significant computation in the lateral cerebellum must modify neuronal activity in the nucleus that may eventually regulate movement timing. We found that neurons in the striatum displayed a ramping-up of firing rate throughout the delay period, while the rate of rise of neuronal activity depended on the length of the mandatory delay interval. In contrast, neurons in the cerebellar dentate nucleus exhibited preparatory activity only during the last part of the delay period, while neuronal correlates of trial-by-trial variation of saccade latency started earlier in the cerebellum than the striatum. These results suggest that the striatum may play a role in monitoring the passage of time relative to the mandatory interval, while the cerebellum might play a role in the fine adjustment of self-timing in the range of hundreds of milliseconds.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Time courses of preparatory activity for self-timing in the striatum and the cerebellum</title><p>We examined neuronal activity while two Japanese monkeys performed the self-timed saccade task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

This neuron elevated activity immediately after cue appearance but the rate of rise of firing rate differed for different interval timing. In contrast, the representative cerebellar nuclear neuron shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> also exhibited a ramp-up activity, but the timing of ramp onset differed depending on the mandatory intervals, while the rate of rise of activity was roughly constant. The time courses of the population activity for each structure also gave a similar impression. Again, the ramp-up activity started just after cue onset in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), while the firing modulation started late for trials with longer delay in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The rate of rise of preparatory activity differed for different interval timing in the caudate nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), while the activity was similar across all timing in the cerebellar dentate nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results held consistent even when the same sets of data were aligned with saccade initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Among six experiments (three for each monkey), ipsiversive self-timed saccades were delayed in four and three experiments in trials with short and medium delay intervals, respectively. For contraversive saccades, changes in self-timing were found in two experiments in trials with short delay intervals (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p&lt;0.05 with Bonferroni correction).

When we compared the coefficient of variation of self-timing, the values were statistically greater during inactivation than the control for ipsiversive saccades in trials with a short delay interval (paired t-test, p=0.042), indicating that the signals in the dentate nucleus may regulate the precision of self-timing in trials with a short delay interval. Because injections of saline into three effective sites in either structure failed to alter saccade latency in all conditions (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p&gt;0.05), the present results were not attributed to a non-specific volume effect. Taken together, the results of inactivation experiments were consistent with the notion that signals in the cerebellum mostly regulate sub-second timing while those in the striatum are important for supra-second timing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our exploration of neuronal signals in the striatum and the cerebellar dentate nucleus during self-timing yielded four major findings. First, neurons in the striatum were active throughout the delay period and altered the rate of rise of firing rate depending on the timing instruction, while those in the cerebellum were recruited only during the last part of the delay period, exhibiting a similar time course of activity for different interval timings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Second, neuronal correlates of trial-by-trial variation started earlier in the cerebellum than the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that the cerebellum might be essential for the fine adjustment of self-timing in each condition. Third, a subset of striatal neurons showed a clear preference for a specific interval, while such neuron was almost absent in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Finally, the effects of inactivation in the striatum were greater for supra-second timing, while those in the cerebellum were dominant for sub-second timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), indicating that the relative contributions of these subcortical structures were different for different intervals. Based on these observations, we conclude that neurons in the striatum keep track of elapsed time by representing relative timing to the intended interval, while those in the cerebellum may participate in the generation of self-timed movements with a certain precision.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Roles of the basal ganglia and cerebellum in self-timing</title><p>We found that individual neurons in the striatum continuously kept track of relative timing. A similar scalable ramping activity has been reported in the prefrontal cortex of rats performing the self-timing task within the range of a few seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Other recent studies have also shown that the transient neuronal activity in the rat striatum represents a scalable population code for interval timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Such temporally-dependent transient signals might be integrated in time to generate monotonic ramping activity to keep track of elapsed time and for making decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janssen and Shadlen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murakami et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, some striatal neurons in the latter study were active throughout the delay period and continuously represented passage of time, although the proportion of such neurons appeared to be relatively small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mello et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>It has been widely accepted that dopamine signaling in the striatum is essential for interval timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coull et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Merchant et al., 2013a</xref>). Subjects with Parkinson’s disease, for example, show deficits in the estimation and production of interval timing within the range of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pastor et al., 1992</xref>) and exhibit a significant decrease in the magnitude of CNV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikeda et al., 1997</xref>). In experimental animals, local application of dopamine receptor antagonists into the striatum alters self-timing in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kunimatsu and Tanaka, 2016</xref>), and more specifically, optogenetic inhibition of nigro-striatal pathways disrupts temporal discrimination in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soares et al., 2016</xref>). However, the firing of midbrain dopamine neurons is known to be generally phasic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>) and therefore appears unlikely to continuously keep track of elapsed time during motor preparation, while the gain of transient sensory response might carry temporal information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soares et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the dopamine concentration in the striatum has been recently shown to exhibit a gradual increase when performing tasks requiring continuous behavioral control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Howe et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, in rats moving towards distant goals, the level of striatal dopamine was proportional to the relative distance (or time) to the goals, thereby showing a scalable monotonous increase. Although how the dopamine release is regulated within the striatum remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D'Souza and Craig, 2006</xref>), the continuous representation of relative timing in striatal neurons might be relevant to the regulation of dopamine release at the terminal.</p><p>Aside from scalable, linear representation of interval timing, the existence of non-linear, duration-selective neuronal representation has also been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merchant and Averbeck, 2017</xref>). Time-dependent firing modulation in individual neurons has been reported during motor preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murakami et al., 2014</xref>), sensory-guided continuous movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schoppik and Lisberger, 2006</xref>) and the maintenance of spatial working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Constantinidis and Klingberg, 2016</xref>). In the present experiments, neurons in the striatum showed greater variation in peak firing rate for different mandatory delay intervals than the cerebellum, and a minority of striatal neurons exhibited a clear duration tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, in the population as a whole, neuronal activity just before saccade initiation was comparable across interval timing, and the neuronal firing rate at a given moment represented the relative timing to the intended interval. Assuming that the duration-selective elements represent absolute timing, such non-linear temporal representation may not conform to the flexible representation of relative timing found in the neuronal population. Instead, the duration-selective elements might distinguish behavioral goals rather than provide a neuronal representation of elapsed time, although how these signals are used for self-timing remains uncertain.</p><p>Since the cerebellum is essential for accurate movements, the generation of self-initiated saccades at proper timing must be one of critical functions of the cerebellum. In this study, we found that neuronal correlates of stochastic variation of self-timed saccade started earlier in the cerebellum than the striatum, while preparatory activity started late in the cerebellum for supra-second intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our recent analysis of neuronal activity in the cerebellum showed that trial-by-trial latency for sub-second timing was correlated with the rate of rise of preparatory activity, while that for supra-second timing was correlated with the times of activity onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohmae et al., 2017</xref>). These results suggest that saccade latency for sub-second timing might depend largely on the magnitude of neuronal activity in the cerebellum, while that for supra-second timing might be regulated by the combination of cerebellar activity and the external signals triggering the activity.</p><p>Consistent with this hypothesis, the effects of cerebellar inactivation on saccade latency were dominant for sub-second intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), while inactivation often increased the variation of self-timing even for supra-second interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The latter findings were consistent with the previous results of stimulation experiments showing that signals in the cerebellum can modify self-timing for all intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohmae et al., 2017</xref>), although the inactivation effects on latency variation found in this study were relatively small for the long intervals. This could be because the cerebellum may have a potential to adjust timing only in the range of several hundreds of milliseconds, and because the inactivation effects of the cerebellum might be masked by the greater variation of duration estimation for supra- than sub-second intervals.</p><p>In addition to the increased variation of self-timing, cerebellar inactivation also prolonged saccade latency in the standard memory-guided saccade task and the visually-guided saccade task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Because the cerebellum is known to assist the cerebral cortex to boost motor commands during the initiation of somatic movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thach et al., 1992</xref>), the weak transient activity around the time of visually-triggered saccades found in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>) might also play such a role. However, given the strong preparatory activity for self-timing, neurons in our recording sites in the dentate nucleus may not be simply providing motor commands for saccades. While the latency of visually-triggered saccades was only ~180 ms in our monkeys, the ramping activity started ~500 ms before self-timed saccades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting a role for motor planning. This was also supported by our previous findings that electrical stimulation applied to the dentate nucleus advanced self-timing without directly eliciting immediate saccades, and that the same stimulation pulses delivered during the delay period did not alter saccade latency in the standard memory-guided saccade task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohmae et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the signals in the cerebellar dentate nucleus may regulate timing of decisions for self-initiated movements. This function might gain importance in the situation where the precision of self-timing need to be preserved. Future studies may require consideration on these possibilities.</p><p>As a limitation of the present study, it should be noted that the other parts of the striatum and the deep cerebellar nuclei might represent sub- and supra-second intervals, respectively. Indeed, functional imaging studies often detect multiple loci in respective subcortical structures relevant to temporal information processing (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). However, the functional preference for short and long intervals for the cerebellum and the basal ganglia are also supported by many previous functional imaging and case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lewis and Miall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ivry and Spencer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buhusi and Meck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allman et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We recently found in monkeys that the trial-by-trial latency of self-timed saccades was inversely correlated with the pupil diameter just before the delay period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, the pupil diameter did not predict absolute timing, but was indicative of relative timing to the intended interval in each trial. Considering that the pupil diameter is well correlated with the noradrenergic signaling in the locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>), and that these neurons send massive projections to the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Olson and Fuxe, 1971</xref>), the stochastic variation of self-timing, cerebellar neuronal activity, and the pupil diameter might all be connected. Local manipulation of noradrenergic signaling in the cerebellum can provide a critical test for this possibility, whereas systemic pharmacological application complicates the interpretation of results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki and Tanaka, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Integration of subcortical signals</title><p>It remains unclear how the signals in the basal ganglia and the cerebellum are integrated to decide movement timing, although these areas have a common connection with the frontal and parietal cortices via the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McFarland and Haber, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prevosto et al., 2010</xref>). Recent anatomical data in rodents show that signals from the basal ganglia are sent to the superficial layers in the motor cortex via the thalamus, while those from the cerebellum are sent to deeper layers, suggesting that the basal ganglia and the cerebellum may play roles in preparing and triggering movements, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaneko, 2013</xref>). Similarly, different subcortical signals for self-timing are possibly integrated through interplay between different layers in the cerebral cortex. In fact, individual neurons in the medial frontal cortex in monkeys are known to exhibit different time courses of activity during isochronous tapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merchant and Averbeck, 2017</xref>), suggesting that these signals might come from different subcortical sources. Alternatively, signals originating in the basal ganglia and the cerebellum might be separately processed in different areas in the cerebral cortex. For example, a recent study in rodents demonstrated that neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex signaled deterministic timing, while those in the premotor cortex represented stochastic timing during tasks requiring self-initiated movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murakami et al., 2017</xref>). These cortical areas might be specifically involved in the cortico-basal ganglia and the cortico-cerebellar loops, respectively. Furthermore, recent anatomical studies showed that the basal ganglia and cerebellum can mutually communicate with each other through disynaptic subcortical pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bostan and Strick, 2018</xref>). Although the outputs from the cerebellar dentate nucleus have been shown to facilitate signals in the striatum through the thalamus in behaving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), how these subcortical pathways can integrate signals for self-timing need to be examined in future study.</p><p>In addition to measuring single time intervals, the functional linkage between the basal ganglia and the cerebellum also appears to be essential for a variety of cognitive tasks. For temporal information processing, beat-based timing has been thought to be processed in the cortico-basal ganglia pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Teki et al., 2011</xref>), but recent analyses also suggest a role for the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohmae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teki and Griffiths, 2016</xref>). In addition, while proactive inhibition for demanding behavioral tasks requires intact basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank et al., 2007</xref>), recent studies also show that the cerebellum is involved in countermanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ide and Li, 2011</xref>) as well as anti-saccade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peterburs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kunimatsu et al., 2016</xref>) paradigms. Furthermore, recent studies in rodents have detected neuronal modulation associated with temporal-difference prediction error of aversive stimuli in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ohmae and Medina, 2015</xref>), although such signals have long been thought to be a hallmark of neural processes in the basal ganglia. All these recent studies indicate the necessity of future research linking neuronal processes in the basal ganglia with those in the cerebellum for comprehensive understanding of global network controlling behaviors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal preparation</title><p>Experiments were conducted on two female Japanese monkeys (<italic>Macaca fuscata</italic>, 7–8 kg).

Visual stimuli were presented on a 24-inch cathode-ray tube monitor (refresh rate: 60 Hz) that was located 38 cm away from the eyes, and subtended a visual angle of 64 × 44°. We used three saccade paradigms: the self-timed memory-guided saccade task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the standard memory-guided saccade task, and the visually-guided saccade task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In the self-timed memory-guided saccade task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashmore and Sommer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costello et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kunimatsu and Tanaka, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), monkeys were required to make a saccade to the location of a previously presented visual cue (100 ms) without any immediate external trigger. The FP disappeared only after the animals generated a self-timed saccade, as eye position deviated &gt;3° from the FP. The mandatory delay interval following the cue onset was selected from short (400–700 ms), medium (1000–1600 ms), or long (2400–3100 ms) intervals that were indicated by FP color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lower panel; cyan, blue and yellow squares for short, medium, and long intervals, respectively). In the standard memory-guided saccade task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hikosaka and Wurtz, 1983</xref>), monkeys made a saccade to the remembered location of the visual cue in response to the FP offset (&lt;400 ms) that occurred randomly during 700–2500 ms (uniform distribution) following cue onset. In this task, saccade timing was instructed externally by extinction of the FP. In the visually-guided saccade task, the saccade target appeared at the time of the FP offset (always 1600 ms following its appearance), and the animals made an immediate saccade to the target. To inform the monkeys of the trial type, the FP was red for the standard memory-guided saccade task and the visually-guided saccade task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In all these tasks, the saccade target and visual cue were presented either 16° left or right of the FP. The size of the eye position window was 2° for initial fixation and 4° for the peripheral targets. Correct performance was reinforced with a liquid reward at the end of each trial. Each trial was presented in pseudo-random order within a block that consisted of 10 different trials (five trials in opposite directions).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Recording and inactivation procedures</title><p>To record from single neurons, a glass-coated tungsten electrode (Alpha Omega Engineering) guided by a 23-gauge stainless tube was lowered into the striatum (caudate nucleus, ±2 mm of the anterior commissure and 4–8 mm lateral to the midline) or the cerebellar dentate nucleus (6–8 mm posterior to the interaural line and 6–8 mm lateral) in separate experiments using a micromanipulator (MO-97S; Narishige). The location of electrode penetration was adjusted using the grid system (Crist Instruments). Signals obtained from the electrodes were amplified and filtered (0.3–10 kHz, Model 1800; A-M Systems). The waveform of action potentials of a single neuron was isolated using a real-time spike sorter with template-matching algorithms (ASD; Alpha Omega Engineering). We searched for the task-related neurons when monkeys performed a block of randomized saccade trials. Once we isolated the putative task-related neuron exhibiting a ramping activity before saccade initiation, we collected data for ≥6 trials for the further offline analysis. We did not include the data from presumably tonically active neurons in the caudate nucleus, which exhibited characteristic tonic firing pattern and wider action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aosaki et al., 1995</xref>). Neurons included for the analysis had low baseline firing rate and were considered as medium-spiny projection neurons and some GABAergic interneurons.</p><p>For the inactivation experiments, we manufactured injectrodes composed of epoxy-coated tungsten microelectrode (FHC Inc.) and silica tube (Polymicro Technology; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tachibana et al., 2008</xref>). The injectrode connected to a 10 μL Hamilton microsyringe was inserted through the guide tube, and a small amount of GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist (muscimol; 5 μg/μL, 1 μL for each site) was pressure-injected using a micropump (NanoJet; Chemyx Inc.) at the sites where the task-related neurons were previously recorded. For the inactivation experiments in the striatum, we infused muscimol into two sites along the same penetration (&gt;500 μm apart). The inactivation effects were assessed by comparing eye movements before and 15–90 min after muscimol injection. We also injected saline in separate experiments to ensure that the effect was not due to any volume effect.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Histological procedures</title><p>Recording sites in one monkey were reconstructed from histological sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). At the end of the experiments, several electrolytic lesions were made at or near sites where task-related neurons were recorded by passing a direct current through the electrodes (10–20 μA, tip negative, 800–1000 μC). The animal was then deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (&gt;60 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused transcardially with 0.1 M phosphate buffer followed by 3.5% formalin. The brain was cut into 50 μm thick transverse (cerebellum) and coronal (striatum) sections using a freezing microtome, and each section was stained with cresyl violet. We reconstructed the location of each task-related neuron according to the depth and coordinates of electrode penetrations, and the locations relative to the marking lesions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data acquisition and analysis</title><p>Spike timing and eye movement data were sampled at 1 kHz and saved in files during the experiments. Further off-line analyses were performed using Matlab (MathWorks). Saccades were detected when angular eye velocity exceeded 40°/s and eye displacement was &gt;3°. Trials were excluded from the analysis when saccades landed &gt;5° from the cue location. Saccade latency was defined as the time from either cue onset (self-timed saccade task) or FP offset (other two tasks) to the time of saccade initiation. Although monkeys sometimes generated early saccades before the expiration of mandatory delay for reward (6–12% and 16–35% of self-timed trials for monkeys B and G, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), these trials were also included for the analysis because the animals were supposed to monitor the elapsed time.</p><p>For quantification, we measured the firing rate during the following periods: (1) 300 ms just before the fixation point onset (baseline period), (2) 200 ms after the cue onset (visual period), (3) the 350 ms interval starting from 500 ms before saccades (delay period), and (4) 150 ms before saccade initiation (saccade period). In this study, we considered neurons with a significant firing modulation during the delay period according to post hoc multiple comparisons (one-way ANOVA followed by Scheffé’s method, p&lt;0.05). The time course of neuronal activity for each condition was qualitatively examined by computing the spike density function using a Gaussian kernel (σ = 15 ms).</p><p>To compare the time courses of preparatory activity for neurons in different structures, we estimated the rate of rise of neuronal activity by fitting (least squares) a non-linear function with parameters of the baseline, slope, and onset time of ramp-up activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The normalized population activity was computed from the traces of spike density starting from 400 ms before cue onset and ending at the mean saccade latency. The data during the 200 ms following 50 ms after cue onset were excluded to eliminate visual transient. To obtain confidence intervals, we randomly resampled neurons with replacement to obtain replications of the same size as the original data set, and this was repeated 1000 times (bootstrap method, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>).</p><p>For the analysis of neuronal correlates of trial-by-trial variation in self-timing, the data for each neuron were divided into three groups according to saccade latencies, and then the population of normalized activity for saccades in the preferred direction was computed for each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We compared normalized activity among three groups every millisecond (repeated measures ANOVA) and measured the timing of neuronal variation relative to either cue onset or saccade initiation when the traces significantly diverged (p&lt;0.01) for &gt;40 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The distributions of timing of neuronal variation were again computed using the bootstrap method.</p><p>For the triangular plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, the firing rate before saccades (200 ms) for each neuron was normalized for the sum of the activity in different conditions. The x-coordinate of each data point is the difference in normalized activity between the medium and long delay intervals, and the y-coordinate is the normalized response in the short delay interval times √3.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank T Mori, A Hironaka for technical assistance, M Suzuki for her administrative help, M Takei and Y Hirata for manufacturing equipment, and all lab members for comments and discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Naoshige Uchida as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Robert S Turner (Reviewer #2); John Assad (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The study compares the firing patterns of neurons in the striatum (the anterior part of the caudate nucleus) and the cerebellum (the posterior part of the cerebellar dentate nucleus) in a self-timed saccade task in two Japanese monkeys. Monkeys were trained to make a saccadic eye movement after a brief target cue presentation (100ms). To obtain reward, saccade onset had to be within a predetermined time interval (short, 400-700ms; medium, 1000-1600ms; long, 2400-3100ms) signaled by the color of the fixation point. The authors recorded the activity of neurons that 'elevated activity before self-timed saccade'. The authors made several interesting findings. First, the activity in the striatum started ramping shortly after the cue onset while that in the cerebellar nucleus started ramping only shortly before saccadic eye movement. Second, trial-by-trial fluctuation of saccade onset is more correlated with the pattern of activity in the cerebellar nucleus but not with that in the caudate nucleus. Third, the authors performed unilateral transient inactivation of each region using muscimol. During caudate inactivation, the onset of contraversive saccades was delayed in long interval trials, whereas that of ipsiversive saccades was shortened for all intervals. During cerebellar nucleus inactivation, a significant effect was found only for ipsiversive saccades in short interval trials. Furthermore, the coefficient of variation (CV) of saccade onset was not altered by caudate inactivation but increased in some conditions by cerebellar nucleus inactivation.</p><p>The possibility that neurons in these regions deferentially regulate self-timed movement initiation is of great interest, and this manuscript contains potentially very interesting results. The study is well designed, and the results appear to be high quality. The analyses are mostly appropriate (but see below) and text and illustrations are well prepared. Although all the three reviewers found this study to be of importance, they raised some concerns that we would like to see your response before recommending this work for publication at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The analyses of ramping activity were performed by aligning trials to cue onset. However, these analyses alone do not distinguish alternative hypotheses that need to be separated. For instance, these analyses do not distinguish whether the variability in ramping activity comes from different ramping patterns (e.g. different rates in ramp) or merely from the variation in movement onset timing. Some of the interpretations must distinguish these possibilities. It is, therefore, important to analyze the data by aligning trials to movement onset. We appreciate that you have already performed this in some analyses, but it is important to apply this method further and to more carefully interpret the results. Specifically, the measurement of ramping slope (Figure 4) should be made on data aligned to movement onset rather than cue onset. Moreover, a more conservative interpretation of the data (at least in Figure 5) is that the striatum activates considerably earlier than the cerebellum during self-timed movements; the &quot;variability&quot; argument is less convincing. That simpler interpretation is still consistent with the different roles that have been proposed for striatum and cerebellum in timing (seconds vs. sub-second).</p><p>Reviewer 3 provided a very thoughtful analysis of this issue, as summarized in the following paragraphs (taken directly from his/her review with some editing).</p><p>The major problem is that much of the analysis was performed with responses aligned to CUE onset rather than MOVEMENT onset (Figure 3 and Figure 4; I have seen this also in several other papers claiming that neurons show ramping before self-timed movements). The issue is that there is a *distribution* of movement times following cue onset. Most neurons in the motor system show activity preceding movement; these responses can be highly stereotyped relative to movement onset. If trials are aligned to the *cue time*, then on average among trials, even a stereotyped movement-related response will appear as a &quot;ramp&quot;, because the variability in self-timed movement latency from trial-to-trial will smear out the average response. Even more dangerous, the distribution of movement times is broader with longer timed intervals than shorter intervals, as the authors showed (Figure 1B) and many other labs have reported. Thus, if trials are averaged aligned on cue onset, the &quot;ramp&quot; will appear shallower for late movements than early movements – i.e., the broader distribution of movement times will &quot;smear out&quot; the average activity more for long than short intervals. This is exactly the problem in Figure 3 and Figure 4. These data need to be re-analyzed aligned with respect to *movement time*, not cue time (i.e., averaging trials back from the movement onset, excluding the 200 ms period following the cue to omit the visual response to the cue). The cue-aligned smearing problem is especially a problem for the cerebellar data, because the apparent &quot;ramp&quot; begins only ~500 ms before the movement (as the authors note) and thus overlaps extensively with the distribution of movement times.</p><p>This has been done in Figure 5. Here the average striatal responses (Figure 5A) still show clear differences in ramping slopes between short, medium and long times, but there is not much difference in slope evident for the cerebellar neurons (Figure 5B). That is, the *slopes* of the rise in cerebellar activity do not appear so different between the sub-divided trials in each category (e.g., light blue, medium blue and dark blue), or between medium or long trials (short trials are difficult to compare, because they are likely contaminated with the cue response). The ramp slope should be quantitatively measured from these movement-aligned data, not from cue-aligned data.</p><p>These observations make it hard to evaluate the claim that the ramps diverge earlier in cerebellum than in striatum. Figure 5A may suggest that striatal activity before the movement is actually comprised of two components, a slow ramp with a slope that co-varies with movement time (short, medium or long) and fast, peri-movement response that is more stereotyped with respect to the movement onset. The cerebellar neurons seem to only have only a fast, peri-movement response, which is larger than the peri-movement response of the striatal neurons. The cerebellar neurons also have much higher intrinsic firing rates. This difference may make it harder to detect the divergence point of the striatal peri-movement component compared to the cerebellum. It is also problematic to argue that the cerebellar response controls the late-phase variability of the movement latency when the cerebellar responses appears to be so stereotyped relative to movement. That is, the stereotypy of the cerebellar response might suggest it arises &quot;after the decision&quot; to move whereas the more variable slow ramp in striatum might suggest it &quot;contributes to the decision&quot;. As written now, casual readers may walk away with the idea that the cerebellum is somehow injecting variability into the movement time, whereas cerebellar responses seems fairly stereotyped relative to movement time.</p><p>2) Interpretation and General conclusion: The general conclusion regarding the role of the cerebellum hardly reaches beyond the results and thus is relatively uninformative. The authors conclude that Cb &quot;might be primarily responsible for the stochastic variation of self-timing.&quot; This, of course, is just what the data show. But why would such a large and complicated structure as the Cb have such a simple job as adding noise to interval timing? Is there some advantage to the animal to implement &quot;stochastic variation of self-timing?&quot; In other words, is sub-second variation an aspect of behavior that benefits the animal and that the Cb is designed (by evolution) to implement? Or, do the authors believe that this kind of variation is merely performance noise? If performance noise, then is it possible the Cb is reflecting this variability without actually controlling it?</p><p>It appears that another way to describe the same results is that activity in the Cb is closely time-locked to the time of saccade onset, even that Cb is closely involved in triggering saccade onset. Granted, the Discussion section does allude to ideas that Cb may be involved in action triggering, but this explanation differs significantly from the one invoked throughout the manuscript ascribing a role to the Cb in &quot;variation control&quot;.</p><p>3) Please provide more information regarding the rationale and the details of recording conditions. First, please provide more information concerning the locations sampled in striatum and dentate. Why were these locations chosen? What are the stereotaxic locations of the regions sampled? Were identical locations sampled in both animals? Do these regions of striatum and dentate &quot;project to&quot; (via their trans-thalamic pathways) the same regions of cortex? Is it possible that a different part of striatum might show sub-second variation related activity? or a different part of dentate show multi-second ramping activity?</p><p>A related question is whether the authors discriminated between the identifiable neuronal subtypes in the striatum? Were all or most of the neurons likely spiny projection neurons? Were TANs explicitly excluded from analysis?</p><p>4) To analyze the onset and slope of ramping activities, the authors fit a line incorporating onset and baseline (three parameters). It would be important to discuss how good the fit is (goodness of fit) at the level of single neurons and populations. Furthermore, it is important to report some data regarding neuron-to-neuron variability in firing patterns.</p><p>5) The interpretation of the inactivation experiments appears to warrant further clarification. There appears to be a significant change in the CV in the long interval condition (Figure 7F). Is this true? How does this relate to the authors' conclusions? Overall, it would be helpful to clarify how the authors interpret the inactivation results (Figure 7).</p><p>6) Last, but not least, there is a logical concern with your study. You compare activity in the input nucleus of the basal ganglia with activity in an output nucleus of the cerebellum. This difference is especially relevant given that current computational models of timing in these subcortical structures tend to focus on the striatum and cerebellar cortex (either Purkinje cells or the cerebellar cortical cells that provide input to the Purkinjes). We are not aware of models that posit a role for DCN neurons in &quot;timing computations&quot;. In fact, some classic results in the eyeblink literature have shown that if the system is just driven by DCN (following lesions/inactivation of cerebellar cortex), you lose the adaptive timing of the CR. This has been taken to mean that inputs to DCN (from extracerebellar regions) are sufficient to associate the CS and US, but the adaptive timing of the CR comes from the cerebellar cortex.</p><p>This issue needs to be made explicit both in the Introduction and Discussion section. You need to outline the logic of comparing the striatum to the DCN, as well as outline how your results may be qualified by the fact that you have focused on this comparison. As things are now written, the framing makes it sound like the striatum and DCN provide a way to compare temporal processing/representation in the basal ganglia and cerebellum. For example, in the Introduction, you write, &quot;These results indicate that neurons outside of the cerebellum must keep track of elapsed time to make temporally accurate movements in trials with suprasecond delay intervals&quot;, and then go on to make the argument that for turning to the striatum. This is reasonable, but note you are going from DCN observations to the conclusion that the tracking of elapsed time must be from &quot;neurons outside of the cerebellum.&quot; This ignores the possibility that the tracking might be done in the cerebellar cortex with the projection from the cerebellar cortex to DCN introducing some sort of non-linearity/thresholding function that obscures more of a ramping-like function.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Different contributions of preparatory activity in the basal ganglia and cerebellum for self-timing&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Nao Uchida as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Rich Ivry as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is one final issue that we would like to see addressed before making a final decision. Specifically, the reviewers thought that the data do not provide strong support for the broad claim that 'the cerebellum might be primarily responsible for the stochastic variation of self-timing'. We ask that you qualify this claim/inference in the manuscript.</p><p>I'm passing along the comments from reviewer 3 on this issue to help guide you in this endeavor.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The paper has been improved. However, I am still skeptical of the claim that the cerebellum is more responsible for stochastic variation in self-timing than the striatum. The authors have tried to address this issue, but the data/arguments are not convincing. For example, in the Discussion section, the authors suggest that the cerebellum adds or maintains variation of saccade timing – but only for short estimated intervals. For longer intervals, the authors state &quot;there was no need for the animals to maintain the variation of saccade timing within several hundreds of milliseconds&quot;. This begs the question of why there is there a &quot;need&quot; at all to maintain variation in timing. Perhaps inherent variation allows us to explore different intervals in a world with constantly changing temporal contingencies - but if so, why would we relax that exploratory bent for supra-second intervals?</p><p>Stepping back, there were two observations behind the claim that the cerebellum is responsible for stochastic variation. First, for the medium and long intervals, if trials are grouped according to precise movement time, the neuronal responses in the Cb appear to diverge a few hundred ms earlier than those of the striatum (Figure 5). This earlier divergence is based (per force) on a statistical criterion – when significant differences first arise based on the results of repeated-measures ANOVA. This is not a fair comparison between caudate and Cb. Average firing rates in caudate are far lower than in Cb dentate firing (Figure 3C-D). Moreover, I'm not sure about dentate nucleus firing statistics, but firing patterns in the Cb can be highly regular (e.g., Purkinje cells), which would reduce variance in spike counts for a given mean firing rate. For both these reasons, it might just be easier to DETECT the ANOVA-based divergence point for the cerebellar neurons than the caudate neurons, whereas we don't know how the brain actually pools signals from these two areas. I'm not exactly sure how to address this problem, but the authors could try to repeat their analysis with a subset of data matched for mean firing rates from the two areas (if possible). It would also be helpful to at least examine the coefficient of variation of firing rates between the two areas.</p><p>Second, the authors conclude the description of the inactivation experiment (end of Results section) with the statement that stochastic variation &quot;might be controlled by signals in the cerebellum, but not in the striatum&quot; - but this does not seem warranted from the inactivation experiment. The clearest result is that inactivation of Cb affected mean movement time most for short intervals while striatum affected mean movement time most for medium and long times. With respect to *variation* in latency, the effects of Cb inactivation were inconsistent at best. In addition, the largest change in movement-time variation with Cb inactivation was for short intervals, but this also caused the largest shift in mean movement latency of any area/interval/experiment, which might be expected to automatically increase the variation in latency (e.g., as per scalar expectancy theory of interval timing). But more generally, what is the hypothesized effect of inactivation on latency variation? Do the authors posit that the cerebellum controls precision, and thus that Cb inactivation would erode that precision? Is that interpretation not at odds with the results in Figure 5? Or do the authors hypothesize that the Cb adds noise to the timing process, in which case Cb inactivation might reduce variation?</p><p>In the end, the clearest result in the paper is the differential roles for the caudate and Cb for long and short intervals, respectively, supported by both electrophysiological recording and inactivation experiments. This alone is a nice contribution. The stochastic variation claims are not strongly supported (either empirically or theoretically). Of course, the authors could present the &quot;divergence&quot; argument in Figure 5, but in a more conservative manner, pointing out the difficulty in statistically distinguishing divergence points between neuronal populations with different firing rates and potentially different firing statistics. But I don't think that the cerebellar stochastic variation claims should be featured prominently in the paper (for example, the abstract should not conclude with that claim).</p><p>We also ask that you double check the new supplement 1 to Figure 3 (saccade-aligned responses). The SD of cue times seems narrow given the wide distributions of movement times in Figure 1B. Please verify that the figure is correct.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35676.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The analyses of ramping activity were performed by aligning trials to cue onset.

Most neurons in the motor system show activity preceding movement; these responses can be highly stereotyped relative to movement onset.

In the revised manuscript, we have added the data for the analysis of ramping activity with saccade alignment (Figure 4C). We also present the population data aligned with saccade initiation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). The results were in good agreement with the original data aligned with the cue onset. The times of ramp onset greatly differed for different interval timing in the striatum but were comparable in the cerebellum (Figure 4C). The degree of changes in ramp slope for different intervals was greater in the striatum than the cerebellum (Figure 4D), although the slope differed for different intervals in both structures. We have modified the text in the Results section accordingly. Also, we have corrected the unit on the ordinate of Figure 4B right panel (from spikes/s/s to unit/s), because the quantification was made for the normalized activity as shown in Figure 4A.</p><p>As the reviewer pointed out, the preparatory activity in the cerebellum appears to be more stereotyped than that in the striatum. This was further elucidated as we quantified the inter-neuronal variation in response to the comment #4 below (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). However, we do not think that the cerebellum simply triggers movements following motor decisions, because the ramping activity was found before self-timed saccades only and started well before the movements (~500 ms) while the triggering of saccades occurred within ~180 ms in the standard memory-guided saccade task. Taken together with the results of inactivation and our previous stimulation study performed in other animals (Ohmae et al., 2017), we have added a paragraph to thoroughly discuss this important point (subsection “Roles of the basal ganglia and cerebellum in self-timing”, &quot;In addition to the increased variation of self-timing, cerebellar inactivation also prolonged saccade latency in the standard memory-guided saccade task and the visually-guided saccade task (Figure 7D). […] Taken together, these results suggest that the signals in the cerebellar dentate nucleus may regulate timing of decisions for self-initiated movements. This function might gain importance in the situation where the precision of self-timing need to be preserved. Future studies may require consideration on these possibilities.&quot;).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Interpretation and General conclusion: The general conclusion regarding the role of the cerebellum hardly reaches beyond the results and thus is relatively uninformative.

Although the results of inactivation experiments clearly show that the signals in the cerebellar dentate nucleus controls the accuracy and precision of self-timing, it is difficult to interpret the results in terms of behavioral benefit in our experimental paradigm, at least for the long delay condition. We have inserted some lines in the Discussion section to mention this point, &quot;This could be because the cerebellum may have a potential to adjust timing only in the range of several hundreds of milliseconds, and because the inactivation effects of the cerebellum might be masked by the greater variation of duration estimation for supra- than sub-second intervals. In other words, while our results suggest that the stochastic variation of self-timing may primarily reflect neuronal signals in the cerebellum, the cerebellum might not be fully engaged in current behavioral condition.

The last question is far beyond the scope of the present study, and we are unable to exclude these possibilities unless thoroughly recording from both structures. We have added a paragraph to the Discussion section to mention this (&quot;As a limitation of the present study, it should be noted that the other parts of the striatum and the deep cerebellar nuclei might represent sub- and supra-second intervals, respectively. Indeed, functional imaging studies often detect multiple loci in respective subcortical structures relevant to temporal information processing (e.g., Rao et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2006). However, the functional preference for short and long intervals for the cerebellum and the basal ganglia are also supported by many functional imaging and case studies (Lewis and Miall, 2003; Ivry and Spencer, 2004; Buhusi and Meck, 2005; Allman et al., 2014).&quot;).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A related question is whether the authors discriminated between the identifiable neuronal subtypes in the striatum?

For example, in the Introduction, you write, &quot;These results indicate that neurons outside of the cerebellum must keep track of elapsed time to make temporally accurate movements in trials with suprasecond delay intervals&quot;, and then go on to make the argument that for turning to the striatum. This is reasonable, but note you are going from DCN observations to the conclusion that the tracking of elapsed time must be from &quot;neurons outside of the cerebellum.&quot; This ignores the possibility that the tracking might be done in the cerebellar cortex with the projection from the cerebellar cortex to DCN introducing some sort of non-linearity/thresholding function that obscures more of a ramping-like function.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer pointed out, the previous studies of eye blink conditioning clearly show that the cerebellar cortex is necessary for learning of stimulus timing while the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) only are sufficient for the expression of conditioned response. Furthermore, it appears to be reasonable that the local circuits within the cortex play a major computational role in the cerebellum. However, because the DCN (and the vestibular nuclei) serve as only output node of the cerebellum, any results of computation in the cerebellum must be transmitted through the DCN to the other brain regions. We therefore recorded from the dentate nucleus to explore the neuronal representation of timing in the cerebellum. To clarify this, we have added a few sentences to the revised Introduction (&quot;Although the previous studies of eye blink conditioning suggest that plasticity in the cerebellar cortex rather than the deep cerebellar nuclei plays a role in the learning of motor timing (Garcia and Mauk, 1998; Perrett et al., 1993; Raymond et al., 1998), neurons in the nuclei encode timing signals originated in the cerebellar cortex (Ten Brinke et al., 2017). Therefore, we explored signals in the dentate nucleus in this study because any significant computation in the lateral cerebellum must modify neuronal activity in the nucleus that may eventually regulate movement timing.&quot;).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is one final issue that we would like to see addressed before making a final decision. Specifically, the reviewers thought that the data do not provide strong support for the broad claim that 'the cerebellum might be primarily responsible for the stochastic variation of self-timing'. We ask that you qualify this claim/inference in the manuscript.</p><p>I'm passing along the comments from reviewer 3 on this issue to help guide you in this endeavor.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The paper has been improved. However, I am still skeptical of the claim that the cerebellum is more responsible for stochastic variation in self-timing than the striatum. The authors have tried to address this issue, but the data/arguments are not convincing. For example, in the Discussion section, the authors suggest that the cerebellum adds or maintains variation of saccade timing – but only for short estimated intervals. For longer intervals, the authors state &quot;there was no need for the animals to maintain the variation of saccade timing within several hundreds of milliseconds&quot;. This begs the question of why there is there a &quot;need&quot; at all to maintain variation in timing. Perhaps inherent variation allows us to explore different intervals in a world with constantly changing temporal contingencies – but if so, why would we relax that exploratory bent for supra-second intervals?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer in that there was no need for the animals to maintain variation of saccade timing in our behavioral paradigm. We have removed the relevant sentences from the text in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Stepping back, there were two observations behind the claim that the cerebellum is responsible for stochastic variation. First, for the medium and long intervals, if trials are grouped according to precise movement time, the neuronal responses in the Cb appear to diverge a few hundred ms earlier than those of the striatum (Figure 5). This earlier divergence is based (per force) on a statistical criterion – when significant differences first arise based on the results of repeated-measures ANOVA. This is not a fair comparison between caudate and Cb. Average firing rates in caudate are far lower than in Cb dentate firing (Figure 3C-D). Moreover, I'm not sure about dentate nucleus firing statistics, but firing patterns in the Cb can be highly regular (e.g., Purkinje cells), which would reduce variance in spike counts for a given mean firing rate. For both these reasons, it might just be easier to DETECT the ANOVA-based divergence point for the cerebellar neurons than the caudate neurons, whereas we don't know how the brain actually pools signals from these two areas. I'm not exactly sure how to address this problem, but the authors could try to repeat their analysis with a subset of data matched for mean firing rates from the two areas (if possible). It would also be helpful to at least examine the coefficient of variation of firing rates between the two areas.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment, we now report the coefficient of variation of baseline firing rates for the two areas (subsection “Neuronal correlates of trial-by-trial variation in self-timing”). As the reviewer pointed out, the baseline firing was more regular and the magnitude of preparatory activity was much greater in the cerebellum than the caudate nucleus. It is worth noting that the analyses in Figure 5 were based on the normalized activity for individual neurons, and that the repeated measures ANOVAs were performed on the spike density profiles derived from three latency groups. This procedure was optimal to detect the earliest diverging point of mean firing rate across groups, while the variation of baseline activity in each trial did not greatly confound the present results. We have added some lines to clarify this point (subsection “Neuronal correlates of trial-by-trial variation in self-timing”). In addition, we now also report that the SDs of normalized baseline activity for the spike density profiles used for the analysis were not different between the recording sites in Figure 5 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the authors conclude the description of the inactivation experiment (end of Results) with the statement that stochastic variation &quot;might be controlled by signals in the cerebellum, but not in the striatum&quot; – but this does not seem warranted from the inactivation experiment. The clearest result is that inactivation of Cb affected mean movement time most for short intervals while striatum affected mean movement time most for medium and long times. With respect to *variation* in latency, the effects of Cb inactivation were inconsistent at best. In addition, the largest change in movement-time variation with Cb inactivation was for short intervals, but this also caused the largest shift in mean movement latency of any area/interval/experiment, which might be expected to automatically increase the variation in latency (e.g., as per scalar expectancy theory of interval timing). But more generally, what is the hypothesized effect of inactivation on latency variation? Do the authors posit that the cerebellum controls precision, and thus that Cb inactivation would erode that precision? Is that interpretation not at odds with the results in Figure 5? Or do the authors hypothesize that the Cb adds noise to the timing process, in which case Cb inactivation might reduce variation?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. In the revised manuscript, we have removed the claim that the cerebellum may control the stochastic variation. Instead, we now mention that the stochastic variation started earlier in the Cb than the striatum, and that the Cb might play a role in the fine adjustment of timing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the end, the clearest result in the paper is the differential roles for the caudate and Cb for long and short intervals, respectively, supported by both electrophysiological recording and inactivation experiments. This alone is a nice contribution. The stochastic variation claims are not strongly supported (either empirically or theoretically). Of course, the authors could present the &quot;divergence&quot; argument in Figure 5, but in a more conservative manner, pointing out the difficulty in statistically distinguishing divergence points between neuronal populations with different firing rates and potentially different firing statistics. But I don't think that the cerebellar stochastic variation claims should be featured prominently in the paper (for example, the abstract should not conclude with that claim).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these positive comments. In the revised manuscript, we only report the fact that the stochastic variation started earlier in the cerebellum but have eliminated the argument about its role. Accordingly, we have also modified the Abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We also ask that you double check the new supplement 1 to Figure 3 (saccade-aligned responses). The SD of cue times seems narrow given the wide distributions of movement times in Figure 1B. Please verify that the figure is correct.</p></disp-quote><p>We have verified that they are correct. In both Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1, the error bar indicates the inter-experimental variability and plots the SD of means for individual recording sessions. We now clarify this point in figure legends.</p></body></sub-article></article>
