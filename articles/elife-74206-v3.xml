during stress — a process known as phase transition. Here, we show that a phase transition of the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain protein (TIR-1), an NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase homologous to mammalian sterile alpha and TIR motif-containing 1 (SARM1), underlies p38 PMK-1 immune pathway activation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal epithelial cells. Through visualization of fluorescently labeled TIR-1/SARM1 protein, we demonstrate that physiologic stresses, both pathogen and non-pathogen, induce multimerization of TIR-1/SARM1 into visible puncta within intestinal epithelial cells. In vitro enzyme kinetic analyses revealed that, like mammalian SARM1, the NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase activity of <italic>C. elegans</italic> TIR-1 is dramatically potentiated by protein oligomerization and a phase transition. Accordingly, <italic>C. elegans</italic> with genetic mutations that specifically block either multimerization or the NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase activity of TIR-1/SARM1 fail to induce p38 PMK phosphorylation, are unable to increase immune effector expression, and are dramatically susceptible to bacterial infection. Finally, we demonstrate that a loss-of-function mutation in <italic>nhr-8</italic>, which alters cholesterol metabolism and is used to study conditions of sterol deficiency, causes TIR-1/SARM1 to oligomerize into puncta in intestinal epithelial cells. Cholesterol scarcity increases p38 PMK-1 phosphorylation, primes immune effector induction in a manner that requires TIR-1/SARM1 oligomerization and its intrinsic NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase activity, and reduces pathogen accumulation in the intestine during a subsequent infection. These data reveal a new adaptive response that allows a metazoan host to anticipate pathogen threats during cholesterol deprivation, a time of relative susceptibility to infection. Thus, a phase transition of TIR-1/SARM1 as a prerequisite for its NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase activity is strongly conserved across millions of years of evolution and is essential for diverse physiological processes in multiple cell types.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>From worms to humans, animals have developed various strategies – including immune defences – to shield themselves from disease-causing microbes. A type of roundworm, called <italic>C. elegans</italic>, lives in environments rich in microbes, so it needs effective immune defences to protect itself. The roundworms share a key regulatory pathway with mammals that helps to control their immune responses. This so-called p38 pathway relies on proteins that interact with each other to activate protective immune defences.</p><p>Proteins contain different regions or domains that can give them a certain function. For example, proteins with a region called TIR play important roles in immune defences in both animals and plants. One such protein, called SARM1, is unique among animal and plant proteins in that it is an enzyme, which cleaves an important metabolite in the cell. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the SARM1 homolog, TIR-1, controls the p38 pathway during infection, but how TIR-1 activates it is unclear.</p><p>To find out more, Peterson, Icso et al. modified <italic>C. elegans</italic> to generate a fluorescent form of TIR-1 and infected the worms with bacteria. Imaging techniques revealed that infection caused TIR-1 in gut cells to cluster into organized structures, which increases the enzymatic activity of the protein to activate the p38 immune pathway. Moreover, stress situations, such as cholesterol nutrient withdrawal, activated the p38 pathway in the same way. This adaptive stress response allows the animal to defend itself against pathogen threats during times, when they are most susceptible to infections.</p><p>Cells in the gut provide a primary line of defence against infectious bacteria and are important for maintaining a healthy gut immune system. When the mechanisms for pathogen sensing and immune maintenance are disrupted, it can lead to inflammation and higher risk of infection. Peterson, Icso et al. show how a key regulator of gut immunity, TIR-1, provides protection in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which may suggest that SARM1 could have a similar role in mammals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>p38 pathway</kwd><kwd>TIR-1/SARM1</kwd><kwd>phase transition</kwd><kwd>intestinal epithelial

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a key regulator of stress responses and innate immune defenses in metazoans. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> p38 homolog PMK-1 is part of a classic MAPK signaling cascade that is activated by the MAPKKK NSY-1 and MAPKK SEK-1, which are the nematode homologs of mammalian ASK and MKK3/6, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2002</xref>). As in mammals, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> p38 PMK-1 pathway regulates the expression of secreted innate immune effectors and is required for survival during pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Troemel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Peterson and Pukkila-Worley, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pukkila-Worley and Ausubel, 2012</xref>). However, the mechanisms that activate the NSY-1/SEK-1/p38 PMK-1 signaling cassette in <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal epithelial cells are poorly defined.</p><p>Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing proteins serve essential functions in both animal and plant immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ve et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">O’Neill and Bowie, 2007</xref>). In mammals, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and downstream adaptor proteins contain TIR domains, which transduce intracellular signals upon pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gay et al., 2014</xref>). Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins in plants also contain TIR domains, which activate host defenses following recognition of pathogen-derived effector proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lolle et al., 2020</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, TIR-1, the homolog of mammalian sterile alpha and TIR motif-containing 1 (SARM1), acts upstream of NSY-1/ASK to control p38 PMK-1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liberati et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Couillault et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, TIR-1/SARM1 is unique among animal and plant TIR domain-containing proteins in that it is an enzyme, which cleaves nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wan et al., 2019</xref>). The NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase activity of TIR is activated upon oligomerization into a multimeric protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Horsefield et al., 2019</xref>). NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion in this manner promotes cell death in plants during pathogen infection and triggers axonal degeneration following neuronal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gerdts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gerdts et al., 2013</xref>). However, it is not known whether the NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase activity of TIR is also required for immune function in metazoans.</p><p>Intracellular signaling regulators can be compartmentalized into membrane-less, higher-ordered protein assemblies with liquid droplet-like properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Du and Chen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boeynaems et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti and Dormann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Verdile et al., 2019</xref>). Cytoplasmic de-mixing or phase transition of proteins in this manner concentrates signaling regulators to facilitate rapid and specific activation of protective defenses during stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Du and Chen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, human SARM1 oligomerizes and undergoes a phase transition, which enhances its intrinsic NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Loring et al., 2021</xref>). Induced multimerization of <italic>C. elegans</italic> TIR-1/SARM1 in neurons also correlated with enhanced axonal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Loring et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we show that a phase transition and NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase activity of TIR-1/SARM1 is required for p38 PMK-1 immune pathway activation and pathogen resistance in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We labeled the TIR-1/SARM1 protein with a fluorescent tag at its genomic locus and demonstrated that TIR-1/SARM1 forms visible puncta within the intestine in response to physiologic stimuli, including both pathogen infection and cholesterol deficiency. By promoting multimerization of TIR-1/SARM1 with macromolecular crowding agents in vitro, we demonstrate that a phase transition is required for the catalytic activity of TIR-1/SARM1. Accordingly, TIR-1/SARM1 containing mutations that either specifically prevent the phase transition or impair NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolysis shows decreased enzymatic activity in vitro. <italic>C. elegans</italic> carrying these same mutations, edited into the genome using CRISPR/Cas9, fail to induce p38 PMK phosphorylation, are unable to upregulate immune effector expression, and have enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infection.</p><p>We also report that a loss-of-function mutation in <italic>nhr-8</italic>, which alters cholesterol metabolism and is used to study conditions of sterol deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Magner et al., 2013</xref>), induces TIR-1/SARM1 oligomerization and p38 PMK-1 pathway activation. <italic>C. elegans</italic> lacks the ability to synthesize cholesterol de novo and must acquire dietary sterols from the environment to support multiple aspects of cellular physiology, including development, fecundity, lifespan, and resistance against pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hieb and Rothstein, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chitwood, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Merris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yochem et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Otarigho and Aballay, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheong et al., 2011</xref>). Some, but not all, <italic>C. elegans</italic> larvae that encounter sterol-scarce environments enter an alternative developmental program, called dauer diapause, to promote animal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burnell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vanfleteren and De Vreese, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gerisch et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gerisch and Antebi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Motola et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> larvae that do not enter dauer diapause in an environment devoid of dietary sterols adapt by promoting oligomerization of TIR-1/SARM1 in vivo to activate the p38 PMK-1 innate immune pathway through its intrinsic NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase activity. Priming p38 pathway activation in this manner augments immune effector expression during a subsequent bacterial infection and reduces pathogen accumulation in the intestine. Thus, we propose that activation of the p38 PMK-1 pathway during conditions of low cholesterol availability is an adaptive response to preempt pathogen attack during a time of relative vulnerability to infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Multimerization of TIR-1/SARM1 and its intrinsic NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase activity are required for activation of the p38 PMK-1 innate immune pathway during pathogen infection</title><p>To determine if <italic>C. elegans</italic> TIR-1/SARM1 multimerizes to activate the p38 PMK-1 innate immune pathway, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to insert the fluorescent protein wrmScarlet at the C-terminus of the endogenous <italic>C. elegans tir-1</italic> locus, which labeled all <italic>tir-1</italic> isoforms.

Therefore, we assessed the effect of several macro- and microviscogens on TIR activity. Macroviscogens reduce the free volume available for protein movement and thus promote aggregation of protein complexes that are capable of self-association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gadda and Sobrado, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blacklow et al., 1988</xref>). Importantly, macroviscogens have minimal impact on the rate of diffusion of small molecules. By contrast, microviscogens, which are much smaller than most enzymes, affect the diffusion of substrates in solution and, thus, the frequency at which enzymes encounter their substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blacklow et al., 1988</xref>). Interestingly, macroviscogens (polyethylene glycol [PEG] 3350 and PEG 8000), but not microviscogens (sucrose or glycerol), dramatically increased the NADase activity of TIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Specifically, PEGs 3350 and 8000 increase TIR activity in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Crowding agents also increase the activity of the TIR domain of human SARM1, as well as plant TIR domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Horsefield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Loring et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that the mechanism of TIR regulation is strongly conserved.</p><p>Treatment with 25% PEG 3350 led to a roughly linear association between TIR concentration and NADase activity and markedly enhanced TIR activity at each enzyme concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Using these conditions, we determined the steady-state kinetic parameters (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>, <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>, and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>) with 2.5 μM TIR in the presence of increasing concentrations of PEG 3350 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of TIR increases and then decreases to level off at ~500 μM of ε-NAD with increasing concentration of PEG 3350 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> increases nearly linearly with increasing concentrations of PEG 3350 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In addition, the catalytic efficiency (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) followed the same trend as <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>, indicating that increased TIR activity is due to increased substrate turnover by the enzyme and not tighter substrate binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p>We found that the NAD hydrolase activity of TIR is also activated by the precipitant sodium citrate, providing an orthologous method to characterize the enzymatic activity of the TIR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Notably, the response to increasing citrate concentration was switch-like, where a concentration of at least 250 mM sodium citrate was needed to observe enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). By contrast, activation with PEG 3350 was more dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Nevertheless, the kinetic parameters obtained in the presence of citrate displayed similar trends to those found with PEG 3350: <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> decreased to level off at ~400 µM of ε-NAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> increases with increasing sodium citrate concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> follows the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>In the cytoplasm, high concentrations of macromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates) cause molecular crowding and induce phase transitions of signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rivas and Minton, 2016</xref>). To determine if TIR undergoes a phase transition and whether its NADase activity correlates with the transition, we incubated purified TIR with different concentrations of PEG3350 or citrate, centrifuged the sample, and evaluated TIR NADase activity in the soluble and insoluble fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). At low concentrations of both PEG and citrate, TIR protein was present in the supernatant. However, at high concentrations of both PEG and citrate, TIR was principally located in the pelleted (insoluble) fraction, as visualized by Coomassie staining on an SDS-PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Importantly, robust NADase activity was observed in the pelleted fraction and not in the supernatant of samples treated with high concentrations of PEG or citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that precipitation/aggregation of TIR is required to activate the intrinsic NADase activity of TIR-1/SARM1.</p><p>To determine whether TIR-1 multimerization is also required for a phase transition and the NADase activity of TIR, we recombinantly expressed and purified the TIR domain of TIR-1, which contained mutations in residues required for oligomerization (TIR<sup>G747P</sup> and TIR<sup>H833A</sup>) and NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolysis (TIR<sup>E788A</sup> and TIR<sup>E788Q</sup>). Notably, TIR<sup>G747P</sup> and TIR<sup>E788Q</sup> mutants showed no apparent activity, and TIR<sup>E788A</sup> and TIR<sup>H833A</sup> showed a &gt; 1 × 10<sup>8</sup>­fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) compared to TIR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Similarly, kinetic analysis of TIR oligomerization and catalytic mutants in 500 mM citrate revealed that all the mutants were catalytically dead, each showing no apparent activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>To further characterize the TIR phase transition, we evaluated the precipitation capacity of TIR oligomerization and catalytic mutants in the presence of PEG 3350 and citrate. Consistent with our genetic data, TIR<sup>G747P</sup>, which contains a mutation that prevents oligomerization of TIR, was unable to precipitate as readily as TIR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Compared to TIR<sup>WT</sup>, the TIR<sup>G747P</sup> mutant in the presence of PEG 3350 demonstrated a 25% decrease in the amount of precipitated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). We observed similar results in the presence of citrate – compared to TIR<sup>WT</sup>, the TIR<sup>G747P</sup> mutant demonstrated a 22% decrease in precipitated protein compared to TIR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Importantly, TIR proteins with two different mutations in the glutamate required for NAD<sup>+</sup> catalysis, TIR<sup>E788A</sup> and TIR<sup>E788Q</sup>, precipitated to a similar extent as TIR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and K</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I and J</xref>) but had minimal NADase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that a phase transition of TIR-1 is required for its NADase activity.</p><p>During phase separations, macromolecules partition into distinct biochemical compartments characterized by a higher concentration dense phase and a lower concentration dilute phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boeynaems et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti and Dormann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Verdile et al., 2019</xref>). The dense compartment can have either liquid-like properties in liquid-to-liquid phase separations or solid-like properties in liquid-to-solid phase transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti and Dormann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Peskett et al., 2018</xref>). To determine whether TIR undergoes a liquid-to-liquid or a liquid-to-solid phase transition, we assayed the enzyme activity of TIR in the presence of 1,6-hexanediol, an aliphatic alcohol that interferes with hydrophobic interactions prominent in liquid-to-liquid separations. Thus, 1,6-hexanediol disrupts liquid-like compartments, but not solid-like compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boeynaems et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Verdile et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>). In the presence of either PEG 3350 or citrate, we observed that 1,6-hexanediol decreases the NADase activity of TIR by &lt;2 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). While significant, this modest decrease (the activity of 1,6-hexanediol-treated TIR remains two orders of magnitude higher than the activity of TIR without PEG 3350 or citrate addition) suggests that the NADase activity of TIR is predominantly associated with a solid, rather than a liquid, state or lies on a continuum between a liquid-like and solid-like state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Notably, in the absence of PEG 3350 or citrate, the low-level TIR NADase activity can be inhibited by 1,6-hexanediol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>), suggesting that this activity is driven by hydrophobic interactions. Importantly, 1,6-hexanediol does not interfere with TIR precipitation in the presence of PEG or citrate, regardless of whether it is added before or after precipitate formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we determined if this liquid-to-solid phase transition of TIR is reversible. The insoluble fraction following treatment of TIR with PEG 3350 or citrate was resuspended in either buffer alone or buffer plus the respective additive (PEG 3350 or citrate). If the phase transition is reversible, resuspension of precipitated TIR in buffer alone should disrupt enzymatic activity. However, if the phase transition is irreversible, activity should be detected when the pellet is resuspended in buffer alone. Notably, we observed some TIR enzymatic activity when the pellet was resuspended in buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). With PEG 3350, the activity was lower than that observed in the precentrifugation control or when the pellet was resuspended in buffer with PEG 3350. By contrast, with citrate, the activity was similar to both control conditions (precentrifugation or when the pellet was resuspended in buffer and citrate). These data indicate that the phase transition of TIR is partially reversible in PEG 3350 and irreversible in sodium citrate. To confirm these findings, we centrifuged the resuspended samples to examine the fractions visually by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In the sample initially prepared with PEG 3350 and resuspended in buffer alone, a faint band was present in the supernatant fraction. However, this band was absent in the sample initially prepared with sodium citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These data confirm that the TIR phase transition is partially reversible in PEG 3350 and irreversible in sodium citrate, at least under these conditions.</p><p>Next, we evaluated the effect of pH on TIR precipitation and NADase activity. There was virtually no increase in TIR precipitation in the absence of PEG. However, in the presence of 25% PEG, TIR precipitation increased with increasing pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Under these same conditions, no activity was apparent below pH 6, <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>), and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> increased from pH 6.5 to pH 8.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>). A corresponding increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> was responsible for the increase in catalytic efficiency above pH 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Notably, the increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> correlated with precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D and G</xref>), again indicating that a phase transition increases TIR activity.</p><p>We performed negative stain electron microscopy to directly visualize TIR aggregation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>). Protein visualization is not possible with PEG because macroviscogens themselves are stained, confounding image analysis. Therefore, we performed this experiment with citrate. In the absence of citrate, we observed borderline fibrillar structures and protein aggregates, but overall, there were no consistent structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>). However, in the presence of citrate, circular particles emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>).

In summary, cholesterol-starved, wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> and two different <italic>nhr-8</italic> loss-of-function mutants induce the transcription of innate immune defenses.</p><p>Two different supplementation experiments using the T24B8.5p::<italic>gfp</italic> immune reporter demonstrated that immune effector activation in <italic>nhr-8(hd117</italic>) mutants is due to sterol deficiency in these animals. First, supplementation of exogenous cholesterol at an increased concentration (80 μg/mL) fully suppressed T24B8.5p::<italic>gfp</italic> activation in the <italic>nhr-8(hd117</italic>) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Second, supplementation with the non-ionic detergents Tergitol or Triton X-100, which solubilize hydrophobic, amphipathic compounds, including sterols, suppressed T24B8.5p::<italic>gfp</italic> activation in <italic>nhr-8(hd117</italic>) animals in a manner that was dependent on the presence of added cholesterol in the growth media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Nematode growth media solidified with agarose, rather than agar, contains markedly fewer contaminating sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Magner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chitwood, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gerisch et al., 2001</xref>). Importantly, on agarose, the addition of Tergitol to the growth media also suppressed T24B8.5p::<italic>gfp</italic> activation in the <italic>nhr-8(hd117</italic>) mutant, but only in the presence of 5 μg/mL of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Notably, this effect was dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These data establish that solubilization of cholesterol by Tergitol in standard nematode growth media suppresses immune activation in the <italic>nhr-8(hd117</italic>) mutant background. We used qRT-PCR to confirm these findings – Tergitol suppressed activation of T24B8.5, as well as the immune effectors <italic>irg-4</italic>, <italic>irg-5,</italic> and K08D8.4 in the <italic>nhr-8(hd117</italic>) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–L</xref>). Of note, activation of immune defenses in <italic>nhr-8(hd117</italic>) animals is specific to cholesterol deprivation in this genetic background, as supplementation with individual saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are also misregulated in the <italic>nhr-8(hd117</italic>) mutant background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Magner et al., 2013</xref>), failed to suppress activation of T24B8.5p::<italic>gfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Together, these data confirm that cholesterol deprivation activates immune effector transcription independent of bacterial infection.</p><p>It has been previously shown that wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> raised on media without supplemented cholesterol are hypersusceptible to killing by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, as are <italic>nhr-8(hd117</italic>) mutants on media with standard cholesterol supplementation (5 μg/mL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Otarigho and Aballay, 2020</xref>). Importantly, we found that high doses of cholesterol (80 μg/mL) rescued the enhanced susceptibility of <italic>nhr-8(hd117</italic>) mutants to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). We confirmed this finding using an orthologous approach. Two detergents (Tergitol or Triton X-100), which solubilize cholesterol in nematode growth media, also restored wild-type pathogen resistance to the <italic>nhr-8(hd117</italic>) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>), consistent with their ability to modulate the expression of innate immune effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–L</xref>). Importantly, we found that the <italic>nhr-8(hd117</italic>) mutant accumulated less <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in its intestine during infection than wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that low cholesterol in the <italic>nhr-8(hd117</italic>) mutants reduces tolerance to pathogen infection, and that the robust transcriptional induction of immune effectors in this mutant background leads to reduced accumulation of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> during infection.</p><p>Additional analyses of the transcriptome profiling data revealed that targets of the p38 PMK-1 innate immune pathway were strongly enriched among the genes induced in wild-type animals during cholesterol deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Accordingly, the levels of active, phosphorylated PMK-1 were higher in wild-type animals grown on media without supplemented cholesterol than in animals grown under standard culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Consistent with these data, the p38 PMK-1 pathway is also activated in <italic>nhr-8</italic> loss-of-function mutants. A gene set enrichment analysis of the <italic>nhr-8(hd117</italic>) and <italic>nhr-8(ok186</italic>) transcriptome profiling experiments revealed strong enrichment of p38 PMK-1 pathway targets among the genes upregulated in each <italic>nhr-8</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, the <italic>nhr-8(hd117</italic>) and <italic>nhr-8(ok186</italic>) mutants had an increased ratio of phosphorylated PMK-1 relative to total PMK-1 compared to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>tir-1</italic>, the most upstream component of the p38 signaling cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liberati et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Couillault et al., 2004</xref>), fully suppressed hyperactivation of T24B8.5p::<italic>gfp</italic> in <italic>nhr-8(hd117</italic>) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

To perform this analysis in an unbiased manner, we scaled the expression level in each condition for each of these 184 genes by calculating a row z-score and performed hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). We observed that these 184 genes group into two clusters: Cluster I had 139 genes and Cluster II contained 45 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Cluster I was comprised mostly of genes whose expression in the absence of infection was higher in <italic>nhr-8(hd117)</italic> mutants than wild-type animals (129 of 139 genes). In addition, the majority of Cluster I genes were more strongly induced during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection in <italic>nhr-8(hd117)</italic> animals than wild-type animals. Cluster II, on the other hand, contained genes whose induction on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> were dependent on <italic>nhr-8</italic>. Importantly, p38 PMK-1-dependent genes were strongly enriched among Cluster I, but not Cluster II, genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Thirty-three of the 139 genes in Cluster I are known targets of the p38 PMK-1 immune pathway (24.17-fold enriched, hypergeometric <italic>P</italic>-value = 7.68 x 10<sup>–37</sup>), a group that includes the immune effectors T24B8.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), <italic>irg-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), <italic>irg-5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), and K08D8.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>).

Subsequent challenge by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> further drives immune activation in a manner that leads to reduced pathogen accumulation in the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we report two conceptual advances. First, we show that a phase transition of <italic>C. elegans</italic> TIR-1, an NADase homologous to mammalian SARM1, underlies p38 PMK-1 immune pathway activation in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). Importantly, we demonstrate that physiologic stresses, both pathogen and non-pathogen, induce multimerization of TIR-1/SARM1 into visible puncta within intestinal epithelial cells. In vitro biochemical studies of purified protein and <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetic analyses revealed that multimerization and a phase transition of TIR-1/SARM1 engages its NADase activity to activate the p38 PMK-1 innate immune pathway and provide protection during bacterial infection.</p><p>Second, we show that cholesterol deficiency, as recapitulated in an <italic>nhr-8</italic> loss-of-function mutant, causes TIR-1/SARM1 to oligomerize into puncta in intestinal epithelial cells and activate the p38 PMK-1 immune pathway through its intrinsic NADase activity. <italic>C. elegans</italic> lacks the ability to synthesize cholesterol de novo and must acquire dietary sterols to support multiple aspects of organismal physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hieb and Rothstein, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chitwood, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Merris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yochem et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Otarigho and Aballay, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheong et al., 2011</xref>). We found that priming of innate immune defenses during conditions of low cholesterol availability augments immune effector induction and leads to decreased accumulation of pathogen in the intestine during a subsequent bacterial infection. We therefore propose that immune activation in this manner represents a new adaptive response that allows a metazoan host to anticipate environmental threats during cholesterol deprivation, a time of relative susceptibility to infection.</p><p>Loring et al. demonstrated that human SARM1 aggregates and undergoes a phase transition to potentiate its intrinsic NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Loring et al., 2021</xref>). These authors studied SARM1 in the context of neuronal degeneration as it was previously demonstrated that loss of mammalian SARM1 protects against axonal degeneration following neuronal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marion et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Henninger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Geisler et al., 2016</xref>). Treatment with non-physiologic concentrations of citrate, a molecule that induces protein precipitation, led to puncta formation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> TIR-1 in neurons, which was correlated with enhanced axonal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Loring et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, previous studies showed that human SARM1 forms oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bratkowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>) and that dimerization, at least, is required for TIR domain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gerdts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Summers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the demonstration here that <italic>C. elegans</italic> TIR-1/SARM1 aggregates in vivo in response to physiological stresses provides an important characterization of the mechanism inferred by Loring et al. and suggests that oligomerization favors the phase transition of TIR-1/SARM1 such that higher order structures are formed. Of note, the enzyme kinetics of TIR-1 are strikingly similar to mammalian SARM1 – the activity of both proteins is exquisitely dependent on precipitation. Thus, together, these studies demonstrate that a phase transition of TIR-1/SARM1 as a prerequisite for its NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase activity is conserved across millions of years of evolution, occurs in multiple cell types, and is essential for diverse physiological processes, including intestinal immune regulation and axonal degeneration.</p><p>Currently, it is unknown how low cholesterol leads to the oligomerization and phase transition of <italic>C. elegans</italic> TIR-1/SARM1 and further studies are needed to characterize this mechanism. Cholesterol could be sensed to trigger this response, or low cholesterol could change the biophysical properties of the cell in a manner that favors oligomerization of TIR-1.</p><p>We demonstrate that cholesterol supplementation can fully rescue the enhanced susceptibility to pathogen-mediated killing in <italic>nhr-8</italic> loss-of-function mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M and N</xref>). These data suggest that cholesterol is required for pathogen tolerance in <italic>C. elegans</italic>; however, the mechanism behind this observation is unknown. The p38 PMK-1 pathway provides protection during pathogen infection in the <italic>nhr-8</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>), suggesting that the enhanced susceptibility to pathogen-mediated killing in the <italic>nhr-8</italic> mutant is not secondary to aberrant activation of the p38 PMK-1 pathway. Cholesterol-deficient animals may therefore have general reductions in organismal fitness that cause vulnerability to pathogen infection and a reduction in lifespan.</p><p>The robust activation of the p38 PMK-1 pathway and the reduced pathogen burden in <italic>nhr-8</italic> mutants suggests that immune activation in this manner promotes pathogen resistance, which we propose is part of a mechanism to prime protective immune activation. It is also possible that activation of the p38 PMK-1 pathway during cholesterol deficiency could engage another protective host response that is unrelated to pathogen defense. We do not favor this hypothesis, however, considering the observed reduction in the pathogen burden of the <italic>nhr-8</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>).</p><p>We previously demonstrated that a <italic>C. elegans</italic> nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-86, a member of a family of ligand-gated transcription factors, surveys the chemical environment to activate the expression of immune effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peterson et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, NHR-86 targets immune effectors whose basal regulation requires the p38 PMK-1 immune pathway. However, NHR-86 functions independently of PMK-1 and modulates the transcription of these infection response genes directly. NHR-86 is a nematode homolog of the mammalian nuclear hormone receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), a family of NHRs that expanded dramatically in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (259 HNF4 homologs are encoded in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sluder et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sluder and Maina, 2001</xref>). One potentially unifying hypothesis is that HNF4 homologs detect pathogen- or host-derived ligands that are associated with infection and activate pathogen-specific immune defenses. In this model, the p38 PMK-1 pathway functions as a rheostat that receives inputs from signals associated with potentially dangerous environmental conditions to prime host immune effector genes. Indeed, inputs from chemosensory neurons, bacterial density, tissue damage, and nucleotide metabolism also regulate the tonic level of p38 PMK-1 pathway activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Couillault et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pujol et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tecle et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Foster et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson and Pukkila-Worley, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Styer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao and Aballay, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sun et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that p38 PMK-1 phosphorylation is adjusted to anticipate dangerous threats during periods of vulnerability. We hypothesize that mechanisms in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that detect specific pathogens can further augment immune effector induction.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

For all assays with high-cholesterol medium, NGM containing 0.4% ethanol and 5 μg/mL cholesterol were used as control plates. Cholesterol solubilization assays were performed by supplementing NGM containing 5 μg/mL cholesterol with either 0.1% Tergitol (Sigma-Aldrich) or 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). For assays using media solidified with agarose, NGM plates were prepared with 1.7% Ultrapure agarose (ThermoFisher Scientific) in place of agar.

The velocity of the reactions was calculated from the slope of the progress curve at each ε-NAD concentration and plotted in GraphPad Prism. Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting these velocities to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Eq. 1) for each mutant.</p><p>To evaluate the precipitation capacity of TIR mutants, 10 µM (WT, G747P, E788Q, and H833A) or 3 µM (WT, E788A) of the enzyme was mixed with Assay Buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0; 150 NaCl) with and without 25% PEG 3350 or 500 mM sodium citrate (final concentrations). Precipitation of the TIR<sup>E788A</sup> mutant was evaluated at 3 µM due to low yields of the protein; WT TIR at 3 µM was included as the proper control. The samples were incubated for 15 min at ambient temperature, at which point the samples were centrifuged at 21,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended buffer with the respective additive (final concentration). Samples were diluted 1:1 with water before running on an SDS-PAGE gel. Stain-free images of the gels were obtained on the BioRad Gel Doc EZ Gel Documentation System with Image Lab Software. Representative images are shown. ImageJ was used to quantify the bands, which were plotted in GraphPad Prism.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Differences in the survival of <italic>C. elegans</italic> in the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> pathogenesis assays were determined with the log-rank test after survival curves were estimated for each group with the Kaplan-Meier method.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Emily Troemel (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please add survival curves/cfu accumulation of a pmk-1;nhr-8 double mutant to the manuscript to validate the notion that the overactivation of the p38 MAPK pathway seen in the nhr-8 mutant is protective. If the double mutant is more sensitive than nhr-8, this would suggest that the p38 activation that is occurring is still protective, even if not up to wild type levels of survival. However, if the double mutant survives better than nhr-8, it suggests that the overactivation of p38 is having a detrimental effect.</p><p>2) Figure 1E: As T24B8.5p::gfp and T24B8.5 gene expression are used frequently as read-outs for p38 PMK-1 pathway activation in cholesterol deprivation assays, could the authors address why T24B8.5 is not shown as differentially expressed in the absence of cholesterol? Furthermore, why not use irg-4p::gfp (or another differentially expressed gene during cholesterol deprivation) as a reporter in main figures?</p><p>3) It is argued that knock-down of atf-7 abrogates T24B8.5::gfp activation in nhr-8 animals. However, the data in Figure 2G is not that convincing. The fluorescent phenotype appears in-between wild type and nhr-8. Can the fluorescent data be quantified or can another method be used such a qRT of the relevant genes in a nhr-8 animal with atf-7 RNAi?</p><p>4) The authors show that nhr-8 mutants have lowered <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> load compared to wild-type animals and call this 'clearance'. Line 443: &quot;promotes clearance of pathogenic bacteria from the intestine (Figure 1O)&quot; However, to demonstrate clearance, the authors need to show more than one timepoint, demonstrating a higher level of pathogen at an earlier timepoint, and a lower level at a later timepoint. Based on previous studies with this pathogen, it is more likely that there is simply lowered accumulation of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in nhr-8 mutants rather than active clearance. The authors either should modify their language, or do a time course to show clearance.</p><p>5) Analysis of transcriptional data: Please evaluate genes upregulated in nhr-8(ok186) and compare them to genes upregulated during infection and/or known to be associated with p38, establishing the significance of the intersection statistically.</p><p>6) Figure 5A: Would it be possible to test a solid-like compartment disrupting additive? To claim TIR undergoes a liquid-to-solid phase transition, it would be preferable to present a positive result (a solid-disrupting additive decreasing activity in support of the model) rather than the negative result that a disruption of liquid-like compartments does not sufficiently decrease NADase activity- especially as reduction in NADase activity due to liquid disruption is statistically significant.</p><p>7) The authors should better explain how the lowered <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> levels in nhr-8 mutants is an example of increased pathogen resistance, which together with the lowered survival of these mutants is an example of decreased tolerance of infection. This distinction is an important aspect of pathogen infection studies, i.e. the difference between pathogen resistance (controlling levels of the pathogen) and tolerance (controlling the health impacts from the pathogen). As it stands the text is confusing, e.g. Lines 183-184: &quot;Thus, even though nhr-8(hd117) mutant animals are more susceptible to pathogen killing, they are mounting effective anti-pathogen defenses toward an ingested pathogen&quot;.</p><p>8) Do the authors think that a lack of cholesterol is sensed by some unknown mechanism and leads to this response? Or do they favor a model in which the lack of cholesterol change the biophysical properties of the cell such that oligomerization of TIR-1 is favored? Some discussion on how the lack of cholesterol and pathogen exposure might stimulate TIR-1 oligomerization and signalling would be interesting.</p><p>9) The reviewers have questions regarding why lack of cholesterol is detrimental to survival under infection challenge, despite its effect on priming. They have suggested that additional care should be taken in discussing this result and its implication. Specific suggestions:</p><p>a. Could the authors comment on / show data on survival in the absence of infection (e.g. ageing?). Lack of cholesterol shortens nematode lifespan and has been reported to prevent benefits from caloric restriction and of some lifespan extending mutations (daf-2). What is the mechanism of such detriment? Does it make sense in the context of the proposed role in modulating innate immunity?</p><p>b. Furthermore, daf-2 mutation increases resistance to infection and this also requires p38. Given the suggested role of low cholesterol in priming nematodes for infection, how might this be reconciled? Does low cholesterol cause inappropriate / over activation of p38 which reduces survival during infection and also shortens lifespan under CR? If this is the case, how would the proposed priming be of benefit as it interferes with appropriate response to both types of challenges (lack of nutrients and infection??).</p><p>c. The authors claim that activation of p38 PMK-1 pathway in sterol-scarce environments is an &quot;adaptive response that allows a metazoan host to anticipate environmental threats during micronutrient deprivation&quot;. However, the data could support alternative explanations for the upregulation of PMK-1 during sterol scarcity. For example, is there some other benefit to upregulating the PMK-1 pathway (in absence of sterols) that isn't related to pathogen defense? Could PMK-1 upregulation be a consequence of some other disturbance rather than a preemptive response? What other cellular processes are perturbed during cholesterol deprivation and does PMK-1 play a role in regulating these processes? The authors should consider framing the concept of an &quot;adaptive response&quot; in a more speculative manner and also address alternative explanations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript: &quot;A TIR-1/SARM1 phase transition underlies p38 immune pathway activation in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine&quot; by Peterson et al. investigates aspects of the phase transition involved in p38 MAPK activation and innate immunity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal cells. The study investigates a mechanism for activation of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> p38 homolog, PMK-1, a required step in activation of innate immunity in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The authors use a range of techniques, including fluorescence microscopy of tagged TIR-1 (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain protein) to demonstrate that p38 PMK activation involves physical multimerization of TIR-1 and that this assembly induces NAD+ glycohydrolase activity, which in turn is required for p38 PMK activation.</p><p>The authors further show that mutations that interfere either with physical association or with NAD+ glycohydrolase activity prevent increased expression of immune effectors and cause increase susceptibility to bacterial pathogens. A similar mechanism, involving human SARM1 and NAD+ glycohydrolase activity has previously been demonstrated to function in the context of injury and axonal degeneration in human neurons. The demonstration that phase transition of TIR-1/SARM1 and increased NAD+ glycohydrolase activity is required for activation of innate immunity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal cells therefore demonstrates an evolutionarily conserved mechanism functioning in different tissues and in response to different stressors.</p><p>Finally, the authors demonstrate that low dietary cholesterol activates immune effector transcription independent of bacterial infection. It is surprising that, despite cholesterol scarcity apparently promoting p38-mediated innate immunity, worms on low cholesterol / with cholesterol related mutants (nhr-8) are more rather than less susceptible to pathogen killing. The reason for this susceptibility should be further investigated or at the very least more deeply discussed. This study is unusual in that it combines very different techniques to follow the stages of the phase transition and induction of innate immune factors. The analysis of transcriptional changes in the presence and absence of cholesterol is interesting but could be taken further. Despite some limitations, I have no doubt that the insights and tools presented here will be of valuable for future studies evaluating this conserved mechanism.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>I feel that the analysis of transcriptional data could be taken further. For example, are genes upregulated in nhr-8(ok186) statistically significantly more likely to be upregulated during infection (and vice versa for downregulated genes). How does this statistic depend on known association of these genes with p38.</p><p>I am also confused why, despite priming animals for infection, lack of cholesterol is detrimental during the challenge. Would the point of such priming not be to increase survival during infection?</p><p>Could the authors comment on / show data on survival in the absence of infection (e.g. ageing?). Lack of cholesterol shortens nematode lifespan and has been reported to prevent benefits from caloric restriction and of some lifespan extending mutations (daf-2). What is the mechanism of such detriment?

In the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the PMK-1 p38 pathway controls expression of anti-microbials, and is among the best studied and most important pathways for defense against pathogen infection. Despite this key role, little is known about the upstream activators of the MAPK pathway.</p><p>In this paper, the authors show that cholesterol scarcity activates the PMK-1 p38 MAPK pathway, as measured by upregulation of PMK-1 phosphorylation and increased expression of PMK-1 controlled gene expression. They also show that nhr-8 mutants, which have impaired cholesterol metabolism, have activated PMK-1 signaling. These mutants also have lowered pathogen load upon P. aeruginosa infection, albeit with impaired survival. This manuscript also shows that the SARM1 homolog TIR-1, which many studies have shown acts upstream of MAPK in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, forms puncta upon exposure to triggers that activate p38 MAPK pathway, such as in nhr-8 mutants that have impaired cholesterol metabolism. They also demonstrate TIR-1 puncta are induced upon pathogen infection. These puncta appear to be important for activation of PMK-1, as mutations that block TIR-1 multimerization also block PMK-1 activation. This manuscript also shows that NAD-ase activity of TIR-1 is regulated by a phase transition of TIR-1, and NAD-ase activity requires multimerization. Importantly, NAD-ase activity and multimerization of TIR-1 appear important for immune defenses in vivo, as mutations that impair these features of TIR-1 lead to increased susceptibility to infection.</p><p>Overall this manuscript makes an important contribution to the field of <italic>C. elegans</italic> immunity. It shows that the assembly of TIR-1 and its NAD-ase activity trigger the p38 MAPK immune pathway. It also provides insight that lowered cholesterol activates these same processes, leading to p38 MAPK signaling and pathogen resistance. Although some of these results were preceded by similar findings about TIR-1 in other systems (e.g. TIR-1 puncta were shown in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons, and the importance of TIR phase transition, multimerization and NADase activity has been shown in other organisms), there is an impressive amount of rigorous data in this manuscript, and it is a significant contribution to bring all these mechanisms together in the context of <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal immunity. However, in some cases, the claims are a bit overstated based on the data shown, with actual evidence being more indirect. There are a lot of moving parts in this paper, and the order in which information is provided can be a bit confusing.</p><p>1. The abstract states that &quot;TIR-1/SARM1 phase transition is modified by dietary cholesterol&quot;. However, those results were not apparent in the manuscript – rather, the authors show altered TIR-1 puncta in nhr-8 mutants, which have altered cholesterol metabolism. The authors should either show that lowered cholesterol induces TIR-1 puncta, or modify their language.</p><p>Related to this issue, the authors need to provide more information about what exactly is perturbed in nhr-8 mutants, given that these mutants are used in many experiments as a proxy for cholesterol scarcity. For example, Line 126-128: How tight is the correlation between transcriptional profiles of nhr-8 loss-of-function mutants and cholesterol-deprived animals? Including a plot comparing both would further support the use of nhr-8 mutants to study conditions of low sterol content. Also, Line 153: Does increased cholesterol supplementation or cholesterol solubilization result in increased cholesterol content in worms? Quantification of cholesterol levels within animals would strengthen the claim that &quot;immune effector activation in nhr-8(hd117) mutants is due to sterol deficiency&quot;.</p><p>2. Line 404 &quot; these data demonstrate for the first time that physiological stressors, both pathogen and non-pathogen, induce TIR-1 multimerization into puncta within intestinal epithelial cells, which superactivates the intrinsic NADase activity of this protein complex to activate the p38 PMK-1 innate immune pathway&quot;. This sentence implies all of these findings have been shown in intestinal cells. The authors show TIR-1 puncta in intestinal cells, and show that mutants defective in NADase activity have less p38 activation, but activation of NADase activity is shown in vitro. Recommend to revise language, or to show through purification of TIR-1 from <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal cells activated by these stressors that it there is increased NADase activity.</p><p>3. A major claim in the paper mentioned above is that physiologically relevant stressors induce TIR-1 multimerization in puncta, shown in Figure 6. However, it is unclear how puncta were counted. Did the authors count puncta in a z-stack or in just one optical plane? How did the authors resolve individual puncta from overlapping puncta? Furthermore, the authors normalize puncta fluorescence to autofluorescence, but autofluorescence is altered by many conditions. Either demonstrate that autofluorescence is not affected by these triggers and genetic backgrounds, or use a different normalization method.</p><p>In addition, the authors should eliminate the concern that nhr-8 mutants are simply prone to higher levels of protein aggregation in general, e.g. by showing lack of aggregation in some unrelated protein. Showing fewer puncta in the multimerization-defective TIR-1 mutant protein would also strengthen the case that the puncta formation is due to organized TIR-1 multimerization (like the model in Figure 7L), rather than non-specific aggregation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The p38 MAPK pathway is a crucial stress-sensing pathway involved in many processes including immune activation in metazoans. It has been heavily studied in both mammalian systems as well model hosts such <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. However, the mechanisms by which this pathway are activated are not yet fully understood. Using <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the authors demonstrate that a component of this pathway, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain protein (TIR-1), an NAD+ glycohydrolase homologous to mammalian sterile α and TIR motif-containing 1 (SARM1), is discovered to undergo a phase transition, forming a higher-ordered protein assembly that is necessary for activation. Strengths include robust genetic analysis as well as rigorous in vitro enzyme kinetic assys revealing that NAD+ glycohydrolase activity requires oligomerization and phase transition. This is similar to what was previously shown with mammalian SARM. What is new is that this oligomerization is visualized for the first time in live animals exposed to pathogen.</p><p>Another exciting discovery is that cholesterol limitation additionally induces oligomerization of TIR-1 and p38 MAPK pathway activation. Cholesterol, which <italic>C. elegans</italic> is not able to manufacture, is limited by not adding it to the medium or by preventing its adequate import using a nhr-8 mutant. nhr-8 mutants or animals raised without cholesterol are hyper-susceptible to pathogen killing. However, in this and previous work, cholesterol limitation is shown to upregulate p38 MAPK signaling. A major claim of the manuscript is that micronutrient deprivation primes <italic>C. elegans</italic> for pathogen defense. There are two major weaknesses with this claim. (1) It is overbroad in that cholesterol is the only micronutrient that the authors show has this effect. (2) The animals who are experiencing cholesterol deprivation survive worse on pathogen – yes, there is less pathogen accumulation and more p38 pathway activation, in fact mis/overactivation, but there is still early death. An alternative hypothesis is that the overactivation/misregulation of p38 observed in nhr-8/cholesterol-deprived animals on pathogen is maladaptive causing a detrimental effect – early death.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1) I would like to see the survival curves/cfu accumulation of a pmk-1;nhr-8 double added to the manuscript to validate whether the authors can argue that the overactivation of the p38 MAPK pathway seen in the nhr-8 mutant is protective. If the double mutant is more sensitive than nhr-8, this would suggest that the p38 activation that is occurring is still protective, even if not up to wild type levels of survival. However, if the double mutant survives better than nhr-8, it suggests that the overactivation of p38 is having a detrimental effect.</p><p>2) Do the authors think that a lack of cholesterol is sensed by some unknown mechanism and leads to this response? Or do they favor a model in which the lack of cholesterol change the biophysical properties of the cell such that oligomerization of TIR-1 is favored? Some discussion on how the lack of cholesterol and pathogen exposure might stimulate TIR-1 oligomerization and signaling would be interesting.</p><p>3) It is argued that knock-down of atf-7 abrogates T24B8.5::gfp activation in nhr-8 animals. However, the data in Figure 2G is not that convincing. The fluorescent phenotype appears in-between wild type and nhr-8. Can the fluorescent data be quantified or can another method be used such a qRT of the relevant genes in a nhr-8 animal with atf-7 RNAi?</p><p>4) Inset in Figure 4I was not immediately clear and not described in the figure legend. It was hard to figure out what it was depicting at first. * are used to mark mutants with no activity, but there appears to be a mistake between E788Q and H833A.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Pathogen infection and cholesterol deficiency activate the <italic>C. elegans</italic> p38 immune pathway through a TIR-1/SARM1 phase transition&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

There are still two outstanding concerns that could however be addressed either by providing additional data or by adding appropriate caveats and further discussion to the final manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is still a concern that the link between cholesterol deficiency and puncta formation is indirectly shown through nhr-8(hd117); tir-1::wrmScarlet animals. This claim would be strengthened by providing confocal images of tir-1::wrmScarlet animals grown under cholesterol-deficient conditions. Otherwise, we ask the authors to reflect comment through modification of their language (e.g. &quot;We demonstrate that a loss-of-function mutation in nhr-8, which alters cholesterol metabolism, causes TIR-1/SARM-1 to oligomerize into puncta in epithelial cells…&quot;).</p><p>2) Another remaining concern is that TIR-1 puncta formation in nhr-8 mutants may be a result of non-specific aggregation (See Original reviews). While Tergitol does suppress TIR-1::wrmScarlet puncta formation, it is possible that Tergitol would also suppress non-specific aggregation of TIR-1::wrmScarlet. Further, tir-1 RNAi data do not provide direct evidence that puncta formation is physiologically relevant. Puncta formation may be a consequence of non-specific aggregation due to dysregulation of other biological processes in nhr-8 mutants rather than a consequence of organized TIR-1 multimerization. Lack of puncta upon tir-1 RNAi treatment could reflect a reduction in TIR-1 protein levels such that non-specific aggregates are not visible. To strengthen the link between ordered multimerization and puncta formation, we ask the authors or show that multimerization mutants (i.e. tir-1∆SAM) exhibit decreased puncta or address these concerns in their interpretation</p><p>While these additional data would be beneficial, we feel that at this stage it is not essential, if appropriately addressed in the text.</p><p>Other than these two remaining points, there is consensus that you have addressed all previous concerns in full and that the manuscript makes an important contribution and is now suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74206.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please add survival curves/cfu accumulation of a pmk-1;nhr-8 double mutant to the manuscript to validate the notion that the overactivation of the p38 MAPK pathway seen in the nhr-8 mutant is protective.

We also used qRT-PCR in three different biological replicate samples to confirm that T24B8.5 was upregulated in animals exposed to 0 μg/mL cholesterol (Figure 3C). As we observed previously, innate immune effector genes were strongly enriched during cholesterol starvation. We also found that the transcriptional changes during cholesterol starvation mirror those in the <italic>nhr-8</italic> loss-of-function mutants, which further supports the use of <italic>nhr-8</italic> mutants to study conditions of low sterol content. This comparison is presented in a new supplemental figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B) and discussed in the text (Lines 315-318). T24B8.5p::<italic>gfp</italic> is widely used as a readout of activation of the p38 PMK-1 pathway. Thus, we chose to use this reporter in the main figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is argued that knock-down of atf-7 abrogates T24B8.5::gfp activation in nhr-8 animals. However, the data in Figure 2G is not that convincing. The fluorescent phenotype appears in-between wild type and nhr-8. Can the fluorescent data be quantified or can another method be used such a qRT of the relevant genes in a nhr-8 animal with atf-7 RNAi?</p></disp-quote><p>We quantified the fluorescent images in Figure 2G (Now Figure 4G) as suggested by the reviewer and present the data in a new figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C).

The text of the manuscript (Lines 230-234) has been updated to reflect this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors should better explain how the lowered <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> levels in nhr-8 mutants is an example of increased pathogen resistance, which together with the lowered survival of these mutants is an example of decreased tolerance of infection. This distinction is an important aspect of pathogen infection studies, i.e. the difference between pathogen resistance (controlling levels of the pathogen) and tolerance (controlling the health impacts from the pathogen). As it stands the text is confusing, e.g. Lines 183-184: &quot;Thus, even though nhr-8(hd117) mutant animals are more susceptible to pathogen killing, they are mounting effective anti-pathogen defenses toward an ingested pathogen&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited this sentence, and the paragraph where it appears, to better highlight the important point raised by this reviewer. We now state: “These data suggest that low cholesterol in the <italic>nhr-8(hd117)</italic> mutants reduces tolerance to pathogen infection, and that the robust transcriptional induction of immune effectors in this mutant background leads to reduced accumulation of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> during infection.” (Lines 353-356) We also further discuss this observation in two new paragraphs in the Discussion section (Lines 491-506).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Do the authors think that a lack of cholesterol is sensed by some unknown mechanism and leads to this response? Or do they favor a model in which the lack of cholesterol change the biophysical properties of the cell such that oligomerization of TIR-1 is favored?

They have suggested that additional care should be taken in discussing this result and its implication. Specific suggestions:</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised Discussion section (Lines 491-506), we include two new paragraphs where we discuss some of the points raised below. In summary, we demonstrate that cholesterol supplementation can fully rescue the enhanced susceptibility to pathogen-mediated killing in <italic>nhr-8</italic> loss-of-function mutants (Figure 3M and 3N). These data suggest that cholesterol is required for pathogen tolerance in <italic>C. elegans</italic>; however, the mechanism behind this observation is not known. The p38 PMK-1 pathway provides protection during pathogen infection in the <italic>nhr-8</italic> mutant background (Figure 4M), suggesting that the enhanced susceptibility to pathogen-mediated killing in the <italic>nhr-8</italic> mutant is not secondary to aberrant activation of the p38 PMK-1 pathway. Cholesterol-deficient animals may therefore have general reductions in organismal fitness that cause vulnerability to pathogen infection and reduce lifespan.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. Could the authors comment on / show data on survival in the absence of infection (e.g. ageing?).

What is the mechanism of such detriment? Does it make sense in the context of the proposed role in modulating innate immunity?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises some very interesting points about the intersection of aging and immune regulation as it pertains to cholesterol metabolism. We chose not to discuss the effect of cholesterol on aging in this manuscript, however, so that we could keep the focus on immune regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Furthermore, daf-2 mutation increases resistance to infection and this also requires p38. Given the suggested role of low cholesterol in priming nematodes for infection, how might this be reconciled? Does low cholesterol cause inappropriate / over activation of p38 which reduces survival during infection and also shortens lifespan under CR? If this is the case, how would the proposed priming be of benefit as it interferes with appropriate response to both types of challenges (lack of nutrients and infection??).</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above in point 1, we present data from a new experiment in the revised manuscript that the p38 PMK-1 pathway provides protection during pathogen infection in the <italic>nhr-8</italic> mutant background (Figure 4M), which suggests that the enhanced susceptibility to pathogen-mediated killing in the <italic>nhr-8</italic> mutant is not secondary to aberrant activation of the p38 PMK-1 pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. The authors claim that activation of p38 PMK-1 pathway in sterol-scarce environments is an &quot;adaptive response that allows a metazoan host to anticipate environmental threats during micronutrient deprivation&quot;. However, the data could support alternative explanations for the upregulation of PMK-1 during sterol scarcity. For example, is there some other benefit to upregulating the PMK-1 pathway (in absence of sterols) that isn't related to pathogen defense? Could PMK-1 upregulation be a consequence of some other disturbance rather than a preemptive response? What other cellular processes are perturbed during cholesterol deprivation and does PMK-1 play a role in regulating these processes? The authors should consider framing the concept of an &quot;adaptive response&quot; in a more speculative manner and also address alternative explanations.</p></disp-quote><p>In a new paragraph in the Discussion section (Lines 500-506), we present the points raised in this critique.

It shows that the assembly of TIR-1 and its NAD-ase activity trigger the p38 MAPK immune pathway. It also provides insight that lowered cholesterol activates these same processes, leading to p38 MAPK signaling and pathogen resistance. Although some of these results were preceded by similar findings about TIR-1 in other systems (e.g. TIR-1 puncta were shown in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons, and the importance of TIR phase transition, multimerization and NADase activity has been shown in other organisms), there is an impressive amount of rigorous data in this manuscript, and it is a significant contribution to bring all these mechanisms together in the context of <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal immunity. However, in some cases, the claims are a bit overstated based on the data shown, with actual evidence being more indirect. There are a lot of moving parts in this paper, and the order in which information is provided can be a bit confusing.</p><p>1. The abstract states that &quot;TIR-1/SARM1 phase transition is modified by dietary cholesterol&quot;. However, those results were not apparent in the manuscript – rather, the authors show altered TIR-1 puncta in nhr-8 mutants, which have altered cholesterol metabolism. The authors should either show that lowered cholesterol induces TIR-1 puncta, or modify their language.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised abstract, we have eliminated the words “modified by dietary cholesterol.” We now state: “We demonstrate that cholesterol deficiency causes TIR-1/SARM1 to oligomerize into puncta in intestinal epithelial cells and engages its NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase activity, which increases p38 PMK-1 phosphorylation, and primes immune effector induction in a manner that leads to reduced pathogen accumulation in the intestine during a subsequent infection.” (Lines 39-42)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this issue, the authors need to provide more information about what exactly is perturbed in nhr-8 mutants, given that these mutants are used in many experiments as a proxy for cholesterol scarcity.

Including a plot comparing both would further support the use of nhr-8 mutants to study conditions of low sterol content. Also, Line 153: Does increased cholesterol supplementation or cholesterol solubilization result in increased cholesterol content in worms?

A major claim in the paper mentioned above is that physiologically relevant stressors induce TIR-1 multimerization in puncta, shown in Figure 6. However, it is unclear how puncta were counted. Did the authors count puncta in a z-stack or in just one optical plane? How did the authors resolve individual puncta from overlapping puncta? Furthermore, the authors normalize puncta fluorescence to autofluorescence, but autofluorescence is altered by many conditions. Either demonstrate that autofluorescence is not affected by these triggers and genetic backgrounds, or use a different normalization method.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we devised a different method of quantifying TIR-1::wrmScarlet that was not subject to potential bias from differences in autofluorescence between experimental and control conditions. We present the details of this approach in a new section of the Materials and methods titled “Microscopy image analyses” (Lines 690-700). In summary, Fiji Image Analysis Software was used to identify TIR-1::wrmScarlet puncta in an automated fashion in the red channel. Importantly, we used a stringent cut-off for puncta calling to maximize specificity. We then overlayed the location of the red channel puncta in the green channel and determined if there were autofluorescent puncta in this exact location. TIR-1::wrmScarlet puncta were those that were present in the red, but not the green, channel. Importantly, we only reported puncta that were positively identified by the image analysis software. The result of this approach was a rigorous assessment of the difference in puncta between the experimental conditions, but one that, by design, under-called puncta numbers in the induced conditions (<italic>i.e.,</italic> during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection or in the <italic>nhr-8</italic> mutant). For example, occasionally, the image analysis software identified overlapping puncta as a single punctum.

Otherwise, we ask the authors to reflect comment through modification of their language (e.g. &quot;We demonstrate that a loss-of-function mutation in nhr-8, which alters cholesterol metabolism, causes TIR-1/SARM-1 to oligomerize into puncta in epithelial cells…&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the sentence in the abstract as suggested by this reviewer (lines 39-41).

While Tergitol does suppress TIR-1::wrmScarlet puncta formation, it is possible that Tergitol would also suppress non-specific aggregation of TIR-1::wrmScarlet. Further, tir-1 RNAi data do not provide direct evidence that puncta formation is physiologically relevant. Puncta formation may be a consequence of non-specific aggregation due to dysregulation of other biological processes in nhr-8 mutants rather than a consequence of organized TIR-1 multimerization. Lack of puncta upon tir-1 RNAi treatment could reflect a reduction in TIR-1 protein levels such that non-specific aggregates are not visible. To strengthen the link between ordered multimerization and puncta formation, we ask the authors or show that multimerization mutants (i.e. tir-1∆SAM) exhibit decreased puncta or address these concerns in their interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a paragraph to the manuscript to acknowledge the possibility that the TIR-1 puncta formation in <italic>nhr-8</italic> mutants may be a result of non-specific protein aggregation and to point out that the in vitro and in vivo data presented in this manuscript, when considered together, suggest that this is not the case (lines 416-427).

Organized multimerization of TIR-1 is a prerequisite for the NADase activity of the protein complex in vitro (Figure 2). Accordingly, the mutations that specifically abrogate TIR-1 multimerization in vitro (Figures 2J, 2K, Figure 2—figure supplement 1I), also block p38 PMK-1 pathway activation (Figures 1E and 1F) and prevented immune effector induction in response to cholesterol deprivation in vivo (Figures 5C-F). Furthermore, Tergitol, which solubilizes cholesterol and fully suppresses p38 PMK-1 immune activation in <italic>nhr-8</italic> mutants (Figure 5G-5N), also suppresses TIR-1::wrmScarlet puncta formation (Figure 5A and 5B). Finally and perhaps most importantly, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection, a separate physiological stress, also induces TIR-1::wrmScarlet puncta formation to activate the p38 PMK-1 pathway (Figure 1).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
