fluorescence imaging through gradient index (GRIN) lens-based endoscopes is fundamental to investigate the functional properties of neural populations in deep brain circuits. However, GRIN lenses have intrinsic optical aberrations, which severely degrade their imaging performance. GRIN aberrations decrease the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution of fluorescence signals, especially in lateral portions of the field-of-view (FOV), leading to restricted FOV and smaller number of recorded neurons. This is especially relevant for GRIN lenses of several millimeters in length, which are needed to reach the deeper regions of the rodent brain. We have previously demonstrated a novel method to enlarge the FOV and improve the spatial resolution of 2P microendoscopes based on GRIN lenses of length &lt;4.1 mm (Antonini et al., 2020). However, previously developed microendoscopes were too short to reach the most ventral regions of the mouse brain. In this study, we combined optical simulations with fabrication of aspherical polymer microlenses through three-dimensional (3D) microprinting to correct for optical aberrations in long (length &gt;6 mm) GRIN lens-based microendoscopes (diameter, 500 µm). Long corrected microendoscopes had improved spatial resolution, enabling imaging in significantly enlarged FOVs. Moreover, using synthetic calcium data we showed that aberration correction enabled detection of cells with higher SNR of fluorescent signals and decreased cross-contamination between neurons. Finally, we applied long corrected microendoscopes to perform large-scale and high-precision recordings of calcium signals in populations of neurons in the olfactory cortex, a brain region laying approximately 5 mm from the brain surface, of awake head-fixed mice. Long corrected microendoscopes are powerful new tools enabling population imaging with unprecedented large FOV and high spatial resolution in the most ventral regions of the mouse brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gradient index lenses</kwd><kwd>aberration correction</kwd><kwd>neural circuits</kwd><kwd>deep imaging</kwd><kwd>two-photon imaging</kwd><kwd>high-resolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/101016787</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fellin</surname><given-names>Tommaso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NextGenerationEU FAIR PE0000013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fellin</surname><given-names>Tommaso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01DC017437</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fleischmann</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A built-in solution for correcting optical aberrations in long (&gt; 6 mm) gradient index (GRIN) lenses enables unbiased two-photon functional recordings of large neuronal populations in the deep mouse brain.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>High-resolution 2P fluorescence imaging of the awake brain is a fundamental tool to investigate the relationship between the structure and the function of brain circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Svoboda and Yasuda, 2006</xref>). Compared to electrophysiological techniques, functional imaging in combination with genetically encoded indicators allows monitoring the activity of genetically targeted cell types, access to subcellular compartments, and tracking the dynamics of many biochemical signals in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2024</xref>). However, a critical limitation of multiphoton microscopy lies in its limited (&lt;1 mm) penetration depth in scattering biological media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Helmchen and Denk, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Deep ventral regions of the brain, such as the olfactory cortex, the hypothalamus, and the amygdala play fundamental roles in controlling the processing of sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Endo and Kazama, 2022</xref>), circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sternson, 2013</xref>), hormone release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sternson, 2013</xref>), decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Phelps et al., 2014</xref>), and adaptation of instinctive and motivational behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Phelps et al., 2014</xref>). Since these ventral areas lay deeper than 4 mm down the brain surface in rodents and larger mammals (e.g. rats, cats, and marmosets), imaging these regions typically requires the use of light guides, which relay the focal plane of the microscope objective down to the target brain area. Since inserting light guides in the brain damages the tissue above the target area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonini et al., 2020</xref>), reducing the cross-section of the probe is desired when imaging these deep brain regions. One popular solution for deep 2P imaging in awake animals is using GRIN lenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jung and Schnitzer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jung et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reed et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barretto et al., 2009</xref>), thin cylindrical rod lenses characterized by refractive index which varies with the radial distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore, 1980</xref>). For example, in the mouse orbitofrontal cortex 2P microscopy through GRIN endoscopes showed that orbitofrontal neurons respond to either caloric rewards or social stimuli, indicating the presence of functionally distinct feeding and social neuronal subnetworks in this deep cortical region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jennings et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, in the lateral hypothalamus combining GRIN endoscopes with 2P imaging revealed neurons encoding thermal punishment and reward and this subset of neurons was distinct from the ensemble of neurons encoding caloric reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung et al., 2022</xref>). Other ventral brain regions, such as the olfactory cortex, can be imaged with an invasive preparation, which does not require a GRIN lens, but which is incompatible with imaging in awake behaving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pashkovski et al., 2020</xref>). In the olfactory cortex, GRIN lens-based 2P endoscopy becomes necessary in awake animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), where head tilting is not compatible with animal performance in a behavioral task.</p><p>One limitation of GRIN lens-based endoscopy is that GRIN lenses suffer from intrinsic optical aberrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bortoletto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee and Yun, 2011</xref>). GRIN aberrations can be both on-axis and off-axis and severely degrade the quality of 2P imaging. GRIN aberrations distort the point spread function (PSF) and enlarge the excitation volume of the focal spot, leading to reduced SNR of fluorescence signals and decreased spatial resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang and Ji, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>). This effect is not uniform across the FOV and is particularly relevant in lateral portions of the FOV, generating uneven spatial resolution and inhomogeneous amplitude of fluorescence signals across the FOV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang and Ji, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>). As a consequence of these limitations, previous studies using 2P imaging through GRIN lenses in ventral regions of the mouse brain were limited to imaging a small number of neurons with uneven spatial resolution across the FOV and low SNR in lateral portion of the FOV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jennings et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Piantadosi et al., 2024</xref>). Developing GRIN-based endoscopic probes with improved optical properties and more homogeneous spatial resolution, which are long enough to enable imaging in the most ventral regions of the rodent brain while maintaining a small (≤500 µm) cross-section, is thus a compelling need.</p><p>Various adaptive optics methods were developed to correct optical aberrations in GRIN lenses. For example, initial efforts utilized optical compensation by low-order electrostatic membrane mirror (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bortoletto et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, adaptive optics through pupil segmentation was used to efficiently correct GRIN aberrations, increasing the intensity of recorded fluorescence signals and enlarging the imaging FOV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang and Ji, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>). More recently, geometric transformation adaptive optics has been developed and applied for the correction of aberrations in GRIN lenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2024</xref>). However, adaptive optics approaches require substantial modification of the optical path of the microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bortoletto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang and Ji, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2024</xref>), needs specifically designed software controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang and Ji, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2024</xref>), and may limit the temporal resolution of imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang and Ji, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>). Alternatively, mm-size plano-convex lenses have been combined with GRIN lenses to correct on-axis aberrations and increase the Numerical Aperture (NA) of the optical system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barretto et al., 2009</xref>). However, this method is difficult to apply to GRIN lenses of cross-section smaller than 1 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matz et al., 2015</xref>), because of the difficulty in manufacturing high-precision optics with small radial dimension and complex profile. Recently, a novel method based on 3D microprinting of polymer optics was developed to correct for GRIN aberrations by placing specifically designed aspherical corrective lenses at the back end of the GRIN lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonini et al., 2020</xref>). This approach is attractive because it is built-in on the GRIN lens and corrected microendoscopes are ready-to-use, requiring no change in the optical set-up. However, previous work demonstrated the feasibility of this method only for GRIN lenses of length &lt;4.1 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonini et al., 2020</xref>), which are too short to reach the most ventral regions of the mouse brain. The applicability of this technology to longer GRIN lenses, which are affected by stronger optical aberrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee and Yun, 2011</xref>), remained to be proven.</p><p>In this study, we designed, developed, and validated correction of optical aberrations in GRIN lenses of length 6.4 mm and 8.8 mm and diameter 500 µm using a combination of ray-trace simulation, 3D microprinting by 2P lithography, simulated calcium data, and experimental characterization. Validation of the new corrected microendoscopes is provided with proof-of-principle experiments in a ventral brain region, the olfactory cortex, of awake head-fixed mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design of aberration corrected microendoscopic probes based on long GRIN rods</title><p>We selected two GRIN singlet rod lenses (hereon GRIN rods) suitable for multiphoton fluorescence imaging in ventral regions of the mouse brain. The two selected GRIN rods had NA = 0.5 on both sides, 500 µm diameter, 1.5 and 2.0 pitch, and 6.4 mm and 8.8 mm length, respectively. For both GRIN rods, we modeled an optical assembly composed of the GRIN rod, a thin layer of glass (representing a 100-µm-thick glass coverslip) attached to the back end of the GRIN rod, and an aspheric corrective lens (here on called corrective lens) aligned to the rod and attached to the opposite side of the glass coverslip with respect to the GRIN rod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). We designed the aspheric surface of the corrective lens using ray-trace simulations at the wavelength (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) of 920 nm, the excitation wavelength commonly used for 2P imaging of the popular genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP. The design of the corrective lens was an iterative process in which the parameters that define the corrective lens surface were automatically varied to obtain the highest and most homogeneous spatial resolution possible over the longest possible radial distance from the optical axis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and Materials and methods for details on simulation parameters). More specifically, we simulated the corrective lens profile such that the Strehl ratio (defined as the peak intensity of the focal spot of an aberrated optical system normalized to the peak intensity of the focal spot of the ideal optical system, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith, 2008</xref>) of the corrected microendoscope remained above the threshold of 0.8 for the longest possible radial distance from the optical axis. The values of Strehl ratio equal to 0.8 corresponded to the lower bound of the diffraction-limited condition set by the Maréchal criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith, 2008</xref>). Our simulations showed that the profiles of the two corrective lenses displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> led to an increase in the radius of the diffraction-limited FOV compared to the case in which the corrective lens was not positioned in the back end of the GRIN rods (uncorrected microendoscopes). The profile of the corrective optical element was specific to the type of GRIN rod considered. The simulated increase in the radius of the diffraction-limited FOV was 3.50 times and 3.35 times for the 6.4 mm-long and 8.8 mm-long probe, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>). Moreover, we investigated the effect of changing wavelength on the Strehl ratio. We found that the Strehl ratio remained &gt;0.8 within at least ±10 nm from <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> = 920 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which covered the limited bandwidth of our femtosecond laser. All simulations were performed maximizing aberration correction in the simulated focal plane of the microendoscopes (imaging plane in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). However, we explored the effect of aberration correction outside the simulated focal plane. In corrected microendoscopes, we found that for off-axis rays (radial distance from the optical axis &gt;40 μm) the Strehl ratio was &gt;0.8 (Maréchal criterion) in a larger volume compared to uncorrected microendoscopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), demonstrating that the aberration correction method developed in this study extends for short distances beyond the simulated focal plane. For example, at a radial distance of ~90 μm from the optical axis, the axial range in which the Strehl ratio was &gt;0.8 in corrected microendoscopes was 28 μm and 19 μm for the 6.4 mm-long and the 8.8 mm-long microendoscope, respectively. Decentering the optical axis of the corrective lens from the optical axis of the GRIN rod rapidly disrupted the optical properties of the corrected microendoscopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). To visualize the expected improvement of the spatial resolution in corrected microendoscopes, we simulated the PSF of uncorrected and corrected microendoscopes at different radial distances from the optical axis. For both the 6.4 mm-long and 8.8 mm-long GRIN rods, we found that the PSF of the uncorrected probe was strongly aberrated and highly irregular at ~90 µm away from the center of the FOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>). In contrast, in the corrected microendoscopes the PSF had regular shape and, at &gt;90 µm away from the optical axis, it was similar to the one measured at the center of the FOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Optical simulations of long corrected microendoscopes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ray-trace simulation for the microendoscope based on the 6.4 mm-long GRIN rod.

This effect was due to a larger decrease of the total number of pairs of adjacent cells as a function of the peak SNR threshold compared to the decrease in the number of pairs of adjacent cells whose activity was more correlated than expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, in uncorrected microendoscopes the pairwise correlation of adjacent cells showed a larger linear dependence on the radial distance of the pair from the center of the FOV compared to corrected microendoscopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref> and C, see also Materials and methods). We interpreted these findings on correlated neuronal activity as due to the enlarged PSF of uncorrected microendoscopes in lateral portion of the FOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–J</xref>), leading to increased signal contamination by sampling across neurons. These results thus suggest that corrected microendoscopes decrease the artefactual correlation of nearby neurons by diminishing the spatial extension of the excitation volume used for sampling neuronal activity (PSF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–J</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Long corrected microendoscopes enable more precise collection of simulated activity signals from individual cellular sources and decrease cross-contamination between adjacent cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fraction of adjacent cell pairs (distance between detected cell centroids ≤25 µm) that are more correlated that expected (expected pair correlation was estimated as mean Pearson’s correlation between ground truth activity traces of any possible neuronal pairs plus 3 SDs) as a function of the peak SNR threshold imposed on extracted activity traces for n=13 simulated experiments with the 6.4 mm-long uncorrected (red) and corrected (blue) microendoscope.

For each ROI, we computed a general linear model (GLM) of the contributions to fluorescence signals of the activity of all ground truth simulated neurons, called ‘sources’, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C, G and H</xref>). From the GLM coefficients, we extracted a source ‘purity’ index, which reached its highest possible value of 1 when only one source contributed to the calcium fluorescent trace in the considered ROI and had values &lt;1 when different source neurons were mixed in the fluorescent signal of the considered ROI. For uncorrected microendoscopes of both lengths, we found that purity rapidly decreased with the radial distance of the ROI from the center of the FOV. In contrast, for corrected microendoscopes the purity index decreased far more slowly with the radial distance and the slope of the linear fit of the purity distribution as a function of the radial distance was significantly smaller than that of the uncorrected probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and H</xref>). For any value of the peak SNR threshold used to select neurons, the purity index was also larger for corrected than for uncorrected probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref> and D). Moreover, for each ROI we analyzed the correlation of the extracted traces with the most correlated ground truth neuron (‘first ground truth source’) as a function of the radial distance of the ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, E,I and J</xref>). For microendoscopes of both lengths, we observed that ROIs from t-series generated with corrected microendoscopes displayed larger correlation with the ground truth signal of an individual neuron over longer distances from the optical axis, compared to uncorrected probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and J</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref> showed a moderate enlargement of the distance at which the Pearson’s correlation with the first ground truth emitter started to drop. This may appear at first in contrast with the enlargement of the FOV shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. However, it can be understood considering that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, all illuminated neurons were visible regardless of whether they were imaged with high axial resolution (e.g. &lt;10 µm as defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>) or poor axial resolution. In contrast, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref> we evaluated the correlation between the calcium trace extracted from a given ROI and the real activity trace of the first simulated ground truth emitter for that specific ROI. The moderate increase in the correlation for the corrected microendoscope compared to the uncorrected microendoscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>) was consistent with the moderate improvement in the axial resolution of the corrected probe compared to the uncorrected probe at intermediate radial distances (60–100 µm from the optical axis, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Taken together, these results indicated that corrected microendoscopes enabled more precise recording of individual cellular source neurons and enhanced demixing of signals coming from different neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Validation of long corrected microendoscopes for large FOV population imaging in ventral brain region of awake mice</title><p>We tested long corrected microendoscopes for in vivo 2P calcium imaging experiments in ventral regions of the mouse brain.

We then computed the pairwise correlation of the activity traces of pairs of adjacent neurons (defined as pairs of cells with an intersomatic distance of ≤25 µm) as a function of the radial distance of the pair’s position centroid from the center of the FOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). We found no dependence of the pairwise correlation on the distance from the center of the FOV. In fact, the slope of the linear fit of pairwise correlation as a function of the radial distance was not significantly different from zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). These findings were in agreement with the results of the optical characterization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and with those of the simulation of calcium data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). These results suggested that the absence of dependence of the pairwise correlation with radial distance reflected the improved and more homogeneous spatial resolution of corrected microendoscopes, which prevented source mixing and artificially inflated correlations of adjacent neurons in the FOV periphery.

Simulations showed strongly aberrated PSF in lateral portions of the FOV of uncorrected microendoscopes and predicted that single corrective optical elements with the aspherical profiles shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> improved the optical performance of microendoscopes of either length. This prediction was experimentally confirmed using subresolved fluorescent beads and layers. We first observed that uncorrected microendoscopes of either length displayed strong astigmatism and had largely distorted PSF in lateral regions of the FOV. In corrected microendoscopes, we instead found that the PSF had regular shape and constrained values for larger radial distances, leading to more homogeneous spatial resolution across the FOV and enlarged effective FOV. Importantly, experimental values describing the improvement of the optical performance of the corrected microendoscopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) were generally in good agreement with the prediction of the optical simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The size of simulated PSFs at a given radial distance (e.g. 90 µm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) tended to be generally smaller than that of the experimentally measured PSFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This might be due to multiple reasons. First, simulated PSFs were excitation PSFs, that is they described the intensity spatial distribution of focused excitation light. On the contrary, measured PSFs resulted from the excitation and emission processes and thus they were also affected by aberrations of light emitted by fluorescent beads and collected by the microscope. Second, in the optical simulations first-order and not higher-order aberrations were considered. Third, intrinsic variability in experimental parameters (e.g. alignment of the microendoscope to the optical axis of the microscope, distance between the GRIN back end and the objective) were not considered in the simulations. It is important to note that the improvement in spatial resolution of GRIN lens-based probes described in this work was related exclusively to the introduction of the corrective lens. In fact, uncorrected microendoscopes used for comparison consisted of a GRIN rod and a glass coverslip attached to the back end of the GRIN lens. Previous work showed that the addition of a glass coverslip, that typically introduces negative spherical aberrations, counteracted positive spherical aberrations introduced by GRIN lens singlets and improved the optical performance of the GRIN rod when combined with the use of a microscope objective with corrective collar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Murray and Levene, 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that adopting our corrected microendoscopes rather than using bare GRIN lenses enhances imaging performance even more than what described in the present study.</p><p>Did the improved optical properties of corrected microendoscopes increase the quality of imaging when corrected microendoscopes were applied to biological samples? We directly addressed this question by performing 2P imaging with uncorrected and corrected microendoscopes in brain slices in which neurons expressed a green fluorescent indicator. In uncorrected microendoscopes, we found that neuronal cell bodies were bright and well contrasted only in the center of the FOV and that neuronal cell bodies were dimmer and blurred in lateral regions of the FOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, neuronal processes could be observed only in the center of the FOV and not in lateral portions of the FOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, in corrected microendoscopes of either length, we found that neurons were bright and well contrasted across the whole FOV, which enabled distinguishing neurons, which were blurred and merged together when imaged with uncorrected microendoscopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, small neuronal processes could be observed throughout the entire FOV. These imaging findings in brain slices are in line with the results of the optical simulation and of the experimental characterization, which showed improved PSF and more homogeneous spatial resolution in corrected microendoscopes compared to uncorrected ones. It must be considered, however, that the extended FOV achieved by our aberration correction method was characterized by a curved focal plane. Therefore, cells located in different radial positions within the image were located at different axial positions and cells at the border of the FOV were closer to the front end of the microendoscope.</p><p>How does the improved optical performance of corrected microendoscope translate into enhanced ability to extract meaningful information from population of neurons in functional fluorescence imaging experiments? We addressed this question generating and analyzing synthetic calcium data in which we could compare the signals extracted from simulated recordings using uncorrected and corrected microendoscopes with the ground truth signals, which were used to generate the simulations. We found that the aberration correction led to an increase in the number of ROIs with high SNR and, correspondingly, a decrease in the number of ROIs with low SNR. Moreover, aberration correction led to high and more stable purity of source demixing over radial distance, which, in turn, led to a major decrease in the artificial overestimation of correlations between adjacent neurons due to source mixing. Since investigating neuronal population codes needs quantification of neuronal activity with large SNR, high precision, and limited contamination, we expect the corrected microendoscopes presented in this manuscript will greatly contribute to the investigation of deep brain regions. In particular, the reduction of artificial overestimation of correlations due to source mixing appears crucial to precisely evaluate within-network neuron-to-neuron communication and investigate the role of correlations between neurons in population codes. Artificial correlations between nearby neurons would bias estimates of neuron-to-neuron communication toward overestimating communications at short distances. Moreover, because source mixing duplicates one neuron into another and thus can only increase redundancy, artificial correlations would also bias the effect of correlations on population coding by artificially inflating redundant correlations over synergistic interactions between neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ecker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Panzeri et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, correcting optical aberrations in GRIN lenses as presented in this study appears essential for the unbiased characterization of single-neuron and population codes in deeper brain structures.</p><p>We used long corrected microendoscopes to measure population dynamics in the olfactory cortex of awake head-restrained mice with unprecedented combination of high spatial resolution across the FOV and minimal invasiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). In agreement with the results of our optical characterization and of the synthetic calcium data, we found that the SNR of calcium signals was independent on the radial distance and that high SNR calcium signals could be recorded across the whole FOV. Moreover, we observed that the correlation between calcium signals of adjacent neurons did not depend on the radial distance, in line with the more homogeneous PSF that characterizes corrected microendoscopes. The correlation between the calcium signals of any pair of neurons displayed, instead, a negative dependence on the distance between the two neurons. This decrease in correlation could reflect a slight change in the laminar position of recorded neurons or suggest a decrease in recurrent connectivity between neurons of the olfactory cortex with distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hagiwara et al., 2012</xref>). In relationship to studies on the olfactory cortex, the improved optical characteristics of corrected microendoscopes increase our ability to understand the properties of this network in several fundamental ways. First, imaging more cells with increased SNR improves our ability to decipher information encoded by neural ensembles in the olfactory cortex. For example, we will be able to characterize the odor response properties of genetically defined subpopulations of olfactory cortex neurons, which may be too sparse to be reliably captured in the smaller effective FOV of uncorrected GRIN lenses. Second, imaging more cells with high SNR in each mouse will allow us to explore differences between individual mice, rather than pooling cells from different animals. Third, less cross-contamination of fluorescence signals improves cell segmentation and motion correction, which are major challenges when imaging mice that are awake or actively engaged in behavioral tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harris et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brondi et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, improved cell segmentation facilitates cell tracking in chronic imaging experiments. Thus, corrected microendoscopes will enhance our ability to monitor individual cells over extended periods of time, for example while mice learn to perform an odor discrimination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berners-Lee et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Alternative methods to correct optical aberrations in GRIN lenses include, for example, low-order adaptive optics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bortoletto et al., 2011</xref>), adaptive optics through pupil segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang and Ji, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>), and geometric transformation adaptive optics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2024</xref>). In the first approach, an adaptive optics module comprising an electrostatic membrane mirror was introduced in the optical path of the 2P microscope and it was shown to significantly improve the microscope PSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bortoletto et al., 2011</xref>). In adaptive optics through pupil segmentation instead, the objective rear lens was divided into N different subsections. By comparing images acquired with light going through each individual pupil segment with images acquired with light going through the whole pupil, local wavefront tilts introduced by aberrations were calculated and corrected for using a spatial light modulator (SLM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ji et al., 2010</xref>). This method was applied to GRIN lens-based endoscopes of larger diameter (i.e. 1.4 mm) compared to the one used in this study (i.e. 0.5 mm) and it was shown to enlarge the effective FOV during 2P imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang and Ji, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>). Finally, in geometric transformation adaptive optics, a 90 degrees rotation was applied to the aberrated beam spatial profile exiting a first GRIN lens and the aberrated beam was passed through a second GRIN lens. This strategy was effective in correcting chromatic and volumetric aberrations in GRIN microendoscopes of small cross section (500 µm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2024</xref>). However, all adaptive optics methods described above require substantial change the optical set-up (e.g. the insertion of an SLM, membrane mirror, and additional optics) and the development of specific software control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bortoletto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang and Ji, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2024</xref>). Additionally, under certain conditions pupil segmentation may limit the acquisition frame rate of the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>). In contrast to the methods described above, the long corrected microendoscopes presented in the current manuscript do not limit the temporal resolution of the acquisition system, require no modification of the hardware and software of the optical set-up, and are easily coupled to any standard 2P microscope. Another advantage of long corrected microendoscopes described here over adaptive optics approaches is the possibility to couple corrected microendoscopes with portable 2P microscopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zong et al., 2022</xref>), allowing high-resolution functional imaging of deep brain circuits on an enlarged FOV during naturalistic behavior in freely moving mice. The corrected microendoscopes presented in this study thus represent a ready-to-use solution, which will likely ease the adoption of aberration correction in GRIN lens-based 2P functional imaging across experimental laboratories.</p><p>In conclusion, we designed, developed, and validated a new series of aberration-corrected GRIN lens-based microendoscopes, which are long enough to reach the most ventral regions of the mouse brain. Long corrected microendoscopes had improved axial resolution and several folds enlarged effective FOV. Importantly, these optical improvements enabled more precise extraction of single cell and population signals from 2P imaging recordings. We validated long corrected microendoscopes by performing functional imaging of the olfactory cortex circuits in awake head-fixed mice. Long corrected microendoscopes provide a unique combination of high and homogenous optical properties across the FOV and minimal invasiveness. Furthermore, they do not require modification of the hardware and software of the optical microscope, providing a ready-to-use solution to experimental laboratories. We foresee that the long corrected microendoscopes developed in this study will drastically improve the yield of 2P imaging in deep brain areas of mice and larger mammals, such as rats (<xref

aberration corrected microendoscopes, we performed ray-trace simulations using OpticStudio 15 (Zemax, Kirkland, WA, US) and integrating the optical model of two commercially available GRIN rods (NEM-050-25-10-860-S-1.5p and NEM-050-25-10-860-S-2.0p, GRIN needle endomicroscopes, GRINTECH Gmbh, Jena, Germany). The wavelength selected for simulations was 920 nm, the commonly used excitation wavelength for 2P imaging of green-emitting fluorescent indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dana et al., 2019</xref>). In simulations, we placed the aspheric lens, whose refractive index corresponded to that of the UV-curable glue we used for microendoscope fabrication (NOA63, see also below), on one side and the back end of the GRIN rod on the other side. 100 µm of BK7 glass were interposed between the corrective lens and the GRIN rod. The profile of the aspheric lens was identified by optimizing a merit function, which took into account the Strehl ratio of focal spots simulated at different field radial distances (up to 200 µm for the 6.4 mm-long and up to 170 µm for the 8.8 mm-long GRIN rod) after being relayed by the optical assembly. During the optimization, the working distance was constrained to values compatible with neurophysiological experiments (~180–220 µm) and the refractive indices simulated at the two ends of the optical assembly were 1 (air) and 1.33–1.36 (brain tissue).

The lens prototypes were finally coated with 200 nm of gold with a sputter coater and inspected with scanning electron microscopy to confirm absence of surface defects.</p><p>To enable fast manufacturing of multiple corrected microendoscopes, we generated replicas of the aspherical lenses using a molding procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schaap and Bellouard, 2013</xref>. We first fabricated negative molds with PDMS (Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer Kit, Dow, Midland, MI, US) casted onto the aspherical lens prototype and solidified at room temperature for 48 hr. We then deposited a small drop of optically transparent UV-curable glue (NOA63, Norland Products, Cranbury, NJ, US) to fill the negative mold. Extreme care was used to avoid bubble formation in this experimental step. We placed a round glass coverslip (coverslip diameter: 3 or 5 mm in diameter; coverslip thickness: 100 µm) on top of the drop of UV-curable glue and pressured it against the PDMS mold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). NOA63 was solidified with UV light exposure for 10 min. After UV curing, the corrective lens was visually inspected at the stereomicroscope. In case of formation of air bubbles, the corrective lens was discarded (yield of the molding procedure: ~90 %, n&gt;30 molded lenses). The coverslip with the attached corrective lens was sealed to a customized metal or plastic support ring of appropriate diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The support ring, the coverslip and the aspherical lens formed the upper part of the corrected microendoscope, to be subsequently coupled to the proper GRIN rod (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, Custom) using a custom-built optomechanical stage and NOA63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonini et al., 2020</xref>). The GRIN rod was positioned perpendicularly to the glass coverslip, on the other side of the coverslip compared to the corrective lens, and aligned to the aspherical lens perimeter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) under the guidance of a wide field microscope equipped with a camera. The yield of the assembly procedure for the probes used in this work was 100% (n=27 endoscopes).

We used a ×20 dry objective (EC Epiplan-Neofluar, NA = 0.5, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and coupled it with the microendoscopes using a custom optomechanical mount similarly to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonini et al., 2020</xref>. The mount was equipped with a micrometric translator to adjust the distance between the objective lens and the upper surface of the corrected microendoscope. We acquired series of z-stacks of different calibration samples (subresolved fluorescent films, subresolved fluorescent beads, calibration rulers, and mouse fixed brain slices) moving the whole mount carrying both the objective and the microendoscope, so that their reciprocal distance remained fixed during the acquisition. For all measurements, the distance between the objective and the upper surface of the coverslip was set to 100 µm for uncorrected microendoscopes and to 150 µm and 180 µm for the 6.4 mm-long and the 8.8 mm-long corrected microendoscopes, respectively. This choice was made taking into account the working distances of simulated corrected probes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). The front end of the GRIN rod was immersed into a drop of distilled water, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for fixed brain slices, which was placed over the calibration sample. Due to the short working distance of the microendoscopes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), we put no coverslip over the samples. For each measurement, experimental replicates were obtained using corrected microendoscopes assembled with distinct optical elements (i.e. different GRIN lenses and different corrective lenses). The uncorrected microendoscopes were assembled either using different optical elements compared to the corrected ones, or were obtained from the corrected probes after the mechanical removal of the corrective lens. The analysis of z-stacks acquired through calibration samples was performed using Imagej/Fiji and custom code written in Matlab (R2022b, MathWorks, Natick, MA, US). In the following paragraphs, we defined ‘nominal’ pixel size as the one determined by imaging a calibration ruler (see below) with the microscope objective alone.</p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Subresolved fluorescent films</title><p>To evaluate the axial extension of the excitation volume for the two types of microendoscopes as a function of the radial distance, we imaged subresolved homogeneous fluorescent layers (thickness: ~300 nm) mounted on a microscope slide. We acquired z-stacks at 256 pixels × 256 pixels resolution (nominal pixel size: 1.73 µm/pixel) with 2 µm axial step and 16 frame averaging. To analyze the axial profile of the imaged film, for each z-stack we generated the mean <italic>x</italic>,<italic>z</italic> intensity projection by averaging 180 evenly distributed sections passing through the center of the FOV of the microendoscope. This <italic>x</italic>,<italic>z</italic> fluorescence intensity projection represents the section of the FOV. From this image, we then extracted the fluorescence intensity profiles along 100 segments evenly distributed across the FOV and orthogonal to the line that is locally tangent to the film profile. We measured the thickness of the average film profile across the FOV as FWHM of Gaussian curves fitting the extracted fluorescence intensity profiles along the segments. Data were binned along the <italic>x</italic> coordinate of the image (bin size: 10 pixels). To set the zero of the <italic>x</italic> coordinate, we fitted the longitudinal intensity profile of the section of the film (along the section of the FOV) to a Gaussian curve and we selected the pixel corresponding to the peak. We finally averaged together binned data obtained from multiple subresolved layer acquisitions using different microendoscopes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Calibration rulers</title><p>To properly calibrate microendoscope images, we used a calibration ruler with ticks spaced every 10 µm along two orthogonal directions (4-dot calibration slide, Cat. No. 1101002300142, Motic, Hong Kong). The ruler was oriented such that the ruler ticks were along the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> directions of the acquired image and the crossing point between the two orthogonal directions of the ruler was positioned at the center of the microendoscope FOV. z-stacks of the ruler were acquired at 512 pixels × 512 pixels resolution (nominal pixel size: 1.06 µm/pixel) with 2 µm axial step and 8 frame averaging. For each z-stack, we generated the maximum intensity projection and identified tick locations as the local maxima of the intensity profiles obtained along two lines drawn along the two ruler directions. We then counted the number of pixels between the identified tick locations and the center of the FOV. Due to the circular symmetry of GRIN lens-based microendoscopes, we averaged together data obtained along the four radii of the ruler. We finally averaged across measurements performed with different microendoscopes. Knowing the average number of pixels in between adjacent ticks in the image and the real distance between adjacent ticks in the sample (10 µm), we could determine, at each tick position, the local pixel size by dividing 10 µm by the mean number of pixels in between two adjacent ticks.</p><p>We observed that corrected microendoscopes had uneven magnification across the FOV (distortion), meaning that the local pixel size is not homogeneous all over the FOV. To characterize the uneven magnification independently of the acquisition setting (pixel size and microscope magnification), we computed the local magnification factor. This quantity was used to calibrate the local pixel size as a function of the radial distance. The local magnification factor was defined as the ratio between the nominal pixel size and the local pixel size obtained as described above. The values of the local magnification factor as a function of the radial distance were fitted with a quartic function <italic>f(x)=ax<sup>4</sup>+bx<sup>2</sup>+c</italic> for each microendoscope type (uncorrected and corrected) and the fitting function was used to calibrate the pixel size of all acquired images (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). For each image acquired using corrected microendoscopes (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we show the scale bar corresponding to the calibrated local pixel size at the center of the FOV. The radial change of pixel size in the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> directions is visualized by a color-coded bar located close to the image and representing the local magnification factor normalized to the magnification factor at the center of the FOV. Additionally, considering the cumulative effect of the local change in the pixel size, we performed a calibration of radial distances longer than 10–20 μm, using the same ruler measurements described above. This calibration was obtained by fitting the nominal radial distances at which we identified the ruler ticks as a function of their real distances (given by the ruler spacing) with a quartic function <italic>g(x)=dx<sup>4</sup>+ex<sup>2</sup>+fx + h,</italic> for each microendoscope type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The fitting function was then used to calculate the real distance among different structures across the FOV.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Subresolved fluorescent beads</title><p>To quantify the extension of the PSF, we imaged subresolved fluorescent beads (FluoSpheres Carboxylate-Modified Microspheres, diameter: 100 nm, Cat. No. F8803, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, US) monodispersed in a thin layer of poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/mL, Cat. No. P2636, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) on a microscope slide. Multiple z-stacks were acquired at 512 pixels x 512 pixels resolution (nominal pixel size: 0.049 µm/pixel) with 0.5 µm axial step and 8 frame averaging. Fluorescent beads were present across the FOV at different nominal radial distances from the optical axis (0–175 µm for corrected probes, 0–75 µm for uncorrected probes). In uncorrected microendoscopes, strong aberrations prevented imaging beads at nominal radial distances &gt;75 µm. To quantify the axial resolution, for each bead we generated the <italic>z</italic>-axis intensity profile using the average value of the fluorescence signal within a ROI encompassing the whole bead perimeter after background subtraction and fitted this profile to either one or two Gaussian curves. For single Gaussian curves, we estimated the axial resolution as FWHM of the curve. In the case of fitting with two Gaussian curves, we computed the axial resolution as the sum of the half width at half maximum of the two Gaussian curves and the distance between their peaks. To quantify the lateral resolution, we generated the <italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic> intensity projections of individual beads and measured the intensity spatial distribution along eight profiles in eight different and equally spaced directions centered on the bead. We fitted each intensity profile to a Gaussian curve and we computed the average value of the FWHM of each curve as the lateral resolution. For each microendoscope type, measurements of axial and lateral resolution performed with multiple microendoscopes on multiple beads for each radial distance were pooled together to compute the mean value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Mouse fixed brain slices</title><p>To prepare brain slices, a deeply anesthetized mouse in which thalamic neurons were expressing jGCaMP7f was transcardially perfused first with PBS and then with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).

Coronal sections (thickness: 50 µm) of the brain were cut using a microtome and kept in anti-freezing medium at –20 ° C. On the day of the experiment, slices were washed three times with PBS for 10 min. One slice at a time was gently placed over a microscope slide and kept wet with drops of PBS along the duration of the experiment. On identified FOV containing neurons expressing the fluorescent indicator, we acquired a z-stack through the slice using a corrected or uncorrected microendoscope (1024 pixels x 1024 pixels resolution; nominal pixel size: 0.45 µm/pixel; axial step: 5 µm; number of axial steps: 23–32; frame averaging = 8).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Generation of synthetic calcium imaging data</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Geometry of simulated neurons</title><p>For all simulated neural data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>), neurons were simulated as spheres with radius randomly sampled from a Gaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation (SD) estimated from the literature to be 10 µm and 3 µm, respectively. A nuclear region, of width randomly sampled from a normal distribution with mean = 5 µm and SD = 1 µm and not expressing the fluorescent indicator, was added at the center of each simulated neuron. Therefore, only the spherical shell surrounding the nucleus generated the fluorescence signal.

The activity of each neuron was then simulated as the sum of an independent Poisson process and as many shared Poisson processes as the number of groups the neuron belonged to. The spike rate of the summed Poisson processes was the same for all neurons (0.3 Hz). These conditions resulted in average pairwise correlations of ground truth calcium activity larger than zero (average correlation 0.041±0.001, n=968130). This correlation value was roughly in the order of average pairwise correlations between neurons experimentally recorded with 2P calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Runyan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Valente et al., 2021</xref>) and was independent of the radial distance.

For corrected microendoscopes, the fifth-order polynomial function fitted to the experimental measurements of subresolved fluorescent films was rotated along the <italic>z</italic>-axis to generate the synthetic imaging focal surface. Moreover, the volume of fluorescence excitation was an ellipsoid resembling the experimentally measured PSF of corrected microendoscopes. For uncorrected microendoscopes, the synthetic imaging surfaces were two spherical shells with curvature radius estimated from the data (curvature radius: 273 μm and 2000 μm for the 6.4 mm-long uncorrected microendoscope and 992 μm and 2000 μm for the 8.8 mm-long uncorrected microendoscope) and the volume of fluorescence excitation was an ellipsoid resembling the experimentally measured PSF of uncorrected microendoscopes.</p><p>Simulated excitation volumes were synthetically scanned along the imaging focal surface (or surfaces), such that their axial direction was always orthogonal to the imaging focal surface(s). Due to the stronger field curvature of the 8.8 mm-long corrected microendoscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) compared to 8.8 mm-long uncorrected microendoscopes, the center of the corrected imaging focal surface resulted at a larger depth in the simulated volume compared to the center of the uncorrected focal surface(s). Therefore, different simulated neurons were sampled in the two cases. We exactly followed methods previously published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonini et al., 2020</xref>. For completeness, the procedure description is repeated here. All voxels within the excitation volumes contributed to the signal of the corresponding pixel in the simulated FOV, as follows:</p><list list-type="bullet" id="list1"><list-item><p>If the pixel was at the FOV edge (radial distance &gt;200 µm and &gt;180 µm for the 6.4 mm-long and the 8.8 mm-long corrected microendoscopes, respectively), its signal was randomly sampled from a normal distribution, with mean and SD estimated from four experimental t-series recorded in vivo with the 8.8 mm-long corrected microendoscope and jGCaMP8f expressed in the mouse piriform cortex (see the paragraph ‘2P microscopy in the mouse olfactory cortex’). The temporal average intensities of pixels in the edges of the microendoscope FOVs, containing dark noise, were used to fit a Gaussian mixture model (component 1: proportion = 0.35; mean = 137.48; SD = 48.96; component 2: proportion = 0.65; mean = 126.83; SD = 5.02). The SD of the dark noise was assumed to depend on the dark noise mean in a linear way, with parameters estimated from the same experimental data (intercept, p<sub>0</sub>=–175.39; linear coefficient, p<sub>1</sub>=1.57).

To evaluate the contamination of pairwise correlation artefactually introduced by the spatial extension of the microendoscope excitation volume in uncorrected or corrected synthetic t-series, we estimated the expected cell pair correlation based on the simulated ground truth calcium activity as described below. We first computed the mean Pearson’s correlation between the activity traces of any possible ground truth source pair for each simulated FOV. For each microendoscope type, we then defined the expected cell pair correlation as the mean Pearson’s correlation of any possible ground truth source pair averaged over different FOV, plus three SD (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> for parameters). In simulated t-series, any cell pair with pairwise correlation above the expected value could not be attributed to correlations between the ground truth calcium activity of source neurons and was expected to arise only because of the source mixing due to finite optical resolution of microendoscopic probes. Thus, we restricted the analysis to cell pairs with pairwise correlation higher than expected. We pooled together pairwise correlation data from FOV obtained for the same microendoscope type and we computed the percentage of detected adjacent cell pairs that had pairwise correlation higher than the expected cell pair correlation for different peak SNR thresholds. Pairwise correlation of adjacent cell pairs that exceeded the expected cell pair correlation threshold was also analyzed as a function of the radial distance of the cell pair, that was defined as the distance between the center of the FOV and the midpoint of the segment connecting the centroids of the two bounding boxes drawn by CITE-ON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sità et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>GLM of the contribution of ground truth source to activity traces</title><p>For each detected ROI of each simulated FOV, we considered the cellular ground truth sources overlapping in the imaging plane with the rectangular bounding box drawn by CITE-ON for at least 1 pixel.

Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane with an induction at 3% and then maintained at 1–2% with an oxygen flow rate of ~1 L/min and head-fixed in a stereotactic frame (David Kopf, Tujunga, CA, US). Mice subcutaneously received buprenorphine slow release (0.05–0.1 mg/kg). Eyes were lubricated with an ophthalmic ointment and body temperature was stabilized using a heating pad attached to a temperature controller. Fur was shaved and the incision site was sterilized with isopropyl alcohol and betadine solution prior to beginning surgical procedures. A 1.0 mm round craniotomy was made using a dental drill centered to the following stereotaxic coordinates (mm): ML, 3.9; AP, 0.3. The virus solution diluted 1/3 in PBS was injected at speed 100 nL/min in three different spots (total injected volume: 1 μL) using the following coordinates (mm) to target olfactory cortex (ML/AP/DV): 3.85/0.6/–3.8, 3.95/0.3/–3.9, 4.05/0.0/–4.0, all relative to bregma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paxinos and Franklin, 2012</xref>). After 5 min, the micropipette was slowly retracted from the brain at a speed of 500 μm/min. 30 min after viral injections, a corrected microendoscope was implanted above the olfactory cortex. The probe was implanted, centered to the craniotomy, at a speed of 100 μm/min until reaching the following coordinate: DV, –3.6. Once placed, the plastic ring of the endoscopic probe was fixed to the skull with Metabond adhesive cement (Parkell Inc, Edgewood, NY, US). A custom-made aluminum head bar was then attached to the skull using dental cement (Pi-ku-plast HP 36 Precision Pattern Resin, XPdent, Miami, FL, US). Finally, a protective cap made of Kwik-Sil silicone elastomer (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, US) was applied over the lens. Mice were allowed to recover from surgery for at least 6 weeks prior to imaging experiments. The criterion for inclusion of animal subjects in the study was based on the quality of the surgical implant, that is absence of blood and presence of &gt;30 detectable cells in the maximally enlarged aberration corrected FOV of the microendoscope. Based on this criterion, six out of eight mice were used for subsequent experiments (average number of cells/FOV ± SD: 40±6, n=6 animals).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Odor delivery</title><p>Animals were habituated to the experimenter and the head-fixation set-up for 30 min per day for at least two days before performing the imaging experiment.

The olfactometer solenoids were triggered by a Teensy 3.6 (PJRC). Vacuum was applied inside the 2P microscope isolation box to evacuate residual odor. For all experimental sessions, mice were habituated to the 2P microscope head-fixation set-up for 10 min prior to imaging. An odor trial lasted 22 s (5 s of pre-stimulus baseline, 2 ss of stimulation, 15 s of post-stimulus acquisition) with inter-trial intervals of 10 s. Odor stimuli were presented in pseudo-randomized fashion and 8 presentations of each odor were performed in a session. The odor panel consisted of (diluted in mineral oil v/v): acetophenone 1%, amylamine 1%, butyl acetate 1%, ethyl hexanoate 1%, 2-Isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine 1%, β-Ionone 1%, 2,3-Pentanedione 0.1%, Valeric acid 0.1%.

Approximately 90–150 mW of laser power (at 920 nm, from Chameleon Discovery laser source [Coherent Inc, Santa Clara, CA, US]) was used during imaging, with adjustments in power levels to accommodate varying signals for each mouse. After focusing on the corrective lens surface using epifluorescence microscopy, optical viewing was switched to live view through the 2P laser, and a FOV was located by moving the objective ∼100–200 μm upward. Images were acquired with a Nikon ×10 Plan Apochromat Lambda objective (0.45 NA, 4.0 mm WD) using a nominal pixel size of 0.72–0.84 µm/pixel. jGCaMP8f or jGCaMP7f signals were filtered through an ET-GFP (FITC/CY2) filter set.

This paper closely follows the thread of earlier work from the same group (esp.

The authors propose to mitigate these aberrations by designing and fabricating aspherical corrective lenses using ray trace simulations and two-photon lithography, respectively; the corrective lenses are then mounted on the back aperture of the GRIN lens.</p><p>This approach was previously demonstrated by the same lab for GRIN lenses shorter than 4.1 mm (Antonini et al., eLife, 2020). In the current work, the authors extend their method to a new class of GRIN lenses with lengths exceeding 6 mm, enabling access to deeper brain regions as most ventral region of the mouse brain. Specifically, they designed and characterized corrective lenses for GRIN lenses measuring 6.4 mm and 8.8 mm in length. Finally, they applied these corrected long micro-endoscopes to perform high-precision calcium signal recordings in the olfactory cortex.</p><p>Compared with alternative approaches using adaptive optics, the main strength of this method is that it does not require hardware or software modifications, nor does it limit the system's temporal resolution. The manuscript is well-written, the data are clearly presented, and the experiments convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the corrective lenses.</p><p>The implementation of these long corrected micro-endoscopes, demonstrated here for deep imaging in the mouse olfactory bulb, will also enable deep imaging in larger mammals such as rats or marmosets.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have clearly addressed all my comments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101420.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This work presents the development, characterization and use of new thin microendoscopes (500µm diameter) whose accessible field of view has been extended by the addition of a corrective optical element glued to the entrance face. Two microendoscopes of different lengths (6.4mm and 8.8mm) have been developed, allowing imaging of neuronal activity in brain regions &gt;4mm deep. An alternative solution to increase the field of view could be to add an adaptive optics loop to the microscope to correct the aberrations of the GRIN lens. The solution presented in this paper does not require any modification of the optical microscope and can therefore be easily accessible to any neuroscience laboratory performing optical imaging of neuronal activity.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The paper is generally clear and well written. The scientific approach is well structured, and numerous experiments and simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of corrected microendoscopes. In particular, we can highlight several consistent and convincing pieces of evidence for the improved performance of corrected microendoscopes:</p><p>- PSFs measured with corrected microendoscopes 75µm from the centre of the FOV show a significant reduction in optical aberrations compared to PSFs measured with uncorrected microendoscopes.</p><p>- Morphological imaging of fixed brain slices shows that optical resolution is maintained over a larger field of view with corrected microendoscopes compared to uncorrected ones, allowing neuronal processes to be revealed even close to the edge of the FOV.</p><p>- Using synthetic calcium data, the authors showed that the signals obtained with the corrected microendoscopes have a significantly stronger correlation with the ground truth signals than those obtained with uncorrected microendoscopes.</p><p>(2) There is a strong need for high quality microendoscopes to image deep brain regions in vivo. The solution proposed by the authors is simple, efficient and potentially easy to disseminate within the neuroscience community.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Weaknesses that were present in the first
