ICC along the submucosal border (ICC-SM) contribute to mixing and more complex patterns of colonic motility. We show the complex patterns of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in ICC-SM and the relationship between ICC-SM Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and activation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) using optogenetic tools. ICC-SM displayed rhythmic firing of Ca<sup>2+</sup>transients ~ 15 cpm and paced adjacent SMCs. The majority of spontaneous activity occurred in regular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients clusters (CTCs) that propagated through the network. CTCs were organized and dependent upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductances, L- and T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the external solution abolished CTCs. Ca<sup>2+</sup> release mechanisms reduced the duration and amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients but did not block CTCs. These data reveal how colonic pacemaker ICC-SM exhibit complex Ca<sup>2+-</sup>firing patterns and drive smooth muscle activity and overall colonic contractions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pacemaker</kwd><kwd>slow waves</kwd><kwd>ca2+ entry</kwd><kwd>ca2+-induced ca2+ release</kwd><kwd>gi motility</kwd><kwd>ca2+ signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK-120759</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>Salah A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanders</surname><given-names>Kenton M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK-078736</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cobine</surname><given-names>Caroline A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An optogenetic dual-color Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging approach shows how submucosal pacemaker-cells, interstitial cells of Cajal, modulate smooth-muscle responses and drive colonic motility via complex Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) serve several important functions in the gastrointestinal tract, including generation of pacemaker activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Langton et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ward et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huizinga et al., 1995</xref>), neurotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burns et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ward et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sanders et al., 2010</xref>), and responses to stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Won et al., 2005</xref>).

While these experiments were strongly indicative of the obligatory role of ICC as pacemakers in GI smooth muscles and essential role in normal electrical and contractile patterns, no experiments to date have measured pacemaker activity in ICC and responses of SMCs in terms of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and contraction simultaneously.</p><p>The anatomy and distribution of ICC varies from place to place throughout the GI tract. Some areas have only an intramuscular type of ICC (ICC-IM) that are closely aligned with and transduce inputs from excitatory and inhibitory enteric motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burns et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckett et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lies et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sanders et al., 2014b</xref>). Other regions contain ICC-IM and pacemaker types of ICC, that exist as a network in the myenteric plexus region of most areas of the gut (ICC-MY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rumessen and Thuneberg, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Faussone-Pellegrini, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Komuro et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burns et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Komuro, 1999</xref>). The colon is more complex in that there are at least four types of ICC, distinguished by their anatomical locations and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ishikawa and Komuro, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vanderwinden et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vanderwinden et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rumessen et al., 2013</xref>). One class of colonic ICC lies along the submucosal surface of the circular muscle (CM) layer (ICC-SM). These cells are known to provide pacemaker activity in colonic muscles, and their activity is integrated with a second frequency of pacemaker activity generated by ICC-MY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smith et al., 1987a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Smith et al., 1987b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Durdle et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huizinga et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yoneda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Plujà et al., 2001</xref>). Pacemaker activities generated by ICC-SM and ICC-MY cause depolarization of SMCs, generation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> action potentials, and excitation-contraction coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yoneda et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>ICC-SM generate slow waves in the canine colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smith et al., 1987a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berezin et al., 1988</xref>). These are large amplitude and long-duration events that produce phasic contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Keef et al., 1992</xref>). The integrity of the ICC-SM network is required for regenerative propagation of slow waves, and disruption of the network causes passive decay of slow waves within a few millimeters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanders et al., 1990</xref>). Electrical coupling of ICC-SM in a network is an important feature allowing the pacemaker activity to coordinate the electrical activation of SMCs. ICC-SM in proximal colons of rodents also display pacemaker function; however, the frequency of the slow waves is higher (10–22 min<sup>−1</sup>, mean 14.8. min<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yoneda et al., 2002</xref>). Slow waves, in this region of the GI tract, consist of a rapid upstroke phase, 148 mVs<sup>−1</sup>, that settles to a plateau phase lasting approximately 2 s. The slow waves are coupled to low-amplitude CM contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yoneda et al., 2004</xref>). Colonic slow waves have been reported to depend upon both Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release mechanisms; however, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in colonic pacemaker cells and the coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events to the electrical responses were not clarified.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that all classes of ICC in the GI tract express Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels encoded by <italic>Ano1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomez-Pinilla et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hwang et al., 2009</xref>). This conductance is required for slow wave activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hwang et al., 2009</xref>), and therefore Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in ICC are of fundamental importance in understanding pacemaker activity and electrical and mechanical rhythmicity in GI muscles. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC-SM are linked to mechanical activation of the CM and that propagation of activity in ICC-SM is related to and controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductances. Experiments were performed on tissues containing ICC-SM taken from mice with cell-specific expression of GCaMP6f in ICC, and changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> were monitored by confocal microscopy and digital video imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ICC-SM distribution within the submucosal plexus</title><p>We optimized a preparation in which the submucosal layer was separated from the <italic>tunica muscularis</italic>.

K<sub>ATP</sub> is functional in colonic SMCs but not in ICC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang et al., 2018</xref>).

Pinacidil produces hyperpolarization of SMCs via activation of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koh et al., 1998</xref>) and the hyperpolarization is expected to conduct to ICC, as they are electrically coupled.

In some regards, these results were surprising as membrane potential hyperpolarization might reduce contributions from L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Ca<sub>V</sub> 1.2). One explanation is that Ca<sub>V</sub> 1.3, which are abundant in ICC-SM and activate at more negative potentials than Ca<sub>V</sub> 1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xu and Lipscombe, 2001</xref>) may contribute to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry at more hyperpolarized potentials.

The sequence of activation from ICC-SM to colonic SMCs was quantified using two optogenetic sensors, expressed specifically in ICC or SMCs. Correlation analysis demonstrated a 1:1 relationship between CTCs in ICC-SM and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and contractile responses in SMCs. The CTCs in ICC-SM consisted of ~2 s bursts of activity from multiple sites within cells. Organization of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients into clusters was due to voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry that appeared to be due to activation of both high-voltage activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (L-type encoded by <italic>Cacna1c</italic> and <italic>Cacna1d</italic> in ICC-SM) and low-voltage activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (T-type encoded by <italic>Cacna1h</italic> and possibly <italic>Cacna1g</italic> in ICC-SM). A portion of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients making up CTCs were due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, as the earliest Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients resolved in a cluster were not blocked by thapsigargin, CPA or antagonists of ryanodine and IP<sub>3</sub> receptors. The earliest events were blocked by nicardipine, suggesting that L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are the dominant Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry pathway at basal resting potentials. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC-SM were not as sensitive to block by STIM and Orai, as in other ICC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drumm et al., 2019a</xref>), However, the Orai antagonist reduced the frequency of CTCs and may have blocked these events completely with longer treatment periods. Our data show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is fundamental in ICC-SM Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. In fact, localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via clusters of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels may cause localized elevation in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and activation of ANO1 channels directly. Localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry events through L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels have been termed Ca<sup>2+</sup>sparklets, and these events could be involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Santana et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sonkusare et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Navedo and Amberg, 2013a</xref>) and initiation of pacemaker activity in ICC-SM. However, the decrease in the frequency of CTCs by manipulations to reduce stored Ca<sup>2+</sup> also suggest an important role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in pacemaker activity, perhaps resulting from coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and CICR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Navedo and Santana, 2013b</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we developed a new preparation in which ICC-SM adherent to the submucosa was used to allow very high-resolution imaging without complications from muscular contractions. In situ preparations of this type in which the natural structure and connectivity between ICC are maintained may be valuable for future studies of cellular mechanisms responsible for pacemaker activity and factors that regulate or degrade pacemaker activity in pathophysiological conditions.</p><p>The pacemaker function of ICC-SM was demonstrated in a novel manner by simultaneous two-color optogenetic imaging with green (GCaMP6f) and red (RCaMP1.07) Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors expressed in ICC and SMCs, respectively. Imaging in this manner revealed the sequence of activation in ICC-SM and SMCs, showing clearly the frequency, onset and duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC-SM, the spatial spread of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC-SM networks, the development of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in SMCs and tissue displacement (i.e. an optical indicator of muscle contraction). Correlation analysis demonstrated the coherence of these events. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, lasting for about 2 s, propagated without decrement through networks of ICC-SM and preceded and likely initiated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and contractions in SMC, as was also suggested by intracellular microelectrode recordings from cells along the innermost surface of canine colonic muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanders et al., 1990</xref>). ICC-SM are electrically coupled to each other and the network of ICC-SM is coupled to SMCs via gap junctions, providing a means of electrical communication. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients initiate depolarization of ICC-SM via activation of ANO1 channels, depolarizing currents conduct to SMCs, and depolarization of SMCs activates Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, by increasing the open probability of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and excitation-contraction coupling. Depolarizing signals from multiple ICC-SM influence the excitability of SMC, and the overall depolarization driving SMCs results from the summation of activity from the ICC-SM network.</p><p>Slow waves with characteristics similar to those found in the stomach and small intestine (i.e. relatively fast upstroke depolarization and a plateau phase) are generated along the submucosal surface of the CM layer in the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smith et al., 1987a</xref>). It was discovered that peeling the submucosa from the innermost surface of CM blocked slow waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Durdle et al., 1983</xref>). While the authors of that study thought this tissue was mostly connective tissue with possibly some adherent SMCs, it became clear that a population of pacemaker cells, ICC-SM, are present along the submucosal surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berezin et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ward et al., 1991</xref>). In the present study, we found that ICC-SM and the networks they form are preserved and remain functionally similar in isolated submucosal tissues to ICC-SM attached to the muscularis. It should be noted that ICC-SM were more adherent to CM in the distal colon, and it was more difficult to obtain ICC-SM/submucosal preparations from that region. Submucosal tissues with adherent ICC-SM were used in the current study to eliminate movement artifacts generated by muscle contractions that plague high-resolution Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in most smooth muscle tissues.</p><p>While the frequency of pacemaker activity was relatively stable over time in a given preparation, the sequence of activation of individual ICC-SM within the network varied as a function of time, as previously observed in gastric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hennig et al., 2004</xref>) and small intestinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Park et al., 2006</xref>) ICC-MY networks. What appeared as global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in low resolution imaging partitioned into clusters of localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients when viewed with a ×60 objective at 30 frames/s or at higher acquisition speeds. Summation of the clustered events reproduced the frequency and duration of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves observed at low resolution. Multiple firing sites, averaging ~8 per cell, were identified. This pattern of clustered Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (CTCs) was also observed in ICC-MY of the small intestine, the pacemaker cells in that region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drumm et al., 2017</xref>). Organization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients into clusters in ICC-SM was dependent upon voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, and our data revealed that in contrast to ICC-MY of the small intestine, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry by both dihydropyridine-sensitive and insensitive mechanisms contributes to clustering and propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves in intact networks. Nicardipine and isradipine reduced the occurrence of CTCs dramatically, and the T-channel antagonists, NNC 55–0396, TTA-A2, and Z-944 also reduced the occurrence and disordered the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. <italic>Cacna1c</italic>, <italic>Cacna1d</italic>, and <italic>Cacna1h</italic> were expressed in purified ICC-SM, and the presence and function of these channels can explain the pharmacological observations. Channels resulting from <italic>Cacna1d</italic> (encoding Ca<sub>V</sub>α1D) activate at relatively hyperpolarized membrane potentials and their currents are partially inhibited by dihydropyridines (~50–70% of current density block) in comparison to <italic>Cacna1c</italic> gene products (Ca<sub>V</sub>α1C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xu and Lipscombe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell et al., 2001</xref>), but isradipine blocks Ca<sub>V</sub>α1C and Ca<sub>V</sub>α1D equally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anekonda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berjukow et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scholze et al., 2001</xref>). The fact that isradipine had no greater effect on the occurrence of clustered Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients than nicardipine suggests that the L-type component of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry may be carried primarily by Ca<sub>V</sub>α1C channels. We have observed relatively robust expression of <italic>Cacna1d</italic> in a variety of ICC in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drumm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2017</xref>); however, the function of these channels has not been identified specifically.</p><p>Having three independent voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductances with different voltage-dependent properties coordinate clustering of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients provides a safety factor for preservation of pacemaker activity over a broad range of membrane potentials. In spite of overarching changes in membrane potential that might influence the availability of ion channels with narrow voltage-ranges, the broader range of activation potentials offered by expression and function of both L-type and T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels might protect against voltage-dependent inhibition of pacemaker activity. L-type channels are activated at less polarized potentials than T-type channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nowycky et al., 1985</xref>). Thus, a factor producing tonic hyperpolarization of the SIP syncytium (e.g. purinergic inhibitory neurotransmission; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gallego et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hwang et al., 2012</xref>) may tend to switch the dominant voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry mechanism from L-type to T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. This concept was demonstrated by the decreased inhibitory effects of nicardipine and increased effects of NNC 55–0396 on Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients after exposure of tissues to pinacidil. The opposite might be true if the SIP syncytium experiences a depolarizing influence (e.g. neurogenic or humerogenic).</p><p>Pinacidil hyperpolarizes colonic muscles through activation of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koh et al., 1998</xref>). This compound increased the frequency and decreased the duration of CTCs. These results are consistent with the effects of pinacidil on electrical pacemaker activity in the small intestine where it increases the d<italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> of the upstroke depolarization and decreases the duration of slow waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kito et al., 2005</xref>). The increase in frequency may have been due to reduced inactivation and increased availability of Ca<sub>V</sub>α1D and T-type channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>α1H) at more hyperpolarized potentials. The decrease in the duration of CTCs may be due to a relative shift in the importance of T-type vs. L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with hyperpolarization. In the presence of pinacidil, NNC 55–0396 had increased antagonistic effects on CTCs. Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents via T-type channels inactivate rapidly, whereas L-type channel inactivation is slower and incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hirano et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tseng and Boyden, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xu and Best, 1992</xref>). Thus, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry period for T-type currents is likely to be more transient than with L-type currents. Channel density in proximity to Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels may also affect the degree of coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and CICR, but, as yet, little is known about the structure and functional components of microdomains in ICC.</p><p>The importance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry as the primary means of activation and organization of pacemaker activity in ICC-SM was shown by the discoordination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients when extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was decreased and the incomplete effects of thapsigargin and CPA on Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. We noted tight clustering of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at 2.5 and 2.0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> but the tightness of the CTCs disassociated when the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (i.e. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> was reduced to 1 mM), and frequency of CTCs was greatly reduced at concentrations lower than 1 mM. Our concept is that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry couples to CICR in ICC. Reducing the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry would be expected to reduce the probability for effective coupling to CICR. CICR would be negligible when Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry falls below threshold levels. Concentrations of thapsigargin and CPA that blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients quantitatively in other ICC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drumm et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drumm et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drumm et al., 2017</xref>) caused a partial block of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC-SM. In fact, these drugs caused a marked narrowing of the duration of the CTCs, and this led us to analyze the temporal characteristics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients within clusters. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at the beginning of the CTCs were unaffected by ryanodine and xestospongin C, but transients toward the end of the clusters were blocked. These data suggest that the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients may result primarily from Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, and CTCs are sustained by Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. This concept is also supported by previous studies showing inhibition of slow waves by blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (L-type and T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drumm et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We have searched for a preparation of pacemaker ICC that would allow us to investigate the underlying pacemaker activity. We have speculated that stochastic Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events, occurring in all ICC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sanders et al., 2014a</xref>), are responsible for the spontaneous transient depolarizations (STDs) observed in patch clamp recordings from isolated ICC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). No simultaneous recordings of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and membrane currents or potentials changes have been achieved yet, and the expected link between Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and STDs is based on the fact that these events have common pharmacology and sensitivity to drugs that interfere with Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and the spontaneous transient inward currents (STICs) due to activation of ANO1 channels result in spontaneous transient membrane depolarizations (STDs). Temporal summation of STDs is likely to be the generator potentials that activate T-type or L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and initiate propagating slow wave events. In this concept it is logical to suggest that inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release should reduce the duration of the CTCs, and inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry should inhibit the organizing influence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and block CTCs. When CTCs are blocked, stochastic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients may be unleashed, as occur in ICC-IM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drumm et al., 2019a</xref>) and ICC-DMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2016</xref>) that lack expression of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry mechanisms. Block of CTCs and unmasking of stochastic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients was accomplished by hyperpolarization with pinacidil and reduction in the availability of L-type and T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with nicardipine and NNC 55–0396. ICC-SM, as imaged in the current experiments provide a potent model for investigating basic pacemaker mechanisms and what happens to these events in response to neurotransmission, hormonal and paracrine inputs and pathological or inflammatory conditions.</p><p>Previous studies have supported a role for store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) in maintaining Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events in ICC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drumm et al., 2019a</xref>). This is logical because Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is extremely dynamic in ICC, and it is likely that Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores would be depleted without an effective recovery mechanism. SOCE depends upon the expression of Orai channels and the ER delimited activator of Orai, STIM, that senses ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> and binds to and activates Orai channels when Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion of the ER occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Butorac et al., 2020</xref>). STIM and Orai are expressed in colonic ICC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). However, an antagonist of Orai, GSK7975A, reduced the frequency of CTCs, but failed to block these events at a concentration effective in blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in small intestinal ICC-MY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). STIM/Orai interactions appear to have a role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> store maintenance in ICC-SM, but our data suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via L-type and T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels also provide Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry mechanisms that may contribute to store refilling. It could also be suggested that GSK7975A, a well-known antagonist for Orai1 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 4 μM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Derler et al., 2013</xref>), is less effective on Orai2, the dominant isoform expressed in ICC-SM. However, studies on cortical neurons that express only Orai2 showed about 50% block of SOCE by GSK7975A (5 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chauvet et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In summary ICC-SM, as suggested from dissection and electrophysiological experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smith et al., 1987a</xref>), are pacemaker cells distributed in an electrically coupled network along the submucosal surface of the CM layer. Our experiments demonstrate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC-SM couple to activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and contractions in neighboring SMCs. The contractile events, called ‘ripples’ by some authors in describing integrated colonic contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corsetti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">D'Antona et al., 2001</xref>), summate with the larger amplitude contractions emanating from the myenteric region of the <italic>tunica muscularis</italic> to produce mixing and propagated movements characteristic of colonic motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rosli et al., 2020</xref>). Data from this study suggest that voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry serves at least four important functions in the pacemaker activity of ICC-SM: (i) Propagation of activity within the ICC-SM network depends upon voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, and the functions and voltage-dependent properties of three types of Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductances appear to provide a safety factor that tends to preserve pacemaker activity over a broad range of membrane potentials (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15s1">Figure 15—figure supplement 1</xref>). (ii) Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is the mechanism that organizes Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events into CTCs. These events constitute the Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves that propagate through ICC-SM networks, and cause slow wave depolarizations by activation of ANO1 channels. (iii) Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry also appears to contribute to refilling of stores, as pacemaker activity was not as immediately dependent upon SOCE as in other ICC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drumm et al., 2019a</xref>). (iv) The observations that treatments expected to reduce Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from stores and reduce coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and CICR reduced, but did not block CTCs, may indicate that transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (sparklets), possibly through activation of ANO1 channels and depolarization, may underlie the pacemaker functions of ICC-SM. Additional studies will be necessary to resolve these hypotheses in finer detail. The preparation of excised submucosal tissue with adherent ICC-SM removes movement artifacts from imaging and is likely to provide a powerful tool for improving resolution of pacemaker mechanisms and determining how regulatory and pathophysiological factors affect basic pacemaker mechanisms.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig15" position="float"><label>Figure 15.</label><caption><title>Role of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in the pacemaker function of submucosal interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC-SM).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Shows segments of plasma membrane (PM) and endoplasmic reticulum membrane (ER) that form PM-ER junctions and microdomains. At least three types of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VDCC) are expressed in ICC-SM, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3, and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2. These conductances, with voltage-dependent activation and inactivation properties spanning a broad range of negative potentials, insure maintenance of pacemaker activity under conditions of hyperpolarization or depolarization in ICC-SM. Pacemaker activity (1. Initial events) in ICC-SM could be due to spontaneous release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from stores in the ER and utilize either IP<sub>3</sub>R or RYR receptors or both (Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks and puffs). However, our data cannot rule out the possibility that transient openings of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (sparklets) and amplification of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in microdomains by CICR constitute the initial events of pacemaker activity. In this case, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from stores is not the primary pacemaker event but a secondary response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from stores would lead to reduced probability of CICR and decrease the frequency of CTCs. Our hypothesis is that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and/or release from stores activates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current due to ANO1 channels in the plasma membrane. Active propagation between cells in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) networks (Phase 2) was inhibited by blocking voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Active propagation may also require or depend upon amplification of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in microdomains by CICR. The duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is likely to be brief due to voltage-dependent inactivation of L- and T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The duration of CTCs appears to be enhanced by CICR (Phase 3). Our data show that the duration of CTCs is reduced by several manipulations known to inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from stores. In Phase four store reloading may occur by multiple mechanisms and may include: (i) transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via sparklets, (ii) activation of SOCE via STIM/ORAI interactions, and (iii) the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry that occurs via depolarization and activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry at the onset of each CTC. (<bold>B</bold>) A novel hypothesis emerges from this study suggesting that the pacemaker mechanism in non-voltage-clamped cells includes a cyclical, positive-feedback phenomenon that may be responsible for initiation of CTCs and relies on: (i) Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Openings of clusters of these channels would generate sparklets; (ii) Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry initiates CICR which amplifies [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> within microdomains; (iii) the rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> activates ANO1 channels in the PM causing depolarization; (iv) depolarization enhances the open probability of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. This cycle creates positive feedback for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, clustering of localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry during the first 350–450 ms of CTCs and development of slow wave depolarizations in ICC-SM.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64099-fig15-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig15s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 15—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic showing how Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the pacemaker function of submucosal interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) is coupled to smooth muscle cells (SMCs).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64099-fig15-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- c-Kit (Goat polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">R and D Systems</td><td valign="top">Cat# AF1356, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_354750">AB_354750</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa-488 (donkey anti-goat IgG)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen/ <break/>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">(Cat# A32814, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2762838">AB_2762838</ext-link>)</td><td valign="top">IHC (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top"><italic>Kit, Ano1, Myh11,Uchl1, Cacna1c</italic> <break/><italic>Cacna1d, Cacna1g</italic> <break/><italic>Cacna1h</italic> <break/><italic>Orai1,Orai Orai3</italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">PCR primers</td><td valign="top">Suppl.

While much of the investigation uses techniques and tools used to previously by the authors study Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in ICC in other regions of the gut (small intestine), they have refined the colonic tissue preparation to remove motion artifacts and have used dual Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator mice to better understand how ICC-SM influence smooth muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and contraction. Overall, this solid study has used a comprehensive battery of drugs that interfere with Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling to demonstrate that extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is a particularly important component of pacemaker activity in ICC-SM.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) Paradoxically, firing failure usually causes subsequent pacemaker events to release more Ca<sup>2+</sup> (amplitude/duration), and are likely to result in stronger/more complete activation of the SM. In terms of motility, it is possible (and likely) that &quot;stronger&quot; pacing at half control frequency may impart more useful force to contents and potentially improve motility. As the authors are well aware, this may be the default situation in the stomach (2pacemaker:1contraction). An analysis of a number of common parameters (amplitude, duration, upstroke velocity) performed on each observable event (rather than on all the events in the recording period) would be important to better assess the effects of the drugs used.</p><p>2) Interestingly, the authors show a different aspect of the &quot;recovery&quot; effect on the coordination of intracellular release site firing – which is somewhat unexpected, and important. Decreasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> began to cause instabilities in the coordination/synchronization in site firing at 1mM while maintaining a frequency close to that observed at 2.5mM. At 0.5mM, firing failure occurred, but in the examples where firing occurred, it was the most synchronous / coordinated observed in the entire experiment. This, again, could indicate that lengthening the duration of &quot;recovery&quot; after a pacemaker event is one of the major factors determining the coordination of both intracellular (site) firing, and by extension, intracellular (network) activity. In contrast to the author's conclusions, this process does not appear to be that dependent on extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and needs to be commented on. In addition, lowering calcium will also affect membrane surface charge, which in itself will affect the electrical field experience by voltage-dependent ion channels.</p><p>3) The spatial segmentation of dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> data into PTCLs based on &quot;first&quot; event seems arbitrary, as the degree to which Ca<sup>2+</sup> spreads from the position of the &quot;first&quot; event appears to be quite variable. The image illustrating individual sites appears to be hand-drawn. If site demarcation was somewhat arbitrary, this should be clarified.</p><p>4) The cell density value reported (95 cells per mm2) seems low by an order of magnitude. If the quoted average minimum separation distance is 30µm, one would expect 33 cells across a 1mm in 1D. Using the same separation distance, in 2D, one would expect 33 cells x 33 cells = ~1000 cells per square mm.</p><p>5) While a correlation exists between the ICC-SM Ca<sup>2+</sup> events, smooth muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> events and resultant micromotion (Figure 2) in general terms, the traces shown in Figure 2E do not show a 1:1 correlation of the event waveforms. While some variability is expected between micromotions and fluorescence signals due to unknown dynamic/static stress and strain in the gut wall, one would expect the Ca<sup>2+</sup> event waveforms in ICC-SM and SM to be more correlated given the tight electrical coupling via gap junctions. While all the presented Ca<sup>2+</sup> events are biphasic in nature, the first event ICC-SM shows a clear separation between the 2 peaks. The time between the 2 peaks appears sufficient to allow for re-stimulation the SM (~1s), given the fluorescence has returned 80-90% back to baseline – yet there is no inflection or change in slope in the SM Ca<sup>2+</sup> event. The authors should comment on this disparity and qualify under which conditions (frequency/amplitude/? range) the correlation holds true using cross-correlation analysis. Differentiation and distortion vectors would also better locate contraction epicenters in videos and differentiation of traces would provide a more reliable landmark (max dI/dT) to compare time delays.</p><p>6) The stomach and small intestine generate slow waves in the outermost ICC layer (myenteric layer: ICC-MY) that co-activates circular and longitudinal muscle layers. Activation of colonic CM from submucosal ICC layer prevents slow waves from directly co-activating longitudinal SM, and this is evident in more independent and varied longitudinal motions (tenia coli tone, greater neural control). The role of colonic ICC-MY is more confusing but appears to synchronize activity in certain conditions, which has been proposed to change the excitability of CM and possibly other layers in the gut wall. As such, without knowing the output from colonic ICC-MY, attempts to correlate CM activity to ICC-SM activity may be highly variable and unreliable. A comment on this would be helpful.</p><p>7) The conclusion that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels is vital to the generation of pacemaker activity is valid with regard to network activity, but the effect on intracellular release sites seems less clear. In Figure 9 A, there are 8-9 well defined &quot;hot spots&quot; demarcated by their white/red color (denoting how long the site was active). The cytoplasm surrounding these hotspots shows a lower occurrence of activity, consistent with an occasional propagating intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave. Interestingly, all of the main hotspots remained after nicardipine, albeit firing at a much lower frequency. Wouldn't this suggest that release sites are not intrinsically dependent on L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and that the L-Type channels are more involved in facilitating spread of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through the cytoplasm?</p><p>8) Have the authors used an L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel opener (BayK8644) on the ICC-SM preparation? This would yield important information regarding the role of channel inactivation/&quot;recovery&quot; and the importance of entrainment and limiting ectopic activity on the formation of coherent pacemaker activity.</p><p>9) Wouldn't large effect of NNC after nicardipine (Figure 12) suggest that T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel entry is equally important is L-type entry. The frequency of control activity prior to the addition of NNC (Figure 10) was quite high and is likely to have predisposed cells to firing failure to a much larger degree as slower control frequencies.</p><p>10) Raw data ± SE was presented in the both the text and in graphical form, particularly when presenting % data. The text in the Results section or the latter parts of many figures could be reduced considerably and easier to read/ view without the repetition. This would considerably raise the impact of the work.</p><p>11) The results of Pinacidil alone (Figure 11) could easily be removed as they didn't reach significance; at the very least, moved to the supplementary section.</p><p>12) The effects of pinacidil on Ca channel blockers could perhaps be best illustrated by plotting the red and blue bars in Figure 11 with the normalized results in Figures 9 and 10 to illustrate any effect. “Tendency” statements that should be removed include: “Pinacidil showed a tendency toward increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient firing, but this effect did not reach statistical significance” and “Reduction in the duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients was associated with a tendency for an increase in frequency, but this parameter did not reach significance”</p><p>13) The Xestospongin modulation of the Ca store signalling in ICC-SM is not significant and probably doesn't require illustration or it should be moved to the supplementary data section.</p><p>14) The qPCR analyses provide evidence for message for those two channels and the use of three different pharmacological inhibitors (for Cav3) with similar effects (Figure 10, Figure 10—figure supplement 2) support their functional expression. However, can the authors rule out the possibility that NNC 55-0396, TTA-A2 and Z-944 are producing their respective effects on calcium transients by partial inhibition of L-type channels? e.g., does a lower concentration of nicardipine produce similar effects to those agents?</p><p>15) Pinacidil was used to activate KATP channels in the muscle layer, when it remained connected to the ICC-SM layer; this presumably(?) led to hyperpolarization of the ICC layer due to electrical coupling between the layers. Is that correct? (If so that assumption was not clearly stated). The differential effects of the calcium channel inhibitors before and after PIN were then used as evidence that voltage-activated calcium channels with more negative thresholds played a role when PIN was used. But shouldn't the effects of isradipine also have been tested in the presence of PIN in order to make conclusions about the contribution of Cav1.3 channels? Supporting electrophysiology data showing the extent of PIN-induced hyperpolarization in ICC-SM cells would aid in interpretation of these data.</p><p>16) The authors state that ICC in general do not express KATP channels, but wasn't that analysis made for another type of ICC (ICC-MY?)? If that is so, they should check for Kir6 and SUR expression in these purified ICC-SM cells.</p><p>17) Previous studies of ICC-SM in mouse have used 0.01 – 1 μm nifedipine (Yoneda et al., 2002; 2003) and Ni2+ to dissect out contributions of L-and T- type channels to the initial and plateau phases of the slow waves in these cells. That data should be discussed at least to some extent. Do the authors think that the pattern of calcium events (fast and transient vs prolonged) correspond to the initial and sustained phases of the slow waves measured in previous studies, in which it was concluded that T- and L-type calcium channels respectively contributed?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64099.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) Paradoxically, firing failure usually causes subsequent pacemaker events to release more Ca<sup>2+</sup> (amplitude/duration), and are likely to result in stronger/more complete activation of the SM.

This analysis is based on temporal characteristics to define firing sites. The number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> firing events is enormous and variable cycle-to-cycle, as firing sites can fire multiple times. The particle analysis method relies on binary transformation to effectively define and segment Ca<sup>2+</sup> firing sites. Therefore, the intensity amplitude of each firing site is not available, but this binary transformation enables us to effectively quantify the large number of sites within the FOV in terms of temporal information and provides parameters of Ca<sup>2+</sup> event size, count, duration and frequency.</p><p>Following the reviewer's suggestion, in addition to firing sites size and frequency count, we analyzed all data sets under control and drug conditions and added the duration information for Ca<sup>2+</sup> particle events to aid the readers to better understand the observed drug effects.

This observation confirms the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in maintaining Ca<sup>2+</sup> release mechanisms as indicated by the reduction of the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> firing sites (Figure 7 K and L)</p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we analyzed the duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> firing sites under reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] <sub>o</sub> conditions (New Figure 7). There was no significant change in the average individual firing sites duration except when we reduce [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] <sub>o</sub> to 1 mM, we noticed a significant increase. This observed increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> firing duration at 50% [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] <sub>o</sub> may be providing a compensatory mechanism for pacemaker firing failure. Reducing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] <sub>o</sub> further had no significant change in individual firing site duration but the duration of the whole Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient cycle (CTC) was reduced, and this is in line with previous paper (Ward et al. J Physiology 1992; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.1992.sp019303">https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.1992.sp019303</ext-link>) that showed reducing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] <sub>o</sub> to 0.5 mM and 0.25 mM caused a firing failure in colonic slow waves that was accompanied with a reduction in electrical slow wave duration in colonic tissues.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that membrane surface charge could influence some experiments where the divalent ion concentration decreased as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] <sub>o</sub> was reduced. We have addressed this point in a previous paper with a series of cation replacement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by Mg<sup>2+</sup> were tested on colonic electrical slow waves and found no significant differences in the responses (Ward et al., J Physiology 1992).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The spatial segmentation of dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> data into PTCLs based on &quot;first&quot; event seems arbitrary, as the degree to which Ca<sup>2+</sup> spreads from the position of the &quot;first&quot; event appears to be quite variable.

If site demarcation was somewhat arbitrary, this should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup> particle analysis used in the study relies on the calculation of the combined area and total number of PTCLs for the entire video. Flags (8-bit, bit-hashed) allowed entire PTCLs to be distinguished based on whether they met certain spatiotemporal (ST) conditions such as size and temporal characteristics. To show the overall regions in cells where Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients occurred, PTCLs were summed throughout the video to create an image of their occurrence.</p><p>Yes. The spatial information in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> occurrence maps data is an indication of each firing site that gives information on their temporal activation and provides no information on their spatial spread. This was implemented in our analysis to accommodate a large number of firing sites and effectively plot them in a 2D occurrence map. We clarified this point in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The cell density value reported (95 cells per mm2) seems low by an order of magnitude. If the quoted average minimum separation distance is 30µm, one would expect 33 cells across a 1mm in 1D. Using the same separation distance, in 2D, one would expect 33 cells x 33 cells = ~1000 cells per square mm.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. The original minimum separation distances between ICC-SM cells were calculated only with the inclusion of very closely associated ICC-SM cells. The ICC-SM network seems to have multiple processes that can vary in length, as visualized in Figure 1. Therefore, we reanalyzed our images and increased the number of images to provide more accurate cell density measurements. New cell density data was added to the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) While a correlation exists between the ICC-SM Ca<sup>2+</sup> events, smooth muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> events and resultant micromotion (Figure 2) in general terms, the traces shown in Figure 2E do not show a 1:1 correlation of the event waveforms. While some variability is expected between micromotions and fluorescence signals due to unknown dynamic/static stress and strain in the gut wall, one would expect the Ca<sup>2+</sup> event waveforms in ICC-SM and SM to be more correlated given the tight electrical coupling via gap junctions. While all the presented Ca<sup>2+</sup> events are biphasic in nature, the first event ICC-SM shows a clear separation between the 2 peaks. The time between the 2 peaks appears sufficient to allow for re-stimulation the SM (~1s), given the fluorescence has returned 80-90% back to baseline – yet there is no inflection or change in slope in the SM Ca<sup>2+</sup> event. The authors should comment on this disparity and qualify under which conditions (frequency/amplitude/? range) the correlation holds true using cross-correlation analysis. Differentiation and distortion vectors would also better locate contraction epicenters in videos and differentiation of traces would provide a more reliable landmark (max dI/dT) to compare time delays.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the ICC network is coupled to SMCs via gap junctions providing an electric signal from ICC to neighboring SMCs. Because of the syncytial nature of the 2 networks, multiple ICC-SM can influence the activity of any given SMC. Thus, the overall signal in adjacent SMC represents a summation of inputs from many ICC-SM, and this may explain the observation of the reviewer.</p><p>In addition, ICC demonstrate complex patterns of Ca<sup>2+</sup> firing in comparison to SMCs. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC activate ANO1 currents. Conduction of currents and depolarization increases the open probability of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in SMCs, resulting in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in these cells. The sequence of signals and coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and electrical responses is different in ICC and SMCs. In fact it is opposite: a rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> initiates ANO1 currents and depolarization in ICC, and depolarization initiates openings of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in SMCs. We don’t anticipate that subtle changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in one or a few ICC during a single cycle would have great influence on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in SMCs, as depolarizing currents from ICC activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> action potentials. Thus, activation of SMCs may be independent of the exact waveforms of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC as long as threshold is reached. Another factor separating 1:1 waveform behavior in ICC and SMCs is the refractory properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> action potentials in SMC and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in ICC are fundamentally different, causing differences in the temporal and overall “shaping” of responses. To clarify this point, we added comment on the contribution of multiple ICC to the overall SMC signals in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The stomach and small intestine generate slow waves in the outermost ICC layer (myenteric layer: ICC-MY) that co-activates circular and longitudinal muscle layers.

A comment on this would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that several types of ICC exist in the colon, and all, through coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and activation of ANO1 channels, can contribute to colonic excitability. Both ICC-SM and ICC-MY provide pacemaker activities in the colon. To understand the complex behaviors of these cells, a reductionist approach is first needed. In this study we focused on the intrinsic pacemaker role of ICC-SM in driving adjacent smooth muscle. Most of the experiments in the study, used an isolated ICC-SM preparation to define Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in ICC-SM with minimal motion artifacts. To examine if ICC-SM drive activity in CM, we used a preparation that included attached SMCs. It is true these preparations included additional types of ICC that might also influence the ultimate behaviors of SMCs. Therefore, we cannot exclude the fact that the signals in SMCs under the conditions of these specific experiments are influenced by additional types of ICC. We know from this study and previously published papers that ICC-SM in the mouse colon generates slow waves at ~ 15 /min whereas ICC-MY ~2/min. Contractions observed in our experiments followed the frequency of behaviors in ICC-SM. Possible influences from additional cells within the muscle tissues were not evaluated in this study. To fully understand the highly integrated functions in colonic motility that result from the behaviors of many types of cells: ICC, SMCs and interstitial cells labeled with antibodies to PDGFRα (i.e. the SIP syncytium), enteric neural inputs and tuning of neural activity by glial cells, will require considerably more complex imaging approaches and refined techniques to limit movements without interfering with the electrical behaviors and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics of the cells involved.</p><p>At this point, we do not know if the activity of ICC-SM propagates through the CM to influence the behaviors of ICC-MY and longitudinal muscle or vice versa. Previous studies in larger animals have shown that pacemaker propagation declines as a function of distance from the submucosal region towards the myenteric region.

But after nicardipine these sites fired randomly, and their frequency was very low. Thus, we interpret these observations to mean that Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is an intrinsic property of ICC, and it occurs from specific sites within cells. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx enhances the excitability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sites and is crucial for organizing Ca<sup>2+</sup> release into clusters that cause sustained activation of ANO1 channels and electrical depolarizations (slow waves). Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry organizes Ca<sup>2+</sup> release via CICR. Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels may also contribute to refilling of stores.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Have the authors used an L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel opener (BayK8644) on the ICC-SM preparation? This would yield important information regarding the role of channel inactivation/&quot;recovery&quot; and the importance of entrainment and limiting ectopic activity on the formation of coherent pacemaker activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have used the L-type channel antagonist (Nicardipine) in this study to evaluate contributions of these channels, however we have not used an L-type channel agonist, such as BayK8644. It is an interesting suggestion, and we will utilize this compound in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Wouldn't large effect of NNC after nicardipine (Figure 12) suggest that T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel entry is equally important is L-type entry. The frequency of control activity prior to the addition of NNC (Figure 10) was quite high and is likely to have predisposed cells to firing failure to a much larger degree as slower control frequencies.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that both L-type and T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are present and may contribute to pacemaker activity in ICC-SM. However, the resting membrane potential of colonic muscles is usually not at highly negative potentials (e.g. ~45 mV; Koh et al. Neurogastroenterol Motil. 2012: doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2012.01956.x). Thus, the relative importance of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels may be reduced due to tonic inactivation of these channels. In cases of depolarized cells, L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels may dominate, as appears to happen under resting conditions in our experiments. T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, however, can become more important if membrane potential is hyperpolarized, as indicated by our experiments when pinacidil was used to hyperpolarize cells. This shift in importance between the two conductances could be important in pathophysiological conditions associated with changes in the membrane potential. Having two conductance expressed with different voltage-dependencies provides a safety factor for maintenance of pacemaker activity, an important and novel observation of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Raw data ± SE was presented in the both the text and in graphical form, particularly when presenting % data.

Ming li et al. 2005 (DOI: 10.1111/j.1527-3466.2005.tb00164.x) demonstrated that 100 microM NNC 55-0396 has no detectable effect on high voltage-activated currents and does not produce metabolite that causes inhibition of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Pinacidil was used to activate KATP channels in the muscle layer, when it remained connected to the ICC-SM layer; this presumably(?) led to hyperpolarization of the ICC layer due to electrical coupling between the layers. Is that correct? (If so that assumption was not clearly stated). The differential effects of the calcium channel inhibitors before and after PIN were then used as evidence that voltage-activated calcium channels with more negative thresholds played a role when PIN was used. But shouldn't the effects of isradipine also have been tested in the presence of PIN in order to make conclusions about the contribution of Cav1.3 channels? Supporting electrophysiology data showing the extent of PIN-induced hyperpolarization in ICC-SM cells would aid in interpretation of these data.</p></disp-quote><p>In the current study, pinacidil application was used to produce a membrane hyperpolarization in SMCs via activation of KATP channels and ICC as they are electrically coupled. We added a statement in the Results section to clarify the rationale of pinacidil application.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer point that these experiments do not directly incorporate potential involvement of Cav 1.3 channels. Data in this study show that ICC-SM Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients depend upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and since isradipine had nearly the same or a lesser effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients than nicardipine, Ca<sub>V</sub> 1.2 appear dominant as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry mechanism. This set of experiments were targeted to determine the contributions of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The results demonstrate that at negative potentials, where the open probability of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels is low, T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are available to facilitate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and sustain pacemaker activity. We agree that patch clamp experiments would further support the conclusions, and we will incorporate them in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) The authors state that ICC in general do not express KATP channels, but wasn't that analysis made for another type of ICC (ICC-MY?)? If that is so, they should check for Kir6 and SUR expression in these purified ICC-SM cells.</p></disp-quote><p>ICC express message for Kir6 and SUR, however KATP currents cannot be resolved in colonic ICC (Huang et al. 2018). At present it is unknown whether Kir6 and SUR are not translated or not trafficked to the plasma membranes to create functional KATP channels in ICC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Previous studies of ICC-SM in mouse have used 0.01 – 1 μm nifedipine (Yoneda et al., 2002; 2003) and Ni2+ to dissect out contributions of L-and T- type channels to the initial and plateau phases of the slow waves in these cells. That data should be discussed at least to some extent. Do the authors think that the pattern of calcium events (fast and transient vs prolonged) correspond to the initial and sustained phases of the slow waves measured in previous studies, in which it was concluded that T- and L-type calcium channels respectively contributed?</p></disp-quote><p>Both of Yoneda et al. papers (Yoneda et al., 2002; 2003) concluded that; L-type and T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels contribute to slow waves in the colon. L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels completely abolished slow waves where T-type channels are involved in the initial component of the slow wave. Our study highlighting the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in ICC-SM is consistent with conclusions of the Yoneda et al. papers. Although the comparison between the electrical activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics from different studies is difficult to clearly interpret. Remember that the electrical activity was recorded (most likely) from SMCs and we are imaging Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in most experiments exclusively from ICC. Figure 15 summarizes the sequence of events in ICC, and these events drive the depolarization-dependent activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> action potentials/ Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in SMCs. We have taken the reviewer’s suggestion and added more information about the conclusions of Yoneda et al. in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
