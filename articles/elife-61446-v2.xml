rotational direction between counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) to direct the migration of the cell. The cytoplasmic ring (C-ring) of the motor, which is composed of FliG, FliM, and FliN, is known for controlling the rotational sense of the flagellum. However, the mechanism underlying rotational switching remains elusive. Here, we deployed cryo-electron tomography to visualize the C-ring in two rotational biased mutants in <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic>. We determined the C-ring molecular architectures, providing novel insights into the mechanism of rotational switching. We report that the C-ring maintained 34-fold symmetry in both rotational senses, and the protein composition remained constant. The two structures show FliG conformational changes elicit a large conformational rearrangement of the rotor complex that coincides with rotational switching of the flagellum. FliM and FliN form a stable spiral-shaped base of the C-ring, likely stabilizing the C-ring during the conformational remodeling.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many bacteria navigate complex environments by controlling the flagellar rotational switch between counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (henceforth, <italic>Salmonella</italic>) use a ‘run-and-tumble’ approach for controlling movement, by which flagella rotating in a CCW sense drive the cell body forward, and when the rotation sense switches to CW the bacterium tumbles through the medium to change direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg,

three-step swimming pattern with forward, reverse, and flick motions; where CCW rotation propels the cell body forward, CW rotation drives the bacterium in reverse, and a flicking motion occurs upon CW-CCW rotation to change swimming direction, analogous to the tumble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xie et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The motor is the most intricate part of the flagellum, not only responsible for flagellar assembly and rotation but also essential for rotational switching. Spanning from the cytosol through the outer membrane, the motor consists of a series of rings, with the L-ring at the outer membrane, the P-ring located within the periplasmic space, the MS-ring embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane, and the C-ring inside the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Homma et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Francis et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ueno et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Francis et al., 1994</xref>). The stator subunits, embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane, generate torque via ion flow to rotate the C-ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blair, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sato and Homma, 2000a</xref>). Different from <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> possesses several Vibrio-specific features: H-, T-, and Orings. The O-ring is located on the outside of the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>), the H-ring facilitates the outer membrane penetration of the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Terashima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>), and the T-ring contacts the H-ring and stators, presumably acting as a scaffold to hold the stators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Terashima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Flagellar rotation is powered by an electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane,driving ion flow through the stator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Terashima et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kojima and Blair, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, H<sup>+</sup> ions are conducted through the stator units. In <italic>Vibrio</italic> species, Na<sup>+</sup> ions are conducted through the stator units. The prevailing idea is that MotA and MotB (in the H<sup>+</sup> motor) or PomA and PomB (in the Na<sup>+</sup> motor) form a membrane-bound stator subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sato and Homma, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kojima and Blair, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braun et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sato and Homma, 2000b</xref>). Recent cryo-EM studies have shown that MotA and MotB assemble in 5:2 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Santiveri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deme et al., 2020</xref>). The A and B subunits have four and one transmembrane helices, respectively, and two helices from the A subunit and one from the B subunit form an ion channel that contains an essential ion-binding aspartyl residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hosking et al., 2006</xref>). Inactive stator complexes diffuse through the cytoplasmic membrane and interact with the rotor to generate a series of conformational changes within PomA and PomB that open the ion channel and facilitate binding to the peptidoglycan layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hosking et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukuoka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sudo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kojima et al., 2018</xref>). However, exactly how the stator assembles around the motor and interacts with the C-ring is still not well understood.</p><p>The C-ring is essential for flagellar rotation and rotational switching. The C-ring structure is conserved among diverse species, with repeating subunits consisting of FliG, FliM, and FliN, with FliN sometimes being supplemented or replaced by FliY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kojima and Blair, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhao et al., 1995</xref>). FliG, located closest to the cell membrane (henceforth referred to upper portion) of the C-ring, interacts with the MS-ring, the lower C-ring, and the stator via three domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). The interaction of the N-terminal domain of FliG (FliG<sub>N</sub>) with FliF tethers the C-ring to the MS-ring and is necessary both for assembly and rotation of the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ogawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lynch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xue et al., 2018</xref>). The middle domain of FliG (FliG<sub>M</sub>) interacts with FliM, holding the upper, membrane-proximal portion of the C-ring in contact with its lower, membrane-distal portion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minamino et al., 2011</xref>). Lastly, the C-terminal domain of FliG (FliG<sub>C</sub>) interacts with a cytoplasmic loop of PomA (or MotA in proton-driven motors) via interactions of oppositely charged residues, connecting the stator and rotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lloyd and Blair, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yakushi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takekawa et al., 2014</xref>). FliM also has three domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 2006</xref>). The N-terminal domain of FliM (FliM<sub>N</sub>) binds to the chemotaxis signaling protein phosphoryl CheY (CheY-P) to trigger switching from CCW to CW rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paul et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vartanian et al., 2012</xref>). The FliM<sub>M</sub> serves as a connection between the base of the C-ring and FliG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minamino et al., 2011</xref>). FliM<sub>C</sub> forms a heterodimer with FliN when fused via a flexible linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Notti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dos Santos et al., 2018</xref>). The third protein, FliN, a small single-domain protein, dimerizes with FliM or itself to form the base of the C-ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2005</xref>). Proposed models for FliG, FliM, and FliN assembly include 1:1:4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sarkar et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sarkar et al., 2010b</xref>) or a 1:1:3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McDowell et al., 2016</xref>) stoichiometry. Two FliN homodimers form a ring at the base of each C-ring subunit in the first model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sarkar et al., 2010a</xref>), while a FliM:FliN heterodimer and a FliN homodimer create a spiral base of the C-ring in the second model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McDowell et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It has been proposed that FliG undergoes a dramatic conformational change from an open, extended form during CCW rotation to a closed, compact form during CW rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Two α-helices play an important role in determining the FliG conformation: helix<sub>MN</sub> connects FliG<sub>N</sub> and FliG<sub>M</sub>, and helix<sub>MC</sub> connects FliG<sub>M</sub> and FliG<sub>C</sub>. It was suggested that these helices are rigid and extended in the open CCW conformation, while they become disordered to switch into the compact CW conformation. Each domain contains armadillo (ARM) repeat motifs; ARM<sub>N</sub> interacts with the adjacent FliG monomer, and ARM<sub>M</sub> and ARM<sub>C</sub> interact either inter- or intramolecularly, depending upon the CCW or CW rotational sense, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minamino et al., 2011</xref>). The domain-swapping mechanism was proposed to coordinate with the conformational change in helix<sub>MC</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Another biochemical study suggested that the domain swapping occurs during C-ring assembly, with FliG in solution existing as a monomer, and an equilibrium favoring FliG oligomers in the C-ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The FliG conformational change occurs about a hinge region first predicted by in silico modeling and characterized via mutational analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Van Way et al., 2004</xref>). Two recently characterized fliG variants in <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> (G214S and G215A), previously characterized in <italic>E. coli</italic> (G194S and G195A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Van Way et al., 2004</xref>]), appear to hinder the conformational change sterically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nishikino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nishikino et al., 2016</xref>), resulting in motors that rotate primarily in a single direction. The wildtype flagella rotate in a CW:CCW ratio of 1:3, while the fliG-G214S mutant produces a CCW-biased phenotype (CW:CCW 1:9), and fliG-G215A mutant produces a CW-locked phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nishikino et al., 2016</xref>). These adjacent residue substitutions create opposite motility phenotypes and are located in the Gly-Gly flexible linker, a hinge region whose conformation is believed to be dependent upon helix<sub>MC</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nishikino et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To characterize C-ring dynamics during switching, we used cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to determine in situ motor structures of the <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> CCW-biased mutant G214S and the CW-locked mutant G215A. We found that a large conformational change of the C-ring occurs between the CCW- and CW-motors. Docking the previously solved homologous structures into our cryo-ET maps, we built two models of the C-ring in CCW and CW rotation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visualization of intact flagellar motors in CCW and CW rotation states</title><p>To address the mechanism of rotational switching, we utilized cryo-ET to visualize the C-rings of two FliG mutants (G214S and G215A) of <italic>V. alginolyticus.</italic> These mutants were previously shown to have CCW-biased and CW-locked flagellar motors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nishikino et al., 2018</xref>). Each <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> cell usually possesses a single, polar, sheathed flagellum, which limits the amount of information per cell for in situ motor structure determination. We therefore introduced the <italic>fliG</italic>-G214S and <italic>fliG</italic>-G215A mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) into the <italic>flhG</italic> KK148 strain, which produces multiple flagella at the cell pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kusumoto et al., 2006</xref>). Tomograms were collected using a 300kV Titan Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) with Volta phase plate, a GIF energy filter and a post-GIF K2 detector electron detector (Gatan). Multiple flagella can be readily seen in a typical cryo-ET reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,D</xref>). In total, 2221 CCW-biased motors from G214S cells and 1618 CW-locked motors from G215A cells were used to determine in situ flagellar motor structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Due to increased contrast from the Volta phase plate and focused classification, we observed 34-fold symmetry of the C-ring in both variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To begin to address potential differences in the switch complex, we measured the diameter of the C-ring in Fiji ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). To describe the observed changes, we will refer to the top of the C-ring as the outermost region facing the cytoplasmic membrane. Starting from the top portion in the <italic>fliG</italic> G214S (CCW) the diameter is 46.2 nm, the middle 46.6 nm, and the bottom 49 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,I</xref>). In <italic>fliG</italic> G215A (CW) motor the diameters are 49.0 nm, 46.6 nm, and 48.3 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,I</xref>). Thus, the CW-motor is about 20.8 Å wider than the CCW-motor at the top of the C-ring, even though the number of C-ring subunits remains unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To understand the interaction between the C-ring and the stator, we also analyzed the densities on the top of the C-ring. We were able to resolve the stator ring in the CW-locked motor but not in the CCW-biased motor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Interestingly, the diameter of the stator ring is 48.3 nm, falling in between the CCW-biased motor and CW-locked motor diameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>In situ structures of <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> flagellum motor in CCW and CW rotation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A representative tomogram slice showing two motors in <italic>V. alginolyticus fliG</italic> G214S mutant (white arrow) Scale bar 100 nm.

However, without a full-length crystal structure, the relative orientations of FliM<sub>N</sub>, FliM<sub>M</sub>, and FliM<sub>C</sub> are unknown.

To place FliM into our map, two I-TASSER models, FliM<sub>M</sub> and FliM<sub>C</sub>, and place the domains separately into our cryo-ET map, and then connected the linker regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We lacked sufficient information to confidently place FliM<sub>N</sub>, and we therefore left it out of our model. The position of FliM<sub>N</sub>, which binds CheY-P, is flexible (discussed below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2001b</xref>). Our model shows that FliM<sub>M</sub> forms the middle portion of the C-ring and allows for the tilting of the C-ring, as FliM<sub>C</sub> tethers FliM to FliN via the heterodimer. We observed the same continuous helical density at the base of the C-ring as shown in <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thomas et al., 2006</xref>) and proposed to be formed via alternating FliM<sub>C</sub>-FliN heterodimers and FliN homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McDowell et al., 2016</xref>) connecting adjacent subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). This region, known as a spiral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McDowell et al., 2016</xref>), is uniform within both the CCW and CW cryo-ET maps, and remains largely unaltered upon rotational switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We will refer to this as the FliM<sub>C</sub>FliN3 (MCN3) spiral from here on. The expansion of the C-ring pseudo-atomic model preserves the continuous uniform shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). By building the patch model initially we were able to preserve the similarity of the MCN3 spiral by removing potential bias from the segmentation of a monomer. The hydrophobic patch residues, originally identified in <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McMurry et al., 2006</xref>), that interact with FliH are facing toward the ATPase such that the interaction could occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). It is important to note that there may be slight movements of the MCN3 proteins during switching, which we would need higher resolution to observe.

First, the density is above the noise level in the CW-motors but not in the CCW-motors, which biochemically makes sense as CheY-P binds to CW rotating motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paul et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vartanian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2001b</xref>). The cells should have endogenous CheY, as there has been no alteration to the <italic>CheY</italic> gene. Second, density similar in location and shape has been shown two recent studies to be CheY-P.

The dynamics of the C-ring appear to be confined to the upper two-thirds of the structure, with the spiral base that connects the C-ring subunits remaining relatively static. We observed a 37<sup>o</sup> lateral and 20<sup>o</sup> medial tilting of the C-ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), which almost certainly alters its interactions with the stator. In our pseudo-atomic model, the charged residues (Lys284, Arg301, Asp308, and Asp309 in FliG<sub>C</sub>) that are known to interact with the stator are located at the top of the C-ring. FliG<sub>C</sub> moves about 40 Å laterally (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This large remodeling of the C-ring presumably enables distinct interactions between the stator and the C-ring (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). FliG<sub>CN</sub> contains the ARM<sub>C</sub> motif that interacts with FliG<sub>M</sub> and FliM<sub>M</sub>, and FliG<sub>CC</sub> contains the charged residues that interact with the stator. A flexible linker attaching the two domains would allow for a range of movement in FliG<sub>CC</sub> relative to FliG<sub>CN</sub> and FliG<sub>M</sub>, thus suggesting that the presentation of the charged residues varies greatly depending upon the conformation of FliG.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-61446-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Focused refinement of the C-ring reveals conformational change during rotational switching.</title><p>The video starts with a <italic>fliG</italic> G214S motor, a mutation leads to a strong preference for CCW rotation, without symmetry applied.

It has previously been hypothesized, based on experiments utilizing fluorescently tagged FliM and FliN, that the FliG, FliM, and FliN composition of the C-ring changes during rotational switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delalez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delalez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hosu and Berg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lele et al., 2012</xref>). A recent single-particle cryo-EM study suggested that inter-subunit spacing and interactions of the C-ring account for motor switching in <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sakai et al., 2019</xref>). That study reported a 9 Å decrease in C-ring diameter upon switching to CW. We report identical diameters at the middle of the C-ring in both rotational directions. However, we observed ~21 Å increase in the diameter and ~40 Å lateral change at FliG<sub>C</sub> of the CW-motor. In a parallel study, Chang et al. used a <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> with a CheX deletion or CheY3 deletion to investigate the switching mechanism of spirochetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2020</xref>). Similar conformational changes of the C-ring were observed in both species; however, the stator complexes were resolved in <italic>B. burgdorferi,</italic> as they appear to be less dynamic than those in <italic>V. alginolyticus.</italic> Visualization of the stator complex provided direct evidence that the conformational change of the C-ring alters the rotor-stator interaction. The model of stator-rotor interactions controlling the rotational direction of the motor is further bolstered by the recent high-resolution cryo-EM models of MotAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Santiveri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deme et al., 2020</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Santiveri et al., 2020</xref> further postulated that MotA rotates CCW in <italic>Campylobacter jejunie</italic> by showing that the conformations of wildtype MotAB and MotAB trapped in the protonated state are nearly identical, thus ruling out a dramatic conformational change in the stator unit. Therefore, we conclude that the change in rotational direction occurs from a large movement of the charged residues of FliG<sub>C</sub> relative to the stator.</p><p>Our in situ structures support that FliG, FliM, and FliN interact in a 1:1:3 ratio, as suggested for the non-flagellar homolog Spa33 in <italic>Shigella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McDowell et al., 2016</xref>). This stoichiometry favors the model in which FliM holds the individual C-ring subunits together by interacting with FliG<sub>M</sub> and forming a heterodimer with FliN. The FliM-FliN spiral connects adjacent C-ring subunits, allowing for dramatic movement without dissociation of the subunits. The FliG<sub>M</sub>-FliM<sub>M</sub> interface, perhaps dynamic in its own right, has been suggested to be involved in flagellar switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sakai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pandini et al., 2016</xref>). It was shown, using NMR, that the CheY-P binding to FliM displaces FliG<sub>C</sub>, and that the dramatic rearrangement of FliG<sub>MC</sub> is possible because of the flexibility of FliG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dyer et al., 2009</xref>). In particular, the GGPG loop in FliM<sub>M</sub> is suggested to be critical for rotation of FliG<sub>M</sub> relative to FliM<sub>M</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pandini et al., 2016</xref>). Most recently, point mutations targeting FliM<sub>M</sub> were shown to restore CCW rotation in a CW-biased mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sakai et al., 2019</xref>). These results, combined with our findings, lead us to suggest that the conformational change in FliG results in a rotation about FliM<sub>M</sub> that leads to the tilting of the C-ring subunit to alter the presentation of the charged residues of FliG<sub>C</sub> to the stator.</p><p>Given that the putative CheY-P-ring is likely associated with the CW C-ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we propose a CCW-to-CW switching model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>). CheY-P binding to the FliM results in a conformational change in FliG and alters the interactions between the C-ring and stator. FliM<sub>C</sub> and FliN create a spiral base that holds the C-ring together during these dynamic rearrangements. FliM<sub>C</sub> and FliN may also be involved in relaying the conformational change to adjacent C-ring subunits. By placing the FliG crystal structures of the open and closed variations within our cryo-ET image, we provide additional evidence to support the proposed model in which the ARM<sub>M</sub> and ARM<sub>C</sub> domains toggle between inter- and intramolecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). NMR data suggest that FliG<sub>C</sub> is the domain that moves and that FliG<sub>M</sub> remains in stable contact with FliM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dyer et al., 2009</xref>). These changes in the C-ring structure produce the two directions of flagellar rotation. Understanding the interactions of the C-ring with the stator and the MS-ring is essential to elucidate the mechanism of rotational switching and transmission of the rotation to the flagellar filament. We could not resolve the detailed interactions between the cytoplasmic portion of the stator and the C-ring in both rotational directions, and we could not confirm directly that the orientation of FliG<sub>CC</sub> alters the presentation of its charged residues to the charged residues of PomA. Restricting the movement of FliG<sub>CC</sub> via truncations of the flexible linker may address the importance of FliG<sub>CC</sub> mobility. With more data and further classification and refinement of the CCW-biased motor, we expect to explain the FliG<sub>CC</sub> and stator interactions in great detail. With the rapid development of cryo-ET, it is increasingly possible to reveal motor structure <italic>in situ</italic> at higher resolution, which will further our understanding of the flagellar assembly and function.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>A model for the rotational switching.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A cartoon of the intact CCW-motor with the C-ring highlighted in blue, and the other conserved regions that have been resolved in teal, the <italic>Vibrio-</italic>specific proteins in light green, PomAB is colored gray as it has yet to be resolved in detail in <italic>Vibrio</italic>.

The Gly-Gly flexible region is depicted by red circles. The stator (gray) is shown to interact with FliG<sub>C</sub>. Upon CheY-P binding, the C-ring undergoes a conformational change that produces CW rotation. During this transition, the center of mass tilts laterally and slightly outward. In CW rotation there are intramolecular interactions of FliG ARM<sub>M</sub> and ARM<sub>C</sub>. CheY-P (dark purple) is shown bound to FliM, and the stator (gray) interacts with FliG<sub>C</sub>. We hypothesize that the conformational change in FliG is initiated <italic>in vivo</italic> by CheY-P binding, and this switches the rotational direction of the C-ring by changing how FliG<sub>C</sub> interacts with the stator. FliG undergoes a conformational change and FliM tilts about the base of the spiral.

Molecular modeling attributes the tilt component of the conformational change to FliM. Gyration of FliG about FliM presents the charged residues of FliG to the stator in a manner that controls the rotational sense. These movements within the C-ring subunits may be relayed throughout the switch complex by interactions between FliM and FliN within the spiral.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids, and growth condition</title><p>Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>.

following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;The flagellar motor of <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic> undergoes major structural remodeling during rotational switching&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Chi Aizawa (Reviewer #2); Susan M Lea (Reviewer #3); Richard M Berry (Reviewer #4).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at this stage.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that an atomic model of the C-ring that allowed a molecular explanation for switching would be of great interest. The key issue is whether there is enough information in the tomograms to uniquely position existing atomic structures to enable this question to be addressed, and whether one can exclude significant conformational changes within these structures. At present the data shown do not allow the uniqueness and quality of the fit to be addressed. This paper is also unusual in that no estimates of resolution are provided. A further concern was the preprint of Chang et al. recently posted on bioRxiv. Is it possible that the mechanism proposed in Chang et al. only applies to <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, while the mechanism in the present paper only applies to <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic>? If this is true, that should have been stated in both papers, but it is stated in neither. In summary, all reviewers felt that a substantially revised paper that addressed all of these concerns should be considered again for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I had a difficult time judging the significance of the work. In some ways, the paper comes across as an incremental advance over previous studies on the bacterial flagellar motor. My main concerns had to do with the cryo-ET image analysis. This may be the first cryo-EM paper I have ever read where there is neither any mention of, nor discussion of, the resolution the reconstructed volumes. It is hard to understand how this can be absent, and it is difficult to understand the reliability of the models without some discussion of this point. Given the recent paper (Johnson et al., 2020) showing symmetry variation in the MS-ring complex, one wonders how reliable the overall imposition of a C34 symmetry is in the present reconstruction. There is no analysis of possible variance within these volumes, nor is there any information on what happens when other symmetries are imposed, both locally and globally. This is important, as the authors take one of the conclusions of their work to be that the composition of the C-ring remains constant between the two states. It is not clear how reliable such a conclusion can be at the limited resolution with the same imposed symmetry for both volumes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a beautiful work on conformational changes of the C ring of the flagellar motor.</p><p>The authors showed two conformations of the C ring in which rotation is biased to either CCW or CW.</p><p>Although I did not understand the details of the image processing using many sophisticated software, the results obtained are quite reasonable and convincing. I highly recommend this work to be published.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The molecular details underlying how the bacterial flagellar motor switches direction of rotation is a long-studied question. This paper aims to address this question by using sub-tomogram averaging to generate volumes from directionally locked forms of the <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> C-ring. This is an important question, being at the heart of how many bacteria move in response to their environment, and new data are therefore welcome. However, there are some issues to do with how the experiments are reported in light of past work and critical details of interpretation of the data that need to be made more explicit to allow a fuller understanding of how the new data enhance our current models. We would like to thank the authors for making the two volumes available as part of the review package to help with assessing the work.</p><p>Key prior work that provides the background to the current manuscript:</p><p>1) Prior structural work on intact C-rings by De Rosier and colleagues (Thomas et al., 2006) led to a moderate resolution, C34 reconstruction, of the C-ring with sufficient detail that permitted fitting of a spiral of a FliM<sub>N</sub> homologue at the base of the ring (Mc Dowell et al., 2016). No formal resolution estimate was provided for the earlier reconstruction, but fitting of domains of known structure in a robust fashion was possible, at least at the bases of the C-ring.</p><p>2) Sakai et al., 2019, reported low resolution analyses of locked C-ring motors from <italic>Salmonella</italic> and demonstrate that there is only a minor change in diameter at the mid-point of the C-ring (~10A).</p><p>3) We (Johnson et al., 2020) have recently reported molecular detail for the MS ring on which the C-ring is assembled showing that, at least in the context of the isolated MS-ring, assemblies with different symmetries ranging from C32-C35 exist. This tallied with earlier analyses of C-ring stoichiometry, including Sakai (Sakai et al., 2019).</p><p>Novelty of these data:</p><p>These volumes are clearly the highest resolution views of the C-ring in locked CW and CCW states to date, combined with atomic structures of component proteins this gives a great opportunity to try and build a more detailed model of the complete C-ring in both states.</p><p>Major issues to be addressed:</p><p>1) Hand of the reconstructions? There are no details on how this key step was performed.</p><p>2) Symmetry of the assembly – there is no detail on how the tomograms were treated to assess the correct symmetry to apply, with only a simple statement on p10 that “our cryo-ET model shows 34-fold symmetry for both the CCW and CW rotating C-rings”. Full details, ideally including images, on how symmetry was assigned must be provided and evidenced in the manuscript. This is especially important in light of the previous data showing variation in C-ring symmetry as, in the extreme, the relatively subtle differences between the CW and CCW volumes could reflect different proportions of 34mer in the samples being averaged rather than true differences between the states.</p><p>3) Fitting of coordinates – it is not possible to judge the quality and uniqueness of the fit of coordinates to the volumes in the current version of the manuscript. A single correlation coefficient statistic is given in the text for each volume and it is unclear (1) if this is for the full model or simply the FliM<sub>N</sub> spiral and (2) how each domain of the model contributes to this statistic. The figures that do show the fit show substantial extrusion of secondary structural elements outside of the volume and unfilled regions within the volume. This is perhaps unsurprising for a volume at modest resolution, but given that the authors go on to propose a radical structural rearrangement and then discuss the location of specific amino acids, the evidence for the uniqueness of the fit needs to be provided. Inspection of the volumes did not trivially allow the viewer to see a correlation in shape between the densities ascribed to the crucial FliG domains in the figures. There is also some confusion surrounding the FliM<sub>c</sub>/FliN spiral, as the text states that this portion of the structure is largely unaltered between the two states, but Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 show significant differences in the side views, with what looks like a 90 degree rotation of the spiral. How is this justified given the relatively featureless resolution of the maps?</p><p>4) Discussion of novelty throughout should acknowledge the incremental nature of the current findings c.f. the earlier work. In particular the extensive discussion c.f. the work of Sakai should acknowledge that, at the resolution of both studies, both could be summarized as “no major difference in diameter on switching”.</p><p>5) CheY binding – this is the most speculative part of the manuscript as a ring of density around the CCW ring is assigned as CheY-P largely on the basis of the groups work that will be presented in another manuscript (cited as Chang et al. in preparation). Particularly in light of another manuscript recently reported in bioRxiv that demonstrates the N-terminus of FliM is <italic>not</italic> required for CheY-P binding induced switching (Eisenback et al.), the authors should either provide further supporting experiments or more clearly mark this as speculative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>The paper presents insitu structures of the bacterial flagellar motor in CW and CCW states, and a corresponding detailed (&quot;pseudoatomic&quot;) structural model of each state. Models are consistent with previous biochemical data on the proximity of various amino acid residues of the constituent proteins.</p><p>The work is novel and important, and of sufficient general interest for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>: it allows analysis of the structural nature of the flagellar switch, which has been a canonical example of a macromolecular switch since the discovery of flagellar switching in the 1970s.</p><p>1) There is a lack of clarity, perhaps even an apparent internal contradiction, as to whether the structure at the filament-distal end of the motor (the FliM<sub>C</sub>/ FliN<sub>3</sub> super-helix, hereafter &quot;MCN3 helix&quot;) is different between CW and CCW structures. This is an important point, worthy even of inclusion in the Abstract, as any changes in this part of the C-ring caused by the 2 point mutations in FliG would indicate long-range effects of very small mutational changes. <italic>Specifically</italic>: the MCN3 helix seems to be very different between CW and CCW in Figures 2C/D and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 B/D – with fairly substantial rearrangement of protein chains. But the density maps for CW and CCW in Figure 2A/B look very similar, and the lack of changes in the MCN3 helix is confirmed in Figure 4 and in the text. Is it possible that the repeating structure of 34 units has been cut differently between Figures 2C and D, and also Figures 2—figure supplement 1B and D? Or alternatively, that the outwardly similar shape of the MCN3 helix conceals a very different internal arrangement of protein chains? Or something else? This apparent contradiction needs to be addressed and removed. A pseudoatomic model allows and demands this level of inspection, with appropriate caveats about the confidence in the model itself.</p><p>2) Closely related to comment 1, it is hard to match corresponding parts of the CW and CCW models – particularly in Figures 2C/D and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B/D. In reality there must be a pathway for switching between the CW and CCW structures. The authors should explore the transition between the two, and supply one or more animations to illustrate the conclusions that they can draw from their model regarding this important point – which is the main result of the paper. Such animations would be a powerful illustration, clarification and explanation of Figures 2-4 (and perhaps also Figure 5). They would serve 3 important purposes:</p><p>a) Identify corresponding parts, including perhaps the possibility that the repeating structure has been cut differently to isolate the units displayed in Figure 2 (see comment 1).</p><p>b) Illustrate either a smooth pathway between CW and CCW states (i.e. requiring no significant unfolding of secondary structure to avoid steric clashes, as proposed in the FliG model of Lee et al., 2010); or the lack of one, indicating rather the need for substantial disruption of interactions during a switch. The current best model for the switch is that of conformational spread (e.g. Bai et al., Science 2010), in which an energetic penalty for boundaries between domains of CW and CCW structure is a key parameter. This paper might be able to add structural data to that model.</p><p>c) Highlight and illustrate changes in the orientation and location of FliG<sub>c</sub>, which are the &quot;output&quot; of the switch and most relevant in terms of understanding how it can cause a change in rotation direction upon interaction with the stator. These are discussed in the text, but it is hard to see them in the existing figures.</p><p>3) Regarding the extra density peripheral to the C-ring in the CW state, visible in Figure 1 and suggested to be CheY later in the paper (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, subsection “Extra diffuse density around the CW C-ring”). The authors should cite references that proposed that FliM<sub>N</sub> is an unstructured &quot;fishing rod&quot; that serves to bind and concentrate CheY, which their hypothesis and data support. Also the alternative explanation (see e.g. Figure 7 in J Mol Biol. 430(22):4557-4579.) that this density could be extra copies of FliM, outside the ordered C-ring. This would reconcile previous observations of substantial recruitment of FliM to the C-ring (although in <italic>E. coli</italic>) during CW rotation with the lack of expansion of the 34-fold ring observed here.</p><p>4) Figure 5 legend is wrong – D and C are described as if they were parts of B and A respectively. More importantly, the figure presents a model where the domain-swap (visible in B as swapping of colour-labelled domains of each protein chain into the neighbouring structural unit) is present in one directional state (CCW, B) but not the other (CW, D). This may be a misunderstanding of the domain-swap model of the flagellar switch. Alteration of the domain-swap during switching is not necessary, nor is it proposed by Baker et al., 2016 (as incorrectly stated in the Introduction). In fact, quite the opposite: the model proposes that the ARM-ARM interface is very strong, the main interaction holding the FliG ring together, and therefore very unlikely to open except under the special conditions that prevail during assembly of the FliG ring. Instead, the cartoon of the CCW state, Figure 5B, appears entirely consistent with the model of Lee et al., 2010, and the switch to a domain-swapped alternative of Figure 5D would then be a data-supported refinement and confirmation of the model of Lee et al., 2010. Alternative models propose non-domain swapped structures (like the cartoon of Figure 5D) for both CW and CCW. Perhaps the authors could comment on whether their data support one or other model.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The flagellar motor of <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic> undergoes major structural remodeling during rotational switching&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

To overcome the limitation, we first used a relatively new technique (Volta phase plate) to collect cryo-ET data, resulting in reconstructions with better contrast. We then used multivariate statistical analysis for 3D classification, which allowed us to determine the 34-fold symmetry of the C-ring. It’s important to point out that we did not resolve the 34-fold symmetry by imposing different symmetries. Furthermore, the C-ring structures in the two states share the same symmetry, however they have different conformations. Again the 34-fold symmetric features were observed first before we impose the symmetry to increase the resolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is a beautiful work on conformational changes of the C ring of the flagellar motor.</p><p>The authors showed two conformations of the C ring in which rotation is biased to either CCW or CW.</p><p>Although I did not understand the details of the image processing using many sophisticated software, the results obtained are quite reasonable and convincing.

We have three pieces of data to support the handedness of the reconstructions in this study. First, we have independently determined two structures of the C-rings. The base of the C-ring shares similar right-handed spiral structure in both states. Importantly, the right-handed spiral structure matches well with the crystal structure of a FliN homolog (Mc Dowell et al., 2016). Second, the exact same cryo-ET protocol was used to generate 3D reconstructions of periplasmic flagella in spirochetes. Consistent with previous findings, periplasmic flagella form a right-handed ribbon in our reconstructions. Third, our recent in situ structures of HIV-1 Env spikes match well with near-atomic structures of purified Env spikes by cryo-EM single particle analysis. Together, we believe that our reconstructions in this study have correct handedness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Symmetry of the assembly – there is no detail on how the tomograms were treated to assess the correct symmetry to apply, with only a simple statement on p10 that “our cryo-ET model shows 34-fold symmetry for both the CCW and CW rotating C-rings”. Full details, ideally including images, on how symmetry was assigned must be provided and evidenced in the manuscript. This is especially important in light of the previous data showing variation in C-ring symmetry as, in the extreme, the relatively subtle differences between the CW and CCW volumes could reflect different proportions of 34mer in the samples being averaged rather than true differences between the states.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the symmetry of the C-ring is important for this study. Therefore, we have provided the detailed steps as requested by the reviewer 1. We first used Volta phase plate to increase the contrast of each reconstruction. We then used multivariate statistical analysis for 3D classification, which allowed us to resolve 34-fold symmetric features of the C-ring. Two independent approaches were used to determine the structures of the C-ring in both states. The resulting structures of the C-ring are considerably different.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Fitting of coordinates – it is not possible to judge the quality and uniqueness of the fit of coordinates to the volumes in the current version of the manuscript. A single correlation coefficient statistic is given in the text for each volume and it is unclear (1) if this is for the full model or simply the FliM<sub>N</sub> spiral and (2) how each domain of the model contributes to this statistic. The figures that do show the fit show substantial extrusion of secondary structural elements outside of the volume and unfilled regions within the volume. This is perhaps unsurprising for a volume at modest resolution, but given that the authors go on to propose a radical structural rearrangement and then discuss the location of specific amino acids, the evidence for the uniqueness of the fit needs to be provided. Inspection of the volumes did not trivially allow the viewer to see a correlation in shape between the densities ascribed to the crucial FliG domains in the figures. There is also some confusion surrounding the FliM<sub>c</sub>/FliN spiral, as the text states that this portion of the structure is largely unaltered between the two states, but Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 show significant differences in the side views, with what looks like a 90 degree rotation of the spiral. How is this justified given the relatively featureless resolution of the maps?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand how it is very challenging to judge the placement of fitted, pseudoatomic models. However, we believe the model was necessary to help explain the cryo-ET maps. To address this issue, we did three things:</p><p>1) We made a supplemental figure of in silico maps reconstructed from the model at the resolution of our experimental maps. This was to show the level of detail that we should expect to see. The maps were similar to our experimental maps, but allow the reader to visualize what is different. We think that this will help with the idea of what can be interpreted from our pseudoatomic model at our resolution.</p><p>2) We clarified in the text that the amino acids are only talked about in relative location to help confirm the location of the proteins.</p><p>“It is important to note that these residues were used to identify unique locations in our model, but due to limited resolution their precise location is not known”</p><p>3) We made it clear that the spiral is not altered specifically in shape.</p><p>“This region, known as a spiral, like that of a spiral bound notebook, is uniform within both the CCW and CW cryo-ET maps, and remains largely unaltered upon rotational switching (Figure 4C). […] By building the patch model initially we were able to preserve the similarity of the MCN3 spiral by removing potential bias from the segmentation of a monomer. […] It is important to note that there may be slight movements of the MCN3 proteins during switching, that we would need higher resolution to observe.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Discussion of novelty throughout should acknowledge the incremental nature of the current findings c.f. the earlier work. In particular the extensive discussion c.f. the work of Sakai should acknowledge that, at the resolution of both studies, both could be summarized as “no major difference in diameter on switching”.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that our finding is an important extension of earlier work from many different labs. We have revised our manuscript with extensive discussions of other related studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) CheY binding – this is the most speculative part of the manuscript as a ring of density around the CCW ring is assigned as CheY-P largely on the basis of the groups work that will be presented in another manuscript (cited as Chang et al. in preparation). Particularly in light of another manuscript recently reported in bioRxiv that demonstrates the N-terminus of FliM is not required for CheY-P binding induced switching (Eisenback et al.), the authors should either provide further supporting experiments or more clearly mark this as speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is speculative. Further experiments will be needed to support the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>The paper presents in situ structures of the bacterial flagellar motor in CW and CCW states, and a corresponding detailed (&quot;pseudoatomic&quot;) structural model of each state. Models are consistent with previous biochemical data on the proximity of various amino acid residues of the constituent proteins.</p><p>The work is novel and important, and of sufficient general interest for publication in eLife: it allows analysis of the structural nature of the flagellar switch, which has been a canonical example of a macromolecular switch since the discovery of flagellar switching in the 1970s.</p><p>1) There is a lack of clarity, perhaps even an apparent internal contradiction, as to whether the structure at the filament-distal end of the motor (the FliM<sub>C</sub>/ FliN<sub>3</sub> super-helix, hereafter &quot;MCN3 helix&quot;) is different between CW and CCW structures. This is an important point, worthy even of inclusion in the Abstract, as any changes in this part of the C-ring caused by the 2 point mutations in FliG would indicate long-range effects of very small mutational changes. Specifically: the MCN3 helix seems to be very different between CW and CCW in Figures 2C/D and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B/D – with fairly substantial rearrangement of protein chains. But the density maps for CW and CCW in Figure 2 A/B look very similar, and the lack of changes in the MCN3 helix is confirmed in Figure 4 and in the text. Is it possible that the repeating structure of 34 units has been cut differently between Figures 2C and D, and also Figures 2—figure supplement 1B and D? Or alternatively, that the outwardly similar shape of the MCN3 helix conceals a very different internal arrangement of protein chains? Or something else? This apparent contradiction needs to be addressed and removed. A pseudoatomic model allows and demands this level of inspection, with appropriate caveats about the confidence in the model itself.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the critical concern. Our two structures of the C-ring suggested that the base of the C-ring remains in similar conformation. We therefore built the model based on the crystal structure of the FliN homolog (in McDowell et al., 2016). Our models were previously refined based on the segmented maps, which were unfortunately not reliable. Given the concerns and suggestions from the reviewer, we have used a different strategy, where we built a patch of 4 subunits, to refine the models. We believe that current models are consistent with the maps with 34-fold symmetry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Closely related to comment 1, it is hard to match corresponding parts of the CW and CCW models – particularly in Figures 2C/D and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B/D. In reality there must be a pathway for switching between the CW and CCW structures. The authors should explore the transition between the two, and supply one or more animations to illustrate the conclusions that they can draw from their model regarding this important point – which is the main result of the paper. Such animations would be a powerful illustration, clarification and explanation of Figures 2-4 (and perhaps also Figure 5). They would serve 3 important purposes:</p><p>a) Identify corresponding parts, including perhaps the possibility that the repeating structure has been cut differently to isolate the units displayed in Figure 2 (see comment 1).</p><p>b) Illustrate either a smooth pathway between CW and CCW states (i.e. requiring no significant unfolding of secondary structure to avoid steric clashes, as proposed in the FliG model of Lee et al., 2010); or the lack of one, indicating rather the need for substantial disruption of interactions during a switch. The current best model for the switch is that of conformational spread (e.g. Bai et al., Science 2010), in which an energetic penalty for boundaries between domains of CW and CCW structure is a key parameter. This paper might be able to add structural data to that model.</p><p>c) Highlight and illustrate changes in the orientation and location of FliG<sub>c</sub>, which are the &quot;output&quot; of the switch and most relevant in terms of understanding how it can cause a change in rotation direction upon interaction with the stator. These are discussed in the text, but it is hard to see them in the existing figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have made appropriate animations.</p><p>Video 1 is a summary of the project. Starting with the low resolution CCW map and moving to the locally refined C-ring map. Then building our pseudo-atomic model. We should how the symmetrized model switches between the CCW- and CW conformations by a simple toggle. And then move back out to the CW rotation.</p><p>Video 2 is a simple look at switching from above the C-ring. This shows how the charged residues of FliG change position relative to the stator if the stator were resolved in our maps.</p><p>Video 3 provides detail at how switching may occur in the domain swapping hypothesis. Here with zoom into a patch of the motor and watch how the CCW subunits morph into the CW subunits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Regarding the extra density peripheral to the C-ring in the CW state, visible in Figure 1 and suggested to be CheY later in the paper (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, subsection “Extra diffuse density around the CW C-ring”). The authors should cite references that proposed that FliM<sub>N</sub> is an unstructured &quot;fishing rod&quot; that serves to bind and concentrate CheY, which their hypothesis and data support. Also the alternative explanation (see e.g. Figure 7 in J Mol Biol. 430(22):4557-4579.) that this density could be extra copies of FliM, outside the ordered C-ring. This would reconcile previous observations of substantial recruitment of FliM to the C-ring (although in E. coli) during CW rotation with the lack of expansion of the 34-fold ring observed here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our data alone does not identify the density as CheY-P, although it was recently suggested in two different studies. Alternatively, it could be also formed by extra FliM or FliN as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5 legend is wrong – D and C are described as if they were parts of B and A respectively. More importantly, the figure presents a model where the domain-swap (visible in B as swapping of colour-labelled domains of each protein chain into the neighbouring structural unit) is present in one directional state (CCW, B) but not the other (CW, D). This may be a misunderstanding of the domain-swap model of the flagellar switch. Alteration of the domain-swap during switching is not necessary, nor is it proposed by Baker et al., 2016 (as incorrectly stated in the Introduction). In fact, quite the opposite: the model proposes that the ARM-ARM interface is very strong, the main interaction holding the FliG ring together, and therefore very unlikely to open except under the special conditions that prevail during assembly of the FliG ring. Instead, the cartoon of the CCW state, Figure 5B, appears entirely consistent with the model of Lee et al., 2010, and the switch to a domain-swapped alternative of Figure 5D would then be a data-supported refinement and confirmation of the model of Lee et al., 2010. Alternative models propose non-domain swapped structures (like the cartoon of Figure 5D) for both CW and CCW. Perhaps the authors could comment on whether their data support one or other model.</p></disp-quote><p>Our resolution doesn’t not allow for the conformation of either model. As we push to increase resolution of the C-ring in tomography, hopefully we will be able to confirm via a true atomic resolution model. We built our models following the literature as closely as possible. Since many papers have suggested FliG is extended in the CCW rotation we used the full length FliG structure, 3HJL. To build this into the map we used the crystal packing that led to the domain swapping hypothesis. This FliG monomer assembled due to crystal packing fits into the map with little movement necessary. To build the CW model we used the “compact” FliG that has been proposed during CW rotation from the crystal structure 4FHR. The figures have been updated to clarify this by alternating the coloring of FliG. We have also addressed this in the text. We think that this is a piece of evidence to support this model, but it is not direct evidence.</p><p>We have updated our previous miscitation. We greatly thank the reviewer for noticing this.</p><p>“The domain swapping mechainism was proposed to coordinate with the conformational change in Helix<sub>MC</sub> (Lee et al., 2010). Another biochemical study suggested that the domain swapping occurs during C-ring assembly, with FliG in solution existing as a monomer, and an equilibrium favoring FliG oligomers in the C-ring (Baker et al., 2016).”</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are is a remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In general, the authors have addressed the concerns raised in the previous review. But the decision letter for the previous manuscript stated: &quot;A further concern was the preprint of Chang et al. recently posted on bioRxiv. Is it possible that the mechanism proposed in Chang et al. only applies to Borrelia burgdorferi, while the mechanism in the present paper only applies to Vibrio alginolyticus? If this is true, that should have been stated in both papers, but it is stated in neither.&quot; This is not answered either in the response nor in the revised paper.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we would like to thank the editors and the reviewers for your time and consideration of our revised manuscript. To some extent, the results in the preprint of Chang et al. matches with what we observed in <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic>. We have updated our manuscript to make this clearer, although we had a sentence in the Discussion that may be overlooked. We replaced, “This finding is consistent with another structural characterization of the CW/CCW motors in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> (Chang et al., 2020).” with:</p><p>“In a parallel study, Chang et al. used a <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> with a CheX deletion or CheY3 deletion to investigate the switching mechanism in spirochetes (Chang et al., 2020). We observed similar conformational changes of the C-ring in both species; however, the stator complexes were well resolved in <italic>B. burgdorferi,</italic> as they appear to be less dynamic than those in <italic>V. alginolyticus.</italic> Visualization of the stator complex provided direct evidence that the conformational change of the C-ring alters the rotor-stator interaction. The model of stator-rotor interactions controlling the rotational direction of the motor is further bolstered by the recent high-resolution cryo-EM structure of MotAB. Santiveri et al. further postulate that MotA rotates counterclockwise in <italic>Campylobacter jejunie</italic> by showing the conformations of wildtype MotAB and MotAB trapped in the protonated state, are nearly identical, thus, ruling out a dramatic conformational change in the stator unit.”</p><p>To further elaborate, the two manuscripts fit nicely together. We used different but analogous approaches to end up at the similar model in which the C-ring underwent a comparable conformational change in both species in different rotational directions. In <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> we were able to generate single point mutation variants that locked the motors in CW or CCW rotation. This enabled us to be truly confident in the rotational direction of the flagellum motor. In <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> we created motors that were half CCW by deleting CheY3, or all CW by deleting CheX, the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of CheY3. Spirochetes have a unique mode of movement as the flagella are located at both cell poles, therefore during the “run” one cell pole is rotating CCW and the other rotating CW (potentially due to an unknown protein). In <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> we were able to resolve density for the stator complex, this has been shown before but not to such resolution. The ability to resolve the stator helps identify FliG-MotA interactions. We are working on trying to visualize the stator in the <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> motors, but the stator occupancy seems to be more dynamic making this a very challenging task. The <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> visualization of the stator, reinforced by the new stator cryo-EM structures recently put on bioRxiv, provides additional evidence for our model. We were unable to discuss much about the stator involvement in this manuscript. But comparison of our CCW and CW C-rings revealed an unambiguously similar pattern with the movement of the C-ring repositioning FliGC thus altering the FliG-MotA interaction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
