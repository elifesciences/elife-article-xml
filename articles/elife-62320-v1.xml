Loss-of-function of the core autophagy gene <italic>Atg16l1</italic> increases risk for Crohnâ€™s disease in part by enhancing innate immunity through myeloid cells such as macrophages. However, autophagy is also recognized as a mechanism for clearance of certain intracellular pathogens. These divergent observations prompted a re-evaluation of ATG16L1 in innate antimicrobial immunity. In this study, we found that loss of <italic>Atg16l1</italic> in myeloid cells enhanced the killing of virulent <italic>Shigella flexneri (S.flexneri)</italic>, a clinically relevant enteric bacterium that resides within the cytosol by escaping from membrane-bound compartments. Quantitative multiplexed proteomics of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages revealed that ATG16L1 deficiency significantly upregulated proteins involved in the glutathione-mediated antioxidant response to compensate for elevated oxidative stress, which simultaneously promoted <italic>S.flexneri</italic> killing. Consistent with this, myeloid-specific deletion of <italic>Atg16l1</italic> in mice accelerated bacterial clearance in <italic>vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Pharmacological induction of oxidative stress through suppression of cysteine import enhanced microbial clearance by macrophages. Conversely, antioxidant treatment of macrophages permitted <italic>S.flexneri</italic> proliferation. These findings demonstrate that control of oxidative stress by ATG16L1 and autophagy regulates antimicrobial immunity against intracellular pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>oxidative damage</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>shigella flexneri</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001961</institution-id><institution>AXA Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16-AXA-PDOC-078</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maculins</surname><given-names>Timurs</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004328</institution-id><institution>Genentech</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maculins</surname><given-names>Timurs</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>742720</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dikic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multiplexed mass spectrometry shows how the autophagy gene <italic>Atg16l1</italic> regulates macrophage innate immunity against intracellular bacterial pathogens by modulating basal oxidative stress responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Effective immunity against enteric pathogens requires complex signaling to coordinate the inflammatory response, pathogen clearance, tissue remodeling, and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maloy and Powrie, 2011</xref>). Autophagy, a cellular catabolic pathway that eliminates cytosolic cargo via lysosomal degradation, has emerged as an important regulator of mucosal immunity and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) etiology. Genome-wide association studies linked the missense T300A variant in the core autophagy gene <italic>Atg16l1</italic> with increased risk for IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hampe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rioux et al., 2007</xref>). Later studies demonstrated that this variant contributes to enhanced caspase-mediated degradation of the ATG16L1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lassen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murthy et al., 2014</xref>). Genetic loss-of-function of core autophagy genes including <italic>Atg16l1</italic> increases secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages in response to toll-like receptor (TLR) activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saitoh et al., 2008</xref>). This contributes to increased mucosal inflammation, driving resistance to extracellular pathogens such as <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marchiando et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin et al., 2018</xref>) and pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Loss of autophagy-related genes <italic>Atg16l1</italic>, <italic>Beclin1</italic>, and <italic>Rbc1cc1</italic> (encoding FIP200) in the myeloid compartment also confers enhanced antimicrobial immunity against certain intracellular pathogens, such as <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (<italic>S.typhimurium)</italic> and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> via induction of type I and II interferon responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Samie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, autophagy impacts antimicrobial immunity <italic>in vivo</italic> via innate immunosuppression as well as myeloid cell reprogramming.</p><p>Targeted elimination of intracellular pathogens by xenophagy, a form of selective autophagy, is well-described in cellular model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bauckman et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to non-selective autophagy triggered by nutrient stress, xenophagy functions to eliminate intracellular bacteria by sequestering them in autophagosomes and shuttling them to the degradative lysosomal compartment. Pathogenic bacteria have evolved mechanisms to either evade capture by the autophagy machinery, as by <italic>S.typhimurium</italic> and <italic>S.flexneri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birmingham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell-Valois et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2019b</xref>) or attenuate autophagic flux as by <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choy et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>S.typhimurium</italic> primarily resides in a protective compartment known as the <italic>Salmonella</italic> containing vacuole (SCV). There it prevents formation of the ATG5~ATG12-ATG16L1 complex at the bacterial vacuolar membrane via secretion of the effector SopF, which blocks ATG16L1 association with vacuolar ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2019b</xref>). Despite its ability to interfere with autophagy, infected host cells still recognize 10â€“20% of cytosolic <italic>S.typhimurium</italic> and subject this subpopulation to lysosomal degradation via mechanisms involving direct recognition of either the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang and Brumell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stolz et al., 2014</xref>) or damaged phagocytic membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thurston et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Compared to <italic>S.typhimurium</italic>, <italic>S.flexneri</italic> is not characterized by a vacuolar life cycle, but instead resides in the host cytoplasm. <italic>S.flexneri</italic> effector proteins IcsB and VirA are capable of completely inhibiting autophagic recognition to permit replication in the host cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ogawa et al., 2005</xref>). In response, the host cell attempts to further counteract <italic>S.flexneri</italic> infection via diverse mechanisms, such as coating bacterial cell surfaces with guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wandel et al., 2017</xref>) or sequestering bacteria in Septin cage-like structures to restrict their motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mostowy et al., 2010</xref>). To reveal these mechanisms, cell-based studies have largely utilized attenuated variants (e.g. IcsB or IcsB/VirA double mutants of <italic>S.flexneri</italic>) or strains that inefficiently colonize the host cytosol (e.g. <italic>S.typhimurium</italic> which express SopF). Thus, observations from <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic models must be reconciled with observations made in cell-based systems to fully describe the roles of autophagy in antimicrobial immunity. Importantly, there is a lack of understanding of how autophagy contributes to immunity against non-attenuated <italic>S.flexneri</italic>. This insight is especially lacking in relevant host cell types, such as macrophages that are infected by <italic>S.flexneri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashida et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the role of ATG16L1 in myeloid cells in response to infection by virulent <italic>S.flexneri</italic> (strain M90T). We observed that loss of <italic>Atg16l1</italic> in murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) enhanced <italic>S.flexneri</italic> elimination in cell culture, as well as by mice lacking ATG16L1 in the myeloid compartment (Atg16l1<italic>-</italic>cKO; LysM<italic>-Cre-</italic>mediated deletion of <italic>Atg16l1</italic>). We utilized multiplexed quantitative proteomics to characterize total protein, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination changes in wild type (WT) and ATG16L1-deficient (cKO) BMDMs either uninfected or infected with <italic>S.flexneri</italic>. Together these data provide a comprehensive catalogue of basal differences between WT and cKO BMDMs and the dynamic response of each to infection. Expectedly, significant differences were observed for components in the autophagy pathway, along with proteins involved in cell death, innate immune sensing and NF-ÎºB signaling. However, pharmacological inhibition of these pathways only modestly affected <italic>S.flexneri</italic> killing by BMDMs at later time points following infection. One key difference between control and ATG16L1-deficient BMDMs was a basal oxidative stress response, highlighted by accumulation of the sodium-independent cystine<italic>-</italic>glutamate antiporter (XCT) and multiple components of the glutathione metabolic pathway. XCT is responsible for importing the constituents required for glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis, and the consequent detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxides. Consistently, sustained pharmacological XCT inhibition in ATG16L1-deficient BMDMs compromised their viability. Likewise, XCT inhibition enhanced <italic>S.flexneri</italic> clearance by wild type BMDMs, demonstrating a role for this pathway in eliminating cytosolic bacteria. Finally, pharmacological scavenging of ROS permitted bacterial regrowth in BMDMs, thereby linking the antimicrobial capacity of ATG16L1-deficient macrophages to elevated ROS.</p><p>This study offers a comprehensive, multidimensional catalogue of proteome-wide changes in macrophages following infection by an enteric cytosolic pathogen, including key nodes of cell-autonomous immunity regulated by autophagy. Our findings demonstrate that ATG16L1 tunes antimicrobial immunity against cytosolic pathogens via oxidative stress as well as interferon responses. Pharmacological modulation of these pathways may represent opportunities for elimination of cytosolic pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Enhanced clearance of intracellular <italic>S.flexneri</italic> by loss of <italic>Atg16l1</italic></title><p>Recent studies identified that defective autophagy in macrophages enhances type I interferon and TNF-driven inflammatory signaling to promote antimicrobial immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Samie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Given these observations, we wanted to explore whether loss of <italic>Atg16l1</italic> affects killing of the intracellular enteric pathogen <italic>S.flexneri</italic> (strain M90T). To test this directly in BMDMs, cells from either control (<italic>Atg16l1</italic>-WT) or mice lacking ATG16L1 in the myeloid compartment (<italic>Atg16l1</italic>-cKO) were subjected to the gentamycin protection assay that enables quantification of intracellular bacteria by enumerating colony forming units (CFUs). We first determined the kinetics of <italic>S.flexneri</italic> killing by following BMDM infection in a time-course experiment with multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5.

This group of proteins included several factors involved in glutathione (GSH) synthesis, such as the glutamate-cysteine ligase regulatory subunit (GSH0/Glcm) and GSH synthetase (GSHB/Gss), as well as GSH regeneration, such as microsomal glutathione S-transferase (MGST1) and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), a major enzyme that assists in reducing oxidative stress in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayes et al., 2020</xref>).

We also detected an increase in the ratio between oxidized versus reduced GSH (GSSH/GSH) in lysates of cKO BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5â€”figure supplement 3Bâ€“D</xref>). Additionally, abundance of NQO1 was significantly higher in cKO BMDMs as determined by a specific NQO1-activated fluorescent probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5â€”figure supplement 3E and F</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Punganuru et al., 2019</xref>). Altogether, these findings indicate that cKO BMDMs are basally exposed to higher oxidative stress, and suggest that upregulation of redox homeostasis factors is required to maintain their viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tal et al., 2009</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we treated BMDMs with Erastin, a small molecule inhibitor of XCT which increases oxidative stress by diminishing the levels of reduced GSH in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). Time-course studies demonstrated that BMDMs exhibited decreased viability upon prolonged XCT inhibition, and revealed a greater dependency on this pathway when <italic>Atg16l1</italic> is deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6â€”figure supplement 1A</xref>). Given the central role of autophagy in mitochondrial turnover, we analyzed mitochondrial morphology and respiration as a possible source of oxidative damage in uninfected cKO BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5â€”figure supplement 3G and H</xref>). However, mitochondrial phenotypes remained consistent between WT and cKO groups. This warrants further investigation into the underlying mechanism(s) of elevated oxidative stress in ATG16L1-deficient BMDMs and posits that altered homeostasis of other organelles may contribute to the ROS accumulation in cKO BMDMs. Interestingly, the KGG(Ub) data displayed a marked response in the peroxisome gene set in cKO cells over WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5â€”figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting a possible link between this organelle and the elevated ROS signature.</p><p>Based on these observations, we hypothesized that higher levels of basal oxidative stress in cKO BMDMs may drive their enhanced ability eliminate cytosolic <italic>S.flexneri</italic>. To test this, we modulated oxidative stress in BMDMs using either Erastin, an oxidative stress inducer, or butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), a ROS scavenger. BMDMs were pre-treated with Erastin or BHA prior to infection and the treatments were maintained throughout the time-course experiments (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6â€”figure supplement 1B</xref>). Importantly, neither Erastin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6â€”figure supplement 1C and D</xref>) nor BHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6â€”figure supplement 1E and F</xref>) treatments increased BMDM cell death throughout the experimental time-course.

To identify mechanisms behind this phenotype we employed TMT-based multiplexed proteomic analysis â€“ a technology capable of near-comprehensive characterization of the global proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lapek et al., 2017</xref>). When isobaric multiplexing methods are coupled with enrichment, it enables quantification of PTMs on thousands of individual proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rose et al., 2016</xref>). This method is ideally suited for interrogation of a complex response such as infection of a host cell with an intracellular pathogen, where the diversity of downstream changes does not lend themselves to candidate approaches involving immunoblotting.</p><p>Our approach identifies multiple novel PTMs in components of inflammatory cytokine signaling, innate sensing and the core autophagy machinery that emerge as a consequence of <italic>S.flexneri</italic> infection. The comparison of early and late infection time-points shows complex dynamics that reflect PTM as well as global protein abundance. The comparison of WT versus ATG16L1-deficient BMDMs further reveals critical nodes in each of the above pathways that are under regulatory control by autophagy. The PTMs listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary files 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref> represent a sizeable fraction of the relevant post-translational changes that occur in macrophages during infection and/or upon loss of autophagy. We have provided interactive, web-accessible Spotfire Dashboards to enable user interrogation of the global proteome, phosphoproteome, and the KGG(Ub) datasets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://info.perkinelmer.com/analytics-resource-center">https://info.perkinelmer.com/analytics-resource-center</ext-link>).</p><p>Our study reveals that basal accumulation of cellular ROS in cKO BMDMs enforces a compensatory increase in antioxidant responses exemplified by elevated protein abundances of key components of the glutathione metabolic pathway. This permits cellular viability under relatively elevated cytosolic ROS levels, which in turn suppresses <italic>S.flexneri</italic> expansion in BMDMs. However, overall macrophage fitness is likely compromised owing to a shift in the basal redox pathway set-point. Pharmacological depletion of GSH phenocopies genetic loss of <italic>Atg16l1</italic> and enhances <italic>S.flexneri</italic> clearance in wild-type cells, whereas the ROS scavenger BHA reverses this phenotype, demonstrating a direct role for cellular ROS in bacterial clearance upon loss of autophagy.</p><p>Mice lacking <italic>Atg16l1</italic> in myeloid cells also demonstrate accelerated hepatic bacterial clearance <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, these findings have some limitations. First, murine enteric infection by <italic>S.flexneri</italic> requires deletion of the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome in intestinal epithelial cells (recently described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the scope of our observations is limited by the availability of murine models and primarily reveal a role of ATG16L1 in myeloid cells during acute bacterial infection. Second, we observe a liver-specific impact of ATG16L1 deletion in the myeloid compartment because splenic <italic>S.flexneri</italic> colonization was comparable between genotypes, while no colonization of lung tissue was detected. However, the broad deletion of <italic>Atg16l1</italic> in the myeloid lineage via LysM-<italic>Cre</italic> raises a possibility that Kupffer cells alone may not be the sole drivers of accelerated hepatic clearance <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additional genetic models are required to directly test the role of autophagy in Kupffer cells, and the intestinal epithelium, as relevant sites of mucosal antimicrobial immunity.</p><p>In addition to demonstrating a role for autophagy in antimicrobial immunity via modulation of oxidative stress, our study provides the most comprehensive multiplexed proteomic analysis to date of the macrophage response to cytosolic bacterial infection. We hope this novel resource will be of broad utility to the study of myeloid signal transduction, host-pathogen interaction, and innate immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal experiments were performed under protocols approved by the Genentech Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Ninety-six fractions were consolidated into 12 samples, acidified with formic acid and vacuum dried. The samples were resuspended in 5% formic acid, desalted on StageTips and vacuum dried.

Approximately 2 Âµg of peptides were loaded on a 75 Âµm capillary column packed in-house with Sepax GP-C18 resin (1.8 Âµm, 150 Ã…, Sepax Technologies) to a final length of 35 cm. Peptides for total protein analysis were separated using a 180 min linear gradient from 8% to 23% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode. The scan sequence began with FTMS1 spectra (resolutionÂ =Â 120,000; mass range of 350â€“1400 <italic>m/z</italic>; max injection time of 50 ms; AGC target of 1e6; dynamic exclusion for 60 s with aÂ Â±Â 10 ppm window).

For all datasets, a 50 ppm precursor ion mass tolerance was selected with tryptic specificity up to two missed cleavages. For the global proteome and serine/threonine phosphorylated datasets a 0.8 Da fragment ion tolerance was selected. While for the tyrosine phosphorylated and KGG (ubiquitin) datasets a 0.02 Da fragment ion tolerance was selected. The global proteome and phosphorylated datasets used a fixed modification of N-ethylmaleimide on cysteine residues (+125.0477) as well as TMT 11-plex on Lysine and the peptide N-term (+229.1629). The ubiquitylated data set used a fixed modification of N-ethylmaleimide on cysteine residues (+125.0477) as well as TMT 11-plex on the peptide N-term (+229.1629). For variable modifications the global proteome dataset used methionine oxidation (+15.9949) as well as TMT 11-plex on tyrosine (+229.1629). The phosphorylated dataset used the same variable modifications as the global proteome dataset plus phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine (+79.9663). Finally, the KGG(Ub) dataset used methionine oxidation (+15.9949), TMT 11 plex on tyrosine and lysine (+229.1629), as well as TMT 11 PlexÂ +ubiquitylation on lysine (343.2059). PSMs were filtered to a 1% peptide FDR at the run level using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirkpatrick et al., 2013</xref>). PSM data within each plex and dataset (global proteome, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation) was aggregated and these results were subsequently filtered to 2% protein FDR. For PSMs passing the peptide and protein FDR filters within the phosphorylated and ubiquitylated datasets, phosphorylation and ubiquitylation site localization was assessed using a modified version of the AScore algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beausoleil et al., 2006</xref>) and reassigned accordingly. Finally, reporter ion intensity values were determined for each dataset and plex using the Mojave algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhuang et al., 2013</xref>) with an isolation width of 0.7.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-10"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis of global proteomics and phosphoproteomic data</title><p>Quantification and statistical testing of global proteomics data were performed by MSstatsTMT v1.8.0, an open-source R/Bioconductor packageÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>). MSstatsTMT was used to create quantification reports and statistical testing reports using the Peptide Spectrum Matches (PSM) as described above. First, PSMs were filtered out if they were (1) from decoy proteins; (2) from peptides with length less than 7; (3) with isolation specificity less than 70%; (4) with reporter ion intensity less than 2^eight noise estimate; (5) from peptides shared by more than one protein; (6) with summed reporter ion intensity (across all eleven channels) lower than 30,000; (7) with missing values in more than nine channels. In the case of redundant PSMs (i.e. multiple PSMs in one MS run corresponding to the same peptide ion), only the single PSM with the least missing values or highest isolation specificity or highest maximal reporter ion intensity was retained for subsequent analysis. Multiple fractions from the same TMT mixture were combined in MSstatsTMT. In particular, if the same peptide ion was identified in multiple fractions, only the single fraction with the highest mean or maximal reporter ion intensity was kept. Next, MSstatsTMT generated a normalized quantification report across all the samples at the protein level from the processed PSM report. Global median normalization, which equalized the median of the reporter ion intensities across all the channels and TMT mixtures, was carried out to reduce the systematic bias between channels. The normalized reporter ion intensities of all the peptide ions mapped to a protein were summarized into a single protein level intensity in each channel and TMT mixture. For each protein, additional local normalization on the summaries was performed to reduce the systematic bias between different TMT mixtures. For the local normalization, we created an artifact reference channel by averaging over all the channels except 131C for each protein and TMT mixture. The channel 131C was removed in order to make each mixture have the same number of samples from each condition. The normalized quantification report at the protein level is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>. As a final step, the differential abundance analysis between conditions was performed in MSstatsTMT based on a linear mixed-effects model per protein. The inference procedure was adjusted by applying an empirical Bayes shrinkage. To test two-sided null hypothesis of no changes in abundance, the model-based test statistics were compared to the Student t-test distribution with the degrees of freedom appropriate for each protein or each PTM site. The resulting p values were adjusted to control the FDR with the method by Benjamini-Hochberg. The table with the statistical testing results for all the proteins is available as in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>. Quantification and statistical testing for phospho- and KGG(Ub)-sites data were performed by the same procedure as for global proteomics data with some modifications. First, PSMs from non-modified peptides were filtered out from the PSM report and the remaining preprocessing analyses were the same as above. Second, custom PTM site identifiers were created for each PSM by identifying the modified residue index in the reference proteome that was used to search the MS/MS spectra. Finally, all steps for quantification and differential abundance analysis were performed at the PTM site level, rather than the protein level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary files 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">10</xref>). The relative abundance of TMT reporter ion abundances in bar graphs throughout the paper stems from MSstatsTMT modeling and sums up to 1.0 for each Plex. Thus, the sum of all signal shown sums to 1.0 or 2.0 depending on whether the feature was quantified in one or both plexes. For the consolidated heatmaps showing proteome level changes immediately adjacent to any identified PTMs, the ComplexHeatmap R package was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-11"><title>Overview heatmaps/clustering</title><p>For the overview heatmaps showing PTM and global proteome datasets side by side, clustering was performed as follows. First, protein quantification results from MSstatsTMT for the PTM and global proteome datasets were merged with the phospho-proteome and KGG datasets, respectively. For each of the two combined datasets, the pheatmap R package was used to cluster the protein model results into 16 row wise clusters using the clustering method â€˜ward.Dâ€™. The columns of the dataset were kept static and not clustered.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-12"><title>Gene set enrichment analysis</title><p>Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using MsigDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liberzon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). Global proteome data were filtered to include features with an absolute value log2fc values of greater than one as well as adjusted p values of less than 0.05. Subsequently the data were filtered to require that every protein must be found in both multiplexed experiments.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors examine the role of ATG16L1 in macrophages in controlling <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> infection. The authors report that: (1) macrophages deficient in ATG16L1 demonstrate accelerated killing of <italic>Shigella flexneri in vitro</italic>, (2) mice harboring myeloid ATG16L1 deficiency control Shigella better <italic>in vivo</italic>, (3) a panel of changes in global proteome and post-translational modifications occur, pointing to an accumulation of ROS in ATG16L-deficient BMDM, and (4) depletion of or reduced but not oxidized GSH in cells with Erastin accelerates Shigella clearance by WT macrophages.</p><p>The authors have also created a website for users to investigate the proteomics data in detail, providing an important resource to the community.</p><p>The discovery of a new mechanism by which autophagy proteins affect host defenses would be very exciting. However, although the authors present a compelling model of how Atg16L1 promotes Shigella survival based on their proteomics data; the manuscript currently falls short of proving the model. Although the authors show increased ROS in Atg16L1-deficient macrophages, they do not present evidence to show this is responsible for the modest decrease in CFUs <italic>in vitro</italic> and whether any of the <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotypes directly relate to the <italic>in vivo</italic> decrease in liver burden in the absence of ATG16L1 in myeloid cells.</p><p>Thus, there are still many critical questions that remain unanswered. These critical questions are as follows. Does ATG16L suppress Shigella clearance in macrophages through regulating ROS <italic>in vivo</italic>? Does this role of ATG16L involve the process of autophagy? In addition, the authors make a point of emphasizing the strengths of their proteomic approach in identifying downstream mechanisms; however, this aspect of the manuscript requires further verification and detailed analysis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Revisions required to connect ROS production in macrophages to control of Shigella replication <italic>in vivo</italic>:</p><p>1. The authors report that Atg16L1-cKO mice display reduced shigella liver burden and conclude that macrophages deficient in ATG16L1 demonstrate an accelerated killing of Shigella <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, LysM-Cre mediates deletion in a wide range of myeloid cells systemically in the mouse. Is the effect the authors reported specific to the liver? Is this mediated by Atg16L1-deficient Kupffer cells in the liver?</p><p>2. There are numerous ways autophagy proteins affect inflammatory responses (as also observed in the authors' proteomic analysis) and, therefore, the <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype may be due to inflammatory differences and not due to a direct role for Atg16L1 in a cell-intrinsic antimicrobial pathway in macrophages. The authors present evidence that several cytokine pathways are significantly affected by loss of Atg16l1, including interferons and TNF. Since autophagy affects cytokine production and release, is it possible that increased ROS and pathogen clearance is a consequence of increased cytokine signaling in the basal state and after infection? This could also explain the observed changes in protein abundance or modifications.</p><p>3. For the Erastin data, this was performed in WT BMDMs, not ATG16L1 deficient BMDMs, and therefore, may have nothing to do with what is going on in ATG16L1 cKOs. The authors will need to show directly that increased ROS in ATG16L1 cKOs is leading to decreased bacterial replication. In addition, the authors do not demonstrate that the Erastin treatment resulted in elevated ROS. Notably, the difference in CFUs following Erastin treatment was much larger in magnitude than that reported for loss of ATG16L1. Another helpful approach here may be the addition of a ROS scavenger (e.g. NAC) in experimental conditions to functionally test the role of ROS in the observed phenotypes.</p><p>4. There appears to be significant variability in the GSSG/GSH ratio in sFigure 7a. Is there a more reproducible or comprehensive way to measure the redox state? Perhaps by additionally examining protein carbonyl adduct formation or other forms of damage (lipids, DNA)?</p><p>5. As a result of the absence of linkage between the authors' observations, there are many times that data are over-interpreted. For example, in the last line of abstract: &quot;These findings demonstrate that control of oxidative stress by ATG16L1 regulates antimicrobial immunity against intracellular pathogens&quot;. The authors never show that control of oxidative stress by ATG16L1 regulates antimicrobial immunity. Another example is in Lines 132-135- &quot;Our findings demonstrate that ATG16L1 tunes antimicrobial immunity against cytosolic pathogens via the oxidative stress responseâ€¦&quot;. This is not supported by the data presented. The authors also start a number of sentences with the &quot;Interestingly&quot; or &quot;Unexpectedly&quot; even when the data could be expected. For example, Line 310, loss of autophagy has already been linked to increased ROS in other systems. Please address these issues with text revision.</p><p>Revisions required to evaluate and verify the proteomics data:</p><p>1. To examine potential mechanisms, the authors performed global proteomic analysis in BMDMs treated ex vivo with Shigella. This led to the identification of numerous modifications in phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and protein abundance. The authors focused on autophagy cargo adaptors, and described numerous modifications to TAX1BP1, OPTN, p62, etc. The proteomic analysis was performed by tandem mass tagging, which allowed comparisons across 2 11-plex experiments. The authors provide a detailed overview of modifications of proteins in the autophagy pathway, including substrate-specific receptors. However, there are a few limitations of the study: (1) There isn't much in the way of comparisons with phosphorylation and ubiquitylation patterns seen previously when these proteins â€“ e.g. TAX1BP1 or OPTN â€“ are phosphorylated during selective forms of autophagy. This has been examined in multiple papers previously (e.g. PMID: 26365381; PMID: 27035970; PMID: 25972374 ).</p><p>2. Although all the modification data is nice and provides an overview, the authors don't really use it for analysis of mechanisms. Are any of the phosphorylation or ubiquitylation events central to the response to Shigella or loss of ATG16L1? As presented, the modification side of the story doesn't go anywhere mechanistically.</p><p>3. The stoichiometry of the modifications are not addressed. While some modifications appear to have pretty large fold changes, many are only ~2-fold, so it may be that this is a tiny fraction of the protein that is modified. Therefore, it is hard to know what is significant biologically without further follow-up. For example, is the modification of the cargo adaptors linked with removal of Shigella directly or is it some other role (for example turnover of aggregated proteins as a result of increased ROS). For example, TAX1BP1 T494 phosphorylation is already maximal in the ATG16L1 KO without Shigella (Figure 3). Similarly, the relationship between phosphorylation and ubiquitylation on the same polypeptide (i.e. combinatorial modification) isn't addressed.</p><p>4. The e3 ubiquitin ligase and xenobiotic metabolism pathways are increased in ATG16L1 KO macrophages. This is suggestive of increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity. Since AhR is a driver of ROS in the cell, as part of the xenobiotic detoxifying response, it would be interesting to see if AhR was involved in the observed phenotype.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62320.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Revisions required to connect ROS production in macrophages to control of Shigella replication <italic>in vivo</italic>:</p><p>1.

As such, it is unable to colonize the intestinal mucosa in mice unless genetically modified strains are utilized that compromise inflammasome function in the intestinal epithelium (recently described by Mitchell et al., 2020).

Indeed, our quantitative mass spectrometry data (new Figure 5â€”figure supplement 1) and RNA-Seq data (new panels Figure 5â€”figure supplement 2A and B) demonstrate a significant enrichment of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways either at baseline or following infection of cKO BMDMs. We addressed the role of TNFa and Type I Interferon signaling in pathogen clearance using BMDM infection model. Indeed, blocking TNFa or IFNAR1 resulted in a modest but significant rescue of bacterial proliferation in cKO, but not WT, BMDMs (new data in Figure 5â€”figure supplement 2C-H). This is in contrast to modulation of ROS levels that affect bacterial proliferation in both WT and cKO BMDMs (new Figure 6). Therefore, it is likely that contributions from pro-inflammatory signaling and ROS together drive bacterial clearance in the BMDM infection model, with a more pronounced phenotype in cells lacking ATG16L1.</p><p>We then decided to follow this observation <italic>in vivo</italic> and performed a study aiming to assess the role of overactive interferon signaling inherent to ATG16L1 KO animals in clearing <italic>S.flexneri</italic>. We focused on blocking type I IFN signaling given the more significant impact of a-IFNAR1 treatment on cKO BMDMs (new panel Figure 5â€”figure supplement 2G). Briefly, mice were pre-treated via intraperitoneal injections (IP) with isotype control or anti-IFNAR1 antibodies for 24h. We used anti-IFNAR1 antibody clone MAR1-5A3 2.5 mg per mouse (Leinco Technologies). Mice were injected with antibodies again prior infection (0.5 mg per mouse, IP) and infected with <italic>S.flexneri</italic> as before (IV). Subsequently, 24h after infection the livers were collected for CFU analysis.</p><p>The result shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> demonstrates a significant CFU reduction in livers from ATG16L1-cKO animals in the isotype control group, which is consistent with our observations presented in panels Figure 1D and 1E. We also observed a trend towards higher CFU counts in ATG16L1-cKO animals treated with the anti-IFNAR1 antibody. However, this experiment failed to demonstrate a statistically significant increase in CFUs within each genotype. <italic>S.flexneri</italic> CFUs did not increase significantly between isotype-treated and anti-IFNAR1-treated WT or cKO animals. In addition to the inherent variability of this challenging model, other factors could contribute to the lack of a clear rescue of bacterial proliferation. These include an incomplete pharmacological blockade of IFNAR1 signaling and redundant pathways which control bacterial proliferation. Additional genetic models (e.g. combined deletion of <italic>Atg16l1</italic> and <italic>Ifnar1</italic>) or combination therapies are currently out-of-scope for the study but supported by our findings.</p><p>Taken together, experiments to address this query led us to acknowledge a contribution of pro-inflammatory signaling in clearing <italic>S.flexneri</italic> in our <italic>in vitro</italic> BMDM infection model and introduce a new Figure S8 to reflect this aspect.

This data is presented in new panels Figure 6B and 6C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the authors do not demonstrate that the Erastin treatment resulted in elevated ROS.</p></disp-quote><p>In the initial submission, we provided data showing that Erastin treatment for 24 hours resulted in elevated oxidative stress, prior to evaluating its effects on bacterial clearance (former panel Supplemental Figure 7G). While WT BMDMs exhibited a clear increase in oxidative stress upon Erastin treatment, ATG16L1-deficient BMDMs <italic>with basally elevated oxidative stress</italic> did not show a further increase at this time point. We also observed that prolonged Erastin treatment resulted in BMDM cytotoxicity, with ATG16L1-deficient BMDMs exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to the inhibitor at a later time point (new Figure 6â€”figure supplement 1A). This is consistent with our findings that ATG16L1-deficient BMDMs are dependent on XCT/GSH mediated antioxidant pathways. It is technically challenging to measure oxidative stress at a later time-point since a large population of ATG16L1-deficient BMDMs are undergoing cell death. However, following Reviewer recommendations, we measured oxidative stress upon prolonged Erastin treatment over 48h. We used high content microscopy enabling imaging of larger cell populations. Consistent with our previous observations, we detected a highly significant increase in CellRox probe mean intensity between untreated WT and cKO BMDMs (this data is shown here as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> and presented in a new panel Figure 5â€”figure supplement 3A). Consistent with the established role of Erastin in increasing oxidative stress, we also observed a significant increase in CellRox probe mean intensity following 48h treatment with Erastin. We hope that the data presented here addresses the Reviewer question. Taken together, we decided to remove the initial data presented in the first submission in relation to this question (former panel Supplemental Figure 7G).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Quantification of CellRox green mean intensity in WT and cKO BMDMs.</title><p>Graph shows single cell data from high content imaging (n = 1).

We noted that only a subpopulation of ATG16L1-deficient BMDMs demonstrates increased cellular ROS levels in our single-cell imaging data presented in Figure 5E. We have followed up on this observation using high content single-cell imaging for cellular ROS and obtained very similar data for a large population of cells (&gt;1000 cells per genotype). We believe this stochasticity is an important point to convey and provide the high content imaging data to the supplement of the revised manuscript (new panel Figure 5â€”figure supplement 3A).</p><p>The GSSG/GSH ELISA-type experiments presented in Figure 5â€”figure supplement 3B-D, to which the Reviewer refers, are performed using cell lysate from a population of cells, which likely accounts for some of this variability since it fails to achieve single-cell resolution as in the above assays. An additional factor contributing to this variability is the exclusive usage of primary macrophages in this study, which lends itself to variability between independent experiments. Nonetheless, we believe the data presented in Figure 5â€”figure supplement 3B-D show a consistent trend across independent biological repeats of the assay.</p><p>Additionally, we now provide further evidence to support our observations. In our initial submission, we noted that ATG16L1 deficient BMDMs exhibit elevated levels of the NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase NQO1 (Figure 5B). Elevated NQO1 levels and activity are indicative of a heightened redox state (Reviewed by Ross et al., 2017; Siegel et al., 2018; Raina et al., 1999). To address the Reviewerâ€™s query, we have synthesized a recently described NQO1-activated fluorescent probe (Punganuru et al., 2019), which enabled us to assess the redox state of WT and ATG16L1-deficient BMDMs using flow cytometry. These experiments represent a highly sensitive assay to measure redox state at the single-cell level in primary cells and demonstrate and increased MFI of the probe in cKO BMDMs. This data constitute new panels Figure 5â€”figure supplement 3E and F.</p><p>We have also attempted quantification of s-GSH adducts and 4-HNE damaged lipids by competitive ELISA kits, however were not able to achieve reliable assay performance using assay standards, which is an essential step prior evaluating assay results (data not shown).</p><p>We hope the Reviewer will find our answer and the provided data satisfactory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

To examine potential mechanisms, the authors performed global proteomic analysis in BMDMs treated ex vivo with Shigella.

However, the totality of the insights generated by multiplexed TMT-MS revealed altered oxidative stress response as a fundamentally important aspect of anti-microbial immunity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Although all the modification data is nice and provides an overview, the authors don't really use it for analysis of mechanisms. Are any of the phosphorylation or ubiquitylation events central to the response to Shigella or loss of ATG16L1? As presented, the modification side of the story doesn't go anywhere mechanistically.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this question. We agree that our initial manuscript did not sufficiently highlight how the PTM data contributed to our conclusions and have tried to remedy that in this revision. Our initial observation that basal mitochondrial function was largely intact in ATG16L1-deficient cells (new Figure 5â€”figure supplement 3G-H) was surprising and prompted us to query additional organelle proteomes in the TMT-MS modification dataset. We focused on mitochondria and peroxisomes, given the established role of these organelles with modulation of cellular ROS. While we did not detect significant or broad ranging accumulation of mitochondrial or peroxisomal proteins, a specific enrichment of peroxisomal matrix proteins in the ubiquitinated fraction was observed in ATG16L1-deficient BMDMs, as shown in the GSEA heatmap presented in the new Figure 5â€”figure supplement 1C. An additional hit in the PTM dataset that points us to the intersection of oxidative stress and the peroxisome is elevated ubiquitination of Fis1 at lysine-20 (FIS1_K20). Fis1 is known to play a key role in peroxisomal homeostasis. From the phosphoproteomics data, ubiquitin phosphorylation at serine-57 also stands out given its recent connection to oxidative stress signaling in yeast (Hepowit et al., 2020).</p><p>These findings leverage the modification (PTM) data generated by TMT-MS and reveal that elevated basal oxidative stress upon Atg16l1 loss appears more closely connected to peroxisomal rather than mitochondrial dysfunction. This commentary has been included in the revised manuscript (Page 15; Lines 428-431). Additional follow up work will be required to elucidate the full mechanistic picture connecting deficient autophagy to the peroxisomal and oxidative stress pathways, but remain outside the scope of our current submission</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The stoichiometry of the modifications are not addressed. While some modifications appear to have pretty large fold changes, many are only ~2-fold, so it may be that this is a tiny fraction of the protein that is modified. Therefore, it is hard to know what is significant biologically without further follow-up. For example, is the modification of the cargo adaptors linked with removal of Shigella directly or is it some other role (for example turnover of aggregated proteins as a result of increased ROS). For example, TAX1BP1 T494 phosphorylation is already maximal in the ATG16L1 KO without Shigella (Figure 3).</p></disp-quote><p>In the context of MS proteomics technologies, TMT and the majority of other approaches report relative rather than absolute quantitative values. Moreover, the majority of physiologically meaningful PTM level changes occur at sub-stoichiometric levels, owing to subcellular compartmentalization and cellular heterogeneity in the responses. Single cell profiling technologies consistently show that a physiologically relevant experimental perturbation like infection causes a diverse range of responses across a population of cells, especially when considering that individual cells are infected at different rates both <italic>in vivo</italic> and ex vivo. In contrast, non-physiological biochemical treatments such as high level LPS or CpG stimulation show more consistent, population-wide changes but do not faithfully recapitulate the infection cycle of a pathogen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the relationship between phosphorylation and ubiquitylation on the same polypeptide (i.e. combinatorial modification) isn't addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the transient nature of most ubiquitination events, the low stoichiometries of both ubiquitination and phosphorylation sites within the population, and the distribution of these post-translational modifications across the proteome, the frequency doubly modified peptides bearing these two heterogenous marks is exceedingly rare in this and other proteomics data. This can be seen within the existing data when looking at the relative (in)frequency of multiply phosphorylated or multiply ubiquitinated peptides, compared to singly modified peptides.</p><p>It is important to call out an analytical caveat that additionally hampers this investigation. Permuting an all by all matrix of two post-translational modifications at proteome scale results in a combinatorial explosion that poses challenges for the software tools tasked with identifying and quality filtering these rare peptide spectral matches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The e3 ubiquitin ligase and xenobiotic metabolism pathways are increased in ATG16L1 KO macrophages. This is suggestive of increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity. Since AhR is a driver of ROS in the cell, as part of the xenobiotic detoxifying response, it would be interesting to see if AhR was involved in the observed phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>During the revision we took a deeper look by performing GSEA with larger curated MSigDb gene set collections to see if there was an indication of AhR pathway that might further explain the quantitative changes in <italic>S.flexneri</italic> infected and ATG16L1-deficient macrophages. Unfortunately, no evidence was found that points to a connection of this <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infection of WT or cKO BMDMs directly to the AhR signaling pathway.</p></body></sub-article></article>
