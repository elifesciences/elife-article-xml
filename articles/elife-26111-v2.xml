and cell division in all kingdoms of life. Diverse regulatory domains adapt PP2C phosphatases to specific functions, but how these domains control phosphatase activity was unknown. We present structures representing active and inactive states of the PP2C phosphatase SpoIIE from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. Based on structural analyses and genetic and biochemical experiments, we identify an α-helical switch that shifts a carbonyl oxygen into the active site to coordinate a metal cofactor. Our analysis indicates that this switch is widely conserved among PP2C family members, serving as a platform to control phosphatase activity in response to diverse inputs. Remarkably, the switch is shared with proteasomal proteases, which we identify as evolutionary and structural relatives of PP2C phosphatases. Although these proteases use an unrelated catalytic mechanism, rotation of equivalent helices controls protease activity by movement of the equivalent carbonyl oxygen into the active site.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26111.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26111.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26111.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To regulate the activity of proteins, cells often modify them by adding or removing chemical groups called phosphates. Therefore, the enzymes that add or remove these phosphate groups must be tightly regulated so that they are active at the right time and place. Enzymes known as phosphatases remove phosphate groups from proteins and the PP2Cs are one such family of enzymes that are found in bacteria, plants and animals. Despite their broad importance, it was not clear how cells control the PP2Cs.</p><p>One way to understand how an enzyme is controlled is to compare the three-dimensional structures of the enzyme when it is active and when it is inactive. Bradshaw et al. used a PP2C enzyme from bacteria as a model to understand how the cell regulates other PP2Cs.</p><p>The experiments reveal that the bacterial enzyme has a structural element that acts as a switch to control its activity. The phosphatase needs to bind metal ions to be active, and movement of the switch promotes binding of the metal ions to activate the phosphatase. The switch is also found in other members of the PP2C family. Furthermore, members of a seemingly unrelated family of enzymes called the proteasomal proteases, which degrade proteins, also have a similar architecture and are controlled by a similar switch. Thus, the phosphatase and protease families may have a common evolutionary history.</p><p>Multiple members of the PP2C family are involved in cancer and other diseases. The discovery of a regulatory switch provides new opportunities to use drugs to control phosphatase activity in patients. Many cancer drugs that are currently in use or are under development target enzymes that add phosphate groups to proteins, but efforts to target the phosphatases have largely been unsuccessful. Bradshaw et al.’s findings may enable the development of new drugs that target protein phosphatases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26111.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26111.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>protein phosphatase</kwd><kwd>proteasome</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd><kwd>molecular evolution</kwd><kwd>cell fate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM18568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Losick</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>082829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilkinson</surname><given-names>Anthony J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG 2051-10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bradshaw</surname><given-names>Niels</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zimanyi</surname><given-names>Christina M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structures of active and inactive conformations of a PP2C family phosphatase reveal a conserved switch that controls enzymatic activity and point to an unexpected relationship between phosphatases and proteasomal proteases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reversible protein phosphorylation is widely used in biological systems to control the activity of enzymes or the association of proteins with other proteins. Kinases and phosphatases control the phosphorylation state of target proteins in response to specific cellular or environmental cues, making reversible phosphorylation a flexible mechanism to control diverse biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huse and Kuriyan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taylor and Kornev, 2011</xref>). Here we address the question of how members of the PP2C family of serine/threonine phosphatases are regulated to control processes such as cell growth and death, development, and responses to stress in all kingdoms of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kerk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lammers and Lavi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shi, 2009</xref>). Among serine/threonine phosphatases, a distinctive feature of the PP2C family is that the activity of a conserved catalytic domain is controlled by diverse regulatory domains that are often linked in cis to the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang and Shi, 2004</xref>). We investigated the PP2C family member SpoIIE, which controls the activation of the cell-specific transcription factor σ<sup>F</sup> during the developmental process of sporulation in the bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>.</p><p>Sporulation involves the formation of an asymmetrically-positioned septum that divides the developing cell into large and small cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stragier and Losick, 1996</xref>). SpoIIE is the most upstream member of a three-protein pathway that activates σ<sup>F</sup> in the small cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It does so by dephosphorylating the phosphoprotein SpoIIAA-P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duncan et al., 1995</xref>). Dephosphorylated SpoIIAA, in turn, displaces σ<sup>F</sup> from the anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB to release the free and active transcription factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diederich et al., 1994</xref>). A long-standing mystery is how SpoIIE is regulated to generate dephosphorylated SpoIIAA selectively in the small cell. Recent work indicates that SpoIIE initially associates with the asymmetrically-positioned cytokinetic ring and then during cytokinesis is handed off to the adjacent cell pole, which will become the small cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradshaw and Losick, 2015</xref>). Cell-specific activation is mediated by the self-association of SpoIIE molecules in the small cell, which protects the protein from proteolysis and activates the phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradshaw and Losick, 2015</xref>).

This active site is embedded in the conserved fold of the PP2C domain, which is shared by all PP2C family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shi, 2009</xref>). The PP2C domain is paired with diverse regulatory modules (over 1500 unique domain architectures have been identified in the InterPro database) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitchell et al., 2015</xref>), but how these regulatory modules control phosphatase activity was not understood. Here we identify a pair of α-helices at the heart of the regulatory mechanism that rotate to position a carbonyl oxygen to bind an active site Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion and activate SpoIIE. We present evidence that this mechanism is widely conserved among PP2C family members. Remarkably, rotation of equivalent α-helices is also used to control an unrelated catalytic mechanism in the structurally similar family of enzymes that form the catalytic core of the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arciniega et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ruschak and Kay, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shi and Kay, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sousa et al., 2000</xref>).

We present a structure of a fragment that includes the entire PP2C phosphatase domain and a portion of the adjacent regulatory domain. This structure shows that the regulatory domain mediates the formation of dimers between SpoIIE molecules, and evidence indicates that dimerization is needed to activate the phosphatase. We also present a structure of the phosphatase domain alone. A comparison of the structures reveals that dimerization rotates two α-helices of the PP2C fold (α1 and α2 of the conserved PP2C fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 1996</xref>) relative to the phosphatase core.

In the dimer, the switch helices are held in position by intramolecular contacts with the long α-helix of the regulatory domain and intermolecular contacts between switch helices across the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B and C</xref>). We found that single-amino acid substitutions at either of these contact sites blocked phosphatase activity but not stabilization or localization to the small cell.

The V697A substitution also enhanced phosphatase activity as measured in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradshaw and Losick, 2015</xref>). But how this substitution acts had been unclear. Our structure of SpoIIE<sup>590–827</sup> reveals that in the monomeric state, V697 packs in a hydrophobic pocket between the β strands at the base of the PP2C domain and the switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In contrast, N665 from the switch packs near V697 in the structure of SpoIIE<sup>457–827</sup> in the dimeric state. We therefore hypothesize that in the wild type, V697 stabilizes the conformation of the switch helices in the inactive monomeric state and that truncating V697 to alanine stabilizes the active conformation by promoting solvation of the polar residue N665 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Thus, and according to our hypothesis, replacing V697 with alanine destabilizes the inactive state by removing hydrophobic contacts and favors the active conformation by eliminating a repulsive interaction. Reinforcing this hypothesis, substitution of V697 with a bulky hydrophobic residue (phenylalanine), which could similarly destabilize the inactive conformation, also causes constitutive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradshaw and Losick, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Other gain-of-function mutants that stimulate phosphatase activity in the context of a loss-of-function mutant support this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carniol et al., 2004</xref>). The amino acid substitutions in these mutants (L479F, K649T, I650L, I684V, L695W, and V728M) were all located at positions in the structure that could contribute to positioning the switch helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). I684 and L695 project down from the β-strands at the base of the phosphatase domain to contact the switch. K649 and I650 are themselves part of the switch helices and project across the dimer interface. V728 projects towards the switch from the loop implicated in substrate binding in other PP2C phosphatases. Finally, L479 projects up towards the switch from the long α-helix of the regulatory domain. We conclude that, like V697A, these amino-acid substitutions bias the phosphatase domain to the active conformation of the switch region.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The switch helices move a conserved manganese-coordinating residue into the active site</title><p>How does repositioning the switch region activate phosphatase activity?

The two core metal ions, known as M1 and M2, directly participate in catalysis by deprotonating a water molecule that serves as the nucleophile for hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 1996</xref>). Based on the universally conserved architecture of the catalytic center, the M2 metal of SpoIIE is predicted to be coordinated by the side-chain of D628 and the carbonyl oxygen of G629 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schroeter et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

This is supported by the fact that although our previously published structures included manganese in the crystallization conditions, the M2 site was unoccupied and the active site contained only a single manganese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levdikov et al., 2012</xref>).

By varying the manganese concentration in the presence of saturating substrate, we determined that SpoIIE was cooperatively activated (<italic>h</italic> = 2.0) with a K<sub>1/2</sub> for manganese of 0.56 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Based on these structures, analysis of the function of SpoIIE mutants in vivo, and biochemical experiments, we propose that the movement of two helices at the base of the phosphatase domain, forming the switch region, activates the phosphatase by positioning the carbonyl oxygen of a conserved glycine to coordinate manganese in the active site. Importantly, and as we will explain, structural and functional data additionally suggest that the switch mechanism is broadly conserved among PP2C phosphatases. Unexpectedly, and underscoring the flexibility and conservation of the switch, our analysis also reveals that a similar module controls the activity of proteases that form the catalytic core of the proteasome.

Hab1 contacts SnRK2 primarily through a sub-domain (termed the ‘flap’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pullen et al., 2004</xref>]) that is variable in PP2C phosphatases and that packs against the switch helices (blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B and C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Soon et al., 2012</xref>). In the presence of abscisic acid, the PYR/PYL/RCAR family of abscisic-acid-binding proteins inhibit Hab1 by binding to a site that overlaps with the binding site for SnRK2, suggesting that the switch could be influenced both by substrate and regulator binding. This could be a more general feature of PP2C phosphatases; the corresponding substrate-binding domain in SpoIIE changed conformation upon SpoIIE dimerization and activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4D</xref>), suggesting that the conformational change of the switch could couple regulatory inputs to substrate binding.

Structural and genetic studies revealed that adapter activity is regulated by contacts between the RssB regulatory domain and the switch helices that are mediated by dimerization, similar to our observations for SpoIIE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battesti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levchenko et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5B and C</xref>). Because the primary function of an adapter protein is to mediate protein-protein interactions, we hypothesize that for RssB the switch couples regulatory inputs to substrate binding (rather than to phosphatase activity) through a mechanism such as proposed above for Hab1. Thus, the switch mechanism may not only provide a flexible platform for adapting phosphatase activity to various inputs but also to control different outputs.

Several lines of evidence suggest that this mechanism is conserved for the eukaryotic proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arciniega et al., 2014</xref>) and is additionally used by chaperones that promote proteasome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wani et al., 2015</xref>).

Independent analysis of structural and sequence similarity suggest that this is a result of common evolutionary ancestry. Structural comparison by the ECOD database, which classifies the evolutionary relationships of protein folds places PP2C phosphatases and the proteasome proteases in the same ‘X-group’, which is consistent with homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). Independently, sequence-based searches using HHPRED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Söding et al., 2005</xref>) detected weak sequence similarity between phosphatases and the broad family of NTN-hydrolases that includes the proteasome proteases. For example, using the SpoIIE phosphatase domain sequence to search hidden Markov model alignments for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> proteins identified weak sequence similarity to D-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase, an NTN hydrolase.

Acquisition of a new catalytic mechanism requires that the ancestral protein retain function while acquiring the changes necessary for the new catalytic mechanism. However, conversion between the catalytic mechanisms of the proteasomal proteases and PP2C phosphatases would require multiple changes that would individually inactivate both activities (including circular permutation of the enzyme, loss/gain of metal binding, and charge swaps of residues at essential positions for catalysis). The conservation of the allosteric regulatory switch suggests a possible solution to this dilemma: namely, that the intermediate was a noncatalytic pseudoenzyme that retained the allosteric regulatory switch. RssB is an example of this sort of hypothetical pseudoenzyme; RssB uses the PP2C switch to regulate protease adapter function without functioning as a phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battesti et al., 2013</xref>). An RssB-like intermediate would provide evolutionary pressure to preserve the regulatory mechanism, while creating a condition of neutrality to other mutations that would allow the new chemistry to evolve. Indeed, <italic>E. coli</italic> RssB lacks the C-terminal β strand of PP2C phosphatases that is substituted by the N-terminus of the proteases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting a pathway for how a gene fusion event could produce the topological change required to evolve protease activity.</p><p>Allosteric regulatory modules have facilitated the evolutionary diversification of enzyme families to respond to new regulatory inputs, and the regulatory mechanism we have described for PP2C phosphatases may have similarly facilitated phosphatase diversification. A recent investigation of the evolution of ligand specificity in PDZ domains proposed that allostery produces conformational flexibility and thus may arise as a consequence of evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Raman et al., 2016</xref>). Here we propose a mechanism whereby pre-existing allosteric regulatory modules such as we have identified for PP2C phosphatases facilitated the evolution of new enzymatic activities by transition through a pseudoenzyme intermediate that is pre-programmed for regulation. Pseudoenzymes are abundant (for example, 10% of kinase family members are pseudoenzymes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leslie, 2013</xref>) and thus may be important for their evolutionary potential in addition to their current biological functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construct design</title><p>The SpoIIE<sup>457–827</sup> construct was designed based on a putative sub-domain immediately N-terminal to the conserved PP2C phosphatase domain that we identified using HHPRED RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_010276">SCR_010276</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Söding et al., 2005</xref>).

Cells were immobilized on 2.5% agarose pads made with the sporulation resuspension medium and imaged on an Olympus BX-61 upright microscope with a 100X objective. Cells were segmented using SuperSegger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stylianidou et al., 2016</xref>) and analyzed with custom MatLab scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradshaw and Losick, 2015</xref>). Samples were taken from the same cultures for western blot analysis; cells were lysed using a FastPrep (MP-BIO, Santa Ana, CA) and blots were probed with polyclonal α-GFP antibody.<table-wrap

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Michael Laub, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper from Bradshaw, Losick and colleagues presents evidence that the PP2C-like phosphatase SpoIIE in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> undergoes a conformational change upon activation that involves dimerization and rotation of two key helices, which promote binding of the divalent ions crucial for catalysis. The structures are compelling and highly suggestive of the model proposed, with the biochemical and genetic evidence further substantiating the model. Notably, the authors synthesize their findings with the structures of several other PP2C family proteins to suggest that a similar switch is used throughout this family of proteins, including in proteasomal proteases.

Additionally, there was confusion about the claim that &quot;The results revealed that a continuous region of the dimer interface composed of six residues from the long α-helix of the regulatory domain and two residues from the switch helices were needed for all three aspects of SpoIIE function.&quot; It's not clear which 8 residues the authors are referring to here. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> highlights 12 positions in total, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> highlights 10 residues at the interface, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> shows data for 16 mutants all of which seem defective to some extent in at least one of the assays shown. Some confusion also arises from an apparent error in the text in the subsection “Amino acid substitutions in the dimer interface block function” – &quot;two&quot; should be &quot;three&quot; (i.e., E639, E642, and I667), as stated in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> legend. In short, a significant improvement in clarity is needed – it almost seemed as if the authors were trying to be so succinct here that they made this section rather opaque. Also, perhaps most importantly, it's not clear one can argue that 'all three aspects' of function (see a similar statement in the subsection “Repositioning the switch region is necessary for phosphatase activation”) are perturbed in these mutants if one of those functions is stability, i.e. if it's not stable, you can't assess phosphatase activity or localization since there's no protein present!

Has this been, or can this be, tested? For all of the gain-of-function mutants, the prediction is that they are constitutive dimers – can this be tested biochemically, e.g. using the SEC-MALLS assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>?

Also, regarding the number of Mn atoms indicated by the Mn anomalous difference map: because the resolution was so low (5.4 Å), it's not impossible that two atoms (or one atom) could appear as one electron density blob.

We had only done this for one of the mutants previously (L646K). We have now deleted the FtsH degradation tag from the nine variants of SpoIIE that were destabilized and assayed SpoIIE protein levels and σ<sup>F</sup> activation during sporulation. We found that all nine variants accumulated to levels substantially in excess of SpoIIE containing the FtsH degradation tag but nonetheless all variants were defective for σ<sup>F</sup> activation. We have added these data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> as panel C.</p><p><italic>The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> seem so critical to the paper's conclusions that they really should be in a main figure.</italic> </p><p>Because <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> summarizes the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, we feel that it works best to have this figure as a supplement. The <italic>eLife</italic> online format in which supplementary figures are made easily accessible by clicking on the main figure is particularly suited to making the underlying data summarized in a main figure easily available. However, if the reviewers feel strongly about this, we would be willing to include it as a main figure.</p><p><italic>The authors seem to be assuming that mutations affecting function must be eliminating dimerization, but there's no direct assay of dimerization for most mutants, except one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> (L484K).</italic> </p><p>We reasoned that substitution of the native amino acids in the dimer interface with lysine would disrupt the dimer interface because of the introduction of a bulky amino acid with a positive charge. We have added text stating, “We substituted the native amino acids with lysine because the introduced charge and the long sidechain would be expected to prevent dimerization” to clarify our reasoning. Consistent with our reasoning, the positions of amino-acid substitutions that produced phenotypes are clustered in the dimer interface, and the variant we tested in vitro (L484K) blocked dimerization.</p><p><italic>And the other, D628A, doesn't seem as defective in dimer formation, in conflict with the claim at the end of the first paragraph of the subsection “Mn<sup>2+</sup> stimulates dimerization and phosphatase activity”.</italic> </p><p>We have modified the text to indicate that the D628A substitution partially blocks manganese induced dimer formation. The fact that some dimerization still occurs for the D628A variant is not surprising because the other metal coordinating residues are still present (including G629) and high concentrations of protein and MnCl<sub>2</sub> were used in the experiment (text has been added to the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>If, as the authors argue in the first paragraph of the subsection “Evidence from gain-of-function mutants that repositioning the switch helices is sufficient for phosphatase activation”, V697 plays a crucial role in stabilizing the inactive state, then it seems like replacing it with residues other than just alanine, e.g. charged or bulky polar residues, should also destabilize the inactive state, yielding hyperactivity. Has this been, or can this be, tested?</italic> </p><p>Yes. We have isolated an additional suppressor allele at this position (V697F) that hyperactivates SpoIIE, consistent with the reviewer’s reasoning. We have included this in the text (subsection “Structure of the phosphatase domain”).</p><p><italic>For all of the gain-of-function mutants, the prediction is that they are constitutive dimers – can this be tested biochemically, e.g. using the SEC-MALLS assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>?</italic> </p><p>We focused on the V697A variant because it has several distinguishing characteristics: (1) V697A is the only variant that we have isolated in the crystalized fragment that led to hyperactivity of SpoIIE in the otherwise wild-type context (the gain-of-function mutants were isolated as suppressors of defective alleles of SpoIIE) and (2) V697A substitution restores phosphatase activity to all of the SpoIIE alleles we have tested that disrupt SpoIIE activation (with the exception of alleles that disrupt the catalytic center). We have not tested the other variants in vitro, but suspect that some may have similar albeit milder effects.</p><p><italic>Or do any of the gain-of-function mutations activate without dimerization?</italic> </p><p>Based on unpublished data, we have evidence that the V697A substitution can promote SpoIIE activity independent from dimerization (as would be predicted from our model for SpoIIE activation). Specifically, expression of the PP2C domain fragment SpoIIE<sup>590-827</sup> in vivo fails to support σ<sup>F</sup> activation, but σ<sup>F</sup> activation can be partially rescued by V697A substitution in the SpoIIE<sup>590-827</sup> construct. Since this fragment lacks the regulatory domain that templates dimerization, this supports the hypothesis that V697A can promote SpoIIE activity in the absence of dimerization.</p><p><italic>The structure said to represent the active form probably lacks the second manganese ion at the active site. The anomalous difference map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> suggests only one manganese ion is present. The authors state that &quot;the number of bound metal atoms could not be established&quot;, but fail to note the apparent absence of the second manganese ion. Was the protein analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy? Also, regarding the number of Mn atoms indicated by the Mn anomalous difference map: because the resolution was so low (5.4</italic> Å<italic>), it's not impossible that two atoms (or one atom) could appear as one electron density blob. The authors could expand their discussion here and perhaps include the density in their alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> panel C.</italic> </p><p>As noted, SpoIIE<sup>457-827</sup> did not contain manganese under the conditions we used for crystallization and determination of the SpoIIE<sup>457-827</sup> structure (we confirmed that manganese was absent from the crystals using X-ray fluorescence scans). We agree that the low resolution anomalous maps were not conclusive with respect to the number of manganese ions bound in the structure (or the site of the bound manganese) and have modified the text to clarify this point (subsection “The switch helices move a conserved manganese-coordinating residue into the active site”, last paragraph). The density for chain A was shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 4 panel A and we have added density maps for the active sites of the other four chains to this figure panel. We have not analyzed the protein by atomic absorption spectroscopy because of the low affinity of manganese binding, however we present new biochemical evidence that SpoIIE uses two manganese ions in the catalytic site in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. By extending the enzymatic analysis of SpoIIE phosphatase activity with better data at low concentrations of manganese, we found that SpoIIE is cooperatively activated by manganese with a Hill coefficient of two, indicating that at least two manganese ions are required for catalysis, consistent with the proposed model for SpoIIE catalytic activity. We have added discussion of this point to the manuscript (subsection “Mn<sup>2+</sup> stimulates dimerization and phosphatase activity”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>Related to the previous comment, did the authors try to crystallize or quantify manganese for SpoIIE 457-827 with a substitution that constitutively activates?</italic> </p><p>We have not yet attempted to crystalize the SpoIIE<sup>457-827</sup> fragment with the V697A substitution, but agree that this might facilitate getting a high resolution structure bound to manganese.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, 5 of 7 mutants in the righthand column appear to mislocalize SpoIIE closer to the forespore pole, which the authors ignore. Can the authors offer an explanation?</italic> </p><p>We have added text to the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> that clarifies this point: “After σ<sup>F</sup> activation, SpoIIE is recruited back to the forespore face of the asymmetric septum and then moves along with the engulfing membrane to encompass the forespore, thus mutants with the most severe defects in σ<sup>F</sup> activation have fluorescence profiles that are slightly shifted towards the forespore pole relative to wild-type cells.”</p><p><italic>It is stated in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> panel D legend that there are two and a half dimers in the asymmetric unit.

Some of the chains have density in the “flap” region that we have now built and added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>The authors seem to imply that the SpoIIE domain-swap is a crystallization artifact. Briefly explain the arguments for or against the biological relevance of the domain-swapped dimer.</italic> </p><p>Solution studies of the SpoIIE<sup>590-827</sup> fragment established that it is monomeric under physiological conditions and can form domain swapped dimers in crystallization conditions (this is discussed in more detail in Levdikov et al. 2012). Additionally, our structure of the A624I mutant revealed that the major conformational differences between the domain swapped structure and the dimeric structure are not caused by the domain swap. Finally, bulkier aliphatic side-chains are found at the position corresponding to A624 in SpoIIE orthologues. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the domain swapped dimer is physiologically relevant, we do not favor it for these reasons.</p></body></sub-article></article>
