The conservation of individual genes across species and the tendency of their networks to stick together is a sign that they are working efficiently. Furthermore, it is common for existing gene networks to be adapted to perform new tasks, instead of new networks being invented every time a similar but distinct demand arises. One important question is: how can evolution use the same building blocks—such as the genes in a functioning network—in different ways to achieve new outcomes?</p><p>The gene network that sets up the ‘body plan’ of insects during development has been well studied, most deeply in the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Like all insects, the body of a fruit fly is divided into three main parts—the head, the thorax and the abdomen—and each of these parts is made up of several smaller segments. There is a remarkable diversity of insect body plans in nature, and yet, these seem to arise from the same gene networks in the embryo.</p><p>When a <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo is growing into a larva, all the different body segments develop at the same time. In most other insects, however, segments of the abdomen emerge later and sequentially during the development process. The ancestors of most insects are also thought to have developed in this way, which is known as ‘short germ embryogenesis’. So how did the so-called ‘long germ embryogenesis’, as observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, evolve from the short germ embryogenesis that is observed in most other insects?</p><p>The gene network that controls development includes the ‘pair-rule genes’ that are expressed in a pattern of alternating stripes that wrap around, top to bottom, along most of the length of the embryo. These stripes mark where the edges of each body segment will eventually develop. In fruit flies, this pattern extends along the entire length of the embryo and the stripes all appear at one time. However, in the abdominal region of short germ insects, the pair-rule genes are expressed in waves that pass through the posterior region as it grows, with new segments being added one behind the other.</p><p>Now, Rosenberg et al. have attempted to explain how the same genes can be used to direct the segmentation process in such different ways by studying another long germ insect species, the jewel wasp. Analysis of the expression of pair-rule genes in the jewel wasp shows that it uses a mixed strategy to control segmentation. The development of segments at the front of its body is directed in the same way as the fruit fly, with all these segments laid down together. However, the segments at the rear of the body are only patterned later, one after the other, like most other insects.</p><p>The work of Rosenberg et al. suggests that the jewel wasp represents an intermediate step between ancestral insects and <italic>Drosophila</italic> in the evolution of the gene network that patterns the ‘body plan’<italic>.</italic> Identifying and studying these intermediate forms allows us to understand the ways in which evolution can innovate by building upon what has come before.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01440.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01440.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Tribolium</italic></kwd><kwd>embryonic patterning</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>segmentation</kwd><kwd>pair-rule gene</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM084563</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenberg</surname><given-names>Miriam I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-1870-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brent</surname><given-names>Ava E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>120323-PF-11-242-01-DDC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenberg</surname><given-names>Miriam I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01GM064864</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Desplan</surname><given-names>Claude</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pair-rule genes in the wasp <italic>Nasonia</italic> function as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in patterning anterior segments, and similar to ancestral insects in patterning posterior segments, illustrating a mixed-mode transition state between short and long germ embryogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Control of axial patterning and embryonic development is well understood in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Kaufman, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rosenberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pankratz and Jaj, 1993</xref>). Extensive work has elucidated the genetic basis of establishment of the anterior–posterior (A–P) and dorsal–ventral (D–V) axes of the fly embryo. For the A–P axis, maternally loaded mRNAs generate localized signaling centers at each pole of the egg to establish morphogenetic gradients. These gradients instruct, in a concentration dependent manner, broad domains of expression of early zygotic genes, the ‘gap genes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). This is made possible in part by the syncytial environment of the early blastoderm embryo where nuclei are not bounded by membranes, allowing diffusion of morphogen transcription factors through a shared cytoplasm without the need for cell–cell signaling. In this environment, broad activation by maternal factors coupled with repressive activities by the gap genes leads to the expression of the pair-rule genes in two-segment periodicity, as pair-rule stripes. The overlapping registers of different pair-rule genes ultimately establish segment polarity through activation of the segment polarity genes, each expressed in stripes with single segmental register. This mode of development is termed ‘long germ’ embryogenesis because the embryo occupies all of the blastoderm apart from a dorsal region representing the extraembryonic ammnioserosa. A striking feature of long germ embryogenesis is that virtually all of segment patterning is completed synchronously in the syncytial environment. However, forays into other insect models have revealed that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> paradigm is an evolutionarily derived state, and that insects generally undergo a very different type of embryogenesis and segmentation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Kaufman, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rosenberg et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Unlike flies, most insect embryonic primordia occupy only a small portion of the blastoderm and only few anterior segments (head and thorax) are patterned in a syncytial environment. The remainder of the embryo is generated after cellularization via a ‘growth zone’, at the posterior region of the embryo. This mode is termed ‘short germ’ embryogenesis. Recently, the mechanisms governing posterior segment patterning and growth in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryo were characterized in elegant detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choe and Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">El-Sherif et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sarrazin et al., 2012</xref>): Oscillations of the pair-rule gene <italic>Tc’odd-skipped</italic> (<italic>Tc’odd)</italic> in the growth zone are in turn linked to a circuit of two other pair-rule genes, <italic>Tc’runt</italic> and <italic>Tc’even-skipped (Tc’eve</italic>), such that each new pair of segments experiences a pulse of <italic>Tc’odd</italic> and requires both <italic>Tc’eve</italic> and <italic>Tc’runt</italic> expression in order to progress; the driver of these oscillations is still unknown. The waves of expression of <italic>Tc’odd-skipped</italic> pass through the growth zone rhythmically, generating segments and new stripes of stable expression with each periodic pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sarrazin et al., 2012</xref>). RNAi of <italic>Tc’odd</italic>, <italic>Tc’runt</italic>, or <italic>Tc’eve</italic> results in asegmental embryos, underscoring their requirement in both growth zone-derived segments and earlier blastoderm anterior segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choe et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, the pair-rule genes <italic>Tc’sloppy paired (Tc’slp)</italic> and <italic>Tc’paired</italic> (<italic>Tc’prd</italic>) appear in two-segment periodicity in head stripes and in stripes that emerge from the growth zone, and RNAi of those genes produce classical pair-rule phenotypes, in which alternating segments are lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choe and Brown, 2007</xref>). Live imaging revealed that formation of posterior segments results primarily from convergent extension and short-range cell movements and not strictly from cell division within the ‘growth zone’. This mechanism appears similar to both segmentation of vertebrate presomitic mesoderm (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dubrulle and Pourquie, 2004</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pourquie, 2011</xref>]) and to segment formation in more basal arthropods, including the centipede <italic>Strigamia maritima</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chipman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chipman and Akam, 2008</xref>) and the spider <italic>Cupiennius salei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stollewerk et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting it as an ancient mechanism inherited from the last common ancestor of all segmented animals (though this interpretation is still debated; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davis and Patel, 1999</xref>]).</p><p>As <italic>Drosophila</italic> is only one example of a derived long germ strategy, one outstanding question is how transitions from short germ to long germ embryogenesis occurred, such that the same set of segmentation genes possesses different functions. The careful study of additional long germ insects should shed light on what aspects of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development are essential facets of long germ embryogenesis and which aspects are more evolutionarily labile. Other model species have been studied, including long germ beetles (e.g., <italic>Callosobruchus</italic> order: <italic>Coleoptera</italic>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Patel et al., 1994</xref>)), and several members of the order <italic>Hymenoptera</italic>, including the honeybee, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dearden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilson and Dearden, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">2012</xref>) and the jewel wasp, <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> (<italic>Nv</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pultz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Werren et al., 2010</xref>). However, systematic characterization of their pair-rule genes and segmentation mechanisms is still incomplete.</p><p>We use the wasp <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> as a model for the study of A–P patterning, as a species that appears to have evolved, independently of <italic>Drosophila,</italic> a similar mode of long germ embryogenesis. We have previously characterized the early patterns of <italic>Nasonia</italic> segmentation genes and found that maternal and gap gene expression confirms a long germ mode of embryogenesis. This conclusion was based on the existence of two polar signaling centers, each utilizing localized maternal <italic>Nv orthodenticle (otd)</italic> mRNA that encodes a morphogen. <italic>Nv otd</italic> acts in combination with <italic>Nv hunchback</italic> (<italic>hb</italic>) and localized maternal <italic>Nv giant (gt)</italic> at the anterior, and with localized maternal <italic>Nv caudal (cad)</italic> at the posterior, to specify positional identity. The domains of zygotic expression of <italic>Nv hb</italic>, <italic>Nv gt</italic>, <italic>Nv cad, Nv Krüppel</italic> (<italic>Kr</italic>), <italic>Nv tailless</italic> (<italic>tll</italic>), and <italic>Nv knirps</italic> (<italic>kni</italic>) closely resemble their <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterparts, consistent with a similar mode of blastoderm allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pultz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lynch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olesnicky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brent et al., 2007</xref>). Although these data support <italic>Drosophila-</italic>like early regulatory interactions and a long germ mode of embryogenesis, little was known about later stages of <italic>Nasonia</italic> embryonic patterning.</p><p>We analyzed the expression and function of the pair-rule genes <italic>Nv eve, Nv odd</italic>, <italic>Nv runt</italic> and <italic>Nv h</italic> during embryogenesis. We found that each gene is expressed in both a canonical long-germ pair-rule stripe pattern at the anterior, as well as late-forming posterior stripes, indicating a dual mode of regulation. Strikingly, <italic>Nv eve</italic> is ultimately expressed in a total of 16 segmental stripes, of which six are derived from a single posterior stripe in the cellularized blastoderm. We also observe waves of <italic>Nv odd</italic> expression that resemble the waves of <italic>Tribolium odd</italic> expression<italic>,</italic> suggesting the residual activity of a segmentation clock in <italic>Nasonia.</italic> As in <italic>Tribolium</italic>, we found that mitoses do not occur exclusively at the site of late forming segments, but mitotic figures are not randomly distributed throughout the embryo. Instead, coordinated mitoses resembling the later mitotic domains of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Foe, 1989</xref>) appear and progress in waves from anterior to posterior, and are largely excluded from stripes of <italic>eve</italic> expression, suggesting a coordination of mitoses by segmentation genes. Using morpholinos to knock down gene function, we found that <italic>Nv eve, Nv odd</italic> and <italic>Nv h</italic> phenotypes do not affect alternating segments at the posterior, unlike what is observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Instead, these ‘pair-rule’ genes are required for the formation of a continuous posterior region comprising abdominal segments A5–A10. Phenotypes in the anterior of the embryo are gene-specific; each gene exhibits a partial pair-rule phenotype in the allelic series. We suggest that <italic>Nasonia</italic> uses ‘pair-rule’ genes to pattern the embryo in a manner that resembles both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Tribolium</italic>. We present a model for how this mixed mode of segmentation is achieved.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Nasonia</italic> even-skipped exhibits character of both long and short germ patterning</title><p>The expression of eve has been studied in many insects, owing to a widely cross-reacting antibody.

We used circular RACE from total embryo RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McGrath, 2011</xref>) to generate a fragment of approximately 1 kb corresponding to the coding region of <italic>Nv eve</italic>, including the highly conserved homeodomain (Genbank Accession# KC168090). Several minor transcript variants were captured and sequenced, but not studied further (see ‘Materials and methods’ for GenBank accession numbers). The homeodomain of <italic>Nv</italic> Eve shares 81.7% amino acid identity with its <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart.</p><p>We used in situ hybridization to look at the expression pattern of <italic>Nv eve</italic> during <italic>Nasonia</italic> embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>Nv eve</italic> expression becomes detectable as a broad early domain in the blastoderm embryo at around 3 hr after egg laying (AEL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This domain broadens and its boundaries sharpen between 3 and 4 hr, by which time a faint posterior stripe (hereafter referred to as ‘stripe 6’, see below) becomes evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). As embryogenesis progresses toward cellularization, the anterior domain splits into three distinct double-segment periodicity pair-rule stripes, stripes 1, 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). By cellularization, around 6 hr, a faint 4/5 stripe appears between the anterior stripes and stripe 6, which has become more intense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Between 6 and 8 hr AEL, stripe 4/5 splits into distinct double-segment periodicity stripes 4 and 5, whereas stripes 1 and 2 split into single-segment periodicity segmental stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, eve secondary stripes form de novo, between primary pair-rule stripes, in contrast to secondary <italic>paired</italic> stripes that later split from primary stripes, forming segmental stripes that affect all segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Macdonald et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36b">Kilchherr et al., 1986</xref>). Splitting of <italic>Nasonia eve</italic> double-segment stripes into single-segment stripes may occur by a similar mechanism (see below). As gastrulation progresses between 8 and 10 hr AEL, double-segment pair-rule stripes 3–5 also split to give rise to two distinct single-segment stripes each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–L</xref>). This anterior to posterior progression of <italic>Nv</italic> eve stripes is consistent with the sequential appearance of the segment polarity genes <italic>Nv wg</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and <italic>Nv en</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pultz et al., 1999</xref>), which are first detected around cellularization in a few anterior segments and then appear in stripes progressively, in an anterior to posterior manner.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01440.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of <italic>Nasonia eve</italic> mRNA expression.</title><p>Embryos are shown with anterior left and dorsal up. <italic>Nv eve</italic> is initially expressed in a broad domain (<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>), which sharpens as a posterior stripe becomes visible at around 4 hr after embryo laying (AEL) (<bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold>).

This division of stripe 6 initiates with an anterior band that will give rise to four stripes (segmental stripes 11–14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P,Q</xref>, arrowheads; see below), and two later-appearing segmental stripes 15 and 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q</xref>, arrowheads).

This is accompanied by a disruption of the remaining denticle belts, leaving naked cuticle along the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, red arrows). In the most severely affected embryos, segments anterior to A1 are lost and are accompanied by head closure defects.

We used sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) and phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) to identify the <italic>Nasonia</italic> paralog that is closest to <italic>Drosophila odd-skipped</italic>, and refer to it hereafter as <italic>Nv odd</italic>. An <italic>Nv odd</italic> cDNA fragment comprising the region encoding the conserved DNA binding domain was used as a probe for in situ hybridization (GenBank Accession # KC142194). As observed above for <italic>Nv eve,</italic> the embryonic expression of <italic>Nv odd</italic> begins as a broad early domain in syncytial blasoderm embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). As this broad domain strengthens and sharpens, a ventral head patch and a posterior cap appear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). The broad domain resolves into two clear apparent double-segment stripes (Stripes 1 and 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). A third double-segment stripe arises from the second stripe, expanding posteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>). At the same time, a stronger posterior domain apparently advances anteriorly. Pair-rule stripe 4 (double-segment periodicity) arises at the anterior of the first advancing ‘wave’ at cellularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–H</xref>) before the posterior domain recedes again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–J</xref>). The fifth double-segment stripe arises during a second ‘wave’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K–M</xref>) at the onset of gastrulation. A sixth stripe arises in an apparently similar manner, though it is much fainter and appears while more posterior stripes are already differentiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>, arrowhead); the posterior cap generates two thin pair-rule stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>) during early germ band extension.

Inactivating <italic>Nv odd</italic> function leads to loss of the most posterior germ band-derived segments A5–A10 with additional anterior defects. The most sensitive phenotypes are the fusion of segments A3 and A4, and loss of segment A5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, red arrowheads and x). More severely affected embryos exhibit loss of most segments posterior to A3/A4 and naked cuticle anterior to T2, though larval head structures are still present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–J</xref>). In many severely affected embryos, <italic>Nv odd</italic> knockdown causes additional loss/fusion of A1, and of T2. Thus, phenotypes comprise loss of segments T2, A1, A3 and A5 and resemble a pair-rule phenotype. A small percentage of embryos are nearly asegmental, with only small patches of denticle bands of unknown identity (not shown). Therefore, as also observed for <italic>Nv eve</italic> knockdown, the segmentation defects resulting from <italic>Nv odd</italic> inactivation only corresponds to a partial <italic>Drosophila</italic>-like pair-rule phenotype, and rather, in the most severe cases, resemble the phenotype of <italic>Tc’odd</italic> loss of function. It is of note that <italic>Nv odd</italic> stripes 4, 5 and 6 appear to emerge from waves of expression at the posterior of the embryo that likely specify segments A3–A5, which are most sensitive to loss of <italic>Nv odd</italic> function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>In summary, <italic>Nv odd</italic> is expressed initially in three sequentially forming anterior double-segment periodicity stripes, which appear to have <italic>Drosophila</italic>-like pair-rule character. Three more posterior double-segment stripes (PR stripes 4–6) then form sequentially, apparently as ‘waves’ of <italic>Nv odd</italic> expression, resembling the clock-driven stripes of <italic>Tc’odd</italic>. Finally, two <italic>Nv odd</italic> stripes form from a posterior cap<italic>.

We sought to determine whether the remaining single segment stripes where <italic>odd</italic> is not interdigitated with <italic>Nv eve</italic> may alternate with stripes of <italic>Nv runt</italic>, as is observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We studied the expression of <italic>Nv runt</italic> throughout embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and then used double fluorescent in situ hybridization to visualize its register with <italic>Nv eve</italic> stripes at both early and late stages. <italic>Nv runt</italic> stripes appear cleanly in an anterior to posterior progression, with six double-segment periodicity stripes visible before cellularization; two additional double-segment stripes are added at the posterior during gastrulation. Single-segment periodicity stripes only appear much later at full germ band extension when the expression of the other pair-rule genes is already well established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

It is worth noting that the severe <italic>Nv eve</italic> anterior defects are more regional, as observed for <italic>Oncopeltus eve</italic> that behaves as a gap gene, and is attributed to the broad early domain of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Kaufman, 2005a</xref>). Perhaps, as in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic>, <italic>Nv eve</italic> is required in combination with <italic>Nv hb</italic> or <italic>Nv gt</italic> for activation of their targets, which are in turn required for the proper formation of head and thoracic segments.</p><p>Another mode must control the formation of stripes of <italic>Nv eve, Nv odd</italic>, and <italic>Nv h</italic> that arise later, in a cellular environment, from a posterior domain (whether at the posterior pole of the embryo, as in the case of <italic>Nv odd</italic> and <italic>Nv hairy</italic>, or from a broad posterior stripe, as in the case of <italic>Nv eve</italic>). Knockdown of each of the three genes produces a severe posterior truncation of the embryo, deleting all six posterior segments, indicating that each gene is required for the formation of posterior-derived segments. This phenotype is unlike flies, and resembles more the short germ pair-rule gene circuit of <italic>Tribolium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choe and Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sarrazin et al., 2012</xref>).

The use of a clock-like mechanism is not incompatible with long germ embryogenesis, and rather, retaining this character might allow for sampling transitional states between the short- and long germ strategies, which likely occurred multiple times within holometabola. Further, it may be that the absence of significant posterior elongation is the transition state that tips the balance toward elaboration of anterior segmentation control mechanisms and loss of late forming segments. Our characterization of the <italic>Nasonia</italic> pair-rule genes illustrates one way that these two strategies can co-exist.</p><p>It is also of note that although <italic>hairy</italic>-related genes are the oscillating components of vertebrate segmentation clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Palmeirim et al., 1997</xref>), it is generally <italic>odd-skipped</italic>-related genes that oscillate in arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chipman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chipman and Akam, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">El-Sherif et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sarrazin et al., 2012</xref>).

In combination with FastRed in situ detection using anti-DIG-AP Fab fragments (Roche Diagnostics) at 1:500, primary antibodies were added to blocking buffer together and incubated according to the in situ protocol, and secondary antibody detection was carried out after the FastRed staining was completed and following three 1X PBT washes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cloning of <italic>Nasonia</italic> pair-rule gene cDNA fragments</title><p><italic>Nasonia</italic> pair-rule gene cDNAs were cloned from embryo cDNA pools generated from reverse transcription of total embryo RNA from mixed age embryos using Superscript First Strand Synthesis kit (with Superscript II; Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s specifications.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom, Duojia Pan, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Rosenberg et al. describe the expression patterns and phenotypes that result from knocking down several pair-rule genes in the wasp <italic>Nasonia</italic>. Previous studies, focused mostly on maternal and gap genes, had suggested that <italic>Nasonia</italic> uses a long-germ mode of embryogenesis, which evolved independently of long-germ development in flies. The results presented here lead the authors to re-evaluate that premise: pair-rule expression and phenotypes in <italic>Nasonia</italic> suggest both a 'long-germ' mode of action in anterior segments (patterning by subdivision in a syncytial blastoderm) and a 'short-germ' mode in posterior segments (sequential patterning in a cellularized environment, coupled with posterior elongation). The data are of excellent quality and largely support this interesting conclusion.</p><p>The reviewers suggested several major points for improvement:</p><p>1) The paper contains a number of imprecise statements that should be corrected by careful editing of the manuscript. On several occasions the authors refer to cross-regulatory interactions among the pair-rule genes, based entirely on expression patterns (e.g., several points in the Discussion section). I think that is a weak basis for proposing such interactions. I recommend testing these hypotheses by combining morpholino treatments with the relevant in situs. Alternatively, the authors should make it clear that the proposed interactions are hypothetical. The remaining suggestions are highlighted in the minor comments below.</p><p>2) The reviewers recommend separating, where possible, the description of data from the interpretations and the discussion that derives from it. Currently, much of the discussion is scattered within the Results section; in the Discussion the authors reiterate many of the same points.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) Introduction, 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph: I am not aware of evidence suggesting that <italic>odd</italic> controls the oscillations, rather than being a read-out?</p><p>2) Introduction, 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph: Whether the common ancestors of bilaterians was segmented is still controversial.</p><p>3) When describing the cuticular phenotypes induced by morpholinos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and Results section), it is not always clear how the authors identify which of the segments are missing or affected? Are there distinctive cuticular features that identify each segment? These should be described.</p><p>4) Section entitled ‘<italic>Nasonia runt</italic> expression’: “Altogether, our data support a model in which <italic>Nv eve</italic> segmental stripes are established through the complementary action of <italic>Nv odd</italic> for odd numbered segmental stripes and <italic>Nv runt</italic> for even-numbered segmental stripes, as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.”</p><p>It is not clear how the data presented justify this statement. The authors could combine morpholino treatments with <italic>eve</italic> stainings to test that hypothesis.</p><p>5) Section entitled ‘Expression and knockdown of <italic>Nasonia eve</italic>, <italic>hairy</italic> and <italic>odd</italic>’, last paragraph: It is difficult to understand what these sentences mean. How is a clock-like mechanism compatible with long-germ embryogenesis?</p><p>6) Section entitled ‘An ancestral role for eve in specifying posterior identity may be linked to growth zone behavior in short germ insects’: “In <italic>Schistocerca</italic>, <italic>eve</italic> is expressed in a posterior mesodermal domain and pair-rule stripes arise from this region, indicating that eve plays a role in posteriorness and not segmentation in basal insects.”</p><p><italic>Eve</italic> is expressed in segmental patterns in spiders, myriapods and crustaceans, suggesting that the data from <italic>Schistocerca</italic> are not representative of the ancestral state.</p><p>7) 'Segmental' and 'pair-rule' stripes could be renamed stripes with single- and double-segment periodicity, for clarity, especially since pair-rule genes are sometimes expressed in stripes that have single-segment periodicity.</p><p>8) The authors point out the lack of 'segmental' stripes of odd (meaning stripes with single-segment periodicity). Have they checked whether one of the other paralogues of odd is expressed in the 'missing' stripes?</p><p>9) It would be useful if the authors could indicate the frequency of each phenotypic class in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2 and 4</xref>.</p><p>10) It would be useful to know the identity of sequences (conventional gene names and, ideally, accession numbers) in the Figures showing sequence alignments and trees. For example, do the hairy-related genes included in the analysis include E(spl) orthologues?</p><p>11) Are the phylogenetic trees based on the entire aligned sequence, or on specific sequence blocks (domains) that could be aligned reliably?</p><p>12) Given the interest in comparing the arthropod and vertebrate segmentation clocks, the authors could comment on the absence of <italic>hairy</italic> oscillations in the Discussion. Have they looked at the expression of E(spl) orthologues?</p><p>13) First paragraph of Discussion: The authors reiterate the view that <italic>Nasonia</italic> develops using a long-germ mode, when in fact their paper argues that this is not the case (next paragraph). It would be interesting if the authors could step back and discuss in more general terms what their data suggests in terms of short- and long-germ mechanisms (see reviews by Davis and Patel, Ann Rev Entomol 2002, and Peel and Akam, Curr Biol 2003).</p><p>14) Section entitled ‘An ancestral role for eve in specifying posterior identity may be linked to growth zone behavior in short germ insects’: The concept of “posteriorness” is vague and should be explained.</p><p>15) The formation of posterior segments seems to be accompanied by a mild elongation the posterior part of embryo. This is another hallmark of short-germ development, which the authors could discuss.</p><p>16) Wilson and Dearden described the expression patterns and phenotypes for some of the same pair-rule genes in another hymenopteran, the honeybee. In the Discussion, it would be useful if the authors briefly compared the results from the honeybee with those from <italic>Nasonia</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01440.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The paper contains a number of imprecise statements that should be corrected by careful editing of the manuscript.

Alternatively, the authors should make it clear that the proposed interactions are hypothetical. The remaining suggestions are highlighted in the minor comments below</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the best experiments would be morpholino knockdown of each gene followed by in situ for each of the others, to really delineate the cross interactions that we propose. However, these experiments faced insurmountable technical limitations, and it was not possible to perform these studies. We have now made it more clear in the text that the proposed interactions represent a model that is hypothetical and based only on the suggestive expression patterns that we describe.</p><p><italic>2) The reviewers recommend separating, where possible, the description of data from the interpretations and the discussion that derives from it. Currently, much of the discussion is scattered within the Results section; in the Discussion the authors reiterate many of the same points</italic>.</p><p>We have removed discussion from the Results section where possible (although in several places, we found it more appropriate to comment briefly on a result that will not be part of a general discussion), and have tried to ensure that there is no redundancy between the Results and Discussion. The Discussion is now shorter and smoother.</p><p><italic>Minor comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) Introduction, 2nd paragraph: I am not aware of evidence suggesting that </italic>odd<italic> controls the oscillations, rather than being a read-out</italic>?</p><p>We agree that the wording of our description of <italic>odd-skipped</italic> oscillations in <italic>Tribolium</italic> was not clear. This has been corrected and we now indicate that the expression of <italic>odd</italic> is indeed oscillating, but that the control of these oscillations is still not understood.</p><p><italic>2) Introduction, 2nd paragraph: Whether the common ancestors of bilaterians was segmented is still controversial</italic>.</p><p>We are now more cautious and have added a reference to an excellent review discussing the competing models about the origin of segmentation, since it is difficult to concisely present these models in this context of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) When describing the cuticular phenotypes induced by morpholinos (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>and Results section), it is not always clear how the authors identify which of the segments are missing or affected? Are there distinctive cuticular features that identify each segment? These should be described</italic>.</p><p>There are significant landmarks on the <italic>Nasonia</italic> cuticle that give clear indications of anterior segment identity. Spiracles are easy to detect on T2, A1, A2 and A3 and their position and order on critical segments allow most of the time their identification. Our interpretation of the phenotypes is based on the phenotypic series that we obtain through morpholino knockdown; we can often observe the reduction of structures or segments stepwise in this fashion. However, there are sometimes ambiguities. We now describe these landmarks in the text.</p><p><italic>4) Section entitled ‘</italic>Nasonia runt<italic> expression’: “Altogether, our data support a model in which </italic>Nv eve<italic> segmental stripes are established through the complementary action of </italic>Nv odd<italic> for odd numbered segmental stripes and </italic>Nv runt<italic> for even-numbered segmental stripes, as summarized in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref><italic>.</italic>”</p><p><italic>It is not clear how the data presented justify this statement. The authors could combine morpholino treatments with eve stainings to test that hypothesis</italic>.</p><p>We are unable to carry out this experiment with the very small number of injected embryos that are both non-uniformly developmentally delayed by the injection and also cannot be reliably recovered for subsequent staining without losing their structure. We have added a qualifying statement to indicate that this model is still theoretical.</p><p><italic>5) Section entitled ‘Expression and knockdown of</italic> Nasonia eve, hairy <italic>and</italic> odd<italic>’, last paragraph: It is difficult to understand what these sentences mean. How is a clock-like mechanism compatible with long-germ embryogenesis</italic>?</p><p>It is difficult to imagine a clock-like mechanism as co-existing with an extreme long-germ insect, like <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where there is very little (or no) material that remains to be patterned/segmented after gastrulation. However, only <italic>Drosophila</italic> fits with a very restrictive definition of long germ.</p><p>Insect embryogenesis comprises a spectrum of short-germ to long-germ, and, although insects like <italic>Nasonia</italic> and <italic>Apis</italic> can be called long germ, they are less completely so than <italic>Drosophila</italic>, indicating that these two mechanisms do appear to co-exist, which is the major conclusion of our paper. It seems reasonable to imagine that evolution sampled more derived, long-germ embryogenesis types (with more of the germ segmented before cellularization) multiple times, while still relying on the ancestral mechanisms of segment patterning to deal with the remaining late-forming segments, even as the number of remaining segments varied. These two mechanisms would have had to co-exist at some point in the transition from the most extreme short germ embryo to the most extreme long-germ embryo. Our interpretation is that embryos like <italic>Nasonia</italic> represent a snapshot of that transition.</p><p><italic>6) Section entitled ‘An ancestral role for eve in specifying posterior identity may be linked to growth zone behavior in short germ insects’: “In</italic> Schistocerca<italic>, eve is expressed in a posterior mesodermal domain and pair-rule stripes arise from this region, indicating that eve plays a role in posteriorness and not segmentation in basal insects.</italic>”</p><p>Eve <italic>is expressed in segmental patterns in spiders, myriapods and crustaceans, suggesting that the data from</italic> Schistocerca <italic>are not representative of the ancestral state.</italic></p><p>A discussion of this point has been added to the text. While it is certainly true that several other arthropods express <italic>eve</italic> in segmental stripes, it is also true that other organisms, including vertebrates, have a posterior domain of <italic>eve</italic> expression like <italic>Nasonia</italic>. We discuss both of these points now in the text and leave open any conclusion about which is the ancestral state.</p><p><italic>7) 'Segmental' and 'pair-rule' stripes could be renamed stripes with single- and double-segment periodicity, for clarity, especially since pair-rule genes are sometimes expressed in stripes that have single-segment periodicity</italic>.</p><p>We had struggled with this and clearly the reviewers also noted this. We have changed the name of the stripes to double-segment and single-segment throughout the descriptions of each gene.</p><p><italic>8) The authors point out the lack of 'segmental' stripes of odd (meaning stripes with single-segment periodicity). Have they checked whether one of the other paralogues of odd is expressed in the 'missing' stripes</italic>?</p><p>We attempted to amplify and clone each of the three <italic>odd</italic> paralogs from <italic>Nasonia</italic> cDNA to look at this, using cDNA from staged animals (embryo, larva, adult). We were able to clone only the one described in the paper from embryo cDNA and one other (“<italic>oddbowl A”</italic> in the tree) from adult cDNA. The third was either expressed at levels too low to efficiently amplified, or may not be expressed. The expression of <italic>oddbowl</italic> A was not tested systematically in embryos, though a small-scale experiment revealed no embryonic expression.</p><p><italic>9) It would be useful if the authors could indicate the frequency of each phenotypic class in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4"><italic>Figures 2 and 4</italic></xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> does not show phenotypic classes but representative stainings of embryos at different stages of development. The pRNAi experiments with gap genes have been extensively described in several previous publications (Pultz et al., 1999, 2005; Olesnicky et al., 2006, Brent et al., 2007).</p><p>We now describe the frequency of the different phenotypic classes presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> obtained with morpholinos, which are approximately as follows:<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Eve:</th><th>B 20.4%</th><th>C 24%</th><th>D 30.1%</th><th>E 25%</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Odd:</td><td>G 27.7%</td><td>H 22.3%</td><td>I 29.2%</td><td>J 20.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Hairy:</td><td>L 13.4%</td><td>M 25.0%</td><td>N 36.6%</td><td>O 25.0%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>These values also now appear in the Materials and methods section of the paper.</p><p><italic>10) It would be useful to know the identity of sequences (conventional gene names and, ideally, accession numbers) in the Figures showing sequence alignments and trees.

It would be interesting if the authors could step back and discuss in more general terms what their data suggests in terms of short- and long-germ mechanisms (see reviews by Davis and Patel, Ann Rev Entomol 2002, and Peel and Akam, Curr Biol 2003)</italic>.</p><p>As discussed above, insects like <italic>Nasonia</italic> and <italic>Apis</italic> whose embryogenesis comprises a spectrum of short-germ to long-germ can be called long germ, though they are less completely so than <italic>Drosophila (</italic>which appears to be the only species that fulfill the strict definition of long germ). We agree with the reviewers that our work demonstrates that, unlike what we previously believed, <italic>Nasonia</italic> is not a strict long germ, indicating that these two mechanisms do appear to co-exist, which is the major conclusion of our paper. It seems reasonable to imagine that evolution sampled more derived, long-germ embryogenesis types (with more of the germ segmented before cellularization) multiple times, while still relying on the ancestral mechanisms of segment patterning to deal with the remaining late-forming segments, even as the number of remaining segments varied. These two mechanisms would have had to co-exist at some point in the transition from the most extreme short germ embryo to the most extreme long-germ embryo. Our interpretation is that embryos like <italic>Nasonia</italic> represent a snapshot of that transition.</p><p><italic>14) Section entitled ‘An ancestral role for eve in specifying posterior identity may be linked to growth zone behavior in short germ insects’: The concept of “posteriorness” is vague and should be explained</italic>.</p><p>This concept, though vague, has been raised previously in the literature (see e.g., Ahringer J, <italic>Genes Dev</italic> 1996; Brown SJ et al., <italic>Mech Dev</italic> 1997). The significance of the posterior expression domains of <italic>eve</italic> in <italic>Nasonia</italic> and other arthropods is still not entirely clear, but it remains a possibility that it is in some way distinct from its expression in stripes and function in segmentation. The fact that its expression delineates a posterior growth zone in animals whose posterior segmentation occurs post-embryonically (e.g., Platynereis-de Rosa et al., <italic>Evolution and Development</italic> 2005) suggests that its ability to delineate a region of growth or patterning can be achieved independently of its striped expression and function (and that it may be an ancient feature). We wanted only to highlight that feature and with it, the possibility that it provides some additional, more general identity/information in the embryo posterior, though this explanation and characterization are still vague.</p><p><italic>15) The formation of posterior segments seems to be accompanied by a mild elongation the posterior part of embryo. This is another hallmark of short-germ development, which the authors could discuss</italic>.</p><p>We didn’t emphasize the mild elongation of the posterior part of the embryo, since compared to the significant posterior growth in more short-germ insects, this elongation is modest in <italic>Nasonia</italic>. It is also difficult to distinguish what may be modest elongation in a short-germ sense vs simply the elongated appearance of a germband elongated (and retracted) embryo. We don’t feel that the data are sufficient to support further discussion.</p><p><italic>16) Wilson and Dearden described the expression patterns and phenotypes for some of the same pair-rule genes in another hymenopteran, the honeybee. In the Discussion, it would be useful if the authors briefly compared the results from the honeybee with those from</italic> Nasonia.</p><p>An additional comparison of <italic>Nasonia</italic> pair rule genes to those of <italic>Apis</italic> has been added in the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
