<italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites, the etiological agents of malaria, suppress the ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to activate optimal T cell responses. We demonstrated recently that B cells, rather than DCs, are the principal activators of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in murine malaria. In the present study, we further investigated factors that might prevent DCs from priming <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific T helper cell responses. We found that DCs were significantly less efficient at taking up infected red blood cells (iRBCs) compared to soluble antigen, whereas B cells more readily bound iRBCs. To assess whether DCs retained the capacity to present soluble antigen during malaria, we measured responses to a heterologous protein immunization administered to naïve mice or mice infected with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>. Antigen uptake, DC activation, and expansion of immunogen-specific T cells were intact in infected mice, indicating DCs remained functional. However, polarization of the immunogen-specific response was dramatically altered, with a near-complete loss of germinal center T follicular helper cells specific for the immunogen, accompanied by significant reductions in antigen-specific B cells and antibody. Our results indicate that DCs remain competent to activate T cells during <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection, but that T cell polarization and humoral responses are severely disrupted. This study provides mechanistic insight into the development of both <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific and heterologous adaptive responses in hosts with malaria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Plasmodium chabaudi</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>T follicular helper cells</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>antibody</kwd><kwd>germinal center</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ROAI118803-01A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pepper</surname><given-names>Marion</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>122353SUB / 5UO1AI42001-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pepper</surname><given-names>Marion</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1016766</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pepper</surname><given-names>Marion</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Flow cytometric analysis of antigen-specific B and T cell responses to heterologous immunization reveals intact dendritic cell function, but selective defects in germinal center formation, in mice with concurrent malaria.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria, caused by parasites of the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, is a leading global driver of infection-related mortality, resulting in 241 million cases of disease and over 600,000 deaths in 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">World Malaria Report, 2021</xref>). Clinical immunity to malaria (i.e. protection from symptoms) develops only after many years and repeated infections. Consequently, children in endemic areas remain vulnerable to severe illness and death for several years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Black et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schofield and Mueller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ryg-Cornejo et al., 2016b</xref>), making the slow and incomplete acquisition of immunity a matter of grave concern for human health. The mechanisms underlying this apparently poor development of immunity have been the subject of intense research for decades. Antigenic diversity among <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites is likely one factor; additionally, however, evidence suggests that immune responses generated in hosts with malaria may be defective or sub-optimal, relative to responses against immunizations or other pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Portugal et al., 2013</xref>). For example, antibodies against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in naturally exposed children are short-lived relative to antibodies against unrelated vaccine antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Portugal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crompton et al., 2010</xref>), and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection has been linked to diminished T helper cell responses in children and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ho et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chizzolini et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rhee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bejon et al., 2009</xref>). These observations raise the question of whether <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites subvert optimal immune responses to facilitate repeated infection of their mammalian hosts. The immune defects associated with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection are not limited to responses against the parasite itself: children with acute malaria exhibit impaired responses to a range of vaccinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greenwood et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Williamson and Greenwood, 1978</xref>), and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection causes declines in pre-existing, unrelated vaccine-induced antibodies and plasma cells in both mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banga et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ng et al., 2014</xref>). From a public health perspective, it is therefore also important to understand how malaria negatively impacts heterologous immunizations.</p><p>One proposed mechanism for the development of sub-optimal or short-lived immune responses in malaria is that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites may suppress the activity of dendritic cells (DCs), innate immune cells that initiate canonical T cell responses to microbes (evidence for malaria-induced dysfunction reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wykes and Good, 2008</xref>). Some studies have found that <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected RBCs (iRBCs) or parasite products can render human DCs refractory to activation and restrict priming of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Urban et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pouniotis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elliott et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yap et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Millington et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pack et al., 2021</xref>)<italic>,</italic> and humans with malaria have fewer and less activated circulating DCs than healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pinzon-Charry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Woodberry et al., 2012</xref>). However, these decreases in circulating DCs during infection could reflect recruitment to infected tissues, and additional in vitro studies have concluded that DCs <italic>do</italic> become activated and can prime T cells after exposure to iRBCs and parasite products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coban et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Griffith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Götz et al., 2017</xref>). Overall, the question of whether malaria suppresses DC activity remains a subject for debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wykes and Good, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Struik and Riley, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Mouse models have provided additional characterizations of DC function during <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection, but with similarly conflicting results. Some studies have reported that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> suppresses DC function under specific circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wykes et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sponaas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wykes et al., 2007b</xref>), but others have established that DCs isolated from infected mice can present parasite-derived antigens to activate T cells and generate protective responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pouniotis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wykes et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sponaas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sponaas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Voisine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perry et al., 2004</xref>). Whether they actually perform this function in hosts with malaria is less clear. Several papers have sought to test a role for DCs in vivo using a transgenic mouse model that permits deletion of CD11c-expressing cells. These studies concluded that conventional CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DCs were important for antigen presentation and T cell responses in malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borges da Silva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ueffing et al., 2017</xref>). However, CD11c is also upregulated on activated B cells, making the results of these studies difficult to interpret. Using more selective genetic tools to ablate antigen presentation specifically in DCs or B cells, we recently demonstrated that B cells, rather than DCs, are the dominant antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that direct activation and polarization of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response in mice with malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arroyo and Pepper, 2020</xref>). In light of this finding, we considered it important to revisit the question of DC dysfunction in mice with malaria.</p><p>Historically, the ability of B cells to present antigen to T cells has been studied primarily in the context of cognate interactions with CD4<sup>+</sup> cells that have already been activated by DCs. However, B cells can also interact with and activate naïve T cells directly. Hong et al. showed recently that whereas DCs were required for activating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to a soluble protein antigen, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to the same antigen delivered on a nanoparticle required presentation by B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hong et al., 2018</xref>). In light of this finding, here we examined whether a differential ability to take up particle-like iRBCs might bias presentation of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite antigens away from DCs and towards B cells. Further, we tested whether DCs in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-infected mice remained competent to activate T cell responses to a heterologous, soluble protein antigen—an approach that allowed us to assess the functional capacity of DCs in hosts with malaria, independent of whether DCs can efficiently obtain iRBC-associated antigen in vivo. We found that DCs are relatively poor phagocytes of iRBCs, which may be one contributing factor in the dominance of B cells as APCs in this disease. We also found that DCs remained competent to activate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to soluble antigens in hosts with malaria, suggesting no global dysfunction occurs. However, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell polarization, germinal center formation, and antibody production were profoundly altered, a finding that has implications for vaccination schemes in malaria-endemic regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DCs do not efficiently capture infected RBCs in vivo</title><p>We recently demonstrated that mice infected with the rodent-adapted parasite <italic>P. yoelii</italic> developed an antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response that was strongly polarized to a T follicular helper cell (Tfh) phenotype, specialized for assisting B cells with affinity maturation within germinal centers. In mice with malaria, these antigen-specific T cells possessed diminished proliferative capacity and longevity compared to T helper cells specific for the same epitope delivered in the context of an LCMV infection. Using genetically modified mice to selectively disrupt or restore antigen presentation in either DCs or B cells, we also determined that B cells, rather than DCs, were the primary APCs in this infection and orchestrated the striking Tfh polarization phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arroyo and Pepper, 2020</xref>).</p><p>We wished to better understand factors that favor B cells as the dominant APCs in this infection model, especially in light of recent work demonstrating that different APCs are required for soluble versus nanoparticle-associated antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hong et al., 2018</xref>). Since <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infects RBCs, its antigens are primarily associated with ‘particles’ in vivo (i.e. RBCs). We hypothesized that the particulate nature of the parasite antigen itself might bias the APC response toward B cells and away from DCs, perhaps contributing to DCs’ apparent lack of participation in antigen presentation to T cells in this infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arroyo and Pepper, 2020</xref>). Upon RBC invasion, parasite antigens can also be shed from the parasite surface into the circulation, where APCs might encounter them in soluble form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beeson et al., 2016</xref>); however, the epitope we examined in our previous study was fused to a parasite protein expressed in the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (Hep17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Charoenvit et al., 1999</xref>), and therefore we expect APCs to interact with it primarily in the context of an iRBC. Another previous study found that DCs do interact with iRBCs in the spleens of infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borges da Silva et al., 2015</xref>), and indeed, it is well-established that DCs from infected mice <italic>can</italic> activate <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific T cell responses ex vivo, indicating that they must take up some parasite antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pouniotis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sponaas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sponaas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Voisine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perry et al., 2004</xref>). Yet the fact that they are capable of T cell activation ex vivo does not necessarily mean that they are the preferred or dominant APCs activating T cells in vivo, as infection could impact DC localization or migration. Some of these studies also examined B cells ex vivo and concluded that they did not activate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during malaria; however, they specifically isolated the CD11c<sup>-</sup> subset, likely excluding the activated B cells that are most likely to serve as APCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Voisine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perry et al., 2004</xref>). Other studies either did not specifically examine B cells or deliberately excluded them from analysis. Given our recent findings on the central role of B cells in activating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in this system, we considered it critical to revisit previous work examining uptake of iRBCs in the spleens of infected mice.</p><p>Modifying the experimental approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borges da Silva et al., 2015</xref>, we used flow cytometry to examine how well various splenic APC subsets, including B cells, could bind to labeled RBCs infected with the parasite <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>. Like <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> exports membrane proteins that render iRBCs cytoadherent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stephens et al., 2012</xref>), a characteristic found to be important for interaction with (and suppression of) DCs in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Urban et al., 1999</xref>). We enriched iRBCs from the blood of infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), labeled them with a fluorescent dye, and injected them intravenously into naïve mice. Differentially labeled naïve RBCs (nRBCs) were injected for comparison. We harvested spleens after 30 min and assessed association of labeled nRBCs and iRBCs with various splenic subsets, including B cells (defined as CD45+ Thy1.2- MHCII<sup>+</sup> B220<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>lo/int</sup>), DCs (CD45<sup>+</sup> Thy1.2<sup>-</sup> MHCII<sup>hi</sup> CD11c<sup>hi</sup>), and red pulp macrophages (RPMs; CD45<sup>+</sup> Thy1.2<sup>-</sup> MHCII<sup>+</sup> F4/80<sup>hi</sup>), which specialize in uptake and recycling of senescent RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that DCs made up only a small fraction of total RBC<sup>+</sup> splenocytes; instead, RBCs were mostly distributed between RPMs and B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Additional flow experiments examining Siglec-H<sup>+</sup> plasmacytoid DCs did not detect significant association of iRBCs with these cells (data not shown). The frequencies of iRBC<sup>+</sup> DCs that we measured were similar to those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borges da Silva et al., 2015</xref>; however, that group did not perform a comparison with B cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DCs capture only a small fraction of infected RBCs in vivo.</title><p>Red blood cells infected with <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic> (iRBCs) were enriched from infected mice, labeled with a fluorescent dye, and injected intravenously into naïve C57Bl/6 J mice.

Very few splenocytes acquired both PE and iRBC labels in our experiments; this could be due both to differences in a particular cell’s ability to take up either label, and to the overall low frequency of splenocytes that pick up any label (making a double positive cell even more rare).

Further, the ratio of PE<sup>+</sup> DCs to iRBC<sup>+</sup> DCs within each mouse was significantly higher than the ratio of PE<sup>+</sup> RPMs or B cells to iRBC<sup>+</sup> RPMs or B cells, respectively, indicating that DCs are biased toward taking up PE more so than iRBCs, relative to the other APC subsets examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Strikingly, however, the Tfh and GC Tfh populations were virtually absent among GP66-specific cells in infected mice following GP immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). This was not due to a generalized loss of Tfh cells in infected mice, since abundant CXCR5<sup>+</sup> T cells were observed in the bulk (non-tetramer-binding) T cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and our previous study found strong Tfh polarization of GP66-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at similar timepoints after infection with GP66-expressing parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arroyo and Pepper, 2020</xref>).

Together, these data demonstrate that an established <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection does not prevent expansion of T cells in response to a heterologous soluble antigen, but does temporarily disrupt the polarization of antigen-specific T cells into B cell-helping Tfh and GC Tfh cells.</p><p>Previous work has shown that DCs can orchestrate initial differentiation of CXCR5<sup>+</sup> Tfh cells 2–4 days after immunization, but that maintenance of the Tfh phenotype at day 8 requires both cognate and non-cognate interactions with B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kerfoot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pepper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">von der Weid and Langhorne, 1993</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that interactions between DCs and T cells were intact in infected mice, allowing for T cell expansion, but that infection disrupted interactions between GP-specific T cells and B cells, preventing establishment of Tfh and GC Tfh populations.

We speculate that some of this antigen may be acquired by DCs in soluble form after being shed from iRBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beeson et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although they did not capture iRBCs efficiently, DCs in both uninfected and infected mice readily took up soluble antigen and expressed the Class II and costimulatory molecules necessary to activate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Further, although the composition of the DC subset changed during infection, the magnitude of the T cell response to soluble protein immunization was similar in both uninfected and infected mice, indicating that DCs were competent to activate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in a <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-infected spleen. The use of different markers to define DC subsets complicates direct comparisons between our findings and previous studies, but Sponaas et al. identified CD8<sup>-</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs from infected mice as the most robust activators of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells ex vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sponaas et al., 2006</xref>; we believe that at the timepoints examined, this subset largely overlaps with the CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD64<sup>+</sup> moDC population that we identified here as the main DC subset capturing soluble antigen in infected mice. In other contexts, moDCs have been found fully capable of antigen presentation and T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plantinga et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gieseler et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, our findings are consistent with previous studies showing that DCs isolated from infected mice are capable of activating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro. In addition, though, our work provides a readout of interactions between DCs and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells within malarial hosts rather than ex vivo. This is important because the splenic architecture undergoes profound alteration in mice and humans with malaria, with dissolution of marginal zones and blurring of borders between the T cell zones and B cell follicles; it has been suggested that these architectural disruptions contribute to the observed delay in establishment of germinal centers, and subsequent failure to make optimal antibody responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achtman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stevenson and Kraal, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beattie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Urban et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cadman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keitany et al., 2016</xref>). These tissue changes have already begun to occur 5 days after infection, when we immunized mice with GP, and reach their peak during the window in which the GP-specific response is being initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achtman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stevenson and Kraal, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cadman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ryg-Cornejo et al., 2016a</xref>). Our data suggest that even within this dramatically altered tissue environment, DCs are able to interact with both antigen and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in a way that permits robust expansion of the latter, ruling out the existence of global DC dysfunction in the malaria-inflamed spleen.</p><p>At the same time, we did observe a near-complete defect in differentiation of GP-specific Tfh and GC Tfh cells in mice that were immunized with GP 5 days after <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection. We and others previously showed that ICOS-mediated interactions between B and T cells support maintenance of Tfh cells, while cognate B-T interactions are necessary for the GC Tfh subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pepper et al., 2011</xref>). In light of this, we infer that the loss of GP-specific Tfh and GC Tfh cells in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-infected mice is due to disruption of both cognate and non-cognate interactions between GP-specific T cells and B cells. Here, alteration of the splenic architecture may play an important role, with the blurring of the T-B border potentially making it more difficult for activated T cells to locate B cells. The inflammatory milieu of the infected spleen may also negatively impact Tfh development; we and others have found that blocking inflammatory cytokines enhances the differentiation of Tfh cells and GC B cells during infections with other strains of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keitany et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ryg-Cornejo et al., 2016a</xref>). Finally, it is interesting to speculate whether the BCR-independent binding of iRBCs that we observed may dilute or misdirect the antigen-specific B cell response in hosts with malaria. Indeed, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection is known to induce polyclonal, nonspecific B cell activation as well as activation of B cells autoreactive for RBC antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rivera-Correa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rivera-Correa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandez-Arias et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sardinha et al., 2002</xref>). This could also contribute to the failure of GP-specific B cells to expand and support the differentiation of cognate Tfh cells.</p><p>An important question is whether the disruption to humoral responses that we observe in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-infected spleens is a malaria-specific phenomenon. Daugan et al. previously found that mice infected with LCMV simultaneous with or 4 days before heterologous immunization developed fewer immunogen-specific antibody-secreting cells and lower specific antibody titers, suggesting that other pathogens can induce similar immune dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daugan et al., 2016</xref>). However, the same study found intact responses to heterologous immunization in mice infected with vesicular stomatitis virus, indicating that not all infections disrupt heterologous immunity. A separate study found that mice infected with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> two days <italic>after</italic> heterologous immunization exhibited defective antibody responses to the heterologous antigen, but immunized mice infected with LCMV or <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banga et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together with the contrasting results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daugan et al., 2016</xref>, which differed in the timing of immunization relative to infection, these data may indicate that LCMV disrupts humoral responses within a narrower window of time than <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Nevertheless, we favor the hypothesis that multiple pathogenic infections can interfere with the robust development of heterologous responses. The precise mechanisms of disruption appear to differ in different infections, but likely involve host-derived cytokines and chemokines, with type 1 interferons, lymphotoxin, and interferon gamma being implicated in studies using LCMV, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keitany et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daugan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glatman Zaretsky et al., 2012</xref>). Typically in these studies, defects in the humoral response correlate with elevated inflammation and disruption of the splenic architecture; as inflammation resolves, the infection is cleared, and the tissue reorganizes, germinal centers and B cell responses also recover.</p><p>The initial motivation for this study was to investigate mechanisms underlying our previous discovery that B cells, rather than DCs, served as the dominant APC population shaping the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response during <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection. By expanding previously established assays of iRBC uptake to include examination of B cells, we found that the majority of iRBCs associate with splenic B cells rather than with DCs, and that B cells preferentially bind iRBCs over nRBCs. This finding is consistent with a previous study showing that B cells were the primary APCs that activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses when antigen was delivered in nanoparticle form, whereas DCs were key for initiating responses to the same antigen in soluble form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hong et al., 2018</xref>). In that study, B cell uptake of nanoparticle-associated antigen was BCR-dependent and performed by antigen-specific B cells. Here, we found that B cells can preferentially bind iRBCs independent of the BCR, although this does not preclude additional BCR-dependent binding by B cells specific for parasite antigens, such as those we have characterized extensively in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krishnamurty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keitany et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thouvenel et al., 2021</xref>). This selective but BCR-independent binding is intriguing; it suggests the existence of antigen-nonspecific interactions between iRBCs and B cells that might explain the reported activation of nonspecific polyclonal or autoreactive B cells during malaria. The literature suggests a number of possible such interaction pathways: receptors expressed by B cells might bind opsonizing antibody, complement, exposed phosphatidylserines or parasite proteins on the iRBC surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vijay et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Donati et al., 2004</xref>). Once taken up, iRBCs contain immunostimulatory ligands, such as parasite RNA and DNA, that could activate B cells through Toll-like receptor signaling, alone or in conjunction with signaling from any of the above pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baccarella et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rivera-Correa et al., 2017</xref>). The iRBCs used in this study were isolated from mice 6–7 days post-infection, a time when some anti-parasite antibody may be present on the iRBC surface; however, we did not observe any defect in B cell binding of iRBCs in vitro when we isolated iRBCs from μMT mice (which lack antibodies) or added an Fc receptor-blocking antibody (data not shown). Further dissection of interactions between iRBCs and B cells therefore remains an important avenue for future research.</p><p>One key aspect of our study with relevance for human health is its insight into the detrimental effects of ongoing <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection on antibody responses to immunization. Such effects have been appreciated for decades, most notably through measurement of poor responses to childhood vaccinations in children from endemic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greenwood et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Williamson and Greenwood, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banga et al., 2015</xref>). Malaria also may affect antibody avidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cadman et al., 2008</xref>). But the mechanisms underlying these malaria-associated decreases in antibody titers have mostly remained unknown, although one paper did identify increased turnover of serum antibodies as a contributing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sardinha et al., 2002</xref>). We recently found that blood-stage-induced inflammation disrupts the development of sporozoite-specific B cells and antibodies in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keitany et al., 2016</xref>), perhaps providing an explanation for the relative scarcity of CSP-specific memory B cells in naturally exposed humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wipasa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jahnmatz et al., 2022</xref>). In the present study, we have further elucidated the cellular basis for defective antibody production during malaria: we showed that immunization with adjuvanted protein during acute <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection activates immunogen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, but fails to elicit the Tfh cells necessary to support a robust immunogen-specific B cell response, correlating with diminished B cell expansion and decreased serum antibody titers. The detrimental effect on antibody production is transient, suggesting that interactions between B and T cells eventually recover as the infection is cleared to sub-patent levels. However, in endemic areas, many clinically immune humans carry patent levels of parasites in their blood during much of the year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ryg-Cornejo et al., 2016b</xref>). It remains to be seen whether asymptomatic parasitemia affects vaccine efficacy similarly to acute malaria. Even so, a strategy in which vaccine is administered together with anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> chemoprophylaxis has recently shown great promise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chandramohan et al., 2021</xref>), raising our hope that a greater understanding of malaria’s effects on the immune system will enable continued improvement of human protection from this and other diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

C57Bl/6 J (B6), CD45.1<sup>+</sup>, and MD4 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. B6 and CD45.1<sup>+</sup> mice were crossed in-house to generate CD45.1<sup>+</sup> CD45.2<sup>+</sup> mice. All mice were group-housed at the University of Washington on a twelve-hour light-dark cycle under specific pathogen-free conditions. 8–12 week old male and female mice were used for all experiments. Mice were age- and sex-matched within each experiment, and no significant differences were observed between sexes. Mice were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Sample sizes were determined by past experience. No mice were excluded from analysis. All mouse experiments were conducted with the approval of the UW Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocols 4412–01 to MFF and 4283–01 to MP) in accordance with the guidelines of the NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title><italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites</title><p>Wild-type <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic> AS was obtained from the MR4 Stock Center and passaged in B6 mice.

For <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infections, mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 10<sup>6</sup> infected RBCs. Parasitemia was monitored by thin blood smear stained with Giemsa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). For immunization with irradiated parasites, <italic>P. yoelii</italic> GP66-infected RBCs were suspended in Alsevers solution and subjected to 30,000 rad on ice. 10<sup>7</sup> irradiated iRBC were then injected i.p. into mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Enrichment and labeling of iRBCs</title><p>Blood was collected by cardiac puncture from infected mice 6–7 days post-infection, when parasitemia was ~20–40%, and immediately diluted into 10 mL PBS. It was then spun, resuspended in PBS, and loaded onto pre-washed LD columns (Miltenyi). The bound fraction was washed with 4–5 mL PBS, eluted, spun down and resuspended at 5*10<sup>7</sup> RBC/mL in PBS. CFSE or CellTrace Violet (Invitrogen) was added to a final concentration of 5 μM and cells were labeled for 20 min at room temperature. Labeled RBCs were washed in five volumes of cold DMEM + 10% FBS, spun, and resuspended in PBS at 10<sup>9</sup> cells/mL for injection. Degree of enrichment was measured both by thin blood smear and by flow cytometry using Hoescht nucleic acid dye to identify iRBCs. To generate naïve RBCs, blood from a naïve mouse was collected and passed through an LD column. The flowthrough was collected and labeled as described for iRBCs. Injections of 10<sup>8</sup> labeled RBCs were performed via retroorbital vein. In some cases, labeled iRBCs were mixed with 100 μg PE (Agilent) prior to injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Detection of RBC binding during processing of spleens</title><p>CD45.2<sup>+</sup> (B6) mice were injected with labeled, enriched iRBCs as described above.

After harvests were complete, each pair of spleens was manually disrupted together, filtered through nylon mesh, and placed back on ice. Flow cytometric analysis was performed as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In vitro RBC binding</title><p>Spleens were aseptically removed from naïve B6 and MD4 mice after euthanasia according to approved methods.

The tissue was then manually disrupted and passed through nylon mesh to obtain single-cell suspensions. The digest step was omitted when only lymphocytes were analyzed. RBCs were lysed in ACK buffer and samples were blocked with anti-CD16/CD32 prior to labeling with antibodies. To analyze antigen-specific T cells, splenocytes were labeled with I-A(b) LCMV GP 66–77 tetramer (NIH Tetramer Core Facility) conjugated to APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arroyo and Pepper, 2020</xref>). To analyze GP-specific B cells, splenocytes were incubated first with a decoy reagent labeled in-house with APC-Dylight755 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>), then with a fluorescently labeled GP tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2019</xref>).

The authors elegantly showed that DCs were activated, capable of acquiring antigens and priming T cells during <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection. B cells are the main APC to capture particulate antigens such as infected RBC (iRBC), while DCs preferentially take up soluble antigens. This study is important to understand how ongoing infections such as malaria may negatively affect heterologous immunizations.</p><p>Overall, the experimental designs are straightforward, and the manuscript is well-written.

Would malaria infection in MD4 mouse that carries transgenic BCR that does not recognize malaria parasite impair subsequent B cell response to HEL immunization? This may clarify whether the impairment of subsequent B cell response is BCR-specific. If malaria impairs subsequent B cell response to HEL in MD4 mouse, it might suggest that other cell types and B cell-extrinsic factors might be involved in causing the impaired B cell responses, instead of malaria affecting B cells directly.</p><p>3. MD4 mice were mentioned in the Methods in vitro RBC binding, although none of the figures described the usage of MD4 mice. This experiment data might be important to show whether RBC binding to B cells is mediated through BCR.</p><p>4. Does <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection have any effects on B cell uptake of subsequent antigens, such as soluble antigen PE or particulate antigen CFSE-labeled P. yoelii iRBC?</p><p>5. Is this phenomenon specific to malaria infection? Does malaria-irrelevant particulate immunization affect T-B interaction of subsequent heterologous immunization?</p><p>6. Despite the impaired Tfh and GC 8 days after immunization following malaria infection, Figure 5F showed GP-specific IgG eventually increased to the same level as the uninfected immunized mice on day 23. Did the authors check whether these mice had a delayed Tfh and GC response that eventually increase on day 23? Are these antibody responses derived from GC, or GC-independent response?</p><p>7. Does recovery from malaria infection by antimalarial treatment rescue the B cell response to subsequent heterologous immunization?</p><p>8. Figure 1C shows more nRBC was taken up than iRBC in B cells, but Line 142 states that &quot;B cells bound significantly more iRBC than nRBC. Is there a mistake in the figure arrangement? Why do B cells take up for naïve RBC than iRBC?</p><p>9. Figure S1 C and D are confusing. CD45.1+ CD45.2+ mouse did not receive labeled iRBC, but why iRBC was detected as much as 40% in the spleen of this naïve mouse?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The data presented support the conclusions of the paper, and my concerns are largely conceptional in how we understand this data in the context of malaria infection in vaccination in endemic areas</p><p>1) The data is presented based on the idea that antigen uptake and presentation differ between particle and soluble antigens, and that during malaria infection particle uptake is more important due to circulating iRBCs. However, during parasite invasion of RBCs, the parasite sheds large amounts of antigen into the circulation, at least some of which would then be found in a soluble form in the circulation. Can the authors comment on this aspect of infection and if/how this may impact the interpretation of results? Do authors assume that any soluble antigen taken up and presented (via DCs?) during infection would be impacted as for GP66 soluble antigen? Or could an interaction on immune responses where the antigen is presented via both particle and soluble pathways?</p><p>2) Impact of particle antigen opsonisation on antigen uptake and presentation. The authors use parasites isolated from mice who have been infected for 6-7 days to investigate the ability of different subsets to update particle antigens. At this time point, have mice developed antibody responses that opsonise these parasites, or are antibody levels low and parasites opsonised? Would opsonised parasites, such as those coated with sera from children in a setting of chronic infection, have a different pattern/ability to be opsonised by different immune cell subsets? And/or would opsonisation change how the DC and other cell types are processing/presenting antigens? While these issues could be addressed experimentally either now or in the future, the manuscript should at least consider this issue because, during a human infection in areas of high exposure, individuals are likely to have reasonable levels of antibodies with opsonised parasites circulating.</p><p>3) While authors show that malaria infection disrupts the response to soluble antigens, the relevance directly to vaccination should be considered carefully, specifically because vaccines of soluble antigens are largely given alongside adjuvants which also will modulate DC function. Again, this could be addressed experimentally now or in the future, but definitely should be mentioned and considered when interpreting the results.</p><p>Prior to publication, I suggest the following edits/queries for clarity.</p><p>Is the legend in Figure 1 correct? Line 142 states &quot;B cells bound significantly more iRBCs than nRBCs …&quot; but the figure is the opposite as labelled. I assumed that the labels have been switched, but best to check and match back to the text as needed.</p><p>In Figure 1 – suggestion to also analyse the data as RBC+ (% of total cell subset) – ie RBC+ DCs/% of total DCs, to understand the relative capacity of each subset to uptake antigen as a % of all those cells in that subset.</p><p>In Figure 2 – it looks like that are hardly any double positive cells – ie those which have taken up both PE and iRBCs at the same time – is this expected and consistent or just in the gating example? Does it suggest the specialisation of both B cells and DCs to be better able to uptake soluble or particle antigens in some way or suggestive of different subsets?</p><p>I don't understand Figure 3C – why is the PE+ DCs in the naive mice 0? Additionally, the text states in line 226 &quot;we observed equivalent or slightly higher frequencies&quot; but Figure 3C has a clear significantly increased uptake in infected mice.</p><p>At day 23, when antibody levels to soluble antigen (Figure 5F) have recovered to levels of uninfected mice – are robust Tfh/GC B cells detected? Ie, is there evidence of germinal centre recovery? Is this due to long-term soluble antigen in DCs that is able to then activate naïve T/B cells down the track?</p><p>Figure 5 – shows reduced IgG, but would be beneficial to also look at the specific subclasses of these antibodies, particularly given the importance of cytophilic subclasses in protection.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83330.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In regard to reviewer #2 conceptual concerns (from 1) to 3)), please discuss these points carefully.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed these points with additional discussion and references to the relevant literature; please see our responses to Reviewer #2, Public Review Points 1-3, below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Authors should clarify whether the impairment of B-T cell interaction is due to direct BCR interaction with iRBC, or indirect response to extrinsic factors induced by malaria infection, by using MD4 mice</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this point extensively in our responses to Reviewer #1, Specific Comments 1 and 2, below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Does P. chabaudi infection have any effects on B cell uptake of subsequent antigens, such as soluble antigen PE or particulate antigen CFSE-labeled <italic>P. yoelii</italic> iRBC?</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide data showing the effect of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection on B cell uptake of soluble PE; Please see our response to Reviewer #1, Specific Comment #4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript clearly demonstrates that murine malaria infection with Plasmodium chabaudi impairs B cells' interaction with T cells, rather than DCs interaction with T cells.

However, the question remains whether direct, antigen-nonspecific iRBC-B cell interactions (i.e., not mediated by the BCR) or additional extrinsic factors, or a combination, are responsible for the observed defects in Tfh and GC B cell populations.</p><p>Existing studies from other infection models are informative in answering this question. Daugan et al. (Front Immunol 2016; PMID 27994594) previously published experiments similar to ours, but used LCMV instead of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. That is, they immunized uninfected or LCMV-infected mice with the well-studied immunogen NPP-CGG and measured NP-specific antibody production and other parameters. They found that LCMV infection concurrent with immunization (or 4-8 days before) significantly decreased the numbers of NP-specific splenic antibody-secreting cells and IgG1 titers, and caused major disruptions to splenic architecture. These defects were shown to require type I interferon (T1IFN) signaling in B cells. However, T1IFN is unlikely to be solely responsible for the observed phenotypes, because simultaneous infection with VSV, another virus that also induces T1IFN, did not cause any defects in NP-specific antibody production. Contrasting with the work of Daugan et al., Banga et al. (PloS One 2015; PMID 25919588) found that infecting with LCMV (or with <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>) two days after heterologous immunization did not disrupt immunogen-specific responses, whereas <italic>P. yoelii</italic> did. Examining both these studies, we hypothesize that both LCMV and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections can disrupt humoral responses, but that LCMV does so within a narrower time frame, thereby yielding different results depending on whether infection comes a few days before or a few days after immunization.</p><p>Complementing these studies of heterologous immunization, additional publications have reported that cytokines induced by several different pathogenic infections drive disruption of germinal centers and decreases in antibody titers specific for the pathogen itself, often correlated with disordered splenic architecture. Glatman Zaretsky et al. (Infect Immun 2012; PMID 22851754) showed that <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infection causes transient disruption of splenic architecture and loss of defined GCs by microscopy. These defects were partially due to decreased lymphotoxin expression by B cells, and were rescued by a lymphotoxin receptor agonist. Similarly, we previously reported that blood-stage <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection disrupted germinal center responses to a <italic>Plasmodium</italic> liver-stage antigen (Keitany et al. Cell Rep 2016; PMID 28009289). In this context, however, the same lymphotoxin receptor agonist had no effect on GCs; instead, blockade of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon γ partially restored antibody responses to the liver-stage antigen. Overall, we favor the hypothesis that several different pathogens can disrupt GCs and antibody responses indirectly by inducing inflammation and a disordered splenic environment; however, the precise mechanisms of disruption likely differ from infection to infection, with different cytokines or other effectors playing key roles in some but not other settings. Importantly, not all pathogens disrupt antibody production, since again, infection with VSV or <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> did not affect immunogen-specific titers in immunized mice (Daugan Front Immunol 2016; Banga et al. 2015). We have now addressed this topic at length in the Discussion (lines 399-418).</p><p>The existence of indirect, inflammation- or cytokine-related mechanisms that may interfere with germinal center formation and antibody production does not preclude additional direct interactions between B cells and iRBCs that might also affect B cell function. We address this possibility more fully in the response to the next comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Would malaria infection in MD4 mouse that carries transgenic BCR that does not recognize malaria parasite impair subsequent B cell response to HEL immunization? This may clarify whether the impairment of subsequent B cell response is BCR-specific. If malaria impairs subsequent B cell response to HEL in MD4 mouse, it might suggest that other cell types and B cell-extrinsic factors might be involved in causing the impaired B cell responses, instead of malaria affecting B cells directly.</p></disp-quote><p>The question of whether the impairments we observe require BCR-specific interactions with iRBCs is an important one. However, we believe that the experiment the reviewer proposes to address this question has technical limitations; further, we assert that we have already provided data to address a requirement for BCR specificity.</p><p>With regard to the proposed experiment of immunizing MD4 mice with HEL in the presence or absence of malaria infection: MD4 mice, in which B cells express a transgenic receptor specific for HEL, can be expected to mount a massive, monoclonal response to direct immunization with HEL that would be very different from the physiological context of a polyclonal B cell population. We are doubtful that this experimental setup would be informative for the question at hand, especially because we are studying the effects of B-Tfh interactions, which are already limiting in the physiological setting of a polyclonal B cell response, but would be massively unbalanced in an MD4 mouse where all B cells express the receptor for HEL.</p><p>Usually, investigators studying MD4 B cell responses generate a more physiological setting by adoptively transferring a small but detectable number of MD4 transgenic B cells into a mouse with a normal polyclonal B cell population, and immunizing that mouse. We maintain that this approach is essentially what we have done in our study, except that instead of using transferred. transgenic cells to identify a B cell population of known specificity, we have used tetramers to detect a specific population of endogenous B cells in a polyclonal setting. By examining GP-specific B cells in our immunization experiments, we restricted our analysis to B cells that could not have had any BCR-mediated, antigen-specific interactions with iRBCs (because the GP antigen is not present in the iRBCs; it is delivered as a soluble protein antigen, 5 days after initiation of infection). Because we see dysfunction in the GP-specific T and B cell populations despite the absence of this antigen within iRBCs, we can conclude that the disruptions to these populations are not due to antigen-specific iRBC-BCR interactions.</p><p>We do also show (using MD4 B cells in Figure S1B) that selective interactions between iRBCs and B cells do not require an antigen-specific BCR. Thus, it is still possible that direct interactions between iRBCs and B cells (that are independent of antigen binding to the BCR) are responsible for disrupting subsequent adaptive responses, perhaps in addition to the more indirect factors that we discuss in the response to Comment #1 above. We are very interested in this possibility, which is discussed in lines 428-436 of the manuscript. But the use of MD4 B cells would not address this specific question. Instead, we would need to identify an alternative pathway or receptor that mediates the iRBC-B cell interaction, and study the effects of blocking that pathway on downstream adaptive responses. We have spent considerable time and energy on this question, but have not yet been able to identify such a pathway; this remains a matter for further study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. MD4 mice were mentioned in the Methods in vitro RBC binding, although none of the figures described the usage of MD4 mice. This experiment data might be important to show whether RBC binding to B cells is mediated through BCR.</p></disp-quote><p>Cells from MD4 mice were used in Figure S1B to show that in vitro binding of iRBCs to B cells did not require interaction with an antigen-specific BCR. We agree that this is an important point and have revised the text (lines 152-156) to outline it more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Does <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection have any effects on B cell uptake of subsequent antigens, such as soluble antigen PE or particulate antigen CFSE-labeled <italic>P. yoelii</italic> iRBC?</p></disp-quote><p>We examined uptake of PE by B cells in <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>-infected mice (5 days post-infection) compared to naïve mice. There was a trend towards increased uptake in the infected mice, but this difference was not significant. These data are taken from the same samples that did reveal a significant increase in PE uptake by DCs in infected mice (Figure 3C). We have now included the B cell data in the paper as Figure 3D, and discussed them in lines 231-232.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Is this phenomenon specific to malaria infection? Does malaria-irrelevant particulate immunization affect T-B interaction of subsequent heterologous immunization?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not believe this phenomenon is specific to malaria infection; please see the extensive discussion of this point in the response to Comment #1 above. We would hypothesize that malaria-irrelevant particle immunization (as with nanoparticles) would not affect T-B interactions for subsequent heterologous immunizations, however, since the disruption seems to be associated with the massive inflammation and splenic disorganization that occurs following certain infections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Despite the impaired Tfh and GC 8 days after immunization following malaria infection, Figure 5F showed GP-specific IgG eventually increased to the same level as the uninfected immunized mice on day 23. Did the authors check whether these mice had a delayed Tfh and GC response that eventually increase on day 23? Are these antibody responses derived from GC, or GC-independent response?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now examined GP-specific T cell numbers and polarization between days 23 and 35 post-immunization. We found that although a defect persists in the percentage of GP66-specific T cells that exhibit a GC Tfh phenotype at later timepoints, the absolute number of GC Tfh cells is not significantly defective in infected mice at these times. Concurrently there is a slight (though nonsignificant) increase in the total numbers of GP66+ T cells in the infected mice; we believe that this modest overall expansion permits recovery of the GC Tfh population numbers despite the continued defect in their frequency. These findings are consistent with our observation that antibody levels recover in infected mice by 3 weeks post-infection. We have added these data to Figure 4 (E-G) and discuss them in lines 283-293.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Does recovery from malaria infection by antimalarial treatment rescue the B cell response to subsequent heterologous immunization?</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown previously that drug-mediated clearance of blood-stage <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection restores GC and antibody responses to a liver-stage-specific antigen, which normally are disrupted by emergence of the blood-stage (Keitany et al. Cell Rep 2016). We have also shown that antimalarial drug treatment restores GC responses in mice lacking the innate immune sensor CGAS, which have higher parasitemia, exacerbated splenic disruption, and diminished GC responses following <italic>P. yoelii</italic> infection (Hahn et al., JCI Insight 2018). Based on these results we hypothesize that drug-mediated clearance of blood-stage infection would also rescue B cell responses to heterologous immunization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

Why do B cells take up for naïve RBC than iRBC?</p></disp-quote><p>The symbols in the figure legend were switched in error; the filled circles are actually iRBC+ and the outlined circles are nRBC+. We regret the error and appreciate the reviewer bringing it to our attention. We have corrected the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure S1 C and D are confusing. CD45.1+ CD45.2+ mouse did not receive labeled iRBC, but why iRBC was detected as much as 40% in the spleen of this naïve mouse?</p></disp-quote><p>The experiment depicted in Figures S1 C and D was designed to test whether B cells actually bound injected iRBCs in vivo, or whether the binding occurred during processing of the tissue. With this experimental setup (injecting labeled iRBCs into CD45.2+ mice, then excising and disrupting the spleen together with an untreated CD45.1+ CD45.2+ spleen), iRBC signal from in vivo uptake should be observed only in CD45.2+ splenocytes, whereas iRBC binding that occurs during tissue processing will be distributed between the two genotypes. Thus, the ~40% of iRBC signal observed in CD45.1+ CD45.2+ B cells leads us to conclude that much of the observed B cell binding from our in vivo experiments occurs during processing, as we state in the text (lines 151-152). Even so, in vitro experiments clearly show that B cells selectively bind iRBCs over naïve RBCs in a setting where processing is not a confounder (Figure S1B). To clear up any confusion, we have expanded the description of the experiment and its interpretation in the Supplemental Figure Legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The data presented support the conclusions of the paper, and my concerns are largely conceptional in how we understand this data in the context of malaria infection in vaccination in endemic areas</p><p>1) The data is presented based on the idea that antigen uptake and presentation differ between particle and soluble antigens, and that during malaria infection particle uptake is more important due to circulating iRBCs. However, during parasite invasion of RBCs, the parasite sheds large amounts of antigen into the circulation, at least some of which would then be found in a soluble form in the circulation. Can the authors comment on this aspect of infection and if/how this may impact the interpretation of results? Do authors assume that any soluble antigen taken up and presented (via DCs?) during infection would be impacted as for GP66 soluble antigen? Or could an interaction on immune responses where the antigen is presented via both particle and soluble pathways?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point and we have now discussed it further in the text (lines 111-115, 204-210, and 356-357). In our previously published study, where we extensively characterized CD4 T cell responses to the GP66 epitope expressed by <italic>P. yoelii</italic>, the epitope was fused to a parasite protein (Hep17) that localizes to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, and so we do assume that the majority of this antigen is encountered by APCs in the context of an iRBC, rather than shed in soluble form. In contrast, some merozoite surface antigens such as cleaved MSP1 are shed copiously from the parasite coat upon RBC invasion, and therefore would be expected to exist in soluble as well as parasite-associated form.</p><p>Unfortunately, our laboratory does not currently have tetramer reagents or access to transgenic mice that would allow us to assess T cell responses specific for shed or soluble parasite antigens. But a previous study from Stephens et al. (Blood 2005; PMID 15890689) reported that T cells with a transgenic TCR specific for an epitope in the shed portion of MSP1 could boost antibody production when transferred into T cell-deficient mice infected with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>, suggesting that at least some fraction of the MSP1-specific T cells differentiate into T helper cells capable of supporting B cell activity. However, antibody production was significantly delayed in this setting compared to its usual kinetics in wild-type mice. Further side-by-side characterization would be needed to assess differentiation of these MSP1-specific transgenic T cells during infection, and determine whether they are primed from B cells or from DCs (or a combination).</p><p>We will note that we <italic>have</italic> extensively characterized B cell responses to MSP1 during both infection and immunization. While robust and T-dependent, MSP1-specific B cell responses in infected mice are delayed relative to their kinetics in mice immunized with recombinant MSP1 or other protein antigens. This may indicate that MSP1-specific T cell activation or cognate B-T interactions are defective in infected mice relative to immunized mice, despite the presumed presence of soluble (shed) MSP1 during infection. If this is the case, it suggests that the defects we describe in the current manuscript exist for both particle-associated and soluble parasite antigens. However, as we mentioned above, a careful characterization of MSP-1-specific T cell differentiation is needed to really understand this, and that requires additional tools that we can’t easily access at this time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Impact of particle antigen opsonisation on antigen uptake and presentation. The authors use parasites isolated from mice who have been infected for 6-7 days to investigate the ability of different subsets to update particle antigens. At this time point, have mice developed antibody responses that opsonise these parasites, or are antibody levels low and parasites opsonised? Would opsonised parasites, such as those coated with sera from children in a setting of chronic infection, have a different pattern/ability to be opsonised by different immune cell subsets? And/or would opsonisation change how the DC and other cell types are processing/presenting antigens? While these issues could be addressed experimentally either now or in the future, the manuscript should at least consider this issue because, during a human infection in areas of high exposure, individuals are likely to have reasonable levels of antibodies with opsonised parasites circulating.</p></disp-quote><p>We ourselves have been very interested in the question of whether host antibodies (or other host factors such as complement) might affect uptake of iRBCs. As the reviewer notes, the iRBCs we use in our experiments are taken from mice 6-7 days post-infection, at which time some amount of anti-parasite antibody has developed. We spent a considerable amount of time trying to measure effects of opsonizing antibody, or even deposited complement, on uptake of iRBCs. However, we did not see any change in B cell binding of iRBCs in vitro when we blocked complement receptor with anti-CD21; blocked antibody receptors (Fc receptors) with anti-CD16/CD32 or excess normal mouse serum; or used iRBCs taken from complement-depleted mice (treated with cobra venom factor) or from uMT mice (which entirely lack B cells and antibody). Thus, we have not been able to find any role for opsonizing antibody (or complement) in iRBC uptake. We have not included these experiments in the manuscript because they yielded only negative data, and we were not able to design positive controls robust enough to give us confidence that the experiments were technically sound (and therefore that the negative results were due to the underlying biology and not to experiment failure). We have added a discussion point about this issue (lines 438-442).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While authors show that malaria infection disrupts the response to soluble antigens, the relevance directly to vaccination should be considered carefully, specifically because vaccines of soluble antigens are largely given alongside adjuvants which also will modulate DC function. Again, this could be addressed experimentally now or in the future, but definitely should be mentioned and considered when interpreting the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Whenever we performed soluble protein immunizations to examine adaptive immune responses in this study, the immunogen was delivered in adjuvant, specifically Σ Adjuvant System (SAS), as described in the Methods. This adjuvant contains the Monophosphoryl Lipid A component from <italic>Salmonella</italic> in an oil-water emulsion, and as such, its formulation is at least roughly similar to the AS01 adjuvant used in Mosquirix (RTS,S), the only licensed anti-malaria vaccine, as well as other vaccines currently used in humans. SAS has been shown to elicit very high titers of neutralizing antibodies in mice (Sastry et al., PloS One 2017, PMID 29073183). Therefore our results should have relevance for vaccination in humans. We have modified the manuscript text (lines 454-455) to highlight that in this study, protein immunogens were administered with adjuvant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Prior to publication, I suggest the following edits/queries for clarity.</p><p>Is the legend in Figure 1 correct? Line 142 states &quot;B cells bound significantly more iRBCs than nRBCs …&quot; but the figure is the opposite as labelled. I assumed that the labels have been switched, but best to check and match back to the text as needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The symbols in the figure legend were switched in error; the filled circles are actually iRBC+ and the open circles are nRBC+. We regret the error and appreciate the reviewer bringing it to our attention. We have corrected the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1 – suggestion to also analyse the data as RBC+ (% of total cell subset) – ie RBC+ DCs/% of total DCs, to understand the relative capacity of each subset to uptake antigen as a % of all those cells in that subset.</p></disp-quote><p>The data are presented this way (as RBC+ % of total cell subset) in Figure 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2 – it looks like that are hardly any double positive cells – ie those which have taken up both PE and iRBCs at the same time – is this expected and consistent or just in the gating example? Does it suggest the specialisation of both B cells and DCs to be better able to uptake soluble or particle antigens in some way or suggestive of different subsets?</p></disp-quote><p>We consistently observed this phenomenon across all our experiments—i.e. that very few cells took up both PE and iRBCs. We can suggest at least three factors that may underlie this: (1) an intrinsic relative specialization of B cells and DCs at picking up soluble versus particulate antigen, which we describe and characterize in Figure 2 and lines 186-192; (2) spatial organization within the spleen that may affect movement of, or access to, soluble versus particulate antigen; and (3) the overall very low frequency of splenocytes that pick up either label, which statistically would also result in an even lower frequency of cells picking up both labels. These factors are not mutually exclusive. We now discuss this point explicitly (lines 172-175).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I don't understand Figure 3C – why is the PE+ DCs in the naive mice 0? Additionally, the text states in line 226 &quot;we observed equivalent or slightly higher frequencies&quot; but Figure 3C has a clear significantly increased uptake in infected mice.</p></disp-quote><p>The absolute number of DCs that picked up PE in naïve mice in these experiments was between 500-5000 cells per mouse. We had graphed these numbers on a linear scale with the y- axis tick marks representing the indicated number multiplied by 10^-4 (which we indicated in the y-axis label). In this format, the values did appear very close to zero, especially next to the data points from infected mice. For better resolution of the data, we have changed the y-axis of this graph to a log scale in the revision.</p><p>Regarding the reviewer’s point about line 226:</p><p>“we had not wanted to overstate the increase in PE uptake in infected mice, since four of the six mice in this group were only slightly higher than in the naïve group while two additional mice had much higher uptake. However, the reviewer is correct that the statistics show a significant increase in the affected mice, so we have revised our text to state this clearly (line 229).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At day 23, when antibody levels to soluble antigen (Figure 5F) have recovered to levels of uninfected mice – are robust Tfh/GC B cells detected? Ie, is there evidence of germinal centre recovery? Is this due to long-term soluble antigen in DCs that is able to then activate naïve T/B cells down the track?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Reviewer 1, Specific Comment #6, with regard to recovery of Tfh cells by Day 23 and beyond. We have not examined GC B cell numbers at this later timepoint, but the recovered production of IgG in infected mice (Figure 5F) by this time, combined with the presence of near normal numbers of Tfh cells (Figure 4G), strongly suggests that germinal centers have recovered as well. Since total antigen-specific T cell numbers are intact in these mice even at early timepoints, we favor the hypothesis that resolving inflammation permits resumption of normal cognate and non-cognate interactions between B and T cells that allows recovery of germinal centers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5 – shows reduced IgG, but would be beneficial to also look at the specific subclasses of these antibodies, particularly given the importance of cytophilic subclasses in protection.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be interesting to examine specific subclasses of IgG in this setting. Unfortunately, we do not have any more stored serum samples that would facilitate the rapid assessment of this question. However, we have performed extensive analyses of antigen-specific IgG+ B cells in mice with malaria and found that the great majority of the class-switched population is dependent on T cell help (Harms Pritchard and Pepper, manuscript under revision). Thus, we would hypothesize that all IgG subclasses elicited by our immunization would be affected in hosts with malaria, since our model is that B-T interactions are severely disrupted in these mice.</p></body></sub-article></article>
