Although once thought to be present only in animals, recent genome sequencing has revealed components of these pathways in the closest unicellular relatives of animals. These findings raise questions about the ancestral functions of these developmental pathways and their potential role in the emergence of animal multicellularity. Here, we provide the first functional characterization of any of these developmental pathways in unicellular organisms by developing techniques for genetic manipulation in <italic>Capsaspora owczarzaki</italic>, a close unicellular relative of animals that displays aggregative multicellularity. We then use these tools to characterize the <italic>Capsaspora</italic> ortholog of the Hippo signaling nuclear effector YAP/TAZ/Yorkie (coYki), a key regulator of tissue size in animals. In contrast to what might be expected based on studies in animals, we show that coYki is dispensable for cell proliferation but regulates cytoskeletal dynamics and the three-dimensional (3D) shape of multicellular structures. We further demonstrate that the cytoskeletal abnormalities of individual coYki mutant cells underlie the abnormal 3D shape of coYki mutant aggregates. Taken together, these findings implicate an ancestral role for the Hippo pathway in cytoskeletal dynamics and multicellular morphogenesis predating the origin of animal multicellularity, which was co-opted during evolution to regulate cell proliferation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Capsaspora owczarzaki</italic></kwd><kwd>Hippo pathway</kwd><kwd>multicellularity</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY015708</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Duojia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Duojia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome editing in a close unicellular relative of animals suggests a premetazoan function of the Hippo pathway effector YAP/TAZ/Yorkie in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and multicellular morphogenesis but not proliferation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The vast morphological diversity observed in animals is generated by developmental programs mediated by a surprisingly small set of conserved signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pires-daSilva and Sommer, 2003</xref>). An exciting and unexpected finding from comparative genomic analysis indicates that many components of these pathways are present in the closest unicellular relatives of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">King et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ros-Rocher et al., 2021</xref>). This raises the question of whether these pathways show similar functions in animals and their unicellular relatives, and, if not, what the ancestral functions of these pathways were, and how they evolved to function in multicellular processes in animals. Answering this question could illuminate the roots of animal multicellularity and provide novel perspective on how to manipulate the activity of these biomedically important pathways.</p><p>One such signaling pathway is the Hippo pathway, which coordinates cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival in animals. Initially defined as a tumor suppressor pathway that restricts tissue growth in <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, Hippo signaling plays a conserved role in organ size control and regeneration in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis and Tapon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harvey and Hariharan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moya and Halder, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zheng and Pan, 2019</xref>). This pathway comprises a core kinase cascade involving sequential activation of two kinases, Hippo (MST1/2 in mammals) and Warts (LATS1/2 in mammals), which culminates in the phosphorylation and inactivation of the potent growth-stimulatory transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (YAP/TAZ in mammals) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This core kinase cascade is in turn regulated by diverse upstream inputs, most notably mechanical force, the state of the actin cytoskeleton, and cellâcell or cellâsubstrate adhesion as part of a mechanotransduction pathway that relays mechanical and architectural cues to gene expression. Echoing its pervasive function in metazoan growth control, the Hippo pathway is required for contact inhibition of proliferation in cultured mammalian cells, and defective Hippo signaling leading to YAP/TAZ oncogene activation is a major driver of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis and Tapon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harvey and Hariharan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moya and Halder, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zheng and Pan, 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Disruption of a YAP/TAZ/Yorkie ortholog in <italic>Capsaspora</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Hippo pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals. <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologs are in yellow, and mammalian orthologs are in white.

However, genome sequencing efforts have revealed that a core Hippo pathway and many upstream regulators are encoded in the genomes of the closest unicellular relatives of animals such as choanoflagellates and filasterians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">SebÃ©-PedrÃ³s et al., 2012</xref>). The choanoflagellates are flagellated filter feeders that can form multicellular rosette structures by incomplete cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fairclough et al., 2010</xref>), whereas filasterians are amoeboid organisms characterized by actin-rich filopodial projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>) and represent the most basal known unicellular organism encoding all core components of the Hippo pathway, including upstream kinases and downstream transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">SebÃ©-PedrÃ³s et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Capsaspora owczarzaki</italic> is a filasterean originally isolated as a putative endosymbiont in the freshwater snail <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic> that can attack and kill the parasitic schistosome <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stibbs et al., 1979</xref>). <italic>Capsaspora</italic> can be cultured easily in axenic growth medium containing protein source and serum in adherent or shaking culture and can be transiently transfected, allowing for the examination of protein localization using fluorescent fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parra-Acero et al., 2018</xref>).

The presence of complete core Hippo pathway components in the close unicellular relatives of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">SebÃ©-PedrÃ³s et al., 2012</xref>) provides the opportunity to elucidate the premetazoan function and evolutionary history of this pathway. By developing tools for genome editing in <italic>Capsaspora</italic>, we demonstrate that coYki regulates cytoskeletal dynamics at the cell cortex but is dispensable for the proliferation of <italic>Capsaspora</italic> cells. Such coYki-dependent cortical cytoskeletal function, in turn, regulates the 3D shape of <italic>Capsaspora</italic> aggregates in a manner that may involve tuning the strength of cellâsubstrate adhesion. Investigating the Hippo pathway in other unicellular relatives of animals such as choanoflagellates and ichthyosporeans, which are now amenable to transgenic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booth and King, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suga and Ruiz-Trillo, 2013</xref>), will further clarify the ancestral function of this pathway predating the emergence of animal multicellularity.</p><p>Our findings implicate cytoskeletal regulation as an ancestral function of YAP/TAZ/Yorkie predating the origin of Metazoa and suggest that this gene acquired the function of cell proliferation control after the last common ancestor of <italic>Capsaspora</italic> and animals in the lineage leading to animals. This co-option likely occurred early in the animal lineage, as in early-diverging ctenophores and cnidarians Hippo pathway activity is enriched in proliferating tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coste et al., 2016</xref>). Given that the cortical cytoskeleton is both an important upstream regulator and a downstream effector of Hippo signaling in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaspar and Tapon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun and Irvine, 2016</xref>), the co-option of YAP/TAZ/Yorkie for cell proliferation control in early metazoans may have provided a convenient mechanism that couples cell proliferation with cytoskeletal and mechanical properties of cells. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the function of YAP/TAZ/Yorkie in the unicellular ancestor of animals differed from what we see in <italic>Capsaspora</italic>, a model of cytoskeletal regulation by Hippo signaling in ancestral unicellular organisms followed by co-option of the Hippo pathway for regulation of cell proliferation in the lineage leading to animals seems plausible given our observations.</p><p>Our study suggests that the abnormal 3D shape of <italic>coYki -/-</italic> aggregates is due to increased cellâsubstrate adhesion without affecting cellâcell adhesion. <italic>Capsaspora</italic> encodes an integrin adhesome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">SebÃ©-PedrÃ³s et al., 2010</xref>), and <italic>Capsaspora</italic> cellâsubstrate adhesion is mediated at least in part by integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parra-Acero et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, our RNA-seq data shows that two integrin-Î² genes (CAOG_05058 and CAOG_01283) are upregulated in <italic>coYki -/-</italic> cells, suggesting a potential contribution by integrins in this phenotype. Given that the strength of integrin-mediated focal adhesions can be regulated by cytoskeletal contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dumbauld et al., 2010</xref>), the aberrant cytoskeletal properties of <italic>coYki -/-</italic> cells may also contribute to their abnormal cellâsubstrate adhesion. This possibility is consistent with our data showing that blebbistatin, which inhibits myosin and thus perturbs cytoskeletal contractility, can rescue the aberrant morphology of <italic>coYki -/-</italic> aggregates.</p><p>A dedicated role for coYki in regulating the 3D shape but not the size of <italic>Capsaspora</italic> aggregates may reflect the different selection pressures on animals versus their close unicellular relatives. It has been suggested that the emergence of multicellularity is driven by phagotrophic predators of unicellular organisms as multicellular aggregates are less likely to be consumed by phagotrophic predators and thus are selectively favored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stanley, 1973</xref>). A round aggregate shape ensures maximum contact between cells within the group, reducing the chance of a cell disassociating and thus being vulnerable to predation. Other proposed selective pressures for multicellularity include selection for sedimentation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dudin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tong et al., 2022</xref>) or selection for multicellular groups that can shield interior cells from external stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuzdzal-Fick et al., 2019</xref>). By increasing the roundness of aggregates, coYki could potentially affect either of these phenotypes: the shape of particles affects sedimentation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yokojima et al., 2021</xref>), and a more round shape minimizes surface area, thus potentially resulting in more interior cells that are shielded from stress.</p><p>Interestingly, a YAP loss-of-function mutation in medaka fish causes a tissue flattening phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Porazinski et al., 2015</xref>) similar to that observed in <italic>coYki -/- Capsaspora</italic> aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Although we cannot rule out independent acquisition of this Yorkie/YAP function in these two lineages, such phenotypic similarity suggests that the regulation of 3D tissue architecture is an ancient and conserved function of YAP/TAZ/Yorkie predating the origin of animal multicellularity. We speculate that YAP/TAZ/Yorkie may have first been selected during evolution to regulate the 3D shape of multicellular aggregates in unicellular ancestors of animals, and evolved later to also control organ size in order to maintain appropriate scaling between the size of an organ and the size of the body as a whole.</p><p>Besides implicating an ancestral function of YAP/TAZ/Yorkie in pre-metazoan multicellular morphogenesis, the genetic tools we have developed for modifying the <italic>Capsaspora</italic> genome provide a valuable opportunity to interrogate the premetazoan functions of other developmental regulators that are present in the genomes of close unicellular relatives of animals. Future functional studies in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> and other close unicellular relatives of animals should clarify the evolutionary history of these developmental regulators and further elucidate the nature of the unicellular ancestor of animals and the emergence of animal multicellularity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Two days after growth medium was added to cells following transfection, the growth medium was removed and replaced with 800 Î¼l of growth medium supplemented with selective drugs. Due to observations of variability in cell viability between transfections, three drug concentrations were tested in parallel for each transfection: for Geneticin (Thermo Fisher), cells were treated at 40, 60, or 80 Î¼g/ml; for nourseothricin (GoldBio), cells were treated at 50, 75, or 100 Î¼g/ml; for hygromycin B (Sigma), cells were treated at 150, 200, or 250 Î¼g/ml. Cells were grown in selective medium for 2 weeks, and medium was changed every 3 days. Following selection, clonal cell populations were generated by resuspending cells in growth medium by pipetting, diluting cells to 3 cells/ml in growth medium, and adding 100 Î¼l of this dilution to 200 Î¼l of growth medium per well in a 48-well plate (this procedure generated approximately 10 wells with cell growth for each 48-well plate).

We designed a pair of primers that amplify the drug resistance markers described above, including the actin (CAOG_06018) promoter and terminator, with 90 bp of homology adjacent to the sequence targeted for deletion at the 5â² end of the primers (oJP105 and oJP106).

Z-stack imaging of aggregates was done using a 7.7 Âµm interval between sections. This method allowed visualization of the 3D structure of the side of the aggregate closest to the objective. Orthogonal views of the aggregate through the approximate midline of the aggregate were generated using ImageJ. To measure the average curvature of aggregates, an open B-spline curve was fit to the aggregate border in an orthogonal view of the aggregate using Kappa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mary and Brouhard, 2019</xref>). An initial curve segment was manually defined on the side of the aggregate closest to the imaging objective by defining points along the aggregate border, and an open B-spline curve was fit to these points.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Xin Chen as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This study investigates the cellular basis of the Hippo signaling nuclear effector YAP/TAZ/Yorkie ortholog (coYki) using a unicellular organism Capsaspora owczarzaki, which potentially contributes to our understanding of the evolutionary roles of the Hippo signaling pathway, given the unique position of this organism during evolution. The distinct roles they found for coYki are unlike its roles in metazoans. These findings should enhance our understanding of the ancient roles of this factor. The tools the authors developed would also be useful for other people to use this unicellular organism as a model.</p><p>Most of the data of this manuscript are presented in a clear and logical manner. The major concerns include:</p><p>1. Better document of the procedure and results of the genome-editing technique developed in this work, including more direct sequencing analyses of the edited Capsaspora owczarzaki. Additionally, more validation and quantitation of the genome editing efficiency should be detailed.</p><p>2. The coYki's functions were assumed as a transcriptional regulator with its primary role as a regulator of cytoskeletal genes. There is a body of published work that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Yki has a function at the cell cortex that is independent of its function as a transcriptional regulator (Xu et al., 2018; PMID30032991). Without the data that show the localization of coYki, currently, we do not know whether it acts in the nucleus or at the cell cortex to regulate the cytoskeleton. More information about the subcellular localization of coYki will help understand its roles.</p><p>3. Capsaspora and animals such as ourselves are equally separated by time from our last common ancestor. The same data could lead to a different conclusion that the ancestral function of the Hippo pathway was to regulate cell proliferation and that this was lost in the lineage that led to Capsaspora. As we learn more about the function of the Hippo pathway in diverse organisms, we will be in a better position to address what the ancestral function was. Therefore, the statements on the ancestral roles of the Hippo pathway need to be revised. In addition, the overall studies in this work focus on Yki so the discussion can be more specific to this particular gene, instead of referring to the entire Hippo pathway.</p><p>4. Figure 2F causes confusion. Instead, a more direct assay using antibodies against Capsaspora integrin could be better to examine the cell-ECM adhesion versus cell-cell adhesion.</p><p>5. Figure 2G is an important piece of data for the later part of the manuscript, the 3D morphology needs to be adequately repeated, quantified, and documented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, the studies were well done and the analyses are rigorous, here are some suggestions:</p><p>1. A domain comparison between coYki with orthologs from metazoans will be helpful, along with Figure 1A.</p><p>2. Does expression of metazoan Yki rescue coYki-/- cells? Does overexpression of coYki lead to any phenotype?</p><p>3. The defective cell-ECM adhesion seems to involve Integrin-like molecules, which was further shown in the RNA-seq results. This connection is worth further investigation. For example, could upregulation of integrin rescue coYki-/- cells?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Authors are encouraged to do a better job of documenting the results from the genome editing efforts. The current approaches are indirect â looking at transcript levels and using +/- PCR off amplicons rather than simply sequencing off of the genomic DNA (which would be far more convincing). Please say more (e.g. starting in line 109) about how you targeted both alleles and provide quantification documenting how efficient the editing was.</p><p>Yki regulates cell proliferation in animals, but you find no such connection in Capsaspora. Have you ruled out the possibility that there might be suppressor mutations in the edited cells you recovered? (This is one reason that it is important to document clearly how efficient the editing was, how you confirmed it, and what you did to ensure that there were no off-target edits or suppressor mutations.)</p><p>The results in Figure 2G (noting the difference in 3D morphology of wild type vs. CoYki mutant aggregates) are critical to later experiments and interpretations but are not adequately quantified or documented. It is essential that the authors document how reproducible this difference is. Hopefully, these data already exist, but if not and experiments need to be repeated, I also recommend that the authors examine whether mixing wt and mutant cells changes the 3D morphology of aggregates.</p><p>I find the focus on single cells in Figure 3F confusing. It seems that the authors are extrapolating from these results to explain the 3D morphology of aggregates, even though the conditions in the two contexts are rather different. This somewhat weakens later interpretations of the data in the manuscript. (There is a published antibody against Capsaspora integrin and that might be a better way to examine the relative importance of cell-substrate adhesion vs. cell-cell adhesion.)</p><p>There appears to be a delay in the aggregation process of mutants based on watching Video S1. This could be better documented in Figure 2C and D.</p><p>It appears that the authors only used blebbistatin to disrupt blebbing and the cytoskeleton. Best practice calls for them to also test additional inhibitors â e.g. Latrunculin, cytochalasin D â to ensure that the results are specific to blebbistatin's influence on the cytoskeleton.</p><p>What is the evidence that Yki is part of the larger Hippo pathway in Capsaspora? This seems to be assumed, but I can see no evidence for it. The authors should perhaps focus more on Yki and avoid invoking the whole pathway.</p><p>The discussion perhaps goes too far in speculating about the potential role of Yki in different evolutionary scenarios. Particularly problematic is the emphasis on predation as a selective pressure that triggered multicellularity when there are many other equally reasonable and plausible hypotheses. The authors are encouraged either to drop the speculation or provide a more well-rounded reflection of the modern literature.

We currently have not performed exhaustive experiments regarding the efficiency of genome editing by homologous recombination (for example, by varying the length of homologous arms or the length of genomic sequence to be deleted). Such optimization may be worth attempting in future work.

There is a body of published work that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Yki has a function at the cell cortex that is independent of its function as a transcriptional regulator (Xu et al., 2018; PMID30032991). Without the data that show the localization of coYki, currently, we do not know whether it acts in the nucleus or at the cell cortex to regulate the cytoskeleton. More information about the subcellular localization of coYki will help understand its roles.</p></disp-quote><p>To provide support for asserting that coYki is transcriptional regulator, we have done the following:</p><p>â We have cited previous results showing that coYki and its binding partner coSd can, when expressed together in the <italic>Drosophila eye,</italic> induce transcription of Hippo pathway genes, indicating a role for coYki in transcriptional regulation</p><p>â We have examined the localization fluorescent fusions of coYki and a coYki (coYki 4SA) mutant predicted to be nonphosphorylatable by upstream Hippo pathway kinases. Enrichment of coYki at the cell cortex was not detected. However, the 4SA mutant showed increased localization in the nucleus relative to the WT coYki protein, arguing for a nuclear function of coYki.</p><p>These data are therefore consistent with the prevailing view of Yki/YAP/TAZ as a transcriptional regulator in animals. Nevertheless, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that coYki may also affect the cytoskeleton through a non-transcriptional manner as described by Xu et al., which we have now stated in the Results section of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Capsaspora and animals such as ourselves are equally separated by time from our last common ancestor. The same data could lead to a different conclusion that the ancestral function of the Hippo pathway was to regulate cell proliferation and that this was lost in the lineage that led to Capsaspora. As we learn more about the function of the Hippo pathway in diverse organisms, we will be in a better position to address what the ancestral function was. Therefore, the statements on the ancestral roles of the Hippo pathway need to be revised. In addition, the overall studies in this work focus on Yki so the discussion can be more specific to this particular gene, instead of referring to the entire Hippo pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the function of signaling pathways in modern protists and their ancestors may not necessarily be identical, and that studies of Hippo signaling in other organisms, especially unicellular holozoans, may clarify which functions may have been ancestral, as we make a point to state at the end of our discussion. However, given that in animals Hippo signaling regulates the cytoskeleton and proliferation, and we find that in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> coYki affects the cytoskeleton but apparently not proliferation, it seems reasonable to us to suggest a model where cytoskeletal regulation was an ancient function, and the pathway was later co-opted for regulation of proliferation. We have added a section in the discussion pointing out that we cannot, from our results, definitively conclude an ancestral Hippo pathway function.</p><p>We largely agree that our Discussion should be restrained to conclusions about YAP/TAZ/Yorkie function as opposed to the entire Hippo pathway, and we have made modifications throughout the Discussion to focus our conclusions on YAP/TAZ/Yorkie instead of the entire Hippo pathway. However, we do think that we are justified in asserting that coYki acts as a component of the Hippo pathway in <italic>Capsaspora</italic>, and we have taken two steps to provide better support for this idea:</p><p>â In the introduction, we have discussed the previous findings that coYki can induce the expression of Hippo pathway genes when expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and that coHpo (the <italic>Capsaspora</italic> Hippo kinase ortholog) can, when expressed in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> cause phosphorylation of (also heterologously expressed) coYki. These previous results support the existence of an active Hippo pathway in <italic>Capsaspora.</italic></p><p>â We have added data showing localization in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> cells of coYki and a mutant coYki lacking four conserved HXRXXS motifs, which serve as phosphorylation sites for the Hippo pathway kinase Wts/LATS in animals. Mirroring findings in animals, we show that this non-phosphorylatable mutant shows nuclear accumulation as compared to the WT coYki protein. This result indicates that, like in animals, the Hippo pathway in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> leads to phosphorylation and cytoplasmic sequestration of coYki, indicating an active Hippo pathway in this organism including coYki as a downstream effector.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 2F causes confusion. Instead, a more direct assay using antibodies against Capsaspora integrin could be better to examine the cell-ECM adhesion versus cell-cell adhesion.</p></disp-quote><p>As the confusion from this figure has to do with the relevance of the cell-substrate adhesion of single cells to aggregate morphology, we focused additionally on the adhesion of whole aggregates to a substrate. To address this point we have performed experiments assaying the effects of coYki on aggregate-substrate adhesion (as opposed to cell-substrate adhesion). In a new supplemental figure (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1), we show evidence that coYki negatively regulates the adhesion of whole aggregates to a substrate, supporting a role for coYki in regulation of aggregate morphology by affecting cell-substrate interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 2G is an important piece of data for the later part of the manuscript, the 3D morphology needs to be adequately repeated, quantified, and documented.</p></disp-quote><p>To more thoroughly document this phenotype, we have now quantified the difference in 3D morphology between WT and <italic>coYki -/-</italic> aggregates. To achieve this, we used optical sectioning of aggregates expressing mScarlet to obtain 3-dimensional data of aggregate structure, as shown previously in Figure 2G. We then used orthogonal views of aggregates generated from optical sections to measure the curvature of aggregate surfaces using the ImageJ plugin Kappa. Results of this experiment show consistent and significant differences in the curvature of WT and <italic>coYki -/-</italic> aggregates, as shown in an added figure supplement in Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, the studies were well done and the analyses are rigorous, here are some suggestions:</p><p>1. A domain comparison between coYki with orthologs from metazoans will be helpful, along with Figure 1A.</p></disp-quote><p>A thorough discussion of comparison of domains in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> and metazoan YAP/yorkie orthologs was done previously (Sebe-Pedros et al., Cell Reports 2012). We have added a reference to this analysis in our introduction and briefly discussed domain conservation in our Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Does expression of metazoan Yki rescue coYki-/- cells? Does overexpression of coYki lead to any phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on previous results (Sebe-Pedros et al., Cell Reports 2012), we would not expect metazoan YAP/Yorkie to bind to the Capsaspora TEAD protein, as the binding interfaces between Yorkie/YAP and TEAD seem to have diverged in animals and Capsaspora. Thus as we would likely not expect a rescue here, we have not performed this experiment.</p><p>Overexpression of coYki is an interesting experiment, but we currently to not have the technical ability to implement or detect strong overexpression of <italic>Capsaspora</italic> proteins over endogenous levels, so to rigorously perform this experiment is currently technically infeasible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The defective cell-ECM adhesion seems to involve Integrin-like molecules, which was further shown in the RNA-seq results. This connection is worth further investigation. For example, could upregulation of integrin rescue coYki-/- cells?</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above we do not currently have the ability to strongly overexpress <italic>Capsaspora</italic> proteins and thus experiments like this are not currently feasible, although further technical developments may make experiments of this sort possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Authors are encouraged to do a better job of documenting the results from the genome editing efforts. The current approaches are indirect â looking at transcript levels and using +/- PCR off amplicons rather than simply sequencing off of the genomic DNA (which would be far more convincing). Please say more (e.g. starting in line 109) about how you targeted both alleles and provide quantification documenting how efficient the editing was.</p></disp-quote><p>To more thoroughly confirm the disruption of the <italic>coYki</italic> gen in our <italic>coYki -/-</italic> mutant, we have now performed PCR across the deletion site in WT and mutant and have sequenced the products. For WT, we obtained a band of the expected size for the WT coYki allele, and confirmed the identity of this product by sequencing. For <italic>coYki Â­-/-</italic> cells, this âWTâ band was absent, supporting the loss of the WT allele. Two different bands were present in the mutant PCR of the expected size of insertion of either the Geneticin resistance or the nourseothricin resistance cassette at the <italic>coYki</italic> locus<italic>.</italic> Sequencing of these two bands confirmed that, indeed, the sequence of these two bands matched the predicted sequence of the disruption of the <italic>coYki</italic> gene with these antibiotic resistance markers. Together these results strongly support the conclusion that <italic>coYki -/-</italic> cells have biallelic disruption of the <italic>coYki</italic> gene. These data are now presented in Figure 1, figure supplement 3.</p><p>To clarify our editing strategy and efficiency, we have improved our Materials and methods section discussing genome editing. To avoid a lengthy discussion of our editing strategy in the Results section, we have directed readers within the text to the Materials and methods section, where we provide additional quantification on how efficient the disruption of coYki was. We currently have not performed exhaustive experiments regarding the efficiency of genome editing by homologous recombination (for example, by varying the length of homologous arms or the length of genomic sequence to be deleted). Such optimization may be worth attempting in future work. However, given the efficiencies that we have observed so far, and our ability to generate the <italic>coYki -/-</italic> mutant and additional unpublished mutants, we are confident that the efficiency of our current method is well suited for further applications in <italic>Capsaspora.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Yki regulates cell proliferation in animals, but you find no such connection in Capsaspora. Have you ruled out the possibility that there might be suppressor mutations in the edited cells you recovered? (This is one reason that it is important to document clearly how efficient the editing was, how you confirmed it, and what you did to ensure that there were no off-target edits or suppressor mutations.)</p></disp-quote><p>Given that WT and coYki mutant cells do not show a difference in proliferation, it seems unlikely that mutation of coYki may indeed effect proliferation, but that additional mutations in the <italic>coYki -/-</italic> cell line increase proliferation so that the proliferation rate exactly matches WT. Our best argument for the validity of our reported proliferation phenotype is that we see the same phenotype in two independently isolated <italic>coYki -/-</italic> clonal cell lines â the fact that we see this in independent clonal lines argues against the phenotype being due to second-site mutations accumulated in a particular clonal line. We had briefly mentioned this in our manuscript, but now we describe this more thoroughly in the Methods section within the âDisruption of the Capsaspora <italic>coYki</italic> gene by gene targetingâ subsection, and state that all reported phenotypes were observed in both <italic>coYki -/-</italic> cell lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results in Figure 2G (noting the difference in 3D morphology of wild type vs. CoYki mutant aggregates) are critical to later experiments and interpretations but are not adequately quantified or documented.

Best practice calls for them to also test additional inhibitors â e.g. Latrunculin, cytochalasin D â to ensure that the results are specific to blebbistatin's influence on the cytoskeleton.</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of using blebbistatin in this experiment was to specifically test how similar the protrusions made by coYki mutants are to the blebs observed in mammalian cells, both of which are actin-depleted structures. The actin-depolymerizing drugs suggested by the reviewer have been reported to both stimulate and/or inhibit blebbing (ex. Charras et al., 2006 JCB). Furthermore, actin-depolymerizing drugs cannot distinguish whether these structures are actin-depleted blebs or actin-rich pseudopodia. Therefore, the rationale for using actin-depolymerizing drugs in characterizing the projections made by coYki mutant cells is less straightforward. It is worth noting that we used very low concentration of blebbistatin in our experiment (1 mm) as compared to that routinely used in the literature (5-100 mm).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the evidence that Yki is part of the larger Hippo pathway in Capsaspora?
