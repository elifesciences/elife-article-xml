<italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries is regulated by niche signals from anterior (cap cells, ECs) and posterior (polar FCs) sources. Here we show that ECs, FSCs, and FCs develop from common pupal precursors, with different fates acquired by progressive separation of cells along the AP axis and a graded decline in anterior cell proliferation. ECs, FSCs, and most FCs derive from intermingled cell (IC) precursors interspersed with germline cells. Precursors also accumulate posterior to ICs before engulfing a naked germline cyst projected out of the germarium to form the first egg chamber and posterior polar FC signaling center. Thus, stem and niche cells develop in appropriate numbers and spatial organization through regulated proliferative expansion together with progressive establishment of spatial signaling cues that guide adult cell behavior, rather than through rigid early specification events.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stem cell development</kwd><kwd>lineage tracing</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>live imaging</kwd><kwd>pupal development</kwd><kwd>oogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM079351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kalderon</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Somatic stem and niche cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary develop from common precursors through regulated proliferative expansion, followed by acquisition of position-specific behaviors, rather than through rigid early specification events.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adult stem cells generally act as a community, coordinating the activities of multiple individual cells to replenish tissues throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clevers and Watt, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Post and Clevers, 2019</xref>). Their behavior is invariably regulated by external signals from other cell types, known as niche cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biteau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Losick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Voog and Jones, 2010</xref>). It is therefore essential to establish adult stem cells in suitable numbers and niche environments during development to ensure appropriately regulated community activity in adults. Understanding the underlying developmental processes would facilitate identification of genetic developmental defects that disrupt adult tissue repair or confer cancer susceptibility, and creation of expandable organoids maintained by stem cells for therapeutic use, drug studies, or mechanistic investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akbari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Merenda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Petersen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pourquie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yousef Yengej et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drost and Clevers, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The development of terminally differentiated adult cell types commonly results from a series of successive, definitive, and largely irreversible decisions that are stabilized by potentially long-lasting shifts in gene expression and chromatin modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam and Harwell, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davidson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rothman and Jarriault, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sagner and Briscoe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Salinas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zechner et al., 2020</xref>). However, the development of adult stem cells has not been studied extensively and presents a number of special considerations. First, stem cells typically continue to proliferate in adulthood and often exhibit malleable relationships with their products, with the potential for marked changes in inter-conversion rates in either direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donati and Watt, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tetteh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wabik and Jones, 2015</xref>). Does the general paradigm of definitive cell-type specification at a fixed time in development still apply, despite this marked flexibility of the final product? Second, do adult tissues and the stem cells that maintain the tissue derive from separate or common precursors? Third, is there coordination between the development of adult stem cells and their niche cells, potentially serving to arrange appropriate proportions and juxtaposition of the two cell types?</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> ovarian follicle stem cells (FSCs) present a particularly interesting and experimentally favorable paradigm to investigate because the organization, behavior, and regulation of these adult stem cells have been studied thoroughly, revealing many similarities to the important mammalian paradigm of gut stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gehart and Clevers, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hayashi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reilein et al., 2017</xref>). FSCs directly produce two different types of cell in adult ovaries, follicle cells (FCs) and escort cells (ECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reilein et al., 2017</xref>). Both of these cell types also act as niche cells, producing key JAK-STAT and Wnt signals, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reilein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Melamed and Kalderon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Song and Xie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vied et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waghmare and Page-McCaw, 2018</xref>). Similarly, Paneth cells in the mammalian small intestine are both stem cell products and niche cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beumer and Clevers, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hsu and Fuchs, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fuchs and Blau, 2020</xref>). FSCs also provide a window into sustaining a tissue supported by two different types of stem cell. The mechanisms of coordination among FSCs, germline stem cells (GSCs), and their products in the adult are not well understood but must rely on an organization that is established during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hayashi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waghmare and Page-McCaw, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kahney et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilboa, 2015</xref>).</p><p>GSCs and FSCs are housed in the germarium, which is the most anterior region of each of the 30–40 ovarioles comprising the adult ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hayashi et al., 2020</xref>). Somatic terminal filament (TF) and cap cells at the anterior of the germarium are stable sources of niche signals for GSCs and FSCs, including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), Hedgehog, and Wnt proteins, with GSCs directly contacting cap cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hayashi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kahney et al., 2019</xref>). Cystoblast daughters of GSCs divide four times with incomplete cytokinesis to yield a progression of 2-, 4-, 8-, and finally, 16-cell germline cysts. Their maturation is accompanied by posterior movement and depends on interactions with neighboring quiescent, somatic ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirilly et al., 2011</xref>). ECs also act as niche cells for adjacent or nearby GSCs and FSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hayashi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waghmare and Page-McCaw, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sahai-Hernandez and Nystul, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang and Page-McCaw, 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Development of ovarioles during early pupal stages.</title><p>(<bold>A–J</bold>) A time course of pupal ovary development.

The most posterior FSCs directly become FCs, while anterior FSCs directly become ECs, but FSCs also exchange AP locations, allowing a single FSC lineage to include both ECs and FCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reilein et al., 2017</xref>). Individual FSCs are frequently lost and frequently amplify, with no evident temporal or functional link between division and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reilein et al., 2018b</xref>), so that the representation and output (of ECs and FCs) of any one FSC lineage is highly variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reilein et al., 2017</xref>). All of these behaviors are largely regulated by extracellular signals that are graded along the AP axis, with especially prominent roles for JAK-STAT ligand derived from polar cells and Wnt ligands derived from both cap cells and ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reilein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Melamed and Kalderon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Song and Xie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vied and Kalderon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). The number of FSCs, together with the spatially regulated signals that guide division rate, is matched to steady-state production of 5–6 FCs every 12 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reilein et al., 2018b</xref>), while the number and location of ECs is important not only to deliver some niche signals directly but may also be important to keep FSCs at a suitable distance from the cap cell source of Wnt and Hh signals.</p><p>Previous studies have outlined how germline and somatic ovary precursors are first selected during embryogenesis, then migrate and coalesce to form a nascent gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jemc, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murray et al., 2010</xref>), followed by specification of anterior TF cells and separation into individual developing ovarioles during larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilboa, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Godt and Laski, 1995</xref>).

Here we use morphological examination of developing pupal ovaries through fixed and live images, together with cell lineage studies, to examine how adult FSCs, ECs, and FCs are produced and organized from precursors present at the end of larval stages.</p><p>Marked lineages were clustered along the AP axis, with larger clones towards the posterior, suggesting limited AP dispersion and an AP gradient of proliferation. FSC lineages almost always included marked FCs and mostly included ECs, especially if initiated early, indicating that specific stem cell precursors are not determined early; instead, FSCs likely simply acquire their characteristics according to AP location at the end of pupal development. Combined lineage and morphological studies showed that ECs and FSCs, as well as some FCs, derive from intermingled cell (IC) precursors that are interspersed with germline cells throughout pupal development, while an expanding population of cells posterior to ICs become the FCs of the first-formed egg chamber. Live imaging showed that the first pupal egg chamber is formed by migration of a germline cyst out of the developing germarium into an accumulation of future FCs, contrasting with the emergence of an FC-encased germline from the germarium that characterizes adult egg chamber budding. Thus, in this paradigm, stem cells are not specified at a fixed time in development. They arise from precursors that also build the niche and the adult tissue they support. The use of delayed specification and shared precursors, together with an evolving spatial gradient of proliferation, may be an effective general developmental strategy to juxtapose and produce appropriate numbers of stem and niche cells in the adult tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Outline of ovary development</title><p>We dissected and imaged developing ovaries during pupation to provide a systematic descriptive overview, informed by prior studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

We assign ‘0 hr after puparium formation (APF)’ as the time when larvae cease moving (pupariation).

In the first set of experiments (‘time course’), we dissected ovarioles from adults 2d after eclosion (‘+2d’), having induced MARCM clones daily (in separate experiments) between 6d and 2d before eclosion (‘–6d’ to ‘–2d’), corresponding to the given times after puparium formation (APF). The second approach used multicolor labeling to reduce the frequency of distinctly marked lineages, so that ovarioles rarely contain more than one lineage of the chosen color. The third approach examined ovarioles from newly eclosed adults to capture all labeled follicle cells (FCs) produced during pupation. Labeled cells were scored as r1 (magenta) or r2a (yellow) ECs, FSCs (blue), or FCs (red); color code depicted at the bottom of (<bold>A</bold>) and the top of (<bold>E–L</bold>).

In practice, it is difficult to label only one cell in a developing ovariole when there are many precursors present. We used a very mild heat-shock protocol to try to accomplish this objective. We principally used MARCM clonal analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee and Luo, 2001</xref>) because positive cell marking with GFP greatly facilitates scoring all cells in a lineage. However, maturation of a strong GFP MARCM signal in adult and developing ovarioles requires almost 4d.

Ovarioles containing only marked ECs (‘EC only’) were seen at each time of clone induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, E, F, I, J</xref>) while a significant frequency of ovarioles with marked FSCs but no marked ECs (‘FSC only’) was evident only when induced at 48 hr or 72 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and L</xref>). These observations immediately suggested that most adult FSCs derive from a dividing precursor that gives rise to both ECs and FSCs. During the second half of pupation, an increasing proportion of the products of early EC/FSC precursors produce FSCs but no ECs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Relative location of precursors along AP axis instructs fate</title><p>The marked cells in an adult germarium were generally clustered in the AP dimension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–L</xref>). To evaluate clustering numerically, we counted marked region 1 (r1) and region 2a (r2a) ECs separately. Region 1 contains germline cysts with fewer than 16 cells and comprises the most anterior two-thirds of EC territory along the AP axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and E–L</xref>). Of all early-induced clones (–6d to –4d) with two or more marked cells and including at least one r1 EC, 35% contained only r1 ECs, 19% included also only r2a ECs, while only 8% also included only FSCs (the remainder included both r2a ECs and FSCs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, genetic relatives of a marked region 1 EC are often only in region 1; they are also more commonly found in region 2a than in the more distant FSC region, even though the total frequency of clones with marked region 2a ECs (54%) and FSCs (57%) were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Conversely, of all clones with two or more marked cells including at least one FSC, 25% contained no ECs, 18% included also only r2a ECs, while only 11% also included only r1 ECs, even though the total frequency of clones with r1 ECs (68%) was higher than for r2a ECs (54%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>These observations suggest that (i) precursors occupy significantly different AP positions early in pupal development, (ii) their progeny undergo stochastic movement in either direction but still remain relatively close in the AP dimension, and (iii) cell identity (r1 EC, r2a EC or FSC) is set by their AP location at eclosion. By adulthood, this identity includes starkly different behaviors of quiescence (ECs) or proliferation (FSCs). Had precursors been restricted early in pupation to produce only FSCs, only ECs, or only one type of EC (r1 or r2a), marked lineages would be restricted to a single-cell type. In fact, we observed many lineages that spanned boundaries between r1 and r2a ECs, and between ECs and FSCs, especially for clones induced from 0 to 48 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D, F–H, J and K</xref>).</p><p>The AP clustering of progeny and the derivation of both FSCs and ECs from a common precursor were investigated further by using a multicolor lineage approach, which has the key virtue of reducing the frequency of cell marking with a specific color.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Low-frequency clones validate a common precursor for ECs and FSCs</title><p>The overall clone frequency (percentage of ovarioles with any marked cells in the germarium or early egg chambers) in the above experiments was 60%. It would therefore be expected that about 2/3 of marked ovarioles derive from marking a single precursor if all recombination events were independent and equally likely (see Materials and methods). We then used a multicolor marking strategy, in which GFP-positive clones lacking both lacZ and RFP result from two recombination events and should therefore be especially rare among the six possible color combinations generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reilein et al., 2017</xref>). GFP-only clones, induced at 0 hr APF and scored in newly eclosed (0d) adults, were found at an overall frequency of 26/115 ovarioles, so that an estimated 86% of labeled ovarioles (see Materials and methods) might be expected to have lineages derived from a single GFP-only cell.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Multicolor labeling of precursors shows clustering of progeny along the AP axis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Second chromosome genotype of multicolor flies used for multicolor lineage tracing of precursors, showing <italic>tub-lacZ</italic> (lacZ), <italic>ubi-GFP</italic> (GFP), and <italic>His2Av-RFP</italic> (RFP) transgenes and <italic>FRT 40A</italic> and <italic>FRT 42B</italic> recombination targets either side of the centromere (white oval).

For each time of clone induction, we summed the total number of marked cells of each type (FSCs, r1 and r2a ECs) over all clones (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The ratio of marked ECs (r1 or r2a) to FSCs for any one time of clone induction reports the relative number of those cell types produced from dividing precursors. The absolute number of ECs per germarium made from dividing precursors was then calculated by using a value of 16 FSCs per germarium and assuming that FSC precursors, like FSCs themselves, do not cease dividing and can therefore all be labeled by MARCM throughout development (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This calculation is based on scoring all labeled cells over all clones and is therefore equally valid whether the scored cells in an ovariole derive from a single marked cell or from more than one marked cell.</p><p>For –6d and –5d samples, the calculated number of ECs made from dividing precursors was very similar at about 33 (19 r1 and 14 r2a) per germarium (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This approximates the total number of adult ECs, which has been reported to be about 40 on average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang and Page-McCaw, 2018</xref>), and which we counted as 32–51 over 25 germaria from young adults, suggesting that most cells that will become adult ECs are still dividing at the larval/pupal transition. The calculated number of ECs made from dividing precursors dropped slightly in –4d samples (from 33 to 28) and more markedly in –3d (to 15) and –2d samples (to 13) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). We surmise that precursors of over half of the future adult EC population have ceased dividing by 2–3 days prior to eclosion. Moreover, the average number of dividing precursors per germarium for r1 ECs (4.6) was significantly lower than for r2a ECs (8.6) by –2d (72 hr APF), even though adults contain more r1 than r2a ECs (19 vs. 14, from –6d and –5d data). Thus, cessation of precursor division appears to spread from the anterior towards the posterior as pupal development proceeds.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Many FCs produced during pupation derive from precursors that also yield FSCs and ECs</title><p>In a third cell lineage approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we induced MARCM clones early enough (0 hr APF and 36 hr APF) that we were able to examine GFP-labeled cells in newly eclosed adults, allowing us to score all FCs produced during pupation, before the earliest FCs are lost in 2d-old adults. FCs typically surround the two most mature germarial cysts and four budded egg chambers in a newly eclosed adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>We first examined lineages induced at 0 hr APF. Most ovarioles with marked FSCs also had marked ECs (24/27) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and D</xref>), as observed for MARCM analysis in 2d-old adults and multicolor clone analysis, confirming a common precursor of ECs and FSCs. Almost all clones with marked FSCs also had marked FCs (25/27) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating a common precursor for adult FSCs and FCs. A significant proportion of all marked ovarioles (23/98 = 23%) had marked ECs, FSCs, and FCs, indicating that some individual pupal precursors give rise to all three cell types in newly eclosed adults. Some ovarioles (‘FC-only’) contained marked FCs but no marked FSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Similar results were observed for multicolor lineage tracing examined in newly eclosed adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).

single precursor types from 0 hr after puparium formation (APF) until 60 hr APF deduced from lineage studies and pupal ovary imaging. The indicated frequency of clone types is drawn from the inference of single-cell lineages for MARCM clones induced at 0 hr APF (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Most 0 hr APF precursors generate only adult escort cells (ECs), with more anterior (left) precursors producing only r1 ECs (top row) and more posterior precursors also producing r2a ECs and more cells in total (second row). Filled green cells have ceased division. Most 0 hr APF follicle stem cell (FSC)-producing precursors also produce ECs (purple outlines). Some of these, more anterior, precursors (third row) do not produce follicle cells (FCs) but most (fourth row) also produce cells (red outline) that will become FCs (but not in the first-formed egg chamber). Precursors that produce adult FSCs but not ECs (blue outline) also produce FCs (fifth row). The most posterior precursors produce only FCs. A subset of progeny accumulate posterior to the germarium from 24 hr APF onward in the primary (1<sup>o</sup>) EGC (depicted as a posterior gray crown) and further posterior in the basal stalk (BS). Examples of origination from extra-germarial crown (EGC) cells (yellow fill, row 6) and BS cells (purple fill, row 7) at 24 hr APF are shown, but the most posterior intermingled cells (ICs) (just anterior to EGC cells) can also yield lineages containing only FCs. Most cells in the EGC will become FCs of the first budded egg chamber (sixth row; the cell denoted by the blue asterisk is modeled after the cyan cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Others, like the cell on the posterior cyst at 48 hr APF, denoted by the red asterisk (modeled on the top red cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), move into the secondary EGC at 60 hr and later become FCs on the second budded egg chamber. Most precursors present in the BS at 48 hr APF (row 7) move onto the first budded cyst (the cell denoted by the blue asterisk is modeled after the white cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Some of the most posterior BS precursor progeny remain in the BS throughout pupation (not shown). More posterior precursors are shown producing larger numbers of progeny because anterior cells divide more slowly and arrest division prior to eclosion.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69749-fig5-v3.tif"/></fig><p>The locations of marked FCs were scored as ‘immediate’ (region 2b), ‘germarial’ (region 3), or in egg chambers (‘ECh’) 1–4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Notably, while some clones contained only ECs or only FCs, the AP spread of derivatives generally exceeded the width of the FSC domain, so that ovarioles with marked FSCs always contained ECs or FCs (or both). In other words, there were no FSC-specific precursors at the larval/pupal transition and individual lineages regularly spanned the borders of adult cell identities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Prevalence of different precursors during pupation</title><p>The number of precursors at 0 hr APF that give rise to different adult cell types can be deduced from the observed proportion of lineage categories (EC, EC/FSC ± FC, FSC ± FC, FC) together with the average number of marked FSCs and ECs in each lineage category. However, both measured parameters will be inaccurate if some ovarioles include two or more marked lineages. Analysis of lineages in 0d adults allowed a better estimate of how often this occurred.</p><p>In this MARCM experiment, 53% of 207 ovarioles contained no marked cells, suggesting that 72% of marked ovarioles have lineages derived from a single cell if all recombination events are independent (see Materials and methods). However, 16% of marked ovarioles contained marked FCs and marked ECs but no marked FSCs, strongly suggesting that these discontinuous patterns represent two lineages and, hence, that the total proportion of ovarioles with more than one marked lineage is considerably higher than 28%. Thus, there appears to be some clustering of recombination events rather than an even distribution among all ovarioles. The observed frequency of ovarioles with marked ECs plus FCs was roughly compatible with a simplified model where 30% of labeled ovarioles derive from a single marked cell and 70% derive from exactly two marked cells. We then used that model to infer single-cell lineage frequencies and constituent cell numbers that would give rise to the scored raw data (see Materials and methods). From those numbers, we deduced the number of dividing precursors at pupariation to be about 24 in total, with 15.1 precursors giving rise only to ECs, 3.1 precursors producing ECs and FSCs, 1.2 precursors producing FSCs but no ECs, and 4.6 precursors producing only FCs on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Similar modeling and calculations were performed for multicolor GFP-only clones (see Materials and methods). We deduced that a single precursor cell gives rise to both ECs and FSCs in 25% of all marked lineages and that the frequency of such precursors greatly exceeds precursors that produce FSCs but no ECs (10%). The deduced numbers of precursors of each type (9.0 EC, 4.2 EC/FSC, 1.6 FSC, 2.4 FC, and 17 total precursors) are reasonably similar to those calculated for the similarly timed MARCM experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Differences may result from variations in the exact developmental stage of animals of different genotypes at the time of clone induction.</p><p>We also performed a MARCM analysis of clones induced 3.5d prior to eclosion (36 hr APF) and examined in 0d adults to learn more about the timing of FC specification (see below). In this experiment, the proportion of ovarioles that were labeled (94%) and the frequency of EC/FC clones were particularly high, probably because there are many more dividing precursors than at 0 hr APF, so the deduction of single-cell lineage content is likely less reliable. Nevertheless, we estimated (see Materials and methods) that the proportions of single-cell lineage types were EC-only (51%), EC/FSC(±FC) (7%), FSC(±FC) (4%), FC-only (38%), and that the total number of dividing precursors was about 35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Based on earlier analysis of MARCM lineages induced at –4d and –3d and examined at +2d, there should also be between 5 and 18 non-dividing EC precursors at –3.5d (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Thus, we estimate that at 36 hr APF there are 13.3 FC-only precursors within a total precursor population of about 40–53 (35 dividing plus 5–18 non-dividing cells) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). The most striking difference between lineages induced at 36 hr versus 0 hr APF is a large increase in lineages producing only FCs. Later, it will be shown that this corresponds to an expansion of FC precursors that accumulate posterior to germline cells during this period.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Timing of FC recruitment to first egg chamber</title><p>To determine when FCs are first allocated to the most mature germline cyst, we looked at the distribution of marked cells in ‘FC-only’ clones (ovarioles with marked FCs but no marked FSCs). The majority of newly eclosed adults have four egg chambers, and we excluded all exceptions from the analysis described below. For FC-only clones induced at 36 hr APF, more than half (34 out of 49) included labeled FCs in the fourth (most mature) egg chamber. Two-thirds of those (21 out of 34) had no other labeled FCs, showing that many precursors are restricted by 36 hr APF to contribute only to the first-formed egg chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). The 13 exceptions all had marked FCs in egg chamber 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, I, J</xref>). This frequency is too high for all to be explained by the presence of two lineages. We also found that the proportion of the egg chamber 4 epithelium occupied by marked FCs was significantly lower when marked FCs were also in egg chamber 3 (19.6%) than when confined to only the terminal egg chamber (29.7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>). These results suggest that, in most cases, a precursor labeled at 36 hr APF divided before all egg chamber 4 FCs were allocated. In some cases, one daughter became an FC founder for egg chamber 4 and the other daughter contributed to egg chamber 3. In other cases, both daughters contributed to egg chamber 4, producing a higher average FC contribution for that labeling pattern. We do not know the cell cycle time for these FC-only precursors subsequent to 36 hr APF, but we expect (from amplification data for EC/FSC lineages in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) that it is shorter than 24 hr and may be as short as 11 hr, the cycling time for early FCs in adult ovarioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Margolis and Spradling, 1995</xref>), so we estimate that FCs are allocated to egg chamber 4 at about 47–60 hr APF. This estimate fits with direct morphological observations described later.</p><p>By 48 hr APF, all germaria have a single cyst in the most posterior region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) but neighboring somatic cells (ICs) only express low levels of Fas3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In adult germaria, even the most recently recruited FCs surrounding the penultimate germarial cyst express high levels of Fas3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); a subset of those cells must then become specialized polar and stalk cells before the egg chamber can bud about 24 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The most posterior ICs that do not express Fas3 strongly before 48 hr APF therefore appear to be far behind schedule, given that the first egg chamber will bud at about 56 hr APF on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). These observations suggest that ICs may not be the cells that become the FCs of the first budded egg chamber, as might have been assumed by analogy to budding of adult egg chambers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Lineage evidence for separate precursors of FCs in the first-formed egg chamber</title><p>The distribution of marked FCs in lineages initiated at 36 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) suggests that precursors of the first-formed egg chamber contribute only to the two terminal egg chambers (seen in 32/34 cases). The two exceptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) likely contain more than one lineage. Five ovarioles had marked FCs only anterior to the two terminal egg chambers, while seven included marked FCs in egg chamber 3 and more anterior locations. It seems unlikely that the latter all include two lineages; all seven have marked FCs also in egg chamber 2, compatible with a common origin. Thus, by 36 hr APF the FC-only precursors appear to be segregated into two populations. The majority contribute FCs to the first-formed egg chamber and sometimes also to egg chamber 3, while the remainder contribute FCs to more anterior egg chambers, sometimes including egg chamber 3.</p><p>Ovarioles that included marked FSCs only rarely had marked FCs in the terminal egg chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The five exceptions (out of 21) may derive from ovarioles that harbor an FC-only lineage (53% frequency overall) in addition to an FSC-containing lineage (26% overall). Thus, at 36 hr APF it appears that more than two-thirds of FC-only precursors will contribute to the first-formed egg chamber (with some also contributing to egg chamber 3), while more anterior egg chambers are later populated by derivatives of a combination of FC-only, FSC/FC, and EC/FSC/FC precursors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>An extra-germarial crown (EGC) forms prior to egg chamber budding</title><p>Posterior to the interspersed germline cells and somatic ICs of the pupal germarium are somatic cells with strong Fas3 staining from 24 hr APF onward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). We noticed that the most anterior of these Fas3-positive cells express TJ, which is also expressed in ICs and required for their interspersion with germline cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2003</xref>). These TJ/Fas3-positive cells form a small multilayered cone or crown around the posterior of the developing germarium that increases in size and cellular content from 12 to 36 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). We refer to those TJ/Fas3-positive cells beyond the most posterior germline cyst as the EGC, and to the more posterior Fas3-positive cells with no TJ expression as basal stalk cells.

We were able to follow isolated live ovaries for up to 15 hr, during which time many cell movements and cell divisions were observed, suggestive of continued normal behavior. We first used samples where all cells were labeled by expression of a <italic>ubi-GFP</italic> transgene. Later, we used animals with multicolor clones induced 2–3d earlier, so that some cells had lost GFP or RFP expression or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Variability in the levels of GFP and RFP simplified the task of following individual cells over time. We were able to track the movements of multiple cells in a series of videos initiated at a variety of times after pupariation.</p><p>From about 30 hr APF onward, tracked ICs moved short distances relative to other cells in a variety of directions.

The white-outlined cell, which initially lay posterior to the region with TJ expression (from comparison to fixed images), entered EGC territory within 4 hr and became associated with the germline cyst by 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig9video3">Figure 9—video 3</xref>). Thus, over the nearly 15 hr of live imaging the newly budded cyst acquired a set of closely associated cells of epithelial appearance that derived from the EGC and basal stalk cells.</p><p>Live imaging of a different ovariole from 55 hr APF onward showed continued posterior movement of the budding cyst until only a small number of basal stalk cells remained at its posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">Figure 9—figure supplement 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig9video4">Figure 9—video 4</xref>). During this almost 15 hr viewing period, the number of cells posterior to the cyst declined from 32 to 13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">Figure 9—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Fixed images of later stages, after two egg chambers have budded (84 hr APF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">Figure 9—figure supplement 4D</xref>), revealed an average of nine cells in the stalk posterior to the terminal egg chamber, resembling the structure seen in newly eclosed adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Tracked cells on the first budded egg chamber moved short distances anterior as the stalk elongated between the first and second egg chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s5">Figure 9—figure supplement 5C</xref>). ICs anterior to the second budding cyst moved posterior as the germarium elongated and appeared poised to associate with later cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s5">Figure 9—figure supplement 5A</xref>). We infer that the second budded egg chamber has FCs derived from the secondary EGC, which is itself derived from primary EGC cells and perhaps also some posterior ICs at 48 hr APF. FCs on later egg chambers likely derive solely from cells that were ICs at 48 hr APF.</p></sec><sec id="s2-14"><title>Lineage analysis of precursor contributions to the first-formed FCs and the adult basal stalk</title><p>Live imaging indicated that many cells in the basal stalk at 48 hr APF later become FCs on the first budded egg chamber, while a small number do not migrate over the cyst and form a short basal stalk structure of 5–10 single-file cells posterior to egg chamber 4 in newly eclosed adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with this scenario, when we examined lineages marked at 36 hr APF, we found 13 ovarioles with label in the basal stalk and in FCs of egg chamber 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>), suggesting a common origin from basal stalk cells at 36 hr APF. There were 18 ovarioles where FCs in egg chamber 4 were marked but the adult basal stalk was not, consistent with an origin from EGC or anterior basal stalk cells at 36 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and H–J</xref>). The proportion of ovarioles containing marked FCs in egg chamber 4 that also contained marked FCs in egg chamber 3 was higher when marked basal stalk cells were absent (7/18) than when they were present (2/13), consistent with a more anterior origin of lineages that did not include the adult basal stalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>In summary, live imaging, together with lineage analysis initiated at 36 hr APF, revealed a separate group of FC-only precursors, now identified as basal stalk and EGC cells posterior to the germarium, that become FCs of the first-formed egg chamber and contribute also to the second-formed egg chamber. Lineage analysis revealed additional FC-only precursors that contribute to more anterior FCs. These FCs must be formed within the germarium (from ICs) because the germarium has an adult morphology, with no EGC structure, before the third egg chamber buds. We did not find any evidence for cells posterior to ICs entering the germarium at any stage during live imaging, consistent with all ICs present in the germarium after two cycles of budding originating from ICs present at 36 hr APF. Thus, the FC-only precursors that produce FCs anterior to egg chamber 3, and even more certainly, all precursors of FSCs, which are anterior to FC-only precursors, must reside within the germarium, as ICs, throughout pupal development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-15"><title>Pattern of precursor divisions along the AP axis</title><p>Progressive cessation of division from anterior to posterior over the EC-producing domain was deduced from the total number of r1 and r2a cells produced relative to FSCs after labeling dividing precursors with MARCM at different times, as described previously (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This inference was supported by examination of clone types and the number of cells they contained. The frequency of clones producing only ECs fell from 58% and 57% (0 hr and 24 hr APF) to 30% (48 hr APF) and then 14% (72 hr APF) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, the yield of r1 ECs relative to r2a ECs declined from 2.2 (0 hr APF) and 2.6 (24 hr APF) to 0.9 (48 hr APF) and 0.8 (72 hr APF). The yield of marked cells per EC/FSC precursor was also consistently higher than for more anterior EC-only precursors at all times of clone induction, even though the many FCs produced by EC/FSC precursors were not included (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The source of lineages reported to include FSCs in the earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Slaidina et al., 2020</xref>) may also have been pre-pupal ICs (rather than the intended cells posterior to ICs that are selectively labeled by <italic>bond</italic> RNA just before pupariation) and the ovarioles with both marked ECs and FSCs may have derived from common precursors, consistent with all of our studies, rather than a combination of EC-specific and FSC/FC-specific precursors, as suggested by the authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Slaidina et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>When animals with <italic>bond-GAL4</italic> and <italic>G-trace</italic> were maintained at 29C during the last 3d or 4d of pupation, we observed an additional type of lineage, either in isolation or together with the types of marked cells described above (55/88 ovarioles; 0/108 when at 18C throughout) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11G</xref>). The second lineage pattern consisted of a few isolated FCs or small FC clusters in the most mature egg chamber, suggesting several independent, recently initiated lineages. Some of the GFP-labeled FCs also expressed <italic>UAS-RFP</italic>, indicating current or recent <italic>bond-GAL4</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11G</xref>). These patterns were not reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Slaidina et al., 2020</xref>), presumably because the first-formed egg chambers were no longer present in the 2d-old adults examined. The same type of clone was observed if animals were kept at 29C until about 2d after pupariation (30/44 ovarioles, with only six ovarioles also including RFP-expressing FCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11F</xref>).

Our investigations of changing morphology, cell movements, and cell lineage in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary reveal a gradual and flexible adoption of these cell types according to AP location throughout pupal development, rather than early definitive cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This contrasts with the development of many other types of differentiated adult cells.</p><p>Specifically, adult EC niche cells and FSCs develop from a common group of dividing precursors (ICs) that are interspersed with developing germline cysts. ICs express TJ and are located posterior to cap cells, which serve as adult niche cells for both GSCs and FSCs, and are already specified by the start of pupation. The most anterior ICs become regional subsets of ECs (r1 and r2a), which likely have distinctive roles in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tu et al., 2021</xref>). These precursors markedly attenuate division, starting from the most anterior locations, during the second half of pupation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, the characteristic quiescence of adult ECs is acquired gradually and in a spatially graded manner throughout most of pupation. ICs further from the anterior produce both ECs (mainly r2a) and FSCs (as well as FCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). More posterior ICs produce FSCs and FCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), while the most posterior ICs produce only FCs. There is a progressive restriction of fates over time. That likely reflects simply the reduced width of AP territory occupied by derivatives of a single precursor cell as development proceeds, rather than any discrete and irreversible cell specification event. This pattern of germarium development ensures the juxtaposition of ECs and FSCs and may contribute to producing those cell types in appropriate proportions, with EC numbers limited by a progressive decline in proliferation that spreads from the anterior.</p><p>Germarium development is likely driven initially by the early establishment of TF and cap cells as a source of anterior organizing signals. The behavior of adult FSCs, including conversion to FCs, additionally relies on a signaling source posterior to the germarium, namely the anterior polar cells of the most recently budded egg chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Melamed and Kalderon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vied et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Torres et al., 2003</xref>). Polar cells were observed on the first budded egg chamber by 60 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">Figure 9—figure supplement 4E and E'</xref>). However, at the start of pupation there are no budded egg chambers, so formation of the first FCs and the first egg chamber must proceed by a different route. We found that those first FCs derive from precursors that have accumulated posterior to ICs by 36 hr APF and differ from ICs by expressing Fas3, by lack of association with germline cells and by being restricted to produce only FCs, and not ECs or FSCs. Thus, precursors of the first FCs, some of which will become polar cells that act as posterior niche cells, have segregated from FSC precursors by 36 hr APF. After both anterior and posterior organizing centers for adult FSCs have been established and two egg chambers have budded, the architecture and Fas3 expression patterns of the germarium resemble those of adults, suggesting that the developmental process for FSCs and niche cells is complete.</p><p>Over the course of pupal development, the entire somatic cellular complement of the adult tissue that is subsequently maintained by stem cell activity derives from an initially small set of precursors that also produce adult FSCs, with outcomes dictated simply by progressive AP cell positioning. Preliminary understanding of other adult stem cells suggests that derivation of tissues and their stem cells from a common source may be frequent but not universal. There is evidence that both adult mouse gut stem cells and adult neural stem cells of the dentate gyrus derive from a precursor pool that also gives rise to the adult epithelial tissue maintained by the stem cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guiu et al., 2019</xref>). By contrast, subventricular zone neural stem cells appear to be specified during embryogenesis and remain quiescent, while the adult tissue it can replenish is built from other precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuentealba et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Furutachi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Defining and locating EC, FSC, and FC precursors through pupal development</title><p>This study examined <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary development comprehensively during pupal stages through lineage analyses initiated at different times, and by systematic analysis of fixed specimens and live imaging.

Here it was met by using very mild heat-shocks to initiate clones through <italic>hs-flp</italic> induction and a multicolor labeling technique that reduces the frequency of a specific color combination substantially relative to single-color clones. We also estimated the frequency of single-cell lineages from both the overall frequency of ovariole labeling and the frequency of clone patterns (exceptional, discontinuous clones), allowing us to derive mathematical estimations of strictly single-cell lineage frequencies and yields. The results led to robust conclusions that many precursors at the start of pupation yield only ECs, a smaller proportion yield both ECs and FSCs (as well as FCs), and very few produce FSCs with no ECs. Common precursors for ECs and FSCs persist for at least the first 72 hr of pupation (later times were not tested), although they are exceeded in number at 72 hr APF by precursors that produce FSCs but not ECs. Almost all FSC lineages also included marked FCs in newly eclosed adults.</p><p>Deducing the locations of precursors required integrating lineage and morphological studies. Each lineage was restricted in its AP extent, but the whole collection of lineages included overlapping domains that spanned the whole length of the ovariole of a newly eclosed adult, from the most anterior r1 EC to FCs and the basal stalk of the terminal egg chamber, suggesting that precursors are arranged in a continuum along the AP axis throughout pupal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We directly observed EdU labeling in the most anterior ICs in early pupae, so we can deduce that the most anterior of the inferred continuum of dividing precursors subject to lineage labeling lie immediately adjacent to cap cells and give rise to adult r1 ECs. The posterior extent of ovariole precursors was deduced by direct observation of the production of the first FCs, as summarized below.

We named one group as extra-germarial crown (EGC) cells in recognition of their location, appearance and TJ expression. Cells of the second, more posterior group do not express TJ and are largely intercalated into a stalk of 1–2 cell’s width at 48 hr APF prior to egg chamber budding. During budding, the most mature germline cyst leaves the germarium devoid of accompanying ICs, which do not yet express Fas3. The cyst then enters EGC territory and moves a considerable distance from the germarium as it is enveloped by both EGC and basal stalk cells.</p><p>Towards the end of the budding process, cells posterior to the new egg chamber are stacked in single file, forming a basal stalk, which is stably retained into adulthood. We observed several lineages that included labeled cells in the adult basal stalk and in an FC patch on the terminal egg chamber, reflecting contributions of pupal basal stalk cells. Some EGC derivatives also remain on the first budded egg chamber, while others migrate anteriorly beyond the budded cyst to form a secondary EGC between the germarium and the budded egg chamber. Secondary EGCs provide cells to partially coat the second cyst to emerge from the germarium. The second cyst appears from live imaging to move out of the germarium together with some associated ICs. Lineage studies also suggest that FCs of the second budded egg chamber derive from both EGC cells (producing FCs in egg chambers 4 and 3) and ICs (producing FCs in egg chamber 3 and more anterior locations) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>There is no longer a recognizable EGC after two egg chambers have budded, and the two most mature germline cysts are surrounded by strongly Fas3-positive cells within the germarium, as in adults. Budding of the third, and subsequent, egg chamber is therefore likely similar to the process in adults, with cysts emerging from the germarium completely encased by FCs. Consistent with this inference, the two most posterior germarial cysts are surrounded by Fas3-positive IC cells by the time the second egg chamber starts to bud. Precursors of those FC-forming ICs were almost certainly resident in the germarium throughout pupation because we never observed cells in the expanding EGC population entering the germarium. FSC precursors, which are anterior to FC precursors, must therefore also be ICs, residing within the germarium throughout pupation. This important deduction is supported also by consideration of cell numbers. Over 60 TJ-positive somatic ICs were seen in the germarium as the first germline cyst leaves the germarium at about 48 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This exceeds the total number of ECs (about 40 on average) plus FSCs (about 16) in an adult germarium, even though many of these precursors are still dividing and amplifying towards producing a full complement of adult ECs and FSCs. Thus, the ICs in the germarium at about 48 hr APF must include all EC and FSC precursors, as well as a significant number of FC precursors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Deductions from targeted lineage analyses</title><p>A recent study used single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the diversity of precursors in late larval ovaries. It was suggested that a distinct group of cells posterior to ICs and characterized by <italic>bond</italic> expression give rise to FSCs and FCs but not ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Slaidina et al., 2020</xref>). We repeated the supporting studies of lineages initiated from cells expressing <italic>bond-GAL4</italic>. By scoring FSCs directly, counting the number of labeled ECs and FSCs in each sample, and comparing the results to those for heat-shock induced single-cell lineages, we were able to deduce that ovarioles almost always harbored more than one lineage initiated by <italic>bond-GAL4</italic>. This allowed us to estimate the composition of single-cell lineages, and we found that they were very similar to those induced by marking any dividing cell at pupariation. This inference is compatible with the observation that <italic>bond</italic> RNA and <italic>bond-GAL4</italic> are expressed at low levels throughout the IC region in mid-third-instar larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Slaidina et al., 2020</xref>) and with RNA in situs showing <italic>bond</italic> RNA in posterior IC regions of late third-instar larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banisch et al., 2021</xref>). In those lineages, which appear to be initiated throughout the IC region, rather than specifically in cells posterior to ICs, we found that labeled FSCs almost always included labeled ECs, compatible with a common precursor. It was previously assumed that <italic>bond-GAL4</italic> lineages derived selectively from cells posterior to ICs in late third-instar larvae and that the presence of both labeled ECs and FSCs in the same ovariole resulted from the simultaneous presence of a lineage dedicated to production of each cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Slaidina et al., 2020</xref>). We did find evidence that <italic>bond-GAL4</italic> also targets cells that become FCs of the first-formed egg chamber very late in pupal development. It remains uncertain whether <italic>bond</italic> might be a selective marker of EGC or basal stalk FC precursors during the first half of pupation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Coordination between germline and somatic ovarian cell development</title><p>Ovary development not only organizes suitable numbers of FSCs, GSCs, and their niche cells into an adult germarium, ready to fuel lifelong adult oogenesis, but also initiates oogenesis early, so that the first eggs can be laid shortly after eclosion. This requires organized progression of germline development. Ecdysone acts positively in somatic cells of late third-instar larvae to initiate GSC differentiation, manifest by induction of the differentiation factor, Bag-of-marbles (Bam) and then cystocyte formation, revealed by the transition of the rounded spectrosome to a branched fusome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gancz and Gilboa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gancz et al., 2011</xref>). Prior studies did not reveal whether Bam-GFP expression or PGC division initiates simultaneously in all PGCs distant from cap cells or in an anterior-posterior gradient, or how germline differentiation proceeds thereafter. We found that there is a clear anterior to posterior polarity of increasingly developed cysts that produced a mature steady-state pattern by 48 hr APF. This was deduced by counting the number of germline cells linked by fusomes, with 16 cell cysts first appearing 18 hr APF, and by observing the exclusion of EdU DNA replication signals from the most posterior regions of the germarium from 36 hr onwards, indicating occupancy by only 16 cell cysts. Moreover, a single posterior 16-cell cyst emerged for the first time between 36 hr and 48 hr APF.</p><p>These observations raise the question of what underlies the spatially organized initiation or progression of differentiation of PGCs that are in different locations at the larval/pupal transition. The BMP signals that maintain anterior pre-GSCs are likely highly spatially restricted, as in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris and Ashe, 2011</xref>), while hormonal ecdysone signals may be spatially uniform, suggesting that there must be other important differentiation signals. Potential sources of relevant signals are the adjacent somatic cell precursors, which will later become ECs. There is some evidence that the ordered posterior movement of germline cysts in adult germaria depends on EC interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banisch et al., 2017</xref>). Perhaps pupal EC precursors, even while still dividing during early pupation, have spatially graded adhesive properties or send graded differentiation signals according to their AP position.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Organizing patterned development of adult stem cells and niche cells</title><p>It is common to think of developmental processes and cell types in terms of establishment of transcriptional networks and key markers that bear witness to permanent decisions. Investigations of adult FSCs, and other adult stem cell paradigms such as the mammalian gut, as well as the observations described here regarding FSC development, reveal a more flexible process, in which environmental signals reflecting current cell locations may be more significant than stable expression of master regulators of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reilein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Melamed and Kalderon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beumer and Clevers, 2020</xref>). The transcription factor TJ is selectively expressed in many developing and mature ovarian somatic cells, and it has been shown to be important for the specification of cap cells and many IC derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panchal et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore suspected that EGC cells, posterior to ICs, might be FC precursors because they also expressed TJ. Although that suspicion was supported by live imaging studies, the same studies showed that TJ-negative basal stalk cells also became FCs. Thus, TJ neither defines ICs nor EC/FSC/FC precursors. We think that it is likely that studying the spatial distribution of external signals and their interpretation by somatic cells in the developing ovariole will be essential to understand why some cells initially mix with germline cells to become ICs, while others segregate away, and how these cells become ECs, FSCs, and FCs just in time to serve the appropriate functional role.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

transferred to a vial with food, and checked every hour to mark the time each individual developed into a puparium (white, but immobile, with small anterior spiracles). This time is 0 hr APF. We found that keeping animals in the light at night and in the dark during the day on a 12 hr/12 hr cycle allowed more of them to pupate during the daytime. We used a programmable outlet timer (Nearpow) together with a manual LED soft white nightlight (Energizer Cat# 37099) installed in a dark incubator at 25C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Dissection and staining of pupal ovaries</title><p>Pupae were removed from the vial wall by adding a drop of water and transferred with forceps into a well of a Corning PYREX glass spot plate (Corning, Cat# 7220-85) containing either PBS or 4% paraformaldehyde solution with care taken not to damage or pierce the posterior end of the pupa. If the dissection was done in fixative solution, it could take no longer than 10 min (ovaries were rocked in clean fixative for a minimum of 15 min, but for no longer than 30 min). Ovaries from 72 hr APF and older had fewer tears in them when dissected directly into fixative. Using a dissecting microscope, pupae were held against the bottom of the well using forceps and the posterior tip was cut off using Vannas Spring Scissors (2.5 mm straight edge, Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA, item number 15000-08) about a third of the way in from the posterior end. The anterior part of the pupa was removed to a discard well. The posterior end was searched for ovaries (clear, spherical, striated structures) by gently dislodging fat tissue surrounding the ovaries so as not to cloud the well with debris. This was done by gently tearing apart the contents of the pupal case or swirling them in the well using two pairs of forceps. As soon as they were spotted, ovaries were transferred to a new well of fixative by the following process. A 20 μl pipette tip with a pipettor set to 20 μl was coated in 10% Normal Goat Serum (NGS) by pipetting up and down several times. The pipettor was set to 5 μl to pipette up the ovary from the dissection well to transfer into the fixative well. Ovaries were fixed by rocking in the well for 15 min at room temperature. Fixative was removed with a 1000 μl pipette set to 270 μl to slowly and carefully pipette up the liquid. The 1000 μl pipettor was used to remove liquid after all subsequent steps. Ovaries were rinsed 3× in 2% PBST 0.5% Tween solution for 5, 10, and 45 min at 4C by rocking very slowly in a horizontal plane. The glass dissection dish was covered with a large pipette tip box. Ovaries were rinsed for 30–60 min in 10% NGS solution at 4C, and then rocked gently in primary antibody overnight. Ovaries were rinsed 3× with 0.5% PBST and then incubated for 1 hr (covered, cold room, rocker set on 2) in secondary antibody diluted 1:1000 with 0.5% Triton. Ovaries were rinsed 2× with 0.5% PBST and 1× with PBS. To mount ovaries, a 20 μl pipette tip coated in 10% NGS solution as described above was set to 5 μl and used to capture the ovary and transfer to a glass slide. 20 μl of DAPI Fluoromount was added to a coverslip, and then placed on top of the slide with the ovaries. Care was taken to avoid pressing the coverslip and potentially disfiguring the mounted ovaries. For older pupal ovaries, specifically 72 hr APF and onward, forceps were used to gently tear apart the ovarioles to separate germaria for clearer imaging. A sharpie was used to draw arrows to mark the location of the ovaries on the coverslip.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>EdU labeling</title><p>Ovaries were dissected directly into 15 μM EdU in Schneider’s insect medium, incubated for 1 hr at room temperature, and then fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde.

Clones were generated in the multicolor ovaries by two 10 min heat-shocks at 37C spaced 8 hr apart, 48–72 hr before imaging in order to generate GFP-only and RFP-only cells that were easier to track. Images were acquired every 15 min with 2.5 μm between z-stacks. Volocity Software (Quorum Technologies, Puslinch, ON, Canada) was used to make the 4D reconstruction of the Ubi-GFP labeled ovary. All nineteen z slices covering 45 μm were used in the reconstruction; however, germaria drifted during imaging such that FCs covering approximately one quarter of the budded egg chamber on the lower germarium were not imaged. Cells were colored with Procreate software (Savage Interactive, North Hobart, Australia). Germline cells in the Ubi-GFP movie were identified based on their larger size and paler labeling with GFP compared to somatic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Clonal analysis and FUCCI labeling genotypes</title><p>MARCM clones for lineage analysis were generated on 2R and 3R using the following genotypes:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>(2R) yw <italic>hs-Flp, UAS-nGFP, tub-GAL4/ yw; FRT42D act-GAL80 tub-GAL80/ FRT42D sha; act&gt; CD2&gt; GAL4/+</italic> and (3R) yw <italic>hs-Flp, UAS-nGFP, tub-GAL4/ yw; act&gt; CD2&gt; GAL4 UAS-GFP/+; FRT82B tub-GAL80/FRT82B NM.</italic></p></list-item><list-item><p>For multicolor clones, flies were of the genotype: <italic>yw hs-flp/yw; ubi-GFP FRT40A FRT42B His2Av-RFP/tub-lacZ FRT40A FRT42B.</italic></p></list-item><list-item><p>Genotypes for FLY-FUCCI were <italic>C587-GAL4/ yw; UAS-FUCCI/Cyo; UAS-FUCCI/ (UAS-FUCCI or TM6B</italic>).</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Lineage analysis by MARCM</title><p>Pupae were heat-shocked at 33C for 12 min at the number of days indicated before eclosion.

To determine the boundaries of each region, we examined EdU incorporation in ovaries of newly eclosed flies and measured the distance from cap cells to the end of region 1 as determined by the presence of cysts that incorporated EdU. Region 1 cysts are going through mitosis and region 2a cysts have the complete complement of 16 germ cells. The length ratio of region 1:2a is about 3:1 in newly eclosed adults.

We assumed that EC numbers and locations did not change during this 2d interval because ECs generally appear to be quite long-lived. ECs are, however, produced from FSCs during adulthood, so it is likely that a small number of marked ECs scored at +2d were produced from FSCs after eclosion. The proportion of marked ECs arising from FSCs is likely small based on known rates of FSC conversion to ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Melamed and Kalderon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reilein et al., 2018b</xref>) and the observed high frequency of FSC clones with no ECs (44%) from –2d samples. Individual marked FSCs can be lost, mainly by becoming FCs, or amplified at high rates during adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reilein et al., 2017</xref>). If one or more marked FSCs were present at 0d but became an FC by +2d, the resulting marked FCs would reside around the two germarial cysts or in the two youngest egg chambers because egg chambers bud roughly every 12 hr, allowing four cycles of FC recruitment over 2d. We therefore scored an ovariole as containing an FSC (classifying it as an FSC-only or FSC/EC lineage, according to EC content) if there were any marked FCs up to and including the second egg chamber, even if there were no FSCs at +2d. In those cases, we scored the number of marked FSCs as zero. On average, the number of marked FSCs should remain constant from 0d to +2d, so we should obtain a very good estimation of FSC numbers at 0d by scoring the numbers of marked FSCs at +2d, provided we include all examples where all marked FSCs were lost as containing zero FSCs. By using these guidelines, we could surmise the number of different types of clone at 0d and the number of constituent ECs and FSCs from data collected by scoring clones in 2d-old adults.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Calculation of single-cell lineage frequencies assuming independent recombination events</title><p>The proportion of marked ovarioles with a lineage originating from a single marked cell is generally estimated by assuming that the probability of each dividing precursor to be labeled is independent. The estimate derives principally from the observed frequency of unlabeled ovarioles, but it is also dependent to a small degree on the number of potential target cells. Different numbers of assumed target cells are used in the calculations below to demonstrate that estimated single-cell frequencies are not greatly altered by this value.</p><p>For the –6d to –2d time course, the average frequency of labeled ovarioles was about 60%.</p><p>If there were, for example, only six target cells and we assume a binomial distribution (independent probabilities) of labeling, the chance of any one cell giving a clone is p and the chance of six cells not giving a clone is (1p)<sup>6</sup>. The observed no-clone fraction was 0.4, so (1p) = 0.86 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.14. Hence, the single-clone frequency among six cells is 6p(1p)<sup>5</sup>, and the frequency among labeled ovarioles is 1/0.6-fold higher (because 60% were labeled). Therefore, the expected frequency of single-cell lineages is 6 × 0.14×(0.86)<sup>5</sup>/0.6 = 0.66.</p><p>If there were instead 15 target cells, then <italic>P</italic> = 0.06 (because 0.94<sup>15</sup> = 0.4) and the frequency of single-cell lineages is 15 × 0.06 ×(0.94)<sup>14</sup>/0.6 = 0.63.</p><p>If there were 30 target cells, then <italic>P</italic> = 0.03 (because 0.97<sup>30</sup> = 0.4) and the frequency of single-cell lineages is 30 × 0.03 ×(0.97)<sup>29</sup>/0.6 = 0.62.</p><p>For the multicolor experiment examining newly eclosed adults 5d after heat-shock, the frequency of labeled ovarioles was 26/115 = 23%. If there were 20 target cells (likely in the range of the actual number of precursors), then <italic>P</italic> = 0.013 (because 0.987<sup>20</sup> = 0.77) and the frequency of single-cell lineages is 20 × 0.013 × (0.987)<sup>19</sup>/0.23 = 0.86.</p><p>For the MARCM experiment examining newly eclosed adults 5d after heat-shock, the frequency of labeled ovarioles was 98/207 = 47%.

Based on the EC/FC clone frequency, we used trial and error (using increments of 5%) to find the percentage of ovarioles with a single lineage that best fit the entire dataset of clone-type frequencies we observed using the simplifying assumption that all other marked ovarioles harbored exactly two lineages. In reality, the proportion of ovarioles with single lineages may be slightly different and a few ovarioles may include three or more marked lineages but the simplifying approximations we used are likely to be close to reality. These calculations, presented below, are better approximations than are generally made by simply considering the proportion of ovarioles with no marked cells.</p><sec id="s4-12-1"><title>MARCM clones induced 5d (0 hr APF) before eclosion</title><p>Single-cell lineage frequencies and labeled cell content were calculated after estimating that 30% of marked ovarioles derived from a single marked cell, while the remaining 70% derived from two marked cells.

This is a well established and genetically amenable system to explore interactions between adult stem cells and their niches. The paper presents a new view of how different cell types acquire their fates during development. This is a more nuanced view than extant models, involving common progenitors from which different cell fates (stem cell, progeny and niche cells) arise gradually and relying on spatiotemporal cues. It will be an important study for the stem cell/developmental biology field.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Adult Stem Cells and Niche Cells segregate gradually from common precursors that build the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary during pupal development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. We are sorry that it took so long to make this decision: A third reviewer promised their review several times but never delivered it.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found the work to be convincing although the sheer amount of data tends to hide the significance of the conclusions.</p><p>Therefore, the main recommendation for a revised version is that you shorten very significantly the manuscript by moving more data to the supplement, and by explaining the main findings in the figures, and their importance in lay terms in the text. The abstract should also be re-written to better convey the main findings to a wider audience. This would make the paper much more powerful to convey the message.</p><p>The reviewers have also a number of smaller questions that you will want to address but will not require significant experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The presentation is too lengthy and some of the figures do not follow the order in the text. For example, Figure 3-5 could be combined for easy comparison, and the detailed images could go to supplementary.</p><p>2. The title should indicate the second part of the paper (EGCs and basal stalks) as well. The word &quot;segregate gradually&quot; is not explained well.</p><p>3. Summary, &quot;set up a key posterior signaling center for regulating adult FSC behavior&quot;, please explain what kind of signaling center?</p><p>4. Figure 1, please move 1J upfront.</p><p>5. Figure 2, could move to supplementary. Also, the quality of the image does not provide enough information to distinguish the different germline stages. A zoomed in view of the four stages shown by different arrows should be provided.</p><p>6. Figure 3B, should be moved to Figure 4, or combine Figure 3-5.</p><p>7. Figure 4, showing quantification could be more helpful than showing examples.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As the paper is very long and dense, we struggled to review it to the standards we normally apply to other manuscripts. I would recommend that the authors shorten the manuscript by moving more data to the supplement, and try to explain the data in the main figures, their findings and importance in lay terms. The abstract could also be re-written to attempt to convey the main findings to a wider audience.</p><p>Aside from the general points described in the public review regarding the manuscript's presentation and the suggested genetic interrogation for model validation, we have the following suggestions:</p><p>Figure panel labelling. We found the cartoons really helpful but we still got a bit lost with some of the figure panels and had to go back and forth between figures. It would be helpful to, for example, see the labels for specific markers on the figure panels themselves rather than having to check in each figure legend, and insert additional cartoons to orient the readers who might be unfamiliar with the system/cell types/markers.</p><p>The authors only discussed the single cell RNAseq paper from the Lehmann lab in the context of bond-Gal4. Can anything else be learned by considering it more &quot;holistically&quot; in the context of the revised lineage relationships revealed by the authors? (e.g. regarding the separate precursors of FCs in different egg chambers, or the gradual restrictions of precursor fates according to cell locations along the AP axis…). Whilst the initial clustering may not have been revealing of these features, further (sub)clustering informed by this new knowledge may reveal some interesting candidate genes/cell subtypes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69749.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found the work to be convincing although the sheer amount of data tends to hide the significance of the conclusions.</p><p>Therefore, the main recommendation for a revised version is that you shorten very significantly the manuscript by moving more data to the supplement, and by explaining the main findings in the figures, and their importance in lay terms in the text.

The required and suggested changes are detailed under comments from each reviewer. They include moving two and a half Figures to supplementary data, ensuring that each section of text included a clear final summary sentence of the main finding in plain language, a completely revised abstract, ands a large number of text edits (principally deletions) to remove duplications or unnecessary material. There was a limit to such changes, enforced by the need to display the requisite evidence to make rigorous conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The presentation is too lengthy and some of the figures do not follow the order in the text. For example, Figure 3-5 could be combined for easy comparison, and the detailed images could go to supplementary.</p></disp-quote><p>I believe Figures are all in order now. Figures 3-5 (now 2-4) all have specific virtues as complementary approaches (summarized in Figure 2A), where examples of images are key to conveying the messages of AP clustering and lineages spanning borders between cell types. These are key points, requiring direct visibility as main Figures and cannot be compressed into just one or two Figures. We have made accommodations elsewhere instead (moving Figures 2, 11 and half of the former Figure 8 to Supplementary).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The title should indicate the second part of the paper (EGCs and basal stalks) as well. The word &quot;segregate gradually&quot; is not explained well.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion but find we cannot convey the second part of the paper within a limited number of words or in a general form. Likewise, it is hard to explain the concept of “segregate gradually” just within a title. We believe that the revised Summary (and Introduction) accomplish that.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Summary, &quot;set up a key posterior signaling center for regulating adult FSC behavior&quot;, please explain what kind of signaling center?</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-written the Summary to explain this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 1, please move 1J upfront.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you- done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 2, could move to supplementary. Also, the quality of the image does not provide enough information to distinguish the different germline stages. A zoomed in view of the four stages shown by different arrows should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done that (now Figure1—figure supplement 1) and key fusome details are mostly directly visible; others required looking at additional z-sections but this has been done to support the stated observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 3B, should be moved to Figure 4, or combine Figure 3-5.</p></disp-quote><p>We moved this (and changed it slightly to illustrate key points in the text better) to become part of the next Figure (now 3A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 4, showing quantification could be more helpful than showing examples.</p></disp-quote><p>The quantitation is in the next Figure (now Figure 4D, E), where it is presented together with analogous quantitation of MARCM 0h and 36h APF experiments to allow direct comparisons. We believe the direct image evidence is important and attractive, with offset clones of different color (Figure 3E-G) hard to present in any other way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>As the paper is very long and dense, we struggled to review it to the standards we normally apply to other manuscripts. I would recommend that the authors shorten the manuscript by moving more data to the supplement, and try to explain the data in the main figures, their findings and importance in lay terms. The abstract could also be re-written to attempt to convey the main findings to a wider audience.</p></disp-quote><p>We re-wrote the Summary to convey the most central general point within the word limit, with further elaboration in the Introduction.</p><p>We moved two Figures (formerly 2 and 11) to Supplementary plus the second part of current Figure 7 (formerly Figure 8).</p><p>We have deleted sections, sentences and phrases throughout.</p><p>We have made sure there are suitable interim summaries of main points, charting the general course of main Figures retained. These can be found, in almost all cases, as the last sentence in a section and are in plain language.</p><p>The story told in the retained main Figures is outlined below.</p><p>Figure 1: general outline of pupal ovary development prior to detailed study.</p><p>Figures 2-4; Three lineage approaches to establish common precursors of ECs, FSCs and FCs, together with AP clustering of lineages from the most anterior ECs to the most posterior FCs, as summarized in the cartoon of Figure 5.</p><p>Figures 6-9: Lineage studies, fixed and live imaging to show that FCs of the first egg chamber derive from precursors that accumulate posterior to ICs and the germarium during the first half of pupation. Those studies also show that FSC precursors must reside within the germarium as ICs throughout pupation.</p><p>Figure 10: declining precursor proliferation from anterior to posterior during pupation, supporting lineage studies presented earlier in Table 2.</p><p>Figure 11: Repeat of targeted bond-GAL4 lineage studies with results compatible with the other lineage studies we presented.</p><p>We also started the Discussion with a summary of the most general insights.</p><p>Subsequent sections explain how the inherent difficulties of inferring cell origins in this paradigm were addressed, including inference of the locations of different precursors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Aside from the general points described in the public review regarding the manuscript's presentation and the suggested genetic interrogation for model validation, we have the following suggestions:</p><p>Figure panel labelling. We found the cartoons really helpful but we still got a bit lost with some of the figure panels and had to go back and forth between figures. It would be helpful to, for example, see the labels for specific markers on the figure panels themselves rather than having to check in each figure legend, and insert additional cartoons to orient the readers who might be unfamiliar with the system/cell types/markers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added colored marker labels to most panels. We have made additional references to key cartoons, including adult germarium structures (Figure 1A), the summary cartoon of all lineage studies (Figure 2A), and the summary cartoon of inferred precursor progress through the first half of pupal development (Figure 5). The process of budding of the first egg chamber is directly evident from the fixed images presented in Figure 7 (even though the time-course is not of the same sample) and the live imaging frames in Figure 9 (and the video) and Figure 9- supplement 4 for the last phase, so we thought it unnecessary to add a cartoon of that process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors only discussed the single cell RNAseq paper from the Lehmann lab in the context of bond-Gal4. Can anything else be learned by considering it more &quot;holistically&quot; in the context of the revised lineage relationships revealed by the authors? (e.g. regarding the separate precursors of FCs in different egg chambers, or the gradual restrictions of precursor fates according to cell locations along the AP axis…). Whilst the initial clustering may not have been revealing of these features, further (sub)clustering informed by this new knowledge may reveal some interesting candidate genes/cell subtypes.</p></disp-quote><p>The quoted studies report cell status in third instar larvae. We have shown that there are likely no definitive precursors for specific adult cell types at that stage. There will doubtless be AP differences in expression profiles amongst ICs that will correlate with more anterior or more posterior outcomes, most likely as a continuum. Those differences likely increase during pupation as precursor potentials become limited according to AP location; their identification would require RNA analysis at stages beyond pupariation. The Lehmann lab followed up their initial studies to target lineage analysis to Swarm cells as the earliest cells to migrate from apical locations, prior to pupation, as cited in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
