growth development, and cancer. However, its role in regulating inflammatory responses remains elusive. Here, we report that Vangl2 is upregulated in patients with sepsis and identify Vangl2 as a negative regulator of The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling by regulating the protein stability and activation of the core transcription component p65. Mice with myeloid-specific deletion of Vangl2 (<italic>Vangl2</italic><sup>ΔM</sup>) are hypersusceptible to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. Vangl2-deficient myeloid cells exhibit enhanced phosphorylation and expression of p65, therefore, promoting the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines after LPS stimulation. Mechanistically, NF-κB signaling-induced-Vangl2 recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase PDLIM2 to catalyze K63-linked ubiquitination on p65, which serves as a recognition signal for cargo receptor NDP52-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate Vangl2 as a suppressor of NF-κB-mediated inflammation and provide insights into the crosstalk between autophagy and inflammatory diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Vangl2</kwd><kwd>NF-κB signaling</kwd><kwd>selective autophagy</kwd><kwd>PDLIM2</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82302731</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Jiansen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021M701622</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Jiansen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82171741</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Xiao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82371761</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Xiao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100021171</institution-id><institution>Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021A1515012140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Xiao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Vangl2 induced by inflammation recruits ubiquitin ligase PDLIM2 and increases K63-linked ubiquitination on p65, which promotes the recognition of p65 by cargo receptor NDP52 and the autophagic degradation of p65.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2), a core planar cell polarity (PCP) component, mediates Wingless-type (Wnt)/PCP signaling, and controls homeostasis, development, and repair of organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailly et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hatakeyama et al., 2014</xref>). Vangl2 has four transmembrane domains with both carboxyl termini and amino oriented toward the cytoplasm, which is phosphorylated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then transported to the cell surface and becomes stabilized, while the unphosphorylated Vangl2 is unstable and internalized to degrade via the lysosomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). The shuttle of Vangl2 between cytoplasm and cell membrane results in its multifunction, including adhesion, membrane protrusive activity, migration, and bridging proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hatakeyama et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, Vangl2 inhibited matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) activity and affected cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jessen and Jessen, 2017</xref>). Vangl2 also modulates glomerular injury by promoting MMP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Papakrivopoulou et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the abnormal function of Vangl2 results in various diseases, such as cancer, kidney glomerular injury, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and systemic dysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Papakrivopoulou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poobalasingam et al., 2017</xref>). Vangl2 is markedly downregulated in patients with emphysema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poobalasingam et al., 2017</xref>), while which level was upregulated and amplified in breast, ovarian, and uterine carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kandoth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cerami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, Vangl2 is bounded to p62 to promote breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Puvirajesinghe et al., 2016</xref>). Our previous study showed that Vangl2 prevents osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells, resulting in osteogenic dysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gong et al., 2021</xref>). Vangl2-mediated downstream factors of Toll-like (TLR) or interleukin (IL)-1 receptor, such as myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gong et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that Vangl2 may play roles in immune-related diseases, including autoimmune diseases. However, the function of Vangl2 in inflammatory diseases remains uncovered.</p><p>The NF-κB signaling is critical for the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). NF-κB activation relies on the pattern recognition receptors recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including TLR, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers TLR activation and the recruitment of adaptor proteins including MyD88. This in turn activates a series of downstream canonical NF-κB signaling cascade, resulting in the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB and the nuclear translocation of RelA/p65 and p50 to induce the transcription of several inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Funes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Locati et al., 2020</xref>). Since uncontrolled immune responses are detrimental to the host, inappropriate or excessive NF-κB activity contributes to the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cartwright et al., 2016</xref>). Thus NF-κB signaling must be tightly regulated to maintain immune balance in the organism. In recent decades, extensive studies have focused on the mechanisms underlying the regulation of NF-κB signaling. Recent research demonstrated that NLRC5 strongly prevents NF-κB signaling pathway by interacting with IκB kinase (IKK) α/IKKβ and blocking their phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cui et al., 2010</xref>). COMMD1, PPARγ, SOCS1, and GCN5 were also shown to negatively regulate NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartuzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mao et al., 2009</xref>). Meanwhile, tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (Trim21) enhanced the interaction of p65 with IKK, which promotes p65 phosphorylation and downstream gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning the regulation of NF-κB signaling are still elusive.</p><p>Autophagy, a conserved intracellular degradation pathway, decomposes cytoplasmic organelles and components, and acts as a defense mechanism to pathogen infection, playing a crucial role in nutrient recycling, stress response, and cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashrafi and Schwarz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denton and Kumar, 2019</xref>). Recent evidence indicates that autophagy is highly selective when delivering specific substrates to autolysosomal degradation by virtue of a number of cargo receptors, including sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62), optineurin (OPTN), nuclear dot protein 52 (NDP52/CALCOCO2), and neighbor of BRCA1 (NBR1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gatica et al., 2018</xref>). Selective autophagy targets immune regulators for degradation, thus suppressing innate immune signaling, such as type I IFN and NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pradel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tong et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, p62 protein has been identified as a novel Vangl2-binding partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Puvirajesinghe et al., 2016</xref>), and our recent study has demonstrated that Vangl2 reduces lysosomal chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) activity by targeting LAMP-2A for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gong et al., 2021</xref>). However, whether and how Vangle2 is involved in the selective autophagic regulation of NF-κB signaling remains largely unknown.</p><p>In this study, we uncover a previously unrecognized role of Vangl2, as a ‘molecular brake’, in the negative regulation of NF-κB signaling to prevent excessive and potentially harmful immune responses during sepsis in both human patient samples and LPS-induced mouse model. Induction of Vangl2 upon inflammation recruits an E3 ubiquitin ligase PDLIM2 to catalyze K63-linked ubiquitination on p65, thus promoting the recognition of p65 by the cargo receptor NDP52 and resulting in the selective autophagic degradation of p65. Our findings provide a potential target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of Vangl2 promotes inflammatory responses in LPS-induced septic shock</title><p>To investigate the potential role of Vangl2 in inflammatory response, we first analyzed the expression of Vangl2 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from sepsis patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and found mRNA level of Vangl2 was increased in the sepsis patients compared to healthy control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, the serum of the high Vangl2 expression group had lower levels of IL-6, white blood cell, and acute C-reactive protein than the low Vangl2 expression group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

In addition, endogenous co-IP immunoblot analyses showed that Vangl2 was strongly associated with p65 upon LPS stimulation in BMDMs, but not with IKKα, IKKβ, or MyD88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Moreover, ZDOCK server predicted that Vangl2 may potentially interact with p65 by a hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J</xref>). We further investigated the co-localization of Vangl2 and p65 by confocal microscopy and found a weak-co-localization of Vangl2 with p65 in unstimulated cells and the co-localization between Vangl2 and p65 was notably enhanced upon LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K</xref>). To determine how Vangl2 interacts with cytoplasmic p65, we isolated cytoplasm and membrane in LPS-treated THP-1 cells. We found that Vangl2 interacted with p65 mainly in the cytoplasm, although most of Vangl2 located on the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1L</xref>). Together, these data suggest that Vangl2 may interact with p65 in the cytoplasm to inhibit NF-κB signaling.</p><p>Vangl2 comprises an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (NT), a transmembrane (TM) domain, a Prickle-binding domain (PkBD), and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nagaoka et al., 2019</xref>). To map the essential domains of Vangl2 that mediate its association with p65, we generated several deletion constructs of Vangl2. We found Vangl2 FL (full-length), T2 (ΔNT + TM), T3 (ΔCT), and T4 (ΔNT) interacted with the full-length p65, while Vangl2 T1 (ΔPkBD + CT) abrogated their association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1M</xref>), indicating that the PkBD domain is important for the Vangl2–p65 interaction. Additionally, we constructed HA-tagged Vangl2 PkBD plasmid and co-IP assay revealed that Vangl2 FL and PkBD interacted with p65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Moreover, we observed that deletion of the PkBD domain (T1), but not other domains, of Vangl2 abolished the Vangl2-mediated inhibition of NF-κB-luc activity, and transfection of Vangl2 PkBD domain achieved similar inhibition on p65 induced NF-κB activation as Vangl2 FL did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that Vangl2 suppresses NF-κB signaling by targeting p65 through Vangl2 PkBD domain interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Vangl2 promotes the autophagic degradation of p65</title><p>Next we sought to study the physiological role of Vangl2-p65 interaction in the regulation of NF-κB signaling by transfecting 293T cells with Flag-tagged p65, together with increasing doses of Vangl2, and found that Vangl2 dramatically decreased the protein level of p65 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the downregulation of p65 protein by Vangl2 was caused by the inhibition of p65 transcription, qPCR results suggested that the abundance of <italic>p65</italic> mRNA did not change in cells with increased expression of Vangl2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Since there is no research suggests that Vangl2 is a cargo protein, we hypothesized that Vangl2 might bridge p65 to the cargo receptors for autophagic degradation. To identify the potential cargo receptor responsible for Vangl2-mediated autophagic degradation of p65, we co-transfected 293T cells with Vangl2 and various cargo receptors, followed by co-IP assay. Result suggested that Vangl2 strongly interacted with the cargo receptors p62 and NDP52, and slightly associated with NBR1 and Nix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, p65 only interacted with the cargo receptors p62 and NDP52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), which is consistent with a recent finding that p62 protein is a Vangl2-binding partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Puvirajesinghe et al., 2016</xref>). We next attempted to clarify whether p62 or NDP52 is involved in Vangl2-mediated autophagic degradation of p65.

Consistently, we found that Vangl2-mediated degradation of p65 was rescued in NDP52 KO cells, but not in p62 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Endogenous co-IP immunoblot analyses also revealed that deficiency of Vangl2 remarkably attenuated the association of endogenous p65 and NDP52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

The function of Vangl2 mostly depends on its cellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hatakeyama et al., 2014</xref>) and is reported mainly through PCP/WNT signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jessen and Jessen, 2019</xref>). Activated Vangl2 exhibits extremely long cytoplasmic and intercellular branches and delivers Wnt to multiple cells to enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunt et al., 2021</xref>). During myocardial hypertrophy, Vangl2 aggravates myocardial hypertrophy by regulating Wnt/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jessen and Jessen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jessen and Jessen, 2019</xref>) and the expansion of cardiomyocyte surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jessen and Jessen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jessen and Jessen, 2019</xref>). However, our previous study showed that the lysosome-suppressing function of Vangl2 in osteoblast differentiation is not dependent on conventional PCP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gong et al., 2021</xref>), and we found Vangl2 did not affect the JNK pathway after LPS treatment (data not shown), suggesting that Vangl2 has additional functions in pathways besides PCP. In this study, we provided direct evidence that the expression of Vangl2 was increased during sepsis and upregulated significantly in immune organs (lymph nodes and spleen) upon LPS stimulation, which is consistent with our previous finding that Vangl2 regulated the downstream signaling of TLR or IL-1R. In addition, the present study showed that Vangl2 prevented the progression of sepsis and the accumulation of inflammatory cytokines through suppressing NF-κB pathway: Vangl2 inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation by delivering p65 to autophagosome for degradation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study proves that Vangl2 regulates NF-κB signaling and inflammatory responses, and could serve as a potential target for therapeutic purposes in diseases associated with NF-κB signaling.</p><p>As is well-known, Vangl2 phosphorylation is essential for its functions in the mammalian PCP pathway in multiple tissues. However, our findings indicate that Vangl2 phosphorylation mutants also promote p65 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and the degradation of p65 induced by Vangl2 was blocked by autolysosome inhibitor (CQ), but not by the JNK inhibitor (SP600125) or Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor (FH535) (data no shown), suggesting that Vangl2 may regulate the NF-κB pathway independently of its conventional PCP pathway. Nevertheless, additional pathway inhibitions, such as those of the HH/GLI and Fat-Dachsous pathways, should also be employed to further elucidate the function of Vangl2 in p65 degradation. The PCP pathways frequently intersect with developmentally important pathways. Previous research has demonstrated that Vangl2 deficiency can affect developmental processes. It would be importance to investigate whether Vangl2-dependent NF-κB is influenced by developmental pathways. Distinct from previous studies, our findings revealed no significant differences in spleen and lymph node size between WT and <italic>Vangl2</italic><sup>ΔM</sup> mice. However, myeloid-specific loss of Vangl2 resulted in increased numbers of monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils in the spleen and BM. This suggests that the ablation of Vangl2 in myeloid cells does not affect the development of immune system development, but rather affects the differentiation of specific cell types. Moreover, we found that Vangl2 is induced and functions under LPS stimulation. Collectively, these findings suggest that Vangl2-dependent NF-κB functions do not affect the development of the immune system, but rather influence the progression of inflammatory-related diseases.</p><p>In our study, LPS stimulation did not mediate the expression of Vangl2 in the lungs and liver, though there are lots of resident immune cells in these organs, which suggests that Vangl2 may be important in circulating immune cells and not in the resident population. Given that LPS stimulation markedly alters the expression of Vangl2 in lymph nodes and spleen, rather than in the lungs and liver, we concentrated on the function of Vangl2 in myeloid cells. However, the restricted tissue specificity of the interaction between two ubiquitously present proteins remains a challenge to comprehend and further investigation is needed.</p><p>The proteasome, lysosome, and autolysosome pathways are the major systems that are utilized by eukaryotic cells to maintain the protein abundance and immune homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deretic, 2021</xref>). Previous studies have shown that cellular levels of Vangl2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feng et al., 2021</xref>) and its binding partner Prickle2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nagaoka et al., 2019</xref>) are maintained by the proteasomal pathway. Our recent study showed that Vangl2-mediated osteogenic differentiation by limiting CMA in mesenchymal stem cells, suggesting a potential close relationship between Vangl2 and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gong et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, Vangl2 interacts with LAMP-2A through PkBD domain. Interestingly, we also found Vangl2 interacted with p65 through PkBD domain, indicating that the PkBD domain of Vangl2 play a pivotal role in mediating the interaction between Vangl2 and its target protein. Furthermore, our study suggests Vangl2 promotes p65 degradation through autophagy pathway, but not proteasomal pathway. Importantly, we demonstrated that the degradation of p65 mediated by Vangl2–NDP52 complex is regulated by autophagy induction through rapamycin treatment and autophagy blockade by ATG5 KO or Beclin1 KO. Considering our findings and previous reports, Vangl2 may play multifunctional roles in regulating different types of autophagy (i.e. CMA or selective autophagy).</p><p>Selective autophagy requires that cargo receptors recognize the labeling of cargoes with degradation signals and subsequently engaged with the LC3 localized in the autophagosome membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shaid et al., 2013</xref>). Common cargo receptors mainly include p62/SQSTM1, CALCOCO2/NDP52, OPTN, NBR1, and TOLLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johansen and Lamark, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamano and Youle, 2020</xref>). A study in HEK293T cells showed that LRRC25 promotes the autophagic degradation of p65 through enhancing the interaction between p65 and p62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, a recent study showed that Vangl2 interacts with p62, subsequently promoting breast tumors by activating JNK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Puvirajesinghe et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that Vangl2 may promote the autophagic degradation of p65 by recruiting the cargo receptor p62. However, our data suggested that Vangl2 markedly increased the p65–NDP52 interaction but not p65–p62. Strikingly, Vangl2-mediated autophagic degradation of p65 was abolished in NDP52 KO cells, but not in p62 KO cells. Thus, our findings identify that NDP52 is the new cargo receptor responsible for Vangl2-mediated selective autophagic degradation of p65.</p><p>Accumulating evidence has shown that cargo receptors mainly recognize ubiquitination modifications on the substrates and then promote degradation in auto-lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shaid et al., 2013</xref>). As expected, we observed Vangl2 promoted the ubiquitination of p65, thus enhancing the association between cargo protein and p65. K48- and K63-linked ubiquitination were mostly reported modifications on p65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kauppinen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Korbecki et al., 2019</xref>). For example, E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF182 inhibited TLR-triggered cytokine production by promoting K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of p65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). Trim21 promoted K63-linked poly-ubiquitination of p65, but did not affect the stability of p65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). PDLIM7 cooperated with PDLIM2 to inhibit inflammation by promoting K63-linked poly-ubiquitination of p65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jodo et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we revealed that Vangl2 specifically promoted K63-linked poly-ubiquitination of p65, but not other ubiquitin linkages by recruiting a previously unrecognized E3 ligase PDLIM2, which further explore the molecular mechanism by which regulates the stability of p65. Although many studies focus on the regulation of p65, the location of p65 degradation has not been clarified. A study showed PDLIM2 degrades p65 through the proteasomal pathway in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jodo et al., 2020</xref>), while we found Vangl2-mediated autophagic degradation of p65 mainly happened in cytoplasm, but not in nucleus. Combined with previous studies, our study indicates that p65 undergoes different degradation pathway in distinct location of cells.</p><p>Autophagy is a fundamental biological process contributing to multiple life processes. Emerging evidence has suggested that crosstalk between autophagy and innate immune signaling plays critical roles in diseases with inflammatory components, including infections, cancer, autoimmunity, and metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pradel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Recent study showed that the interplay between autophagy and type I IFN or NF-κB signaling drives or suppresses inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hui et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, autophagy-related key genes, such as Atg5, Atg9, and ULK1, also play critical roles in inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peng et al., 2019</xref>). Here, our discovery of Vangl2–PDLIM2–NDP52 complex in the regulation of p65-mediated NF-κB signaling could be a therapeutic target for the development of immunotherapy against infection and inflammation.</p><p>The IKK complex plays a pivotal role in the phosphorylation of p65, which in turn influences NF-κB transcriptional activity. Our findings also indicate that Vangl2 deficiency results in an increased accumulation of phosphorylated p65 and IKK also at 30 min post-LPS stimulation. However, autophagic degradation of p65 may not have been initiated at this early time point. The function of Vangl2 in mediating NF-κB activation during the early stages of LPS stimulation may be complex. Consequently, these data suggest the intriguing possibility that Vangl2 may also regulate the immediate early phase of the inflammatory response via the IKK–p65 axis, which need further study.</p><p>Based on our findings, we propose a working model that Vangl2 negatively regulates NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Vangl2 functions as an adaptor to recruit ubiquitin ligase PDLIM2 and increase K63-linked ubiquitination on p65, which promotes the recognition of p65 by cargo receptor NDP52 and the autophagic degradation of p65, resulting in suppressing the production of proinflammatory cytokines and ameliorating sepsis.

Vangl2 malfunctioning has been linked to various human ailments, including autoimmune and neoplastic disorders. Interestingly, it was shown that Vangl2 interacts with the autophagy regulator p62, and autophagic degradation limits the activity of inflammatory mediators, such as p65/NF-κB. However, the possible role of Vangl2 in inflammation has not been investigated. In this manuscript, Lu et al. describe that Vangl2 expression is upregulated in human sepsis-associated PBMCs and that Vangl2 mitigates experimental sepsis in mice by negatively regulating p65/NF-κB signaling in myeloid cells. Their mechanistic studies further revealed that Vangl2 recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase PDLIM2 to promote K63-linked poly-ubiquitination of p65. Vangl2 also facilitated the recognition of ubiquitinated p65 by the cargo receptor NDP52. These molecular processes caused selective autophagic degradation of p65. Indeed, abrogation of PDLIM2 or NDP52 functions rescued p65 from autophagic degradation, leading to extended p65/NF-κB activity in myeloid cells. Overall, the manuscript presents convincing evidence for novel Vangl2-mediated control of inflammatory p65/NF-kB activity. The proposed pathway may expand interventional opportunities restraining aberrant p65/NF-kB activity in human ailments.</p><p>IKK is known to mediate p65 phosphorylation, which instructs NF-kB transcriptional activity. In this manuscript, Vangl2 deficiency led to an increased accumulation of phosphorylated p65 and IKK also at 30 minutes post-LPS stimulation; however, autophagic degradation of p-p65 may not have been initiated at this early time point. Therefore, this set of data put forward the exciting possibility that Vangl2 could also be regulating the immediate early phase of inflammatory response involving the IKK-p65 axis - a proposition that may be tested in future studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87935.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Lu et al. describe Vangl2 as a negative regulator of inflammation in myeloid cells.

The primary mechanism appears to be through binding p65 and promoting its degradation, albeit in an unusual autolysosome/autophagy dependent manner. Overall, these findings are novel, valuable and the crosstalk of PCP pathway protein Vangl2 with NF-kappaB is of interest. While generally solid, some concerns still remain about the rigor and conclusions drawn.</p><p>Comments on the revised version:</p><p>(1) Lu et al. address my comments through responses and new experimental data. However, some of the explanations provided are inadequate.</p><p>However, in response to my enquiry regarding directly exploring PCP effects, the authors simply assert &quot;Our study revealed that Vangl2 recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase PDLIM2 to facilitate K63-linked ubiquitination of p65, which is subsequently recognized by autophagy receptor NDP52 and then promotes the autophagic degradation of p65. Our findings by using autophagy inhibitors and autophagic-deficient cells indicate that Vangl2 regulates NFkB signaling through a selective autophagic pathway, rather than affecting the PCP pathway, WNT, HH/GLI, Fat-Dachsous or even mechanical tension.&quot;</p><p>I do not agree that the use of autophagy inhibitors and autophagy-deficient cells can rule out the contributions of PCP or any other pathways. Only experimentally inhibiting the pathway(s) with adequate demonstration of target inhibition/abolition of well-known effector function and documenting unaltered p65 regulation under these conditions can be considered proof. Autophagy inhibitors and autophagy-deficient cells only prove that this particular pathway is necessary. Nonetheless, I do not want to dwell on proving a negative and agree that Vangl2 is a novel regulator of p65 through its role in promoting p65 degradation.

We provided new data and revised the Discussion as suggested.</p><p>To ascertain whether Vangl2 degrades p65 through a selective autophagic pathway or the PCP pathway, 293T cells were transfected with p65, together with or without the Vangl2 plasmids, and treated with different pharmacological inhibitors. We found the degradation of p65 induced by Vangl2 was blocked by autolysosome inhibitor (CQ), but not by the JNK inhibitor (SP600125) or Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor (FH535) (New Figure. 1). These data suggest that Vangl2 primarily degrades p65 through a selective autophagic pathway, rather than through the JNK or Wnt signaling pathway. Nevertheless, additional pathway inhibitions, such as those of the HH/GLI and Fat-Dachsous pathways, should also be employed to further elucidate the function of Vangl2 in p65 degradation. As suggested, we have added a statement about the limitation of the approach in the discussion (Page 12, lines 378-385).</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Vangl2 degrades p65 through a selective autophagic pathway, but not by the PCP pathway.</title><p>HEK293T cells were transfected with Flag-p65 and HA-Vangl2 plasmids, and treated with DMSO, CQ (50 mM) for 6 h, SP600125 (20 mM) for 1 h or FH535 (30 mM) for 6 h.

There are lots of resident immune cells in the lungs and liver (alveolar macrophages in the lung and Kuppfer cells in the liver). For example, it may be so that Vangl2 is important in monocytes and not in the resident population. This might be a potential explanation. But this is not explored. The restricted tissue-specificity of the interaction between two ubiquitously present proteins is still a challenge to understand. The response from the authors is not satisfactory. There is plenty of Vangl2 in the liver in their western blot.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. We added this explanation in the Discussion.

The body temperature of #6 doesn't fall in the &lt;36 or &gt;38 degree C SIRS criteria. The inclusion of CRP, PCT, heart rate and respiratory rate, and other lab values would have further improved the inclusion criteria. Moreover, it is difficult to understand why there are 16 value points for healthy and sepsis cohorts in Fig 1 when there are 8 patients.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion.
