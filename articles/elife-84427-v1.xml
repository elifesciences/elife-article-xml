In Gram-positives, these secretion systems often rely on surface adhesins to enhance cellular aggregation and mating-pair formation. One of the best studied adhesins is PrgB from the conjugative plasmid pCF10 of <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, which has been shown to play major roles in conjugation, biofilm formation, and importantly also in bacterial virulence. Since <italic>prgB</italic> orthologs exist on a large number of conjugative plasmids in various different species, this makes PrgB a model protein for this widespread virulence factor. After characterizing the polymer adhesin domain of PrgB previously, we here report the structure for almost the entire remainder of PrgB, which reveals that PrgB contains four immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. Based on this new insight, we re-evaluate previously studied variants and present new in vivo data where specific domains or conserved residues have been removed. For the first time, we can show a decoupling of cellular aggregation from biofilm formation and conjugation in <italic>prgB</italic> mutant phenotypes. Based on the presented data, we propose a new functional model to explain how PrgB mediates its different functions. We hypothesize that the Ig-like domains act as a rigid stalk that presents the polymer adhesin domain at the right distance from the cell wall.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic></kwd><kwd>conjugation</kwd><kwd>type 4 secretion system</kwd><kwd>bacterial adhesion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016-03599</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berntsson</surname><given-names>Ronnie P-A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007067</institution-id><institution>Kempestiftelserna</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SMK-1762</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berntsson</surname><given-names>Ronnie P-A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007067</institution-id><institution>Kempestiftelserna</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SMK-1869</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berntsson</surname><given-names>Ronnie P-A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002805</institution-id><institution>Carl Tryggers Stiftelse för Vetenskaplig Forskning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CTS 18:39</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berntsson</surname><given-names>Ronnie P-A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The enterococcal adhesin PrgB consists of four immunoglobulin-like domains that support the proper function of its polymer adhesin domain.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> is one of the leading causes of hospital acquired infections, such as urinary tract infections and endocarditis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilmore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hidron et al., 2008</xref>). These infections are difficult to treat as <italic>E. faecalis</italic> has the tendency to form biofilms and is often resistant to various antibiotics. They are also notorious for spreading antibiotic resistance and other fitness advantages by transfer of mobile genetic elements, which can be located on conjugative plasmids or in the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palmer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palmer and Gilmore, 2010</xref>). Conjugative plasmids usually also encode a Type 4 Secretion System (T4SS) that mediates its transfer, via conjugation, from a donor cell to a recipient cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trokter and Waksman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cabezón et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koraimann, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grohmann et al., 2018</xref>). However, conjugative plasmids and their T4SS have almost exclusively been studied in Gram-negative model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grohmann et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>One of the few well-characterized Gram-positive conjugative plasmids is pCF10 from <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cabezón et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunny and Berntsson, 2016</xref>). This conjugative plasmid contains a ~27-kbp operon that is tightly regulated by the P<sub>Q</sub> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chandler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunny, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lassinantti et al., 2021</xref>) and that encodes all proteins needed for conjugation. This operon also encodes three cell wall anchored proteins: PrgA, PrgB, and PrgC. PrgA is a conjugation regulator that provides surface exclusion to prevent unwanted conjugation. We have previously shown that PrgA consists of a protease domain that is presented far away from the cell wall via a long stalk and that it is likely mediating the proteolytic cleavage of PrgB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmitt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Järvå et al., 2020</xref>). PrgC is a virulence factor, but its function and structure remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhatty et al., 2015</xref>). PrgB is the main adhesin produced by pCF10 and has been studied for well over three decades. This protein is around 140 kDa in size and possesses an N-terminal signal sequence and a C-terminal LPXTG cell wall anchor motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuang et al., 2009</xref>). PrgB, which is indicated to function as a dimer in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmitt et al., 2018</xref>), distributes over the entire surface of the cell wall and increases cellular aggregation, biofilm formation, and the efficiency of plasmid transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Olmsted et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Olmsted et al., 1993</xref>). Several mammalian infection model systems have shown that PrgB is a strong virulence factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Süssmuth et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schlievert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chuang-Smith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rakita et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vanek et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirt et al., 2022</xref>). One reason for this virulence is that PrgB mediates biofilm formation in an extracellular DNA (eDNA)-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhatty et al., 2015</xref>). Homologs of PrgB have been identified in many other conjugative plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Järvå et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that PrgB-like proteins confer important roles in a large number of bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muscholl et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galli et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Waters and Dunny, 2001</xref>).</p><p>PrgB was initially identified as one of the driving forces in cellular aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Olmsted et al., 1991</xref>). To understand how it mediated this process, previous research has tried to identify the various protein domains that are present in PrgB and evaluate their function(s). Two RGD (Arg–Gly–Asp) motifs were identified (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and found to be important for vegetation and biofilm formation in the host tissue environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chuang-Smith et al., 2010</xref>). The N-terminal half of PrgB was found to be required for aggregation and to bind lipoteichoic acid (LTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Waters and Dunny, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waters et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Waters et al., 2004</xref>), which is a major constituent of the cell wall in Gram-positive bacteria. In 2018, we solved the structure of PrgB<sub>246–558</sub> and showed that it has a lectin-like fold that was most similar to adhesins from various oral Streptococci. As these adhesins are known to bind various polymers, we subsequently referred to PrgB<sub>246–558</sub> as the polymer adhesin domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Järvå et al., 2020</xref>). We have shown that this domain can bind both LTA and eDNA in a competitive manner. Bound eDNA is thereby strongly compacted as it is wrapped around the domain’s positively charged surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmitt et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore proposed that PrgB could use eDNA to promote cell-to-cell contacts, as an alternative to direct binding to the LTA from a recipient cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As all described polymer adhesin domains, PrgB has a central ridge with a conserved cation-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Järvå et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kohler et al., 2018</xref>). In the homologous GbpC, from <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, this site has been suggested to bind glucans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mieher et al., 2018</xref>). However, no interaction with glucans has been observed for PrgB or any other homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Forsgren et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the importance of this conserved motif remains an open question.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic overview of PrgB domain organization and function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Updated schematic overview of the domain organization of PrgB.

PrgB compacts the eDNA, and thereby likely pulls the recipient cells closer.

However, when we reanalyzed the PrgB sequence with the new structure-prediction tools that are available, such as AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>), it became clear that this model was partially incorrect. PrgB seems to consist of an N-terminal disordered region (residues 35–197), followed by a newly identified coiled-coil (COI) domain (residues 198–257), the previously crystallized polymer adhesin domain (residues 261–558), a linker region (residues 559–582), four immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (residues 583–1232), and finally the C-terminal disordered region containing the LPXTG motif (residues 1263–1305) that gets anchored to the cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The Ig-like domains seem to come in pairs of two slightly different structures, denoted as CSA1–CSC1 (first pair) and CSA2–CSC2 (second pair), as named in InterPro (CSA from IPR026345; adhesin isopeptide-forming adherence domain, and CSC from IPR032300; cell-surface antigen C-terminal). To verify this updated domain organization of PrgB, we set out to experimentally determine its structure using a combination of X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM methods.</p><p>As described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmitt et al., 2018</xref>, we were not able to produce full-length PrgB in <italic>E. coli</italic>, but instead produced and purified PrgB<sub>188–1233</sub>. This version of the protein only lacks the disordered N-terminal region and the LPXTG anchor and elutes from size exclusion chromatography in two peaks corresponding to dimeric and a monomeric PrgB. PrgB is in a monomer–dimer equilibrium and the dimer has been described as the main biologically functional unit in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koraimann, 2018</xref>). The monomeric fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) was successfully used for crystallization trials. Crystals belonging to space group P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> appeared after 8–12 weeks, diffracted to 1.85 Å and contained two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The crystallographic phase problem was solved using molecular replacement with SspB (PDB: 2WOY) as a search model. Surprisingly, the resulting electron density lacked the previously crystallized polymer adhesin domain of PrgB, and instead only contained residues 584–1233. There is also no space in the crystal packing to allow for a flexible polymer adhesin domain, so it was likely cleaved off in the crystallization drop before the crystals were formed. The modeled protein indeed consists of four Ig-like domains: two CSA and two CSC domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Previous bioinformatics analysis showed that various homologous adhesin proteins contain different numbers of Ig-like domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Järvå et al., 2020</xref>), but a DALI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holm, 2020</xref>) analysis of PrgB<sub>584–1233</sub> showed that there is no previously solved structure in the PDB that contains four of these Ig-domains coupled together. There are, however, homologous structures available with either two or three Ig-domains. The closest structural homologs are the C-terminal parts of Antigen I/II proteins from oral Streptococci, for example the surface protein AspA from <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hall et al., 2014</xref>) (PDB code: 4OFQ), which has three Ig-domains and a root mean square deviation(r.m.s.d.) to the Ig-like domains from PrgB of 3.2 Å over 337 residues, or the BspA protein from <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rego et al., 2016</xref>) (PDB code: 4ZLP) which has two Ig-domains and an r.m.s.d. of 3.3 Å over 334 residues (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> for an overview of the highest ranked DALI hits). The r.m.s.d. decreases to ca. 1 Å if the individual Ig-like domains are superimposed upon each other.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Structure of immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains of PrgB.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Ig-like domains are arranged as tandem pairs (CSA1–CSC1 and CSA2–CSC2).

However, we have not found any evidence that the Ig-like domains of PrgB bind to a specific substrate in our own experiments, nor have we found this in other reports. PrgB also does not contain a BAR domain, which is crucial for stable interactions between for example SspB from <italic>S. gordonni</italic> and Mfa-1 of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Purushotham and Deivanayagam, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daep et al., 2011</xref>). However, since Ig-like domains are known to bind a large variety of ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Halaby and Mornon, 1998</xref>), we do not exclude the possibility that ligands for the Ig-like domains in PrgB will be found in the future. The only ligands that have been verified to interact with PrgB so far are eDNA and LTA, which have high affinity to the polymer adhesin domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmitt et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The crystal structure of the Ig-like domains from PrgB, PrgB<sub>583–1233</sub> was complemented by single particle analysis of PrgB<sub>188–1233</sub> via cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Despite the low resolution of the EM volumes, we tried to dock in the high-resolution crystal structures of the Ig-like domains and the polymer adhesin domain. The model of PrgB from cryo-EM indicated that the polymer adhesin domain might interact with the Ig-like domains in the absence of substrate, which could have implications for the function or regulation of PrgB. To test this hypothesis, we assayed the interaction between the polymer adhesin domain and the separately purified Ig-like stalk domain in vitro. The results did not show any interaction between these domains. However, in the full-length protein these two domains are attached via a linker region, which make their local concentration very high. Thus, we cannot exclude that these two domains can interact, but in that case the dissociation constant must be high (at least high µM range) and the interaction is thus unlikely to be physiologically relevant.</p><p>We have now obtained a structural basis to interpret almost all phenotypic data that is available for PrgB. Unfortunately, most of the mutants that were previously described did not correlate well with the newly determined domain boundaries. Therefore, we decided to create specific deletion mutants that were based on the new PrgB structure to determine the role of the various domains. At the N-terminus of PrgB, before the polymer adhesin domain, there is a predicted COI region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that we wanted to investigate. To our surprise, the expression of PrgB<sub>ΔCOI</sub> could not rescue any of the aggregation, biofilm formation or conjugation phenotypes from a <italic>prgB</italic> deletion strain. However, in our experiments PrgB<sub>ΔCOI</sub> was unstable with substantially decreased amounts present in the cell-wall extract collected after overnight induction as compared to 1-hr induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the COI region is important for protein production and/or stability. In line with this hypothesis, AlphaFold predicts this COI domain to interact with the linker between the polymer adhesin domain and the Ig-like domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Since the linker region contains the sequence that PrgA recognizes for cleavage of PrgB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmitt et al., 2020</xref>), the lack of the COI domain and its potential shielding effect could explain the decreased stability of PrgB<sub>ΔCOI</sub>. Deletion of all Ig-like domains (PrgB<sub>ΔCSA1-ΔCSC2</sub>) renders the protein incapable to support aggregation, biofilm formation, and conjugation. However, exogenous expression of <italic>prgB</italic> with single Ig-like domain deletions, <italic>prgB</italic><sub>ΔCSA1</sub> and <italic>prgB</italic><sub>ΔCSC2</sub> in the pCF10Δ<italic>prgB</italic> background, restore cellular aggregation, while they do not rescue biofilm formation and conjugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This was unexpected, as the polymer adhesin domain is predicted to mediate all the functions that were tested in these assays: aggregation, biofilm formation and conjugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhatty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmitt et al., 2018</xref>). Our results, however, indicate that it is important to have all Ig-like domains present and properly folded. The cellular aggregation assays seem to indicate that PrgB can function when at least three Ig-like domains are present, as expression of both <italic>prgB</italic><sub>ΔCSA1</sub> and <italic>prgB</italic><sub>ΔCSC2</sub> can complement pCF10Δ<italic>prgB</italic>, but unfortunately this assay is not suitable to detect small changes. Based on the biofilm formation and conjugation efficiency assays, which are more sensitive, we therefore conclude that even removing a single Ig-like domain strongly decreases the function of PrgB. We hypothesize that these Ig-like domains are required to present the polymer adhesin domain at the right distance from the cell.</p><p>The conserved Ser–Asn–Glu site in the negatively charged cleft of the polymer adhesin domain intrigued us, as its function is unknown. Any changes that we made in these conserved residues resulted in PrgB variants that did not facilitate biofilm formation or conjugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Surprisingly the same PrgB variants did fully support cellular aggregation. This is thought-provoking, since various literature has shown that the PrgB functions in cellular aggregation, biofilm formation, and conjugation are strongly correlated. However, even a single-point mutation in this conserved site produced a PrgB variant that completely separates the cellular clumping phenotype from biofilm formation and conjugation. In vitro experiments showed that these point mutations did not impair PrgB binding to eDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). A similar phenotypic pattern was observed with PrgB<sub>ΔCSA1</sub> and PrgB<sub>ΔCSC2</sub>, which both could fully rescue aggregation but not biofilm formation. Our data therefore strongly indicate that PrgB has additional role(s), besides mediating cellular aggregation, to further support conjugation and biofilm formation. We therefore propose that PrgB performs at least one, currently unknown, additional function besides binding to eDNA and/or LTA from the cell wall of the recipient cell. It is highly likely that at least one of these additional functions is mediated by the conserved site in the polymer adhesin domain.</p><p>As described in the introduction, there is a plethora of <italic>prgB</italic> mutants made (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and phenotypically analyzed, predominantly by the group of Prof. Gary Dunny. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, we provide a summary of all <italic>prgB</italic> mutants that we have identified in the literature and our brief reinterpretation based on our new structural knowledge. Below, we will discuss a selected number of these mutants in detail.</p><p>As expected, most mutants that have an insertion or a mutation in the polymer adhesin domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) show a loss of protein function. Shortly, insertions at amino acids (a.a.) 358 and 359 are on the surface of the protein and likely leads to steric clashes that prevent the domain from binding to eDNA and LTA, whereas insertions at a.a. 439, 473, 517, and 546 are all in secondary structures that are central parts of the polymer adhesin domain and therefore are likely to disrupt folding of this domain.</p><p>The RGD motifs in PrgB were previously proposed to be involved in integrin binding and to promote adherence to human neutrophils, as well as internalization in cultured intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vanek et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olmsted et al., 1994</xref>).

The structure that we determined shows that these two sequence motifs are not surface exposed, but instead play an important role in the structural integrity of the interfaces between CSA1 and CSC1, and between CSA2 and CSC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Mutations in these motifs would thus very likely destabilize the folding of the tandem Ig-domains, which would explain the decreased PrgB biofilm formation observed in these strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chuang-Smith et al., 2010</xref>).

Therefore, we were surprised to find that this mutant was described to behave like wild type in aggregation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Waters et al., 2004</xref>). Possibly the remaining parts of CSA2 and CSC2 form a (unfolded) linker region of similar length to the tandem CSA2–CSC2 structure, which allows PrgB to retain its function of promoting aggregation. Similarly, PrgB<sub>Δ668–1138</sub>, corresponding to a complete removal of CSC1 and CSA2 and approximately half of both CSA1 and CSC2 domains, could still support PrgB-mediated aggregation. Potentially the remaining residues (ca. 180 amino acids) could also form an unfolded linker region allowing for the variant to retain its aggregation phenotype. For PrgB<sub>Δ993–1138</sub> and PrgB<sub>Δ668–1138</sub>, unfortunately no biofilm formation or conjugation efficiency were reported, but based on our results it is likely that those capabilities would have been severely compromised.</p><p>Taking past and present results into account combined with our new structural insights, we propose a new mechanistic model for the function of PrgB. Our in vivo data show that removal of one of the Ig-like domains does not largely affect PrgB function. Previous data also indicate that parts of the Ig-like domains can be deleted without affecting the function of PrgB. We therefore hypothesize that the Ig-like domains provide two important features to the protein. First, a rigid stalk that is needed to present the polymer adhesin domain at the correct distance from the cell wall. Second, providing the correct structural positioning for PrgA-mediated cleavage of the polymer adhesin domain, as the potential protease domain in PrgA is also presented away from the cell on a ~40-nm long stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmitt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Järvå et al., 2020</xref>). The exact distance of the polymer adhesin domain from the cell wall does not seem important for LTA binding, since aggregation can still take place even with partially disrupted Ig-like domains. However, the length of the stalk may be very important when it comes to facilitating both biofilm formation and conjugation. This indicates that effective mating-pair formation in conjugation may require a PrgB-mediated function distinct from pure aggregation, something that is further shown by the findings of the mutations in the conserved site in the polymer adhesin domain.</p><p>Besides providing a structural basis to explain about 30 years of work on PrgB, we here also uncovered that the conserved Ser–Asn–Glu site in the polymer adhesin domain likely provides additional functionality to PrgB that is needed for optimal biofilm formation and conjugation, but that does not affect cellular aggregation. To fully investigate the function of this conserved site in PrgB and other homologous virulence factors from Gram-positive bacteria, remains an exciting question to address in future research.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for a full list of all strains, plasmids, and oligonucleotides used. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Top10 was used in molecular cloning and grown in Lysogeny broth (LB). <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) was used for recombinant protein expression and grown in Terrific Broth (TB).

Though they were successful in their crystallization endeavors, the crystal contained only what was previously thought to be two domains with RGD motifs. The authors' high-resolution structure shows that in fact the C-terminal portion of PrgB is made up of four immunoglobulin-like domains. The authors then set out to collect single-particle cryoEM data in a bid to obtain a full-length structure of PrgB, both in the presence and absence of ssDNA. The authors were only able to obtain quite low-resolution data, which they fit their crystal structures into. The authors then used these structures to inform the design of novel deletion mutants and point mutations, as well as to rationalize years of phenotypic data from other published mutants.</p><p>The X-ray crystallographic structure is beautiful and in combination with their in vivo data allowed them to propose a model where PrgB positions cells at an appropriate distance for conjugation. The in vivo experiments appear to be done well and the authors' discovery that the Ser-Asn-Glu is not important for generalized aggregation but has an additional yet unknown role in conjugation and biofilm formation is exciting and well supported by their data.</p><p>[Editors' note: In response to reviews of a previous version of this manuscript, the authors have carried out additional experiments that have strengthened the already convincing aspects of the work. We commend the authors for responding to questions raised by the reviewers about the inference of interactions of in vivo importance inferred from low-resolution cryo-EM studies by carrying out and reporting on additional experiments that fail to confirm their initial speculative model. The current work is stronger and more convincing as a result.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84427.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Wei-Sheng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05kb8h459</institution-id><institution>Umeå University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Umeå</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lassinantti</surname><given-names>Lena</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05kb8h459</institution-id><institution>Umeå University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Umeå</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Järvå</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05kb8h459</institution-id><institution>Umeå University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Umeå</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schmitt</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05kb8h459</institution-id><institution>Umeå University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Umeå</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>ter Beek</surname><given-names>Josy</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Umeå University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Groningen</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Berntsson</surname><given-names>Ronnie P-A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05kb8h459</institution-id><institution>Umeå University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Umeå</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>First of all, we would like to again thank the reviewers for their work. We appreciate the constructive review comments and useful suggestions to further improve our article. With those comments in mind, we have now revised our manuscript. Please see below for a point-by-point response (our responses in green) to all comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Sun and colleagues outline structural and mechanistic studies of the bacterial adhesin PrgB, an atypical microbial cell surface-anchored polypeptide that binds DNA. The manuscript includes a crystal structure of the Ig-like domains of PrgB, cryo-EM structures of the majority of the intact polypeptide in DNA-bound and free forms, and an assessment of the phenotypes of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strains expressing various PrgB mutants.</p><p>Generally, the study has been conducted with a good level of rigor, and there is consistency in the findings. However, I do have some specific technical concerns relating to the study that necessitate the undertaking of additional experiments. These are summarized as follows:</p><p>1. Recombinant PrgB188-1233 produced in the study purifies as a mixture of monomeric and dimeric species separatable by SEC. There is very limited discussion in the text re. the significance and/or implications of this. Is it feasible that the dimeric form is biologically relevant in the context of the in vivo situation? Or alternatively, is this simply an artifact of protein production?</p></disp-quote><p>Experimental data that we published in 2018 indeed indicates that the dimer is relevant in the in vivo situation. We did not discuss this here since this was discussed in detail in the previous paper: Schmitt et al, 2018. We have now added a bit more information on this in the results section, highlighting this, so that it is clearer to the reader (lines 114-116).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors see no evidence of the adhesive domain of PrgB in their PX structure highlighting that this must have been cleaved during crystallisation. Is this claim supported by an inspection of the crystal packing? It could be that this region of the protein is dynamic within the context of the crystal and is thus not observed. This should be clarified in the text either way.</p></disp-quote><p>The crystal packing does not provide any space for the PAD. We have added this to the results section. We have added a sentence describing this in lines 122-124.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The Cryo-EM structures reported are both at ~10-angstrom resolution. Are the authors truly confident in the placement of their crystal structures on these maps? Visual inspection indicates that their positioning of the PrgB domains into the EM envelopes is somewhat questionable. The authors need to provide some quantitative measures of the quality of their domain fitting. The narrative of the manuscript very much hinges on this being correct.</p></disp-quote><p>This is something that the other reviewer also commented on. The fitting of the crystal structures in the maps are indeed not optimal, but was the best we could do with the available data. In line with point #6, we have now constructed new protein variants of the stalk domain (the four Ig-like domains) alone, and have assayed it’s interaction with the PAD in vitro using native gels and size exclusion chromatography. The outcome of these experiments is that the two domains do not interact in any substantial way on their own. Thus, the added experiments do not support the hypothesis that the PAD interacts with the Ig-like domains, at least not without the local high concentration provided by the linker region in the in vivo situation.</p><p>To account for these new experiments, we have moved the cryo-EM structure to the supplement, and rewritten this part of the manuscript to say that the cryo-EM data indicated that there might be an interaction, but that we have not been able to verify this in vitro, indicating that if the interaction at all exists it must have a low affinity and is likely not physiologically relevant. In line with this, we have also further modified the text throughout the manuscript to account for this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The manuscript would be significantly strengthened if the authors could include confirmatory hydrodynamic data in support of the observed conformational reorganization of PrgB in the presence of DNA. SAXS analysis of the DNA-free and bound complexes would be ideal for this and would also help address the issues raised above in pt 3.</p></disp-quote><p>To analyze PrgB radius with and without DNA, we tried both SEC-MALS and DLS experiments. It proved difficult to obtain precise and reproducible values, but the initial data indicated that no large changes were observed upon DNA binding. As we could also not measure specific interaction between the PAD and the stalk in vitro, we did not perform SAXS experiments. As mentioned in the response to point #3, we have modified the results and discussion regarding the potential interaction of th PAD and Stalk domains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors present binding studies of various PrgB mutant-expressing strains. A number of the mutations generated delete significant portions of the polypeptide. Can the authors confirm that these mutant proteins are correctly folded despite the introduced mutations? It could be that loss of function is simply a consequence of mutation-induced misfolding. I would like to see some confirmatory data (CD, SEC, etc.) in support of the foldedness of the mutant proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot completely rule out that the folding of some of the variants is affected in <italic>E. faecalis</italic>. However, CD or SEC experiments would only give indications of the contrary if the overall fold had been majorly affected in an in vitro situation where the protein is not anchored to the <italic>E. faecalis</italic> cell wall.</p><p>To alleviate this valid concern, we probed if all variants are correctly exported and linked to the cell-wall. Therefore we have now extracted the cell wall of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> producing wild-type or variant PrgB and performed Western blot . The results of the Western blot with cell wall extract largely matches the whole cell experiments that were in the initial manuscript. If a protein variant was largely misfolded, it would likely not be targeted and linked to the cell-wall, nor would it be stable in vivo. We have added this new data as a new fig 3 – figure supplement 1 and on lines 201-214</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors suggest a direct interaction between the PAD and the stalk domains in PrgB. The discussion of this is very generic and no evidence to support this is provided other than the 10-angstrom resolution EM map. If they believe this to be the case, then additional evidence should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Answer: As mentioned previously, we have now performed additional in vitro experiments to probe this potential interaction, but conclude that this indication from the EM data is likely not a real high affinity interaction. In line with this, we have modified the results and discussion regarding this point, see also response to point #3 and 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>As currently presented, I don't feel that the cryoEM data support the authors' proposed model, largely because the fit of the crystal structures to the EM volumes does not seem entirely reasonable for the apo- dataset and because the EM volume for the ssDNA bound dataset is not even contiguous. For me to believe the model as it is currently built, I would want to see a dataset with the PAD deleted, showing that its proposed density disappears, or a dataset with a PAD-specific antibody as a fiducial marker. It would be nice to see some goodness of fit metric with a comparison to other crystal structures fit such low-resolution data as well. At the very least, the authors must include the standard cryoEM workflow supplementary figure showing representative micrographs, 2Ds, and 3Ds along with particle numbers.</p></disp-quote><p>In line with the comments raised by reviewer #1, we have now added more experiments where we have analyzed the potential interaction between PAD and the stalk domain. From this new data, it looks like they do not interact with any substantial affinity, at least not on their own without any linker region holding them together, and that this interaction if it all exist likely is not physiologically relevant. The cryo-EM data has been moved to the supplement as we agree with both reviewers that the resolution, and the fitted model, is not good enough to draw any hard conclusions. The standard table for the cryoEM workflow was present as supplementary table 2, where eg particle numbers etc are described, but we have now also added a new supplementary fig 2 – figure supplement 2 that shows the EM processing workflow, including representative micrographs, 2D and 3D classes. We debated whether we should remove the EM data, but decided against it in line of transparency and to explain why the interaction studies with the PAD and stalk domains were performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The X-ray crystallographic structure is very nice, but I was a bit surprised by the R factors in Table 1. After downloading the structure factors and coordinates from the PDB (thank you for depositing before submission!) I was able to see quite a few positive peaks in the difference map that could probably use some cleaning up. I realize I may just be a bit of a masochist when it comes to adding/deleting waters and moving around side chains to get things just right, but for such lovely data, I would have liked to see the model polished up a bit more. I was going to say that the isopeptide bond should be modelled, but I can see from a cursory Google that the authors did in fact try to find a way to model this and that it is indeed a bit of a pain.</p></disp-quote><p>The model refinement proved surprisingly recalcitrant with regards to the remaining difference density, so we took the decision to only model what was solidly there (which leads to slightly higher R factors). We did indeed try to model the isopeptide bond, but we did not find a good way to do so (despite trying quite extensively), and ended up determining them as a linker in the PDB file, so that the bond shows up when one opens the structure in eg. Pymol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For protein production/purification in general I would have liked to see actual traces for the gel filtration and pure protein on a gel in a supplementary figure. I strongly believe that this type of information is so critical for future researchers looking to replicate or build upon published work so that they have some sense that what they are doing is working in the way it should be.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a supplementary figure (as new Fig. 1 – figure supplement 1) that shows SEC and SDS-PAGE for the purification of PrgB188-1233.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, I think for the in vivo data it only makes sense to show the reader whether any or all the differences measured across your different mutants are statistically significant. Having done the graphing and analysis in GraphPad this should be a simple thing to achieve.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added statistical test (One way Anova) that show the statistical significance between the mutants, and show that in Fig 3 and Fig 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, I think it's a very nice paper and while I feel that the cryoEM data in its current form doesn't support the model of occlusion from PrgA, I also don't think that removing the cryoEM data and that specific mechanistic idea from the paper detracts from its overall message and impact.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for those comments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
