Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions, repetitive movements, and abnormal fixed postures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albanese et al., 2013</xref>). While PD is characterized as a collection of hypokinetic syndromes (apart from tremor and levodopa-induced dyskinesias), dystonia is considered a hyperkinetic movement disorder.</p><p>The dichotomy between the hypo- versus hyperkinetic nature of PD and dystonia, respectively, is thought to be reflected in the underlying basal ganglia pathophysiology. In particular, basal ganglia circuitry that involves ‘direct’ (D1-mediated striatal projections to the internal globus pallidus [GPi]) and ‘indirect’ (D2-mediated striatal projections via the external globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus to GPi) pathways has been implicated in these disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeLong and Wichmann, 2007</xref>). In PD, activity in the indirect pathway is upregulated while the direct pathway is downregulated, both of which converge toward increased GPi-mediated inhibition of thalamocortical motor networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeLong, 1990</xref>). Conversely, dystonia has been hypothesized to occur as a result of hypofunctional indirect pathway activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Naumann et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simonyan et al., 2013</xref>) and/or hyperfunctional direct pathway activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simonyan et al., 2017</xref>), producing decreased GPi-mediated inhibition of thalamocortical motor networks. These circuit differences would thereby result in increased GPi firing rates (FRs) in PD and decreased rates in dystonia, which has been substantiated by some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Starr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2007</xref>) but not all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hutchison et al., 2003</xref>) human single-neuron studies. In addition to potential differences in single-neuron firing properties, each of the disorders has been associated with aberrant synchronization at the neural aggregate level; namely, increased beta (13–30 Hz) and theta (4–12 Hz) local field potential (LFP) oscillations in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neumann et al., 2016</xref>) and dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neumann et al., 2017</xref>), respectively.</p><p>Despite opposing neurocircuit pathologies, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the GPi is a widely used treatment for the motor symptoms of both PD and dystonia. However, the timescales of symptomatic improvement after GPi-DBS and the reappearance of symptoms upon stimulation cessation are markedly longer in dystonia (minutes–hours–days) compared to PD (seconds–minutes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stefani et al., 2019</xref>). These differences in timescales may be the result of disease-specific dynamics of various forms of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ruge et al., 2011a</xref>). Intriguingly, high-frequency GPi stimulation has been shown to induce synaptic depression of inhibitory striato-pallidal (GPi) projections during stimulation (short-term plasticity effects), followed by an enduring potentiation of these projections after stimulation cessation (long-term plasticity-like effects) in both patients with PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Milosevic et al., 2019</xref>) and dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). However, the dynamics of these plastic effects have not been directly compared between disorders.</p><p>In this work, we compared GPi single-neuron activities (rate and oscillation -based features) between PD and dystonia, and investigated the relationships between electrophysiological features and disease severity. Moreover, we investigated differences in the dynamics of short- and long-term plasticity of the direct pathway projections.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patients and clinical scores</title><p>For the single-neuron feature analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), data were collected from 19 patients with non-genetic dystonia (135 included segments; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for information on subtypes) and 44 patients with PD (222 segments) during awake microelectrode-guided GPi-DBS surgeries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hutchison et al., 1994</xref>) after overnight withdrawal of anti-Parkinsonian medications in patients with PD. Corresponding preoperative clinical scores for PD using the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRSIII) and dystonia using either the Burke–Fahn–Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) or the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) were also amalgamated for each patient. Given that UPDRSIII includes both hypokinetic and hyperkinetic symptoms of PD, we further sought to disaggregate the score by only considering items 23–26 in UPDRSIII, which assess hypokinetic symptoms of PD. To enable comparison across different dystonia scales, clinical scores were normalized (0–100%) with respect to the maximum severity per scale (108 for total UPDRSIII, 32 for hypokinetic only UPDRSIII, 85 for TWSTRS, and 120 for BFMDRS). For plasticity analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), data were collected from a subset of 8 patients with dystonia (12 recording sites) and 10 patients with PD (13 recording sites).

For long-term plasticity analyses, the median normalized fEP amplitudes pre- versus post-HFS at each recording site were analyzed using a linear mixed model (LMM), with patient ID as a random factor, normalized fEP amplitudes as the response variable, and epoch as a fixed effect, to establish whether plasticity was elicited in each disorder. The percentage change from pre- to post-HFS was also compared across disorders using an LMM with patient ID as a random factor. For short-term plasticity analysis, the dynamic change of the first five fEP amplitudes during the first train of HFS was assessed, normalized with respect to the first fEP amplitude for each train.

In particular, we found that GPi neurons exhibited lower FRs, but greater burstiness and variability in dystonia compared to PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While no differences were found in the power of spiketrain oscillations across disorders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we found that PD symptom severity positively correlated with the power of low-beta frequency spiketrain oscillations, whereas dystonia symptom severity positively correlated with the power of theta frequency spiketrain oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Dystonia symptom severity moreover correlated negatively with FR and positively with neuronal variability. These results are discussed in greater detail with respect to previous literature in the section ‘Neuronal correlates of PD and dystonia’. In response to electrical stimulation (protocol depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we found significant increases in the amplitudes of positive-going stimulation-evoked field potential amplitudes (considered to reflect striato-pallidal synaptic strength, as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) before versus after HFS in both PD and dystonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), with recording sites in PD exhibiting significantly greater increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). While changes to evoked potential amplitude before versus after stimulation can be considered to be reflective of long-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Milosevic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Milosevic et al., 2018</xref>), the dynamics of evoked potentials during HFS (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) can be considered reflective of short-term synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Milosevic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steiner et al., 2022</xref>). To this end, our findings are suggestive of faster latency synaptic depression in PD compared to dystonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F/G</xref>). Plasticity findings are discussed in greater detail in thesection ‘Direct pathway plasticity’.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Neuronal correlates of PD and dystonia</title><p>The basal ganglia circuit models of PD and dystonia have been suggested to be driven by an imbalance between direct and indirect pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hallett, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hallett, 1993</xref>). While hyperfunctionality of the indirect pathway and hypofunctionality of the direct pathway are associated with PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McGregor and Nelson, 2019</xref>), the direct pathway has been suggested to be hyperfunctional in dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simonyan et al., 2017</xref>). To this end, our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) of lower FRs in dystonia compared to PD may further substantiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Starr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2007</xref>) such claims, whereby greater inhibition of GPi would produce decreased inhibitory output, and thus under-inhibition of thalamocortical motor networks, giving rise to hyperkinetic motor symptoms, whereas the opposite would be true in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeLong and Wichmann, 2007</xref>). These claims are further substantiated by findings of an inverse relationship between FR and disease severity in dystonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; rate-based features), although the opposite was not found in PD. Despite the lack of correlations with FR in PD, our findings seem to align with those of Muralidharan and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Muralidharan et al., 2016</xref>), who showed that GPi neuronal FRs may not directly correlate with motor severity but exhibit variability across the disease severity continuum in Parkinsonian non-human primates (initially increasing, then decreasing, then increasing again at mild, moderate, and severe disease manifestations, respectively). Thus, while GPi discharge rates may change in PD, such changes may not be reflected by linear relationships with motor sign development and progression. Indeed, variability in spike FRs in PD may be reflected in the considerable overlap in spiking activity between PD and dystonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), with many dystonia patients exhibiting higher discharge rates compared to patients with PD. While differences in discharge rates were nevertheless observed between PD and dystonia, it may be that the combination of rate and pattern (reflected in the BI and CV) changes best differentiates the two disorders.</p><p>From a neural synchronization standpoint, we recently showed that pathological oscillations at the neural aggregate/LFP level are likely encoded by periodic oscillations in the FRs of single neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scherer et al., 2022</xref>). In the current work, we did not find significant differences in the power of spiketrain oscillations across disorders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although previous research has reported differences in the LFP power between PD and dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Silberstein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), a study in non-human primates found no such differences in single-neuron oscillatory strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Starr et al., 2005</xref>), as reflected in our findings. However, despite a lack of difference in overall power across disorders, we were able to derive disease/frequency-specific relationships with respect to clinical scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; oscillatory features). In particular, we provided evidence of relationships between the power of spiketrain oscillations in the theta and low-beta frequency bands and the severity of motor symptoms in dystonia and PD, respectively, providing a cellular-level validation of previous frequency-specific LFP clinical correlation studies in people with PD (beta oscillations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neumann et al., 2016</xref>) and dystonia (theta oscillations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neumann et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, Muralidharan and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Muralidharan et al., 2016</xref>) also showed linear group-level relationships between low-beta frequency spiketrain oscillations and disease severity in Parkinsonian non-human primates, despite the lack of linear relationships with spike discharge rates (as discussed above).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Direct pathway plasticity</title><p>We have previously shown that the amplitude of positive-going inhibitory fEPs is directly associated with the duration of neuronal inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Milosevic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Steiner et al., 2021</xref>, thus serving as a viable substrate of inhibitory synaptic transmission efficacy. These observations are supported by work in animals demonstrating the reversal of both positive-going extracellular fields and neuronal inhibition with the application of GABA antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoshida and Precht, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Precht and Yoshida, 1971</xref>). Importantly, we previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Steiner et al., 2021</xref> demonstrated that low-latency inhibitory fields recorded in the subthalamic nucleus (GPe-mediated) are far smaller in amplitude and are resilient during HFS (i.e., minimal synaptic depression), whereas high-latency inhibitory fields recorded in substantia nigra pars reticulata and GPi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) (striatum-mediated) are far larger in amplitude and are subject to potent synaptic depression during HFS, thus, enabling electrophysiological discernment of these distinct inhibitory projections in humans.</p><p>To this effect, our findings may suggest disease-specific differences in mechanisms underlying both short- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prescott et al., 2013</xref>) and long-term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ueki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tamura et al., 2009</xref>) forms of synaptic plasticity of direct pathway projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Converging evidence from past animal and human studies suggests that dystonia is associated with impaired synaptic function and abnormal synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Udupa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peterson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Quartarone and Pisani, 2011</xref>). Compared to healthy controls, it has been shown that transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor-evoked potentials are hyperexcitable in dystonia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Siebner et al., 1999</xref>, and somatosensory and motor cortical plasticity is greater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tamura et al., 2009</xref>). Likewise, enhanced long-term potentiation at cortico-striatal synapses has been shown in rodent models of dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Köhling et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martella et al., 2009</xref>). While our finding that long-term potentiation effects are greater in PD compared to dystonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) is difficult to corroborate with this literature, one potential explanation can be that all of our patients with PD are long-term users of levodopa. We have previously shown that the intake of this antiparkinsonian dopaminergic medication leads to potent increases in the magnitude of direct pathway plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Milosevic et al., 2019</xref>). Although patients are 12 hr withdrawn from anti-Parkinsonian medications for surgery, it could be that striato-pallidal synapses are nevertheless chronically over-sensitized from prolonged use of dopaminergic medication, which is a well-known hypothesis related to the manifestation of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (a hyperkinetic feature) in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calabresi et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, a lack of depotentiation of striato-pallidal projections has previously been observed in patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prescott et al., 2014</xref>). As such, excessive plasticity of these projections may corroborate hyperkinetic features of dystonia and levodopa-induced dyskinesias in PD.</p><p>In addition, the variation in the modulation of these striato-pallidal projections to electrical stimulation may also be reflective of differences in the mechanism by which DBS operates across PD and dystonia, despite a common stimulation target. Clinical studies in dystonia have shown that DBS leads to a more rapid improvement in the transient, dynamic muscle contractions (phasic components) of the disorder compared to the sustained, continuous muscle contractions (tonic or fixed components) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krauss, 2002</xref>). The early improvement of the phasic component has been suggested to be associated with direct suppression of abnormal activity in the GPi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barow et al., 2014</xref>), whereas the improvement of tonic components has been associated with long-term potentiation-like synaptic plasticity in TMS studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ruge et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ruge et al., 2011b</xref>). This contrasts with PD, where the maximal clinical response to DBS occurs within a much faster time course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stefani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hammond et al., 2007</xref>). The present study shows disease-specific differences in the dynamics associated with modulation of direct pathway projections, thus, potentially providing a local synaptic rationale for the differential time courses associated with the clinical effects of DBS in the same target. Specifically, we found faster rates of synaptic depression during HFS and greater post-HFS long-term plasticity-like effects in PD compared to dystonia, implying that striato-pallidal synapses in dystonia are perhaps more resistant to change compared to PD. Our findings may therefore explain the phenomenon that functional benefits of DBS require longer time courses in dystonia if the effects of DBS rely upon network reorganization, which involves adjustments in neural connectivity or synaptic efficacy in response to stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ruge et al., 2011b</xref>). Indeed, the benefits of GPi-DBS in dystonia have also been shown to persist for long periods of time even after the cessation of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ruge et al., 2011a</xref>). In PD, washout effects take longer with GPi-DBS compared to STN-DBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Follett et al., 2010</xref>), and long-term dyskinesia reduction has also been observed with GPi-DBS even when DBS is off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bejjani et al., 2000</xref>). While further work is certainly required to better understand disease-related differences in plasticity, our findings may nevertheless motivate the development of periodic intermittent (ON/OFF) DBS strategies that periodically modulate synaptic plasticity for therapeutic benefits that outlast stimulation delivery as have recently been employed in preclinical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spix et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mastro et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>Important limitations of intraoperative/intracranial studies in humans include a lack of access to healthy control data (hence comparison across disorders), the inability to use pharmacological interventions to verify pathway specificity of elicited responses, and time constraints preventing thorough scrutinization of time courses of long-term plasticity-like effects. Indeed, GPi receives the greatest abundance of inhibitory inputs from striatum (direct pathway), but also it also receives inhibitory inputs by way of GPe (indirect pathway). Although we can functionally disaggregate these pathway-specific responses based on the differences in morphology and dynamics of GPe-mediated versus striatum-mediated inhibitory fEPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steiner et al., 2022</xref>), the possibility of compounded effects cannot be completely ruled out. While our neuronal investigations provide cellular-level support for closed-loop targeting of disease-related neural oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Little et al., 2016</xref>), future applications of DBS may also benefit from closed-loop tuning of basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit dynamics and plasticity through chronic monitoring of evoked potential responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Versantvoort et al., 2024</xref>). Indeed, optogenetic studies in Parkinsonian rodents have demonstrated the ability to achieve lasting therapeutic efficacy via periodic activations of striatal direct pathway projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spix et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mastro et al., 2017</xref>), likely leveraging long-term plasticity-like mechanisms. An additional limitation of this study is that we did not stringently monitor personal medication intake or levels of intraoperative sedation; however, all patients with PD were asked to withdraw from medications the night before surgery, and the analyses only included patients operated on awake. It is important to consider that classifications of PD and dystonia as hypo- and hyperkinetic disorders can be considered oversimplifications as there can be contradictory comorbidities and drug- and DBS-related effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reese et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Esposito et al., 2017</xref>), though our results do not change substantially when only hypokinetic PD features are considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, our analyses involved pooling of patients with various forms of dystonia. While we did not observe differences across dystonia subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), future studies in larger patient cohorts are warranted. Finally, as many findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> do not survive corrections for multiple comparisons, we suggest interpretation of results with caution. Despite this, many of our findings related to neuronal correlates are generally in line with previous literature, especially related to oscillatory correlates of PD and dystonia.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We substantiated claims of hypo- versus hyperfunctional GPi output in PD and dystonia, while furthermore providing cellular-level validation of the pathological nature of theta and low-beta oscillations in respective disorders.

Their data in my view emphasize this somewhat emphatically. Most patients with the 'hypokinetic' movement disorder PD have dystonia as a part of their motor features. Dystonia is a form of excessive muscle activation that on the one hand is 'hyperkinetic' but on the other usually decreases the speed of motor tasks, even in patients with primary dystonia. Similarly, PD patients display a bewildering variety of hyperkinetic manifestations as well (rest tremor, dystonia, dyskinesia). If these are truly independent classifications, i.e. hyper- versus hypo-kinetic, the authors must acknowledge that there is considerable overlap in the spike activity across groups - numerous dystonia patients display higher discharge rates than the majority of the PD sample. Based on the firing rate alone, it would not be possible to distinguish these groups.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful comments regarding the discussion of the rate model and the distinction between hyperkinetic and hypokinetic movement disorders. We acknowledge that the rate model, primarily derived from limited number of animal subjects [1], may not fully encapsulate the complexities of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia. Our study aimed to validate animal model findings in humans by correlating single-neuron features with disease symptom severity. However, we concur with the Reviewer’s comment regarding the overlapping motor features in hypokinetic and hyperkinetic disorders. We can speculate that the overlap in neuronal properties may be reflected in the overlap of, for example, hyperkinetic features being also present in PD, as suggested by the Reviewer. Per the Reviewer’s request, we have now acknowledged this notion in the manuscript. Interestingly, hypokinetic symptoms have been reported to occur in dystonia in response to GPi-stimulation and have been associated with beta activity in the LFP [2], which reinforces the notion that neural activity may be more related to specific symptoms rather than diseases as a whole. Supplementing our analyses, in addition to total UPDRSIII scores, we have now provided correlations with only hypokinetic (i.e. bradykinesia) subscores of the UPDRSIII to focus on more direct assessment of hypokinetic features in PD versus hyperkinetic features in dystonia. We have updated our methods and results accordingly.</p><p>[1] M. R.

One would have predicted greater beta power in PD than in primary dystonia. This should be discussed explicitly and an interpretation should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that considering the previous LFP literature, one might have expected a difference in single-neuron oscillation power between PD and dystonia. However, while prior studies [3], [4] have reported significant differences in oscillatory power between the two diseases, researchers examined local field potential (LFP) activity only. Other work [5] in non-human primates investigated single-neuron oscillations and reported no differences between PD and dystonia at the single-neuron level, in line with our findings. However, despite the lack of difference in overall power presented here, we provide evidence that the strength of the beta-frequency single-neuron oscillations nevertheless correlates with symptom severity in PD but not dystonia; whereas the strength of the theta-frequency single-neuron oscillations correlates with symptom severity in dystonia but not PD.</p><p>[3] P.

However, despite a lack of difference in overall power across disorders, we were able to derive disease/frequency-specific relationships with respect to clinical scores (Fig. 1C; oscillatory features).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The study lacks a healthy control group, making it challenging to differentiate disease-specific findings from normal variations in GPi activity and plasticity. Although this is acknowledged in the discussion, this complicates the interpretation of the results. The sample sizes for PD and dystonia patients are relatively small, and the study combines various forms of dystonia, potentially masking subtype-specific differences. A larger and more homogenous sample could enhance the study's reliability.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, intraoperative microelectrode recordings cannot be obtained in healthy individuals. We agree with the Reviewer that this limits the interpretation of the data. However, directly comparing clinical correlations with single neuron readouts between two distinct clinical entities may, to some degree, compensate for the lack of healthy control data. This contrast, while not providing a healthy control, is still able to point to disease-specific differences. This approach has previously been used to comparisons at the LFP level [6]. While the sample size is indeed small, it is comparable or even higher to similar studies that have investigated the relation of symptom severity of single neuron readouts [7]. The Reviewer is right in that we do not differentiate between generalized or cervical dystonia. We chose to do so because our subgroup analysis provided in the Supplementary Material did not suggest specific differences; though there is insufficient data from specific dystonia subtypes to make formal statistical comparisons. Indeed, future studies should investigate specific subtypes further.</p><p>[6] R.

Our finding that striato-pallidal plasticity decays more slowly in dystonia compared to PD may relate to the slower time course of symptom relief associated with GPi-DBS in dystonia, as presently outlined in the discussion. On the other hand, symptoms are also suppressed for longer after the cessation of stimulation in dystonia compared to PD, which may reflect long-term plastic changes [8], [9]. In the context of clinical DBS, plasticity modulation may be facilitated by intermittent stimulation algorithms that may achieve the necessary plastic network change by applying stimulation for a defined time but could then be switched off for improved energy consumption and perhaps as a means of mitigating side effects. DBS devices with chronic sensing may enable monitoring of evoked potential amplitudes for future adaptive stimulation applications; however, currently available devices are limited by low sampling rates, but future devices may overcome these technical limitations.</p><p>[8] D.

In response to the concerns regarding the statistical methods, we have expanded our analysis to provide a more comprehensive statistical overview. Specifically, we implemented the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons across each of the seven tests conducted for the differences in single-neuron features between PD and dystonia. The adjustment revealed that only the burst index and coefficient of variation retain statistical significance after post hoc correction, while the firing rate does not. Results of the Bonferroni corrections are now presented in Supplementary Table 3. Reflecting on the initial comment about firing rates between the two disorders, our updated findings underscore the limitation of using firing rates alone to differentiate between PD and dystonia, and instead, our analysis now points to burstiness and firing irregularity as more reliable discriminators. Regarding the clinical correlations, we refined our statistical analysis by employing nonparametric Monte Carlo permutation tests with 5000 permutations, as used in recent work [10], [11]. This method is chosen for its independence from assumptions regarding data distribution. Specifically, we computed and tested the Spearman rho for significance using the permutation test. Then, to address multiple comparisons, we controlled the false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Results of these comparisons are now presented in Supplementary Table 4. Lastly, to address the concern regarding recording site independence within patients, we updated our plasticity analysis methodology. In our study, 6 out of 18 patients had multiple recording sites. Thus, to account for this, we employed linear mixed models (LMM) with patient ID as a random factor to appropriately account for the non-independence of these observations.</p><p>[10] v Lofredi et al., “Dopamine-dependent scaling of subthalamic gamma bursts with movement velocity in patients with Parkinson’s disease,” Elife, vol. 7, p. e31895, Feb. 2018, doi: 10.7554/eLife.31895.</p><p>[11] R.

We have enhanced the manuscript by integrating additional discussions on previous studies related to plasticity in dystonia and PD (e.g., [12], [13]), which highlight excessive plasticity in dystonia.

While no differences were found in the power of spiketrain oscillations across disorders (Fig. 1B), we found that PD symptom severity positively correlated with the power of low-beta frequency spiketrain oscillations, whereas dystonia symptom severity positively correlated with the power of theta frequency spiketrain oscillations (Fig. 1C). Dystonia symptom severity moreover correlated negatively with firing rate, and positively with neuronal variability. These results are discussed in greater detail with respect to previous literature in the subsequent Discussion section entitled “Neuronal correlates of PD and dystonia.” In response to electrical stimulation (protocol depicted in Fig. 2A), we found significant increases in the amplitudes of positive-going stimulation-evoked field potential amplitudes (considered to reflect striato-pallidal synaptic strength; as exemplified in Fig. 2B) before versus after HFS in both PD and dystonia (Fig. 2C); with recording sites in PD exhibiting significantly greater increases (Fig. 2D). While changes to evoked potential amplitude before versus after stimulation can be considered to be reflective of long-term plasticity [15,18], the dynamics of evoked potentials during HFS (as depicted in Fig. 2E) can be considered as reflective of short-term synaptic plasticity [18,21]. To this end, our findings are suggestive of faster latency synaptic depression in PD compared to dystonia (Fig. 2F/G). Plasticity findings are discussed in greater detail in the Discussion section entitled “Direct pathway plasticity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, I felt that more discussion could be used to highlight the significance of the current results by comparing and/or contrasting them to prior relevant work and mechanisms. The novelty or impact is not very clear as written. Could this be further substantiated in the Discussion?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the feedback. The discussion has been expanded to include additional literature that is relevant to the findings reported in the manuscript. For example, with regards to the neuronal correlates sub-section, we now highlight the important findings [15] that show changes to the discharge rates and oscillatory tendencies of GPi neurons in non-human primates in response to staged MPTP applications to progressively titrate motor severity; these results substantiate our lack of correlation with firing rates in PD, and presence of a clinical correlation with beta oscillations. We additionally now emphasize human studies that found LFP power difference between PD and dystonia [3], [4]; but simultaneously highlight studies that did not find such differences in spike-train oscillations (in non-human primates) [5], which is reflective of our own findings. With regards to our plasticity sub-section, we have added new content related to previous literature on plasticity in dystonia and PD (also addressed in response to a query from Reviewer #1). For example, we bring to light a variety of previous studies [12], [13] emphasizing excessive plasticity in dystonia. However, while such studies may seem to contradict our findings of greater plasticity in PD compared to dystonia, we additionally provide hypotheses (justified by previous literature) that prolonged used of dopaminergic medication may result in synaptic over-sensitization, thus giving rise to levodopa-induced dyskinesias (a hyperkinetic feature) in PD [14].</p><p>[3] P.

Thus, while GPi discharge rates may change in PD, such changes may not be reflected by linear relationships with motor sign development and progression.

Despite observing higher firing rates in PD compared to dystonia, it is unexpected that these rates do not correlate with symptom severity according to the rate model of PD [1]. However, despite the lack of correlations with firing rates, our findings align with similar animal work of Muralidharan et al. [15], which reported that neuronal firing rates within the GPi of rhesus monkeys did not increase linearly with respect to varying intensities of parkinsonian motor severity. We did however show that low beta oscillatory strength within the GPi may play a significant role in the manifestation of motor symptoms in PD; which is also in line with findings of Muralidharan and colleagues.

Recent work from our lab [16] shows that inhibitory evoked fields in STN (which receives inhibitory fields from GPe; no other inhibitory sources) are persistent with very minimal depression during HFS. On the other hand, inhibitory fields in the SNr (which receives majority of its inhibitory inputs from striatum; though some come by way of GPe as well per anatomical literature) depress quickly. We have previously also shown these rapidly depressing fields in GPi [17], [18], which also receives the majority of its inhibitory inputs via striatum, though some also from GPe. As such, the disaggregation of striatum-mediated versus GPe-mediated inhibitory fields is achieved based on: lack of rapidly depressing inhibitory evoked field potentials in STN (which receives inhibitory inputs via GPe and not striatum), but a common presence of rapidly depressing evoked field potentials in SNr and GPi (which both receive most of their inhibitory inputs from striatum); differences in the morphology of purportedly GPe- (fast latency) versus striatum-mediated (slow latency) evoked field potentials [16]; and the presence of slow latency caudato-nigral evoked field potentials in slices [19] that are reversed by GABA antagonist application [20]. These points are indeed outlined in the first paragraph of the Discussion sub-section “Direct pathway plasticity.” However, we have now additionally added a point to the Limitations that inhibitory inputs to the GPi also come by way of GPe, though in a lesser abundance.</p><p>[16] L.

(A) With respect to (A) rate-based spiketrain features, firing rate was greater in PD while burst index (BI) and coefficient of variation (CV) were greater in dystonia; whereas no differences were found for (B) oscillatory spiketrain features for theta, alpha, low beta, high beta frequencies. MWU statistical results depicted are not corrected for multiple comparisons; after correction using the Bonferroni method, only CV and BI results remain significant (please see Supplementary Table 3). (C) In PD, the power of low beta spiketrain oscillations positively correlated (Spearman correlation) with symptom severity; in dystonia, neuronal firing rate negatively correlated with symptom severity, whereas CV and the power of theta spiketrain oscillations positively correlated with symptom severity. Depicted scatterplots are results that were significant before correction for multiple comparisons; however, none of the results persist after Benjamini-Hochberg correction for false discovery rate (please see Supplementary Table 4).”</p><p>“Fig 2 – Long-term and short-term effects of HFS on striato-pallidal plasticity in PD and dystonia. (A) Schematic of the plasticity protocol to assess long-term plasticity via fEP amplitude comparisons pre- versus post-HFS and short-term plasticity via fEP dynamics during HFS. (B) Highlights example fEP traces for measuring long-term plasticity pre- versus post-HFS, with (C) displaying group-level fEP amplitudes pre- versus post-HFS across diseases. (D) Illustrates the amount of plasticity (i.e., percentage change in fEP amplitudes pre- versus post-HFS) in both PD and dystonia, with PD showing higher levels of plasticity. (E) Provides an example of fEP traces during HFS for assessing short-term plasticity, with (F) depicting group-level decay rates of fEP amplitudes using an exponential fit on the fEP amplitudes over the first 5 stimulus pulses across diseases. (G) Shows the half-life of the fitted exponential (i.e., rate of attenuation of fEP amplitudes) between PD and dystonia, with PD demonstrating faster fEP attenuation.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
