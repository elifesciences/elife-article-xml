While paracetamol is safe at standard doses, overdose can cause acute liver failure, which leads to 30,000 patients being admitted to emergency care in the United States each year. There is only one approved antidote to overdoses, which becomes significantly less effective if its application is delayed by more than a few hours. This has incentivized research into identify new drug targets that could lead to additional treatment options.</p><p>Acetaminophen overdose triggers blood clotting and inflammation, contributing to liver injury. It also causes a decrease in cells called platelets circulating in the blood, which has been observed in both mice and humans. In mice, this occurs because platelets accumulate in the liver. Removing these excess cells appears to reduce the severity of the damage caused by acetaminophen, but it remains unclear how the drug triggers their accumulation in the liver. In 2018, researchers showed that a protein called Chi3l1 plays an important role in another form of liver damage. Shan et al. – including many of the researchers involved in the 2018 study – have examined whether the protein also contributes to acetaminophen damage in the liver.</p><p>Shan et al. showed that mice lacking the gene that codes for Chi3l1 developed less severe liver injury and had fewer platelets in the liver following acetaminophen overdose. They also found that human patients with acute liver failure due to acetaminophen had high levels of Chi3l1 and significant accumulation of platelets in the liver. To test whether damage could be prevented, Shan et al. used antibodies to neutralize Chi3l1 in mice after giving them an acetaminophen overdose. This reduced platelet accumulation in the liver and the associated damage.</p><p>These findings suggest that targeting Chi3l1 may be an effective strategy to prevent liver damage caused by acetaminophen overdose. Further research could help develop new treatments for acetaminophen-induced liver injury and perhaps other liver conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group

liver failure (ALF) is a life-threatening condition of massive hepatocyte injury and severe liver dysfunction that can result in multi-organ failure and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernal and Wendon, 2013</xref>). Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of ALF in Europe and North America and responsible for more cases of ALF than all other aetiologies combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernal and Wendon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaeschke, 2015</xref>). It is estimated that each week, more than 50 million Americans use products containing APAP and approximately 30,000 patients are admitted to intensive care units every year due to APAP-induced liver injury (AILI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernal and Wendon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blieden et al., 2014</xref>). Although <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine (NAC) can prevent liver injury if given in time, there are still 30% of patients who do not respond to NAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fisher and Curry, 2019</xref>). Thus, identification of novel therapeutic targets and strategies is imperative.</p><p>APAP is metabolized predominantly by cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) to a reactive toxic metabolite, <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<italic>p</italic>-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI causes mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and eventually cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hinson et al., 2004</xref>). The initial direct toxicity of APAP triggers the cascades of coagulation and inflammation, contributing to the progression and exacerbation of AILI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hinson et al., 2004</xref>). In patients with APAP overdose, the clinical observations of thrombocytopenia, reduced plasma fibrinogen levels, elevated thrombin-antithrombin, and increased levels of pro-coagulation microparticles strongly suggest concurrent coagulopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stravitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stravitz et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, APAP challenge in mice causes a rapid activation of the coagulation cascade and significant deposition of fibrin(ogen) in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Groeneveld et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sullivan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sullivan et al., 2013</xref>). With regard to the role of platelets in AILI, it is reported that in mice APAP-induced thrombocytopenia correlates with the accumulation of platelets in the liver and that platelet depletion significantly attenuates AILI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miyakawa et al., 2015</xref>). Two recent studies also demonstrate that persistent platelet accumulation in the liver delays tissue repair after AILI in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chauhan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Groeneveld et al., 2020</xref>). These findings strongly indicate that hepatic platelet accumulation is a key mechanism contributing to AILI. However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism of APAP-induced hepatic platelet accumulation and whether targeting this process could attenuate AILI.</p><p>Chitinase 3-like-1 (Chi3l1) (YKL-40 in humans) is a chitinase-like soluble protein without chitinase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). It is produced by multiple cell types, including macrophages, neutrophils, fibroblasts, synovial cells, endothelial cells, and tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hakala et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawada et al., 2007</xref>). Chi3l1 has been implicated in multiple biological processes including apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, infection, and tumor metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Elevated serum levels of Chi3l1 have been observed in various liver diseases, such as hepatic fibrosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver, alcoholic liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kumagai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nøjgaard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). However, the biological function of Chi3l1 in liver disease is not clear. Our previous study revealed an important role of Chi3l1 in promoting intrahepatic coagulation in concanavalin A-induced hepatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shan et al., 2018</xref>). Given the importance of intrahepatic coagulation in the mechanism of AILI, we wondered whether Chi3l1 is involved in platelets accumulation during AILI.</p><p>In the current study, we observed elevated levels of Chi3l1 in patients with APAP-induced ALF and in mice challenged with APAP overdose. Our data demonstrated a central role of Chi3l1 in APAP-induced hepatic platelet recruitment through CD44. Importantly, we found that targeting Chi3l1 by monoclonal antibodies could effectively inhibit platelet accumulation in the liver and markedly attenuate AILI.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory, <break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14759567/">14759567</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Stock #:000664 <break/>MGI Cat# 3849035, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3849035">MGI:3849035</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Cd44</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (also called Cd44<sup>tm1Hbg</sup>/Cd44<sup>tm1Hbg</sup>)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #:005878 <break/>MGI Cat# 4941902, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:4941902">MGI:4941902</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Chil1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>mice</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19414556/">19414556</ext-link></td><td valign="top">MGI #:3846223 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3846223">MGI:3846223</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Dr Jack A.

There are several reports describing a role of Chi3l1 in models of chronic liver injuries caused by alcohol, CCl4, or high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Higashiyama et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qiu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms accounting for the involvement of Chi3l1 have yet to be defined. The present study unveils a function of Chi3l1 in promoting platelet recruitment to the liver during acute injury. We provide compelling data demonstrating that Chi3l1 acts through its receptor CD44 on Mɸs to recruit platelets, thereby contributing to AILI. Multiple receptors of Chi3l1 have been identified, including IL-13Rα2, CRTH2, TMEM219, and galectin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). The fact that Chi3l1 could bind to multiple receptors is consistent with a diverse involvement of Chi3l1 under different disease contexts. A recent study showed that Chi3l1 was upregulated during gastric cancer (GC) development and that through binding to CD44, it activated Erk, Akt, and β-catenin signaling, thereby enhancing GC metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geng et al., 2018</xref>). Our studies illustrated a novel role of Chi3l1/CD44 interaction in the recruitment of hepatic platelets and contribution to AILI. Our in vivo studies using <italic>Cd44</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and anti-CD44 antibody provide strong evidence that CD44 mediates the effects of Chi3l1. Our observation that Chi3l1 predominantly binds to CD44 on Mɸs, but not other CD44-expressing cells in the liver, suggests two possibilities which warrant further investigation. First, Chi3l1 may bind a specific isoform of CD44 that is uniquely expressed by Mɸs. Second, the Chi3l1-CD44 interaction requires binding of a co-receptor, which is expressed on Mɸs but not on other CD44-expressing cells in the liver.</p><p>We identified hepatic Mɸs as a key player in promoting platelet recruitment to the liver during AILI. Given the involvement of platelets in AILI, this finding would suggest that hepatic Mɸs also contribute to liver injury. The role of hepatic Mɸs in AILI has been a topic of debate and the current understanding is confined by the limitation of the methods used to deplete these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campion et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fisher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ju et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laskin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michael et al., 1999</xref>). Several previous studies using CLDN to deplete Mɸs concluded that these cells play a protective role against AILI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campion et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fisher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ju et al., 2002</xref>). However, in those studies, Mɸ-depletion was confirmed by IHC staining of F4/80, which cannot distinguish KCs from IMs. Our laboratory and others had since developed a flow cytometric approach to detect and distinguish the two Mɸs populations. Using flow cytometry to monitor Mɸ-depletion, we found that the timing of CLDN treatment was critical. In the previously published reports, mice were treated with CLDN around 2 days before APAP challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campion et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fisher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ju et al., 2002</xref>). Using this treatment regimen, IMs became abundant prior to APAP treatment, even though KCs were depleted. Without this knowledge, previous studies attributed the worsened AILI to the depletion of KCs. However, the advancement of knowledge on the recruitment of IMs and their contribution to acute liver injury offers an alternative interpretation that the worsened AILI is due to IM accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chauhan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mossanen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zigmond et al., 2014</xref>). In the current study, we analyzed KCs and IMs in the liver at various time points after CLDN treatment to identify a new strategy to achieve more complete hepatic Mɸ-depletion. Our data demonstrated that when both Mɸs populations were absent at the time of APAP treatment, platelet recruitment was abrogated and AILI was significantly reduced. During the preparation of this manuscript, a study was published describing that IMs could recruit platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chauhan et al., 2020</xref>). Together, these data suggest that hepatic Mɸs (both KCs and IMs) play a crucial role in promoting hepatic platelet accumulation, thereby contributing to AILI.</p><p>Our data suggest that platelet-derived Clec-2 interacts with podoplanin expressed on Mɸs, resulting in platelet recruitment to the liver during the early phase of AILI. The role of podoplanin/Clec-2 interaction in platelet recruitment and thromboinflammation has been indicated in multiple inflammatory and infectious conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chauhan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hitchcock et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kerrigan et al., 2012</xref>). Our data, for the first time, provide evidence that the podoplanin expression on Mɸs is regulated by the Chi3l1/CD44 axis. Future studies focusing on gaining molecular insight into such regulation are warranted. An increasing number of studies suggest that platelets play an important, but paradoxical role in liver injury. It has been proposed that they contribute to tissue damage during injury phase but promote tissue repair at later time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chauhan et al., 2016</xref>). However, two recent studies of AILI demonstrate that persistent platelet accumulation in the liver significantly delays liver repair. One study described a podoplanin/Clec-2 interaction between platelets and hepatic IMs during tissue repair and demonstrated a detrimental role of such interaction through blocking the recruitment of reparative neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chauhan et al., 2020</xref>). Another study showed that AILI was associated with elevated plasma levels of von Willebrand factor, which prolonged hepatic platelet accumulation and delayed repair of APAP-injured liver in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Groeneveld et al., 2020</xref>). These studies together with our finding that platelets drive tissue damage during early stage of AILI suggest that platelets may be a therapeutic target to treat acute liver injury.</p><p>We observed hepatic platelet accumulation as early as 3 hr after APAP treatment in mice, prior to APAP-induced liver necrosis, indicating that platelets are likely to be the driver of AILI. Mitochondrial damage is a key event in APAP-induced cell necrosis, in which APAP triggers c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in the cytosol and translocation of phospho-JNK to the mitochondria, resulting in oxidant stress and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saito et al., 2010</xref>). Others and our lab have reported that Chi3l1 can induce phosphorylation of JNK directly in either bronchial epithelial cells or LSEC line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). However, whether Chi3l1 or Chi3l1-recruited platelets affects mitochondrial damage or mitochondrial JNK activation in hepatocytes warrants further investigation. During this study, we did compare the liver injuries among WT, and <italic>Chil1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>Cd44</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice in the recovery/regeneration stage of AILI (data not shown). Although ALT levels of WT mice were still slightly higher than both knockout strains of mice at 48 hr post-APAP, it is most likely due to high degrees of injury in WT at the initiation stage of AILI but not due to delayed repair. There were no differences in ALT levels at 72 hr post-APAP, again indicating that the Chi3l1/CD44 does not affect tissue recovery. Moreover, we compared ALT levels at 6 hr post-APAP and there were lower in <italic>Chil1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Cd44<sup>-</sup></italic><sup>/-</sup> mice than WT mice (data not shown), which were consistent with the data shown at 24 hr, indicating that Chi3l1/CD44 axis is involved in the initiation and injury phases of AILI.</p><p>Our studies uncovered a previously unrecognized involvement of the Chi3l1/CD44 axis in AILI and provided insights into the mechanism by which Chi3l1/CD44 signaling promotes hepatic platelet accumulation and liver injury after APAP challenge. Taking our findings one -step further toward clinical application, we demonstrated the feasibility of targeting Chi3l1 by mAbs to attenuate AILI. There is an unmet need for developing treatments for AILI, as NAC is the only antidote at present. However, the efficacy of NAC declines rapidly when initiated more than a few hours after APAP overdose, long before patients are admitted to the clinic with symptoms of severe liver injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Larson et al., 2005</xref>). Our studies provide strong support for the potential targeting of Chi3l1 as a novel therapeutic strategy to improve the clinical outcomes of AILI and perhaps other acute liver injury conditions.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We appreciate the time and effort from Dr Yanyu Wang (Department of Anesthesiology, UTHealth), who diligently double-checked the raw data for each figure.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Validation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><p>Human subjects: Serum samples from patients diagnosed with APAP-induced liver failure on day 1 of admission were obtained from the biobank of the Acute Liver Failure Study Group (ALFSG) at UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.

They found that human liver samples from APAP overdose and mouse livers treated with APAP had increased Chi3l1 and platelets in the liver. Chil3l1<sup>-/-</sup> mice were protective against AILI. They further found that Chi3l1 bound with CD44 on macrophages that were critical for platelet recruitment. Pharmacological depletion of macrophages decreased platelet recruitment and AILI. Moreover, anti-Chi3l1 monoclonal antibodies could effectively inhibit hepatic platelet accumulation and AILI in mice. The manuscript was well written and generally well designed with high quality data. The conclusions were generally supported by the data. The combination of genetic mouse models and antibody manipulations are excellent approaches. The findings of chil31 on platelet recruitment and AILI are novel and have high clinical relevance and translational values. This paper will have a high impact as it provided compelling data on the role of macrophages-platelets and novel mechanistic insights in AILI.</p><p>The noticeable limitation was that only a single time point injury of AILI was determined in most experiments. Another limitation is the use of whole body Chi3l1 KO mice and the potential functions/mechanisms of Chi3l1 and platelets in the early phase of cell death induced by APAP, which remains to be determined.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. Increased hepatic platelets in human liver samples with APAP overdose are most likely reflect very late phase of APAP hepatotoxicity. However, authors observed increased hepatic platelet recruitment/accumulation as early as 3 hours, which was likely prior to the notable necrosis/liver injury. These observations would suggest a potential role of platelet involving in the early phase of APAP-induced necrosis. How would Chi3l1 or platelet affect the well-known pathways that trigger necrosis such as mitochondrial damage and mitochondrial JNK activation by APAP? These questions have not been addressed by the authors. Moreover, the protective effects of posttreatment with anti-Chi3l1 antibody would suggest that it may also involves in the late phase of AILI. These possibilities should be discussed.</p><p>2. In almost all the experiments, only one single time point of liver injury after APAP was determined. There are very distinctive phases of AILI (initiation, injury and recovery/regeneration), authors should discuss these limitations in the text. This may also help to clarify some of the conflicting results regarding the role of macrophages and platelets in AILI.</p><p>3. Figure 1A, could authors comment on what cell types were the Chi3l1 positive in the patient samples? The staining pattern tends to suggest they are mainly expressed in hepatocytes? Was it possible that Chi3l1 may have other functions in addition to platelet recruitment in AILI? For instance, if Chi3l1 also expresses in hepatocytes would hepatic Chi3l1 have direct effects on hepatocytes in promoting APAP hepatotoxicity? The use of whole body Chi3l1 KO mice is a limitation to address these concerns.</p><p>4. Figure 2E the quantification data should also include the WT mice.</p><p>5. The hepatotoxicity of APAP is mainly mediated by its metabolite NAPQI. It is critical to rule out any potential changes on the bioactivation of APAP in all the approaches by manipulating Chi3l1. While authors have compared the bioactivation key factors (the levels of hepatic Cyp2e1, early phase of GSH depletion as well as the formation of APAP-adducts in WT and Chi3l1 as well as CD44 KO mice). However, some of the bioactivations were missing in experiments in mice receiving recombinant Chi3l1, anti-Chi3l1 or clodronate for macrophage depletion. Future experiments to dissect the mechanisms of how platelets affect the early phase of hepatocyte necrosis will be exciting although it may be beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Shan et al. investigated mechanism of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury (AlLI), a life threatening condition with limited therapeutic options. It is known that platelet accumulation contribute to AILI, but its mechanism remains fully elucidated. A previous study by the authors showed a role of chitinase 3-like 1 (Chi3l1) in hepatic coagulation, linking its relation to the platelets. In the current study, the authors first demonstrated that Chi3l1 promotes AILI. Second, they showed that hepatic accumulation of platelets in mice promotes AILI. Third, they showed Chi3I1 is important for platelet accumulation in AILI. To determine the mechanistic link between Chi3I1 and platelet accumulation in the liver, the authors identified its receptor, CD44, by incubating non-parenchymal cells with His-tagged recombinant mouse (rm) Chi3I1 and pull-downed by immunoprecipitation against His-tag, followed by the LC/MS. Vigorous in vivo and in vitro kinetic experiments confirmed a direct interaction between Chi3I1 and CD44. Interestingly, CD44 expressing cells were identified to be macrophages. Using adhesion molecule panel, it was found that podoplanin in macrophages (later found to be induced by Chi3I1) mediated platelet adhesion to macrophages. Further, the authors identified that C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (Clec-2) on platelets binds to podoplanin on macrophages, leading to the macrophage recruitment of platelets. Finally, authors evaluated therapeutic potential of Chi3I1 for the treatment of AILI using an anti-mouse Chi3I1 and showed that anti-mChi3I1 could block APAP-induced platelet recruitment and liver injury in mice.</p><p>Elegant and vigorous experiments were performed to demonstrate the role of Chi3I1 in the APAP-induced liver injury. This study established a novel concept that hepatic macrophages as a key player in promoting platelet recruitment to the liver in AILI. The finding is significant because there is only limited treatment option for AILI and this study demonstrated that Chi3I1 can be a novel target for the treatment of AILI.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic>The principal involvement of platelets in acetaminophen-induced liver injury is well known. Cynthia Ju's group now provides a very comprehensive and conclusive experimental study, implicating Chi3l1 signaled through CD44 on macrophages to induce podoplanin expression, which mediated platelet recruitment through C-type lectin-like receptor 2.1. YKL-40 is generally known as a fibrosis marker in humans. In Figure 1, it would be interesting to understand the range of YKL-40 seen ALF as compared to liver fibrosis (&quot;diseased control group&quot;).</p><p>2. In a similar direction, do you have data from human patients correlating serum YKL-40 with the extent of liver injury (e.g. peak ALT / bilirubin / INR) and prognosis (recovery vs. transplant vs. death)? Do YKL-40 levels correlate (inversely) with platelet count?</p><p>3. I found the experimental data very convincing and conclusive. Nonetheless, it is not clear to me why platelets aggravate APAP. Can the authors speculate and/or provide data? Does platelet binding affect the polarization or function of the hepatic macrophages?</p><p>4. I share the author's excitement about the α-hChi3l1 mAb approach. From a clinical perspective, it would be interesting to combine this treatment with N-acetyl cysteine treatment. Moreover, it would be important and relevant to see, how &quot;late&quot; you can apply this. 3 hrs after APAP is still early (way before the ALT peak). Would 6h or 12h after APAP still protect from AILI?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68571.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, authors investigated the role and potential mechanisms of chitinase 3-like-1 (Chi3l1) in hepatic platelet recruitment during acetaminophen-induced liver injury (AILI).

The manuscript was well written and generally well designed with high quality data. The conclusions were generally supported by the data. The combination of genetic mouse models and antibody manipulations are excellent approaches. The findings of chil31 on platelet recruitment and AILI are novel and have high clinical relevance and translational values. This paper will have a high impact as it provided compelling data on the role of macrophages-platelets and novel mechanistic insights in AILI.</p><p>The noticeable limitation was that only a single time point injury of AILI was determined in most experiments. Another limitation is the use of whole body Chi3l1 KO mice and the potential functions/mechanisms of Chi3l1 and platelets in the early phase of cell death induced by APAP, which remains to be determined.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. Increased hepatic platelets in human liver samples with APAP overdose are most likely reflect very late phase of APAP hepatotoxicity. However, authors observed increased hepatic platelet recruitment/accumulation as early as 3 hours, which was likely prior to the notable necrosis/liver injury. These observations would suggest a potential role of platelet involving in the early phase of APAP-induced necrosis. How would Chi3l1 or platelet affect the well-known pathways that trigger necrosis such as mitochondrial damage and mitochondrial JNK activation by APAP? These questions have not been addressed by the authors. Moreover, the protective effects of posttreatment with anti-Chi3l1 antibody would suggest that it may also involves in the late phase of AILI. These possibilities should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewer’s suggestions and included further discussion on Page 19-20, Line 505-522.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In almost all the experiments, only one single time point of liver injury after APAP was determined. There are very distinctive phases of AILI (initiation, injury and recovery/regeneration), authors should discuss these limitations in the text. This may also help to clarify some of the conflicting results regarding the role of macrophages and platelets in AILI.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewer’s comments. During this study, we did compare the liver injuries among WT, and <italic>Chil1<sup>-/-</sup>, Cd44<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice in the recovery/regeneration stage of AILI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Although ALT levels of WT mice were still slightly higher than both KO mice at 48hrs post-APAP, we think it is most likely due to high degrees of injury in WT mice at the initiation stage of AILI but not due to delayed repair. Besides, there were no differences in ALT levels at 72hrs post APAP, indicating that the Chi3l1/CD44 does not affect tissue recovery. Besides, we also examined ALT levels at 6hrs post-APAP (Figure 1). The results were consistent with the data shown at 24hrs, indicating that Chi3l1/CD44 axis is involved in the initiation and injury phases of AILI. In the revised manuscript, we included additional discussion regarding this comment on Page 19-20, Line 505-522.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Deletion of Chi3l1- or CD44 does not affect liver recovery after APAP-induced injury.</title><p>Male WT, <italic>Chil1<sup>-</sup></italic><sup>/-</sup> and <italic>Cd44</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were treated with APAP.

Figure 1A, could authors comment on what cell types were the Chi3l1 positive in the patient samples? The staining pattern tends to suggest they are mainly expressed in hepatocytes? Was it possible that Chi3l1 may have other functions in addition to platelet recruitment in AILI? For instance, if Chi3l1 also expresses in hepatocytes would hepatic Chi3l1 have direct effects on hepatocytes in promoting APAP hepatotoxicity? The use of whole body Chi3l1 KO mice is a limitation to address these concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that Figure 1A would suggest that both hepatocytes and macrophages are positive for Chi3l1. Although our data demonstrate that Chi3l1 binds to Kupffer cells and that hepatocytes do not express CD44, we cannot exclude the possibility that Chi3l1 might still act on hepatocytes, perhaps through another receptor. Additional studies of treating hepatocytes with recombinant Chi3l1 in vitro might help to address whether Chi3l1 has a direct effect on hepatocytes in promoting APAP hepatotoxicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 2E the quantification data should also include the WT mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and included the quantification data of WT mice now in the revised Figure 2E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The hepatotoxicity of APAP is mainly mediated by its metabolite NAPQI. It is critical to rule out any potential changes on the bioactivation of APAP in all the approaches by manipulating Chi3l1. While authors have compared the bioactivation key factors (the levels of hepatic Cyp2e1, early phase of GSH depletion as well as the formation of APAP-adducts in WT and Chi3l1 as well as CD44 KO mice). However, some of the bioactivations were missing in experiments in mice receiving recombinant Chi3l1, anti-Chi3l1 or clodronate for macrophage depletion. Future experiments to dissect the mechanisms of how platelets affect the early phase of hepatocyte necrosis will be exciting although it may be beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>To ensure that gene deletion of Chi3l1 or CD44 did not affect APAP bioactivation, we measured key determining factors. We did not measure these factors in experiments of rChi3l1 or anti-Chi3l1 treatment because these treatments were performed at the same time or 3hrs after APAP challenge, at which time APAP bioactivation has already occurred. Regarding macrophage depletion by clodronate, we and other had shown that this treatment does not affect APAP bioactivation.[1, 2]</p><p>We share the excitement with the reviewer and agree that the next question to address would be how platelets affect hepatocyte necrosis during the early phase of injury.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The principal involvement of platelets in acetaminophen-induced liver injury is well known. Cynthia Ju's group now provides a very comprehensive and conclusive experimental study, implicating Chi3l1 signaled through CD44 on macrophages to induce podoplanin expression, which mediated platelet recruitment through C-type lectin-like receptor 2.</p><p>1. YKL-40 is generally known as a fibrosis marker in humans. In Figure 1, it would be interesting to understand the range of YKL-40 seen ALF as compared to liver fibrosis (&quot;diseased control group&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestions. We agree with the reviewer that YKL-40 is known as a fibrosis marker in humans. Unfortunately, we do not have serum samples from patients with liver fibrosis. However, we compared the levels of YKL40 we detected in AILI patients with published data [3, 4]. The levels of YKL-40 in AILI patients (150-1300 ng/ml) are higher than those in liver fibrosis patients (80-420 ng/ml). This is likely because liver fibrosis is a chronic liver disease while AILI is an acute liver injury, in which hepatocytes undergo necrosis to a greater extend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In a similar direction, do you have data from human patients correlating serum YKL-40 with the extent of liver injury (e.g. peak ALT / bilirubin / INR) and prognosis (recovery vs. transplant vs. death)? Do YKL-40 levels correlate (inversely) with platelet count?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great question that we are also curious about. However, we could only obtain serum samples from patients undergoing transplantation due to APAP-induced liver failure, and only 1 to 2 days before surgery. This limited our ability to correlate YKL-40 levels with the extent of liver injury or with platelet counts. We are pursuing a prospective study to address the exact questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I found the experimental data very convincing and conclusive. Nonetheless, it is not clear to me why platelets aggravate APAP. Can the authors speculate and/or provide data? Does platelet binding affect the polarization or function of the hepatic macrophages?</p></disp-quote><p>In the current study, we did not elucidate the underlying mechanism by which platelets exacerbate APAP-induced liver injury. This is clearly an important question and has not been addressed. There are two studies of the role of platelets in liver repair after APAP-induced injury. One report described a detrimental role of platelets through blocking the recruitment of reparative neutrophils.[5] Another study showed that AILI was associated with elevated plasma levels of von Willebrand Factor (vWF), which prolonged hepatic platelet accumulation and delayed repair of APAP-injured liver in mice.[6] We included additional discussion in the revised manuscript regarding how platelets might aggravate APAP(Manuscript Page 19-20, Line 505-522). So far, we have not found any studies regarding whether platelets could affect the polarization or function of the hepatic macrophages. This idea certainly warrants further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. I share the author's excitement about the α-hChi3l1 mAb approach. From a clinical perspective, it would be interesting to combine this treatment with N-acetyl cysteine treatment. Moreover, it would be important and relevant to see, how &quot;late&quot; you can apply this. 3 hrs after APAP is still early (way before the ALT peak). Would 6h or 12h after APAP still protect from AILI?</p></disp-quote><p>These are very important questions to address. We have started to evaluate the efficacies of a panel of our antibodies, and the experiment design includes varying the dose and timing of antibody treatments as well as in combination with NAC.</p><p>References:</p><p>[1] S.
