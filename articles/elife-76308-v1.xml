However, because COLD relies on intensity fluctuations that result from the blinking behavior of fluorophores, it is limited to cases where individual emitters show different brightness. This significantly lowers the measurement yield. To extend the number of resolved sites as well as the measurement yield, we employ partial labeling and combine it with polarization encoding in order to identify single fluorophores during their stochastic blinking. We then use a particle classification scheme to identify and resolve heterogenous subsets and combine them to reconstruct the three-dimensional arrangement of large molecular complexes. We showcase this method (polarCOLD) by resolving the trimer arrangement of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and six different sites of the hexamer protein Caseinolytic Peptidase B (ClpB) of <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> in its quaternary structure, both with Angstrom resolution. The combination of polarCOLD and single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) promises to provide crucial insight into intrinsic heterogeneities of biomolecular structures. Furthermore, our approach is fully compatible with fluorescent protein labeling and can, thus, be used in a wide range of studies in cell and membrane biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryogenic super-resolution</kwd><kwd>correlative imaging</kwd><kwd>protein structure</kwd><kwd>assembly</kwd><kwd>fluorescence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009328</institution-id><institution>Planning and Budgeting Committee of the Council for Higher Education of Israel</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020 - VATAT Postdoctoral fellowships for outstanding candidates from the Arab sector</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mazal</surname><given-names>Hisham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mazal</surname><given-names>Hisham</given-names></name><name><surname>Wieser</surname><given-names>Franz-Ferdinand</given-names></name><name><surname>Sandoghdar</surname><given-names>Vahid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryogenic super-resolution microscopy resolves the three-dimensional arrangement of individual fluorescent markers attached to protein complexes with Angstrom precision through their blinking behavior, polarization selection and a classification scheme.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteins and their various assemblies are among the main constituents of all living systems and govern every aspect of cellular physiology in both healthy and disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nelson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mavroidis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schliwa and Woehlke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberts, 1998</xref>). These biomolecular structures adopt sophisticated three-dimensional (3D) configurations during their multifaceted conformational changes. A full understanding of their spatial arrangements and associated heterogeneous configurations is crucial for elucidating their molecular mechanisms, helps guide the engineering of new proteins, and is a great asset for drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Renaud et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, since the pioneering work of Perutz on protein crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fersht, 2008</xref>), a variety of techniques such as X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shi, 2014</xref>) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kanelis et al., 2001</xref>) have been explored for gaining insight into protein structure and function. Advances in sample preparation, detector technology, and image processing based on single-particle analysis have also ushered in atomic resolution in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) studies of protein structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nakane et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kühlbrandt, 2014</xref>). The inherent resolution of this method is highly desirable, but lack of specific labeling makes it challenging to identify small variations such as structural inhomogeneities. Fluorescence microscopy, on the other hand, draws its success from an exquisite specificity in labeling, but has traditionally suffered from a limited resolution.</p><p>The recent advent of super-resolution (SR) fluorescence microscopy has opened new avenues for studying subcellular organization and is on the way to become a workhorse for biological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lelek et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sahl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Weisenburger and Sandoghdar, 2015</xref>). However, conventional SR microscopy performed at room temperature is still not considered as a contestant in the arena of structural biology, where Angstrom-level information about the molecular architecture of proteins and protein complexes is sought after. To push the limit of fluorescence microscopy, one can perform measurements under cryogenic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Böning et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoffman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dahlberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moser et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hulleman et al., 2018b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weisenburger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Furubayashi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weisenburger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weisenburger et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to slowing down photochemistry, which allows each fluorophore to emit several orders of magnitude more photons than at room temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weisenburger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weisenburger et al., 2013</xref>), a key advantage of cryogenic temperatures is in offering superior sample preservation and high stability for Angstrom-scale structural studies. In one implementation, cryogenic optical localization in 3D (COLD) was introduced, where the stochastic intensity blinking of organic dyes gave access to the positions of up to four labeling sites on a single protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weisenburger et al., 2017</xref>). We recently employed a more robust protocol to identify individual fluorophores by exploiting the polarization of the fluorescence light dictated by the fluorophore orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Böning et al., 2021</xref>). This latter method was validated by measuring single distances on one-dimensional DNA nanorulers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Böning et al., 2021</xref>). Control of the fluorescence signal via polarization modulation has also been shown to offer an alternative to random blinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hulleman et al., 2018a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hafi et al., 2014</xref>). In our current study, we introduce polarCOLD, which exploits polarization encoding for resolving several fluorophores in 3D. Importantly, we show that the distances and arrangements of protein complexes can be determined by combining images recorded from under-sampled structures. To demonstrate this, we first resolve three fluorophores on a trimer protein complex with Angstrom resolution. Next, we use partial labeling, a supervised particle classification procedure to solve a complete hexameric protein arrangement. We discuss the limits of our methodology for resolving structures with a certain degree of disorder as well as its promise for combination with cryoEM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>polarCOLD on a protein trimer</title><p>Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a central functional unit in genome repair and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruck and O’Donnell, 2001</xref>). The structure of this complex protein was solved by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Georgescu et al., 2008</xref>) and more recently by cryoEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Madru et al., 2020</xref>). These studies have shown that PCNA forms a stable homo-trimer with a pseudo-hexameric shape. The stability and simple configuration of its structure make PCNA a good model system for benchmarking our imaging methodology. To study human PCNA with polarCOLD, we first fully labeled it via a His-tag linker on the N-terminal side of each subunit of the protein, forming an equilateral triangle (see Materials and methods section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). PCNA complexes were then embedded in a hydrophilic poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix at sub-nanomolar concentration and spin-coated on a mirror-enhanced substrate (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Böning et al., 2021</xref> for in-depth characterization of the mirror-enhanced substrate). The resulting density corresponds to fewer than one protein per μm<sup>2</sup> on average so that individual proteins can be easily identified in diffraction-limited imaging. The samples were immediately imaged in our custom-built microscope (see Materials and methods section).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> shows a schematic of the imaging setup. A liquid helium cryostat houses the cold stage as well as a scannable microscope objective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weisenburger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Böning et al., 2021</xref>). A polarizing beam splitter in the detection path allows us to determine the orientation of dipole-like emitters projected onto the angular interval θ ϵ [0°, 90°] in the imaging plane. The high photostability of the fluorophores at T=4 K allows us to collect on average 260 photons per frame (per 14 ms) from a single fluorophore with a total number of registered photons exceeding 10<sup>6</sup> after 50,000 frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref> (blue trace) displays two examples in which three different polarization states recur at various times. The long photo-blinking off-times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>) allow one to identify each of the three fluorophores on a given protein complex separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weisenburger et al., 2017</xref>). More insight into polarization trace processing can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. To resolve the polarization histograms in cases where they partially overlap (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), we fit the data using an algorithm that combines unsupervised statistical learning tools with change-point detection in a model-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">White et al., 2020</xref>). As illustrated by the red traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>, we can robustly identify the polarization states over time and hence assign the signal in each frame to a single fluorophore. We also verified the robustness of our assignment procedure by performing random assignment of frames, which resulted in single, unresolved spots (see Materials and methods section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Photo-physics and co-localization of fluorophores at cryogenic temperatures.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematics of the cryogenic optical microscope.

This, in turn, directly affects the yield of resolved particles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplements 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>). For example, in our current experiment, we used one polarization basis and projected all orientations to the limited space of θ ϵ [0°, 90°]. By taking the experimental angular resolution of ca. 5° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplements 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>), we can theoretically expect to resolve 70% of the particles which contain 3 fluorophores, and roughly 15% of the particles which contain 6 fluorophores. Adding a second polarization basis at a tilt of 45°, would allow one to double the angular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stallinga and Rieger, 2012</xref>). Moreover, using polarized illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Backer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhanghao et al., 2019</xref>) and a full 3D characterization of the dipole moments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lieb et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mortensen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hulleman et al., 2021</xref>) would result in less overlap and thus enhanced capacity for identifying different polarization states. We remark, however, that even in our current scheme, one can improve the number of resolved polarization states by excluding the ambivalent cases, albeit at the expense of the overall yield (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref> for the statistics of this analysis).</p><p>Having identified the individual fluorophores, we generate super-resolved images by clustering the respective coordinates and taking their averages (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref> for moving from traces to 2D resolved image). The top and bottom rows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> display a selection of the measured and simulated 2D projection maps. To quantify their similarity, we computed a correlation score ranging from 0 to 1. We obtained 2D correlation scores of 0.92 or higher, representing nearly perfect agreement. To obtain a 3D model from our 2D localization maps, we use a single-particle reconstruction algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dvornek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weisenburger et al., 2017</xref>; see Materials and methods section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> for complete data set). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> shows that the reconstructed fluorophore volumes (red spheroids) agree well with the crystal structure of the PCNA protein (PDB: 1AXC) containing three identical subunits in an equilateral triangle. The slight asymmetry and deviation from the actual crystal structure can in part be attributed to the uncertainty introduced by the dye linker, 6-histidine linker and possibly the restricted rotational mobility of the dye itself, resulting in a minor localization bias. Indeed, by taking the dye linker into account and calculating the accessible volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kalinin et al., 2012</xref>), we found that our 3D reconstructed volumes correlate very well (0.96 correlation score) with the simulated accessible volumes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Animation 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>3D reconstruction of the PCNA protein trimer.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Experimentally obtained super-resolved 2D images (top row) of single proteins and simulated images based on the crystal structure (bottom row).

Here, we divide the 2D image data set into two randomly chosen groups and then determine their 3D reconstruction separately. Then we assess the cross-correlation (similarity) between the two 3D volumes in Fourier space as a function of spatial frequency. The overall resolution of a 3D reconstructed volume is thus obtained by finding the maximum spatial frequency corresponding to a correlation above a specific threshold value. Here, we used the half-bit criterion, which is a standard threshold curve used in single-particle cryoEM. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, the intersection of this curve (red) with the FSC curve (blue) indicates at which spatial frequency we have collected a sufficient amount of information in order to interpret the 3D reconstructed volumes accurately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Heel and Schatz, 2005</xref>). We find a remarkable resolution of 4.9 Å. We further quantified the size of the protein-dye conjugate via the pair-wise distances between the localized sites on each particle. The histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> plots the distribution of the side lengths of the projected triangles and is well-described by a fit that considers the localization uncertainty as well as the random particle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Böning et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weisenburger et al., 2017</xref>). We determine a side length of 9.9±0.6 nm in excellent agreement with the expected value. The uncertainty was determined via bootstrapping and is consistent with the resolution obtained from the FSC curve. We note that the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the method (see, e.g, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), and the comparatively low information density per particle, deliver a good results from a total of 119 particles (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref> for overall statistics), which is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the number required for typical cryoEM measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, the low SNR in cryo-EM requires data from a large number of particles to be first averaged to establish 2D classes before using them for 3D reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</xref>). In our case, each 2D projection directly contributes to the 3D reconstruction process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Resolving a hexameric protein complex using partial labeling</title><p>The trimer structure discussed above involves only a single dye-dye distance. We now turn to resolving an example of more complex higher-order protein structures. Considering that a limited number of fluorophores can be resolved via stochastic blinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>), we pursued a strategy of partial labeling of the sites of interest on a given individual protein complex. The piece-wise information, which involves various fluorophore arrangements and distances is then assembled to solve for the full architecture using prior knowledge of the symmetry. This concept has been successfully used to build structural models in NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiaux et al., 2002</xref>) and more recently in SR microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heydarian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Molle et al., 2018</xref>). To demonstrate this technique, we examine the homo-hexamer Caseinolytic Peptidase B (ClpB) of <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> in its quaternary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diemand and Lupas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). ClpB is a molecular machine that rescues proteins from aggregation within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doyle et al., 2013</xref>), and its structure was shown to be very stable in the presence of ATP at low concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mazal et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we labeled the M-domain of the protein at residue S428C such that the distance between two adjacent labeling sites is expected to be 9 nm after accounting for the dye linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We deliberately reduced the labeling efficiency to 50% in order to allow for 1/3 of the particles to carry three fluorophores as estimated by the binomial distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>).</p><p>Labeled ClpB complexes were imaged in the same fashion as before in the presence of 2 mM ATP to stabilize the protein assembly. We obtained about 510 photons per frame on average and a significantly higher total number of photons after 100,000 frames since 87% of the molecules survived until the end of the acquisition interval (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c-g</xref> for photo-physics charectrization). The photo-blinking behavior was similar to that observed in PCNA with a slight increase in the average off-on ratio, allowing robust fluorophore assignment. Hence, we fitted our polarization traces as described previously and selected only those cases that contained three fluorophores. Particles carrying three labels inherently fall into three distinct classes (I, II, and III) with multiple pair-wise distances of approximately 9, 15, and 18 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>).</p><p>To analyze the resulting triangle images, we used a supervised classification scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2004</xref>) to assign each 2D image to one of the three classes, taking the angle of its plane into account. Here, we simulated large data sets of 2D projections for each class and applied a template matching procedure based on the 2D cross-correlation between an experimental image and the simulated images. A control based on simulated ground truth images obtained from the crystal structure of ClpB showed an accuracy of 98% in template matching. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> displays examples of the 2D super-resolved images of each class (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> for more examples of different projections, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref> for full dataset). We assigned each image to the class that yielded the highest correlation score. Images that matched all classes with a difference below 10% for class 1 and 3, and below 3% for class 2 in the score (estimated from a simulation analysis, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) were excluded from further analysis in order to avoid smearing (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref> for all statistics). Next, we picked 2D images of each class with a localization precision better than 3 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>) and correlation score better than 0.9 and calculated their respective 3D structures as described previously for PCNA. Overall, we obtained 232, 100, and 135 particles for classes 1, 2, and 3, respectively, representing a yield of ~7% for all the particles detected with three polarization states (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Remarkably, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, the reconstructed 3D volumes fit very well to the probable locations of the dye on the protein structure given by the accessible volumes (circles) on each protomer after taking the dye linker into account. The correlation scores between the reconstructed 3D volumes and the accessible volumes of the dyes were 0.98, 0.96, and 0.86 for classes I, II, and III, respectively. As a control, we also performed a reconstruction of unclassified 2D images, and confirmed that no structure was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Again, the FSC curves of the volumes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5a-c</xref>) suggest an exquisite resolution of 4.0, 7.9, and 6.4 Å, for classes I, II, and III, respectively.

To examine the applicability of our method for samples with unknown symmetry or side lengths, we followed a similar procedure as demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curd et al., 2021</xref>. First, by inspecting the raw distance histogram of our unclassified particles obtained from single distance measurements (two polarization states), we could identify a peak at ~9 nm as the most probable side length of our molecules (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Next, we assumed three models with different symmetries for pentamers, hexamers and heptamers, but all sharing the same side length of 9 nm. We simulated an equivalent number of projections for each model and correlated them with our experimental data.

In particular, heterogeneities caused by mobile domains and intrinsic distributions in assemblies cannot be preserved and classified in a robust fashion so that they lead to a smearing effect in the final reconstruction in EM studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nwanochie and Uversky, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Serna, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scheres, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheres et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orlova and Saibil, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Papai et al., 2020</xref>).

Briefly, we perform dual-channel localization using maximum-likelihood estimation with a Gaussian PSF model. The minor asymmetry due to the 3D dipole orientation causes a small bias of less than 3 nm on average after filtering the data. Mechanical drift during the long acquisition times is first corrected based on image cross-correlation. Localized coordinates from both channels are then registered via an affine transformation and a non-linear correction. Registered PSFs are grouped and their polarization is calculated from the intensities. Single fluorophores are identified via this feature and used as fiducial markers to perform additional drift correction and establish a more precise image alignment via an interpolated map. The residual drift is well below 1 nm and the median registration error is less than 2 nm. Polarization time-traces of multi-fluorophore particles are then analyzed in more detail (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) by a routine that is based on the DISC algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">White et al., 2020</xref>) to find the polarization states of multi-fluorophore conjugated particles.

In the case of the hexamer protein, ClpB, we generated a large space of multiple 2D projections, ~25,000 images for each class, using a rotation matrix over x, y, and z axis with an angular resolution of 10°.

To this end, we can choose to consider the complete distribution of polarization values and identify well-separated peaks (histogram method), or consider polarization information in the time domain and identify recurring levels and transitions between them (DISC algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">White et al., 2020</xref>). Both methods are limited in resolution, that is depending on the signal-to-noise ratio and switching rates there is a smallest difference between any two fluorophore dipole orientations that we are able to resolve. We consider a particle with N fluorophores to be completely resolved if all N-1 pairwise angular separations are above this angular resolution. Thus, the yield of completely resolved particles depends on how well two polarization states can be distinguished. We performed a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate this yield in our measurements. To this end, we generate large sets of N random fluorophore angles in the interval [0°,90°] and compute the pairwise differences. For a given angular resolution s between 0.1° and 90° we then calculate the fraction of particles for which all differences are larger than s. This simple estimation shows that for a case of just 2 fluorophores an angular resolution of 20° is already sufficient to achieve a yield of 50%. The same yield for the case of 6 fluorophores, however, requires an angular resolution of 2°.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Designed the experiment, Designed the experiment and carried out the measurements, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Designed and prepared the optical setup, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Designed the experiment, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76308-transrepform1-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Raw data generated or analyses during this study are included in the manuscript file and supporting files.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sophie Brasselet (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers of this manuscript have pointed out important questions that I'm convinced will help the authors to resubmit a revised paper that is much stronger and clearer. The detailed reviews are enclosed in this email, and I would strongly encourage the authors to address all the questions and comments raised in those reports. That being said, the most important points are listed here (see referee reports for the details):</p><p>1) About the non-Gaussian shape of a 3D-oriented dipole PSF: what is its effect on localization precision?</p><p>2) Discuss the limitations of the method: requirement for no dipole rotation, orientation discrimination, etc.</p><p>3) Discuss a more general/wider applicability of the method: how can this be applied to non-symmetric/unknown complexes. How necessary is it the use of particle symmetry to determine the structures?</p><p>4) Discuss the reliability of particle discrimination based on the fluorophore polarization state.</p><p>5) Provide a better/fairer comparison of this technique to EM (e.g. number of needed particles, low yield in determination, etc.)</p><p>6) Expand on the methods (especially because this is a methods paper), in particular in the image analysis bit.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Some points, detailed here, need to be addressed to clarify the findings, their conclusion and the claims.</p><p>1. Effect of the 3D orientation of the fluorophores.</p><p>1.1 Even though the used NA is low and the incident polarization is in the sample plane, the localization precision required here is extreme and necessarily comes in competition with the inacuracy of PSF-centroid determination when the dipole is oriented in 3D. In particular, PSFs from 3D dipoles are not symetric Gaussians anymore. It is quite surprising that the 3D-orientation bias does not surpass, in some situations, the other bias sources in the reported data. This bias needs to be estimated and introduced in the localization accuracy estimation, together with the other inaccuracy sources (noise, drift).</p><p>1.2 Is the presence of the mirror-enhanced substrate modifying the expected brightness from dipoles at different axial positions, as well as the 3D-orientation bias mentioned above?</p><p>2. Orientational and time emission dynamics of the fluorophores.</p><p>2.1 The orientation of the dipoles is considered fixed at low T. The authors should give the expected number for the rotational diffusion of the fluorophore. We would expect that if some degree of rotational motion is permitted by the linker between the dipole and protein, this could be an issue for the reconstruction of the information, even at low T since more orientations will be probable for the measured dipoles.</p><p>2.2 It is not clear how the time dynamics of emission of the fluorophores affects the reliability of the discrimination of the different oriented dipoles in the time traces recorded. Is there any need for fine-tuning this on-off dynamics as well as the recording time of the measurement such as only one dipole emits at a time ? Optimal settings rules should be mentioned.</p><p>3. Orientational discrimination of fluorophores.</p><p>3.1 The authors mention in line 126 “The maximum number of resolvable polarization states per protein is currently limited to fewer than 5, dictated by the width of the polarization histogram”</p><p>How is this number 5 extracted from the width of the histograms, and how does this number depend on the signal level, possible presence of orientational mobility (see above)?</p><p>3.2 Would this number increase if the measurement also includes the quantification of the 3D orientation of the dipoles as mentioned below? If the measurement also includes spectral discrimination in addition to polarization discrimination?</p><p>3.3 The previous work by the authors (Boning et al.,) involved important signal thresholding, which was determining in the final dipole-distances assessment. How necessary is the signal thresholding here and what how is the choice of this filtering performed?</p><p>3.4 The authors mention in line 128 the necessity to exclude cases where the expected number of polarization states is not well resolved. What is the origin of this effect and is this also a limit of the unsupervised statistical learning algorithm used to treat the time traces?</p><p>3.5 The authors mention an angular resolution required for resolving 3 vs 6 fluorophores in a structure. How is the experimental angular resolution measured and what are the experimental sources of errors that can affect this resolution?</p><p>4. Classification and reconstruction.</p><p>4.1 The fluorophores assignment relies on a robust supervised classification procedure and template matching, which decreases the number of unknowns. How would this classification perform if the structure would contain unknown parameters?</p><p>4.2 In Figure 3 —figure supplement 2, it is not visible by eye that some of these figures belong to one class rather than another: some of them look very similar (e.g. aligned 3 dots) and belong to different classes.</p><p>4.3 Table S1 shows that the yield to reconstruct 3D information is very low (for ClpB, 100-200 particles are used out of more than 23000 particles detected initially). A lot of particles are also excluded from the analysis because a low-confidence score (line 202). What would be needed to increase this yield and increase the confidence score?</p><p>5. Methods</p><p>5.1 Is the fact that there is an ambiguity on the projection angle retrieval a problem? Since the orientation measured is confined in the [0-90{degree sign}] range, can't the orientation discrimination be problematic if a whole angle sector is missed in the angles determination?</p><p>5.2 How is the 100 photon/frame threshold (Figure S3 legend) chosen, what is the rationale behind in terms of estimation precision and accuracy? Isn't intensity thresholding also excluding 3D dipoles orientations?</p><p>5.3 The authors mention in line 160 a model to extract the side lengths of the projected triangles, what are the detail and hypotheses of this model?</p><p>5.4 The 3D protein orientation is linked to the spatial repartition of the fluorophores, however there is no mention of the possibility to use the 3D z position of the fluorophores to infer such a 3D information. Can't this axial position be exploited?</p><p>5.5 There are several recent techniques developed to infer the 3D orientation from emitting dipoles (using PSF engineering and/or polarization splitting, possibly using radial-polarization filtering). The measurement of the 3D orientation of the fluorophores would be of great value to complete the information with an additional angular parameter, which could increase the number of measurable fluorophores. The authors should comment on this, and possibly test this extension of the approach.</p><p>5.6 The abstract (line 43) states that the method “promises to provide crucial insight into intrinsic, environmental and dynamic heterogeneities of biomolecular structures.” The present method requires a large amount of data to be collected in the context of a known, fixed protein structure which density is highly controlled. It seems therefore very robust in the limited framework of low-level labelling, immoblilized and low concentration proteins, however it is difficult to envision its application in a native, dynamic configuration where diffusion potentially comes into play. The authors should provide more detail about what would be the ingredients needed to enlarge the application range.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In Weissenburger 2017, the authors already presented the reconstruction of four fluorophore sites within streptavidin. Overall, I think the manuscript presents an advance of previous developments by the authors, but the generalizability and applicability to more complex samples remain partly open. This could be discussed in more detail.</p><p>1) Fluorophore discrimination depends on the correct assignment of the different polarization states. It would be good to include a representation of the uncertainties in fluorophore assignment and the resulting filtering procedure. For clarity, it would also help to color-code the different fluorophores as identified from the polarization state in the scatter plots. For example in Figure 2A, some spots appear larger or have an irregular shape, which could be associated with the uncertainty (as mentioned above) or the result of overlapping molecules for which a color code could help.</p><p>2) I am wondering about how generalizable the described reconstruction approach is or can be with respect to non-symmetric complexes or mixed samples of multiple protein species. To what extent does the reconstruction rely on prior knowledge of the investigated proteins? For example, the simulations used to classify the triangle images in the case of ClpB. What are the boundaries of these simulations (distance, angle, etc)? Is it possible to combine this with existing pattern extraction schemes (i.e. Curd, 2020)? Also, would more classes be helpful in increasing the precision or applicability of the approach? Particle reconstruction typically relies on many more classes unless some of them are redundant due to symmetries.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper by Mazal, Wieser and Sandoghdar presents a method to image molecular complexes with light microscopy, but still obtain resolutions/localization uncertainties of fluorescent labels that have been limited to cryo EM.</p><p>This submission build upon earlier work from the same group (Weisenburger 2017 and Boning 2021). The polarisation detection does not increase the sparsity compared to Weisenburger, but on the detection side they can identify different emitters based on their fixed dipole emission as shown in Boning. They further improve the sparsity, by explicit under labelling which later is compensated by particle registration and averaging. Compared to Boning the submission adds 3D reconstructions of two molecular complexes from 2D under labelled structures. The polarisation and localization method is improved technically, but the concept was already there.</p><p>The presented methodology and results are overall very nice.</p><p>In the following a few remarks and details that could help to improve the manuscript or that are unclear to me.</p><p>– Abstract: many it would good to directly state to how many sites you extend the method (l34).</p><p>In how far was the use of a supervised classification and use of particle symmetry really needed? (l93) Typically in cryoEM the use of symmetry is only needed to increase the resolution or in the absence of a large number of particles. What does the method deliver if the symmetry is not implied? That is a strong prior knowledge assumption and hinders discovery of new insights. The supervised classification is similar as model assumptions could be brought into the reconstruction.</p><p>In the introduction it would be nice to mention the idea of Hafi et al., Fluorescence nanoscopy by polarization modulation and polarization angle narrowing. Nature Methods, 11:579-584, 2014. and also Hulleman et al., Fluorescence polarization control for on-off switching of single molecules at cryogenic temperatures. Small Methods, page 1700323, 2018. Similar ideas to exploit polarisation of the fixed dipole emitters have been introduced here too.</p><p>l112 the polarisation state give the in-plane dipole angle. Would the method benefit from an estimation of the polar angle in addition? around l125 this could increase the number of resolvable polarisation states, but this might not be the limiting factor but the sparsity of the blinking?</p><p>l132 After localizations and identifying emitters by their polarisation state, how is the average position computed? Is that done weighted by the photon count?</p><p>l162 The remark the only 119 particles are needed for a reconstruction and not many more as in cryo EM is a bit misplaced. The information density in the LM is very low (only the few coordinates of the particles), while the EM map is a full image with millions of pixels that contain information. In addition early LM particle averaging results have used also hundredth of particles only typically. In addition the benefit of increasing the number of particles in LM is diminishing, because the additional particles cannot improve the localization precision but only fill in missing information thereby increasing the SNR. For cryo EM the resolution scale as sqrt(N) with number of particles, for LM this is much worse and eventually zero.</p><p>l181 Could you provide the t_on and t_off for the emitters. The 50% underlabelling is based on their ratio?</p><p>l203 &quot;better 3 nm&quot; -&gt; better than 3 nm.</p><p>l205 yield of 7,46% point and comma not correct. 2 digits behind comma not needed. In addition why was the yield so low? Even if you consider that the polarisation state removes 3/4 of the particles the yield is still low. In cryoEM most particles needs to be removed due to damage resulting from stress close to the air water interface. What could be the reason here?</p><p>l 217 The claim to &quot;all possible orientations&quot; is a bit strong. I do not see why the 3 citations, in particular Huijben and Sieben, cannot deal with data in all possible orientations. I would argue that up to now, either the particles in a top-down configuration have been images because the structure was 2D or in the case of the much used NPC because the nuclear envelope is running nearly parallel to the cover slip. Therefore the NPC only have a limited tilt range. In conclusion, the claim to being the first is a big too much, as this is certainly not a methodical advance.</p><p>l277 the amount of Trolox 1mM seems quite a lot. Is this needed to suppress triplet states?</p><p>l288 What is the physical pixel size of the camera. The model is not stated, but the back projected size is stated as 190 nm with a 100x objective. This information is also not present in the supplement of Boning2021.</p><p>l290-298 Image analysis.</p><p>This part is vague on the details. Is the code available? I think as the analysis is not standard this needs to be open. The Poisson-weighted Gaussian MLE, what is that? Fitting a Gaussian function with Poisson likelihood? Will not polarisation effects of the restricted dipole play a role already at 0.95NA? (see Stallinga 2010, Optics Express 18:24461 and Engelhardt 2010, NanoLetters 11:209). The drift correction is non-linear, but for the rest it is totally unclear how it works. However, that is quite important as the acquisition time is a bit less than 1h.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Deciphering a hexameric protein complex with Å optical resolution&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please, consider answering the 3 specific comments from Reviewer #3, which need no new experiments, just clarification in the text and maybe some simple extra data analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have done well in responding to my comments, which at least partly came from misreading and/or misunderstanding on my side. The paper remains a difficult read but shows a clear step forward in using low temperature to increase SNR in single-molecule imaging.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall the authors did a very nice job with the revision. I would support the publication of the manuscript.</p><p>point (2) I strongly disagree that classification is needed and an assumption of symmetry. Many published averaging techniques for LM deal exactly with the problem described by the authors &quot;In that sense, the incompletely labelled object inherently behaves as a heterogenous sample with multiple labelling configurations and distances&quot;. This is why most of the cryo-EM algorithms fail when applied to strongly under labelled data, they see the different labelling states as different classes. Please have a look at the work of Heydarian et al., (Nat Methods 2018, Nat Com 2021), Sieben et al., (Nat Methods 2018), Salas et al., (PNAS 2017), Shi et al., (PLOS one 2019) and maybe others.</p><p>The question at hand is, if the under labelling here is so severe that indeed the above methods cannot deliver a good reconstruction. From my own experience somewhere between 30-50% degree of labelling is needed to obtain a meaningful reconstruction. However, this depends also on the absolute number of sites. Some of the above papers have open access code, it might be worthwhile to try this at least.</p><p>The approach to validate their model via the AIC is good. The idea from Curd et al., have been well incorporated as this method typically only can learn something for the nearest neighbour distance, exactly what it has been used for her.</p><p>point (5) The average best position of a set of localisations from the same molecule is typically done by photon weighted averaging not median computation? If there are strong outliers which suggest the use of the median, maybe it would be better to remove the outliers first and then compute a weighted average?</p><p>point (13) I see that the author fit a 2D Gaussian, at the expense of a bit of blurring due to model mismatch. I would expect that the random dipole orientation do not average about but give rise to a large standard deviation of the localization than strictly needed with a correct model fitting. The localization will be unbiased due to the randomness, but it will result in a bit of extra blurring.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76308.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers of this manuscript have pointed out important questions that I’m convinced will help the authors to resubmit a revised paper that is much stronger and clearer.

The localization bias due to the asymmetry of the dipole PSF is a major contribution to the overall localization uncertainty. However, the overall extent of this contribution is reduced by the fact that we preferentially excite the in-plane components and detect them more efficiently due to the lower NA. In addition, by discriminating against less bright fluorescence signals, we eliminate contributions from molecules that have dipole moments with substantial axial component. We estimate the contribution to the localization inaccuracy to be no more than 3 nm on average as was discussed in our recent publication (Böning et al., ACS Photonics 2021). Nevertheless, it is possible to reach subnanometer resolution with a more selective choice of the particles that are included in the averaging process, as validated in Figure 2b-d and Figure 3b.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we extended the image analysis part of the methods section to include our estimates for the contributions to the localization uncertainty.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.2 Is the presence of the mirror-enhanced substrate modifying the expected brightness from dipoles at different axial positions, as well as the 3D-orientation bias mentioned above?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the effect of the mirror is two-fold. It increases the power radiated into the upper half space of the objective depending on the axial position and, thus, affects the collection efficiency. Moreover, due to interference of the incoming plane wave with the reflected wave the intensity of illumination is modulated in the axial direction. This creates an optical sectioning effect such that the brightness of fluorophores also depends on their axial position with respect to this standing wave pattern. We choose the spacer thickness on top of the mirror to be approximately a quarter-wavelength, such that the first antinode coincides with the spacer-sample interface. As mentioned in the main text (line 95) we refer the readers to our recent publication (Böning et al., ACS Photonics 2021) for more details on the properties of the mirror substrate.</p><p>L95: “see (Böning et al., 2021 for in-depth characterization of the mirror-enhanced substrate).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Orientational and time emission dynamics of the fluorophores.</p><p>2.1 The orientation of the dipoles is considered fixed at low T. The authors should give the expected number for the rotational diffusion of the fluorophore. We would expect that if some degree of rotational motion is permitted by the linker between the dipole and protein, this could be an issue for the reconstruction of the information, even at low T since more orientations will be probable for the measured dipoles.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume the orientation of dipoles to be fixed since the environment of the fluorophore is in a fully frozen solid state. Polarization-resolved imaging supports this assumption since for single fluorophores we find shot-noise limited polarization angles that remain constant over time. The shot noise limit of our polarization signal is ca. 4-5 degrees (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Moreover, for single dye molecules we do not observe any jumps or diffusion of their polarization angle during 25 min of measurement time. This is fully in line with the wisdom of more than three decades of low temperature single-molecule spectroscopy. Thus, we can safely conclude that the rotational diffusion is less than a few degrees based on the angular resolution. This information is mentioned in the following passage of the main text, including the figure as well.</p><p>L118: “The number of fluorophores that can be simultaneously resolved depends on the blinking on-off dynamics (see method section). Furthermore, the shot noise determines the angular resolution and, thus, the maximum number of resolvable polarization states per protein.

For example, in our current experiment, we used one polarization basis and projected all orientations to the limited space of θ ϵ [0°, 90°]. By taking the experimental angular resolution of ca. 5° (Figure 1 —figure supplement 5-6), we can theoretically expect to resolve 50% of the particles which contain 4 fluorophores, and roughly 15% of the particles which contain 6 fluorophores.”</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Polarization histogram of single fluorophore ATTO 647N imaged at 4K.</title><p>The histogram shows single population with a width of 5 degrees, which matches the expected shotnoise value estimated from 100 photons.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-76308-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.2 It is not clear how the time dynamics of emission of the fluorophores affects the reliability of the discrimination of the different oriented dipoles in the time traces recorded.

Optimal settings rules should be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>The dynamics of emission dictates the admissible fluorophore density and the necessary imaging speed. As a rule of thumb, to resolve N labels unambiguously within a diffraction-limited spot, we require an on-off ratio of less than 1/N. In addition, the frame rate of the camera needs to be faster than the average off-time to minimize the probability of overlapping contributions from many molecules in a single image. Unfortunately, it is generally not straightforward to predict the on- and off-times of fluorophores at cryogenic temperatures from their values in solution and common strategies cannot be directly used to engineer them. While we have confirmed an intensity dependence of the on-times in isolated fluorophores, the overall statistics still depends critically on the local environment. Here, in accordance with previous work at cryogenic temperatures (Weisenburger et al., Nat. Methods 2017; Hoffman et al., Science 2020), we find exceptionally long dark states. Since N is less than a handful of labels in our case, both criteria stated above are fulfilled. For the protein-fluorophore conjugates investigated in this work we found average on- and off-times of 17 ms and 73 ms, respectively. Therefore, an exposure time of 14 ms is sufficient to resolve single fluorophore blinking. We now mention this in the experimental setup part of the methods section.</p><p>L320: “The laser intensity used in all experiments was set to ~1 kW/cm2 and images were recorded with 14 ms exposure time, more than 5 times faster than the typical off-time.

Since fluorophores show a variation in their brightness, the angular resolution in assessing their dipoles also varies. In figure supplement 2 of Figure 1, we show the obtained total photons per frame. Taking an average of 100 photons, we arrive at an upper bound for the width of ca. 3-4 degrees. As stated before, our measurements of single fluorophores show that we reach this shot-noise limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), suggesting no influence of orientational mobility. In figure supplement 6 of Figure 1 we performed a simulation to determine the fraction of particles for which all fluorophore polarizations are separated by more than the angular resolution. At a resolution of 5 degrees, we would obtain less than 30% yield beyond 5 fluorophores before filtering. This is indeed not a strict theoretical limitation.

Including the 3D orientation of dipoles and/or their spectral information would certainly increase the dimensions along which fluorophores can be distinguished and would therefore scale up our method.

However, acquiring more information comes at the expense of more sophisticated experimental protocols and analysis as well as longer integration times.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.3 The previous work by the authors (Boning et al.,) involved important signal thresholding, which was determining in the final dipole-distances assessment.

In our previous work we demonstrated the narrowing of this distribution for a dye-dye separation of 6.5 nm by filtering the data for the brightest emitters. Here, the filtering process is less strict since the smallest distance we resolve is around 9 nm. The exact choice of the filtering process, however, also depends on the desired or required localization precision. In our current work, we could resolve the distance histogram (Figure 2 d) with a precision of 0.6 nm by selecting the particles with a localization precision below 3 nm. This particle selection comes over the yield, while in (Boning et al., 2020) the yield was ~ 60% , here we obtain ~ 7 %.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.4 The authors mention in line 128 the necessity to exclude cases where the expected number of polarization states is not well resolved.

Therefore, in some cases the algorithm might over or under-estimate the number of polarization states, thus affecting the number of detected molecules. In particular, if the projections of two polarization are very close, or if the SNR is very low it might not be possible to distinguish them in a reliable fashion. In our case, we prefer to use an unsupervised algorithm as it is very user friendly and adapted very well to our pipeline. We modified our statement in the main text accordingly:</p><p>L118:” The number of fluorophores that can be simultaneously resolved depends on the blinking on-off dynamics (see method section). Furthermore, the shot noise determines the angular resolution and, thus, the maximum number of resolvable polarization states per protein.

We remark, however, that even in our current scheme, one can improve the number of resolved polarization states by excluding the ambivalent cases, albeit at the expense of the overall yield (see Figure 1 —figure supplement 6 and Table supplement 1 for the statistics of this analysis).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.5 The authors mention an angular resolution required for resolving 3 vs 6 fluorophores in a structure. How is the experimental angular resolution measured and what are the experimental sources of errors that can affect this resolution?</p></disp-quote><p>Unlike the brightness, which is subject to fluctuations due to time-dependent changes in the blinking behaviour, the lifetime or the quantum yield, the polarization angle is remains unchanged. We estimate the experimental angular resolution based on the number of photons per frame (see figure supplement 2 of Figure 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) to be ca. 5 degrees. However, we want to emphasize that this is an average value and some fluorophores will show considerably broader polarization features. In particular, those with a polarization close to either 0° or 90° are not visible in one channel, narrowing the actual range of detection. It should also be noted that even 6 or more fluorophores could be resolved with our method if one is willing to accept the lower fraction of such particles extracted from a measurement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Classification and reconstruction.</p><p>4.1 The fluorophores assignment relies on a robust supervised classification procedure and template matching, which decreases the number of unknowns. How would this classification perform if the structure would contain unknown parameters?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that the fluorophore assignment does not depend on any model it is done using DISC algorithm in a model-free manner. However, the arrangement of the fluorophores on the protein is determined using prior knowledge/initial models. In general, if we have a homogenous sample, such as the trimer protein PCNA which adopts a single conformation only, or a homogenously and fully labelled object (Weisenburger et al., Nat. Methods 2017), our method would work without any prior assumptions. It should, of course, be evident that more data might be necessary to collect.</p><p>However, the challenge we want to address in this work is particle classification of an incompletely labelled system and reconstruction of a high-order protein complex based on that. In that sense, the incompletely labelled object inherently behaves as a heterogenous sample with multiple labelling configurations and distances, as described for the hexamer protein (class 1, class 2 and class 3). In addition, multiple different 3D orientations of proteins make the problem even more challenging. Thus, to classify these particles and converge to the true structure one needs to assume an initial model. To the best of our knowledge, currently, there are no algorithms that solve such an issue in a model-free manner (unsupervised). Even in the cryo-EM community it is common practice to work with existing structures as initial models for classification and alignment. Thus, the fact that we can nevertheless distinguish and resolve the three classes at high resolution, considering the subtle changes between them, is still remarkable. In fact, this establishes an important future step for our method and toward combination with other structural methods such as cryo-EM.</p><p>To address the reviewer concern, we reduced the number of known parameters, following a similar approach to (Curd et al., 2020), as also mentioned by Reviewer 2 and 3. Here we show that the symmetry assumptions could indeed be relaxed. First, by inspecting the raw distance histogram of our unclassified particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2a</xref>) we could identify a peak of ~ 9 nm as the major side length of our protein complex. Second, we assumed three different models, with different symmetries (pentamer, hexamer, and heptamer), but sharing the same side length of 9 nm (author response image 2b). Then we cross-correlated our experimental images with these different models and calculated the best model which fitted our data using the Akaike information criteria (AIC), as discussed now in the method section. Interestingly, we found that the best model is a symmetric hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2b</xref>). In addition, we examined a different case of hexamers. We simulated a deformed shape of hexamer structure, which composed of two side lengths 9 and 4 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2b</xref>), and we found that this model fitted our experimental data significantly worse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2b</xref>). Next, we also tried to test how minor deviations from a perfect hexamer could affect the classification procedure. Here, we found that changes up to ± 1 nm could still successfully classify our experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2c</xref>). Given these results, we believe that our approach does not rely on a strict assumption/knowledge of the particle symmetry since one can blindly screen different initial models for classification, and find the best choice which describes the experimental data. Quantification of the robustness conditions for a general particle with limited prior knowledge is an interesting mathematical task, which is beyond the scope of our current work.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concerns, we have modified the main text as follows:</p><p>L225: “Efficient classification benefits from some prior knowledge of the structure. To examine the applicability of our method for samples with unknown symmetry or side lengths, we followed a similar procedure as demonstrated by (Curd et al., 2021). First, by inspecting the raw distance histogram of our unclassified particles obtained from single distance measurements (two polarization states), we could identify a peak at ~9 nm as the most probable side length of our molecules (see Figure 4a). Next, we assumed three models with different symmetries for pentamers, hexamers and heptamers, but all sharing the same side length of 9 nm. We simulated an equivalent number of projections for each model and correlated them with our experimental data. Then, we used the Akaike information criterion (Portet, 2020, Curd et al., 2021) to find the best model that describes our experimental data (see method section). As shown in Figure 4b, we found that the hexamer structure matches our data significantly better than the other models. In addition, we examined a different case of hexamer model with reduced symmetry and found that this model resulted in a considerably worse fit to our data (Figure 4b).</p><p>Quantification of the robustness of our approach for samples without symmetry and order goes beyond the scope of our current study, but one simple strategy would be to consider a symmetric structure such as a hexamer and allow for each corner to deviate within a circle of radius R (see Figure 4c). Simulations show that classification of our current data becomes less robust for R&gt;1 nm.

For example, Class 1 and Class 2 share similar distances of 15 nm. Class 1 and 3 share the distances 9 and 15 nm and so on. If our projection were top views only, this would be obvious for us and we would not need any type of supervised classification. However, due to multiple orientations of the particles, the side lengths are somewhat distorted (looks shorter in some cases) and thus, it hard to judge by eye which particle is related to which class. In addition, all classes contain triangles, so that at certain projections they would look similar.</p><p>As verified by simulations, the 2D cross correlation algorithm turns out to be powerful in determining the class of each particle. The classification based on simulation yield 98% accuracy. Among the 2% of the misclassified particles, results showed that 46% were wrong assignment of particles from class 3 into class 1, 23% of particles form class 3 into 2, 23 % of class 2 into 1, and 8 % are of class 1 into 3. By examining the correlation score of these misclassified particles, we found that they had very similar scores. As seen in Figure 3 —figure supplement 3, some have a negligible score of 0 and others are up to 5 %. However, as described in the main text, we include information from particles with a very high correlation score above 0.9, and at the same time, we exclude particles with score difference below 10 %. Thus, theoretically, we should be able to exclude them completely from our classification and 3D reconstruction. We would like to note that the 2% misclassification is due to a number of simulated projections. In fact, we found that by increasing the number of projections (finer steps of rotational degrees) we could reduce misclassifications to 0.5%, leading a difference between the scores that is essentially 0.</p><p>We now clarify the sentence regarding to this and add a supplement figure:</p><p>L207: “Images that were fitted to all classes with a difference below 10% for class 1 and 3, and below 3% for class 2 (estimated from a simulation analysis, see Figure 3 —figure supplement 3) in the score were excluded from further analysis in order to avoid smearing.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.3 Table S1 shows that the yield to reconstruct 3D information is very low (for ClpB, 100-200 particles are used out of more than 23000 particles detected initially). A lot of particles are also excluded from the analysis because a low-confidence score (line 202). What would be needed to increase this yield and increase the confidence score?</p></disp-quote><p>The harsh reduction from ~ 23000 particles into ~ 6000, in the case of ClpB, has different origins. First, as described in the main text, we started by 50% labelling of the protein complexes. As shown in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 b, 70% of the particle are disqualified as they are labeled with 1, 2, or 4-6 fluorophores. Second, some particles are also missed during the time trace fitting using DISC algorithm, for example, particles assigned to two polarization states rather than three. Third, proteins might be damaged during preparation and handling (e.g., spin coating). Fourth, although the photophysics is generally improved at low temperatures, some fluorophores bleach spontaneously. In addition, as pointed out in point 5.1, overlap of polarization projections can also contribute to reducing our yield.</p><p>The reduction of particles from 6000 particles to ~500 particles happens as a result of filtering: (1) Based on the correlation score (here we consider particles with a correlation score above 0.9). (2) Based on localization precision (here we consider particles with a localization precision better than 3 nm). (3) We further filter particles with a correlation score difference of up to 10% for class 1 and 3, and 3% for class 2. In fact, it is hard to judge the true yield, as here we rely on the performance of the DISC algorithm, which dictates the number of particles with three polarizations (as mentioned in point 3.4). Furthermore, we exclude particles where the SNR of the trace fit falls below 2. In the trimer case we might also be confronted with another issue. The labelling in that case was done on the histidine tag linker, which is not covalently bound, and might thus disassemble once we dilute the protein.</p><p>To increase the yield, one can take several measures. First, one could improve the assignment of fluorophore identification with better algorithms, or by including more information such as spectral information or resolving the 3D orientation of each fluorophore. For example, in the case of ClpB, specific labelling of each monomer in the complex would allow one to achieve full labelling with three fluorophores, thus increasing our yield. However, this approach is still very challenging and out of reach. In fact, we can also turn into fully labeling of the complex and exploit the 4-5 labeled molecules as well in order to gain more information. Second, regarding the classification, at the moment we select the best particles which match our model structure. In practice, we can increase our library for template matching, to include 1 nm variation at each distance, which would increase our yield. Lastly, one could expect to improve the sample quality by switching to 100% aqueous medium, such as vitreous ice, as used in the cryo-EM community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Methods</p><p>5.1 Is the fact that there is an ambiguity on the projection angle retrieval a problem?

As we only measure in one polarization basis, all angles are mapped into the first quadrant. The resulting ambiguity reduces the range over which fluorophores can be distinguished by their dipole orientation. In principle, one can do better by measuring in two different polarization bases to extend the range to [0°,180⁰], and by extracting the 3D orientation of each fluorophore, e.g. by engineering the PSF. However, these approaches generally require a higher numerical aperture and signal.

While a higher value excludes frames from analysis, possibly lowering the localization precision, it also increases the accuracy of assignment as the remaining frames have lower shot noise and can therefore be assigned with higher confidence. Dipoles with larger outof-plane angles are more likely to be completely excluded, which is, however, desirable given their larger localization bias. The exact threshold of 100 photon/frame (total counts from both cameras) was manually set as a reasonable compromise. We now add a figure in the supplement which shows the relation between localization precision as a function of the segment length (number of frames for each fluorophore). It shows that the longer the segment, the higher the localization precision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.3 The authors mention in line 160 a model to extract the side lengths of the projected triangles, what are the detail and hypotheses of this model?</p></disp-quote><p>The fit shown in Figure 2d is based on the following model: The distance distribution between two points in a plane, each determined with a finite localization uncertainty, is mathematically described by a so-called Rician function. If the expected distance value is large compared to the localization uncertainty it resembles a regular Gaussian. In our measurement, however, particles are randomly oriented within the sample, such that the distance between two localized fluorophores is a projection of the real distance. We include this projection by convolving the Rician with a cosine function, which results in the characteristic shape shown in Figure 2d. In the case of the PCNA trimer, we only need to consider a single distance due to the symmetry of the structure.

By directly localizing fluorophores in 3D we could circumvent this step and facilitate our analysis. Instead of a 3D reconstruction, we could then perform particle alignment directly on the localization. However, most options for 3D localization (e.g. astigmatism, double helix, Vortex etc.) will enlarge the PSF and therefore reduce the SNR. Furthermore, the axial position is usually determined with lower precision than the lateral coordinates. As more groups join the emerging efforts in cryogenic super-resolution microscopy, we expect these variations to be examined in different arrangements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.5 There are several recent techniques developed to infer the 3D orientation from emitting dipoles (using PSF engineering and/or polarization splitting, possibly using radial-polarization filtering).

The authors should comment on this, and possibly test this extension of the approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this issue. Measuring full 3D dipole orientation indeed adds information that improves the applicability of our method to more complex situations, while also eliminating the known dipole bias issue in a rigorous way. However, these approaches generally reduce the SNR because the emitted photons are either split between more channels or more pixels. Radial polarization as recently demonstrated by the group of W.E. Moerner decrease the signal by 30% even for perfectly horizontal dipoles. Nevertheless, we consider full 3D orientation estimation to be a valuable addition to be explored further.

It would be good to include a representation of the uncertainties in fluorophore assignment and the resulting filtering procedure. For clarity, it would also help to color-code the different fluorophores as identified from the polarization state in the scatter plots. For example in Figure 2A, some spots appear larger or have an irregular shape, which could be associated with the uncertainty (as mentioned above) or the result of overlapping molecules for which a color code could help.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her suggestions. We now provide the residuals of the DISC fit to better represent the uncertainty associated with this step (Figure 1 main text). Also, we provide a colour code of two different trajectories, and mention the associated localization precision for each fluorophore. In addition, we attach a figure which shows the localization precision as a function of the length of each assigned polarization (number of frames). As expected, the longer the segment, the higher the achievable localization precision. We refer the readers to these two new figures as well (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1-2).</p><p>Regarding the super-resolved projection images in Figure 2a, we can unfortunately not follow the Reviewer’s concern. All but the last image in Figure 2a, as well as the majority of images in the corresponding figure supplement 1, show three clearly separated spots and we describe in the figure caption that the spot size is given by the localization precision of the respective fluorophore. In some cases, the shape looks elongated as a result of two overlapping spots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I am wondering about how generalizable the described reconstruction approach is or can be with respect to non-symmetric complexes or mixed samples of multiple protein species. To what extent does the reconstruction rely on prior knowledge of the investigated proteins? For example, the simulations used to classify the triangle images in the case of ClpB. What are the boundaries of these simulations (distance, angle, etc)? Is it possible to combine this with existing pattern extraction schemes (i.e. Curd, 2020)? Also, would more classes be helpful in increasing the precision or applicability of the approach? Particle reconstruction typically relies on many more classes unless some of them are redundant due to symmetries.</p></disp-quote><p>We have answered similar question raised by Reviewer 1 (point 4.1) and have revised the manuscript:</p><p>To address the reviewer concern, we reduced the number of known parameters, following a similar approach to (Curd et al., 2020), as mentioned by the Reviewer. Here we show that the symmetry assumptions could indeed be relaxed. First, by inspecting the raw distance histogram of our unclassified particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2a</xref>) we could identify a peak of ~ 9 nm as the major side length of our protein complex. Second, we assumed three different models, with different symmetries (pentamer, hexamer, and heptamer), but sharing the same side length of 9 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2b</xref>). Then we cross-correlated our experimental images with these different models and calculated the best model which fitted our data using the Akaike information criteria (AIC), as discussed now in the method section. Interestingly, we found that the best model is a symmetric hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2b</xref>). In addition, we examined a different case of hexamers. We simulated a deformed shape of hexamer structure, which composed of two side lengths 9 and 4 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2b</xref>), and we found that this model fitted our experimental data significantly worse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2b</xref>).

Given these results, we believe that our approach does not rely on a strict assumption/knowledge of the particle symmetry since one can blindly screen different initial models for classification, and find the best choice which describes the experimental data.

We point out that solving a completely disordered structure without any prior knowledge would only be possible for complete labelling.”</p><p>Regarding the comment on the classes. There is some difference between the classes we define here and the definition of classes raised by the reviewer. In cryo-EM, due to a very low SNR, they perform class average of particles which share the same in-plane orientation in order to increase the SNR for 3D reconstruction. Thus, the number of classes is defined by the total number of inplane orientation/projections. In our case, we do not need any class average, as our SNR is already very high, and these particles can be fed immediately into 3D reconstruction. This avoids the introduction of wrong classifications and some noise into the system. The three classes we define here as in the case of the hexamer protein, are based on conformational state/heterogeneity within the same protein complex. Each class here (act as different sample) adopts different 3D orientation and has different distances. As we have shown, give some degree of prior knowledge, we could identify these classes/conformations and resolve them separately in 3D. Such an approach can be combined with cryo-EM to help identifying particle orientation and heterogeneity with the same protein complex to resolve each state at high resolution without smearing.</p><p>We now mention this in the text:</p><p>L169: “Indeed, the low SNR in cryo-EM requires data from a large number of particles to be first averaged to establish 2D classes before using them for 3D reconstruction (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003).

The information density in the LM is very low (only the few coordinates of the particles), while the EM map is a full image with millions of pixels that contain information. In addition early LM particle averaging results have used also hundredth of particles only typically. In addition the benefit of increasing the number of particles in LM is diminishing, because the additional particles cannot improve the localization precision but only fill in missing information thereby increasing the SNR. For cryo EM the resolution scale as sqrt(N) with number of particles, for LM this is much worse and eventually zero.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting and subtle point. Indeed, our method delivers far less information about the structure than would be obtained from a cryoEM density map, i.e. we obtain a similar resolution but only for the locations of a few labelling sites. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we therefore require fewer particles to obtain a high-resolution reconstruction. Nevertheless, we wanted to raise awareness for this conceptual difference between LM and cryoEM. Following the reviewer’s justified remark, we attempted a better formulation of our original statement.</p><p>We now address this issue in the manuscript, where we write:</p><p>L165:“ We note that the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the method (see, e.g, Figure 2a), and the comparatively low information density per particle, deliver a good results from a total of 119 particles (see Table supplement 1 for overall statistics), which is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the number required for typical cryoEM measurements (Cheng et al., 2015). Indeed, the low SNR in cryo-EM requires data from a large number of particles to be first averaged to establish 2D classes before using them for 3D reconstruction (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003). In our case, each 2D projection directly contributes to the 3D reconstruction process.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>l181 Could you provide the t_on and t_off for the emitters.

In cryoEM most particles needs to be removed due to damage resulting from stress close to the air water interface. What could be the reason here?</p></disp-quote><p>We answered this question in Reviewer 1 comment, point 4.3:</p><p>The harsh reduction from ~ 23000 particles into ~ 6000, in the case of ClpB, has different origins. First, as described in the main text, we started by 50% labelling of the protein complexes. As shown in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 b, 70% of the particle are disqualified as they are labeled with 1, 2, or 4-6 fluorophores. Second, some particles are also missed during the time trace fitting using DISC algorithm, for example, particles assigned to two polarization states rather than three. Third, proteins might be damaged during preparation and handling (e.g., spin coating). Fourth, although the photophysics is generally improved at low temperatures, some fluorophores bleach spontaneously. In addition, as pointed out in point 5.1, overlap of polarization projections can also contribute to reducing our yield.</p><p>The reduction of particles from 6000 particles to ~500 particles happen as a result of filtering: (1) Based on the correlation score (here we consider particles with a correlation score above 0.9). (2) Based on localization precision (here we consider particles with a localization precision better than 3 nm). (3) We further filter particles with a correlation score difference of up to 10% for class 1 and 3, and 3% for class 2. In fact, it is hard to judge the true yield, as here we rely on the performance of the DISC algorithm, which dictates the number of particles with three polarizations (as mentioned in point 3.4). Furthermore, we exclude particles where the SNR of the trace fit falls below 2. In the trimer case we might also be confronted with another issue. The labelling in that case was done on the histidine tag linker, which is not covalently bound, and might thus disassemble once we dilute the protein.</p><p>We note that cryo-EM studies have similarly low yields of 10-30% (Merk et al., 2016), as a result of iterative brute-force filtration at the 2D class average steps, and consequently at the 3D classification process. This not explicitly due to the damage of molecules at the air water interface, but also from other factors as well, mainly particle heterogeneity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>l 217 The claim to &quot;all possible orientations&quot; is a bit strong.

I would argue that up to now, either the particles in a top-down configuration have been images because the structure was 2D or in the case of the much used NPC because the nuclear envelope is running nearly parallel to the cover slip. Therefore the NPC only have a limited tilt range. In conclusion, the claim to being the first is a big too much, as this is certainly not a methodical advance.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer comment, and we modified the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>l277 the amount of Trolox 1mM seems quite a lot.

Is the code available? I think as the analysis is not standard this needs to be open. The Poisson-weighted Gaussian MLE, what is that? Fitting a Gaussian function with Poisson likelihood? Will not polarisation effects of the restricted dipole play a role already at 0.95NA? (see Stallinga 2010, Optics Express 18:24461 and Engelhardt 2010, NanoLetters 11:209). The drift correction is non-linear, but for the rest it is totally unclear how it works. However, that is quite important as the acquisition time is a bit less than 1h.</p></disp-quote><p>The MATLAB code for our image analysis is currently not fully available. Our PSF model is a 2D Gaussian that we fit with a Poisson likelihood. As the reviewer suspects, the dipole orientation does introduce a minor localization bias even at a numerical aperture of 0.95. However, the extent of this error is considerably reduced by selective excitation in epi-illumination and by postselection (at the expense of reducing the yield of the measurement). Furthermore, since the dipole orientation was found to be random with respect to the protein structure, the residual shift is in a random direction and therefore averaged out in the 3D reconstruction.</p><p>As for the rest of the image processing pipeline: we correct for drift in a coarse fashion based on image cross-correlation. To this end, we render a super-resolution image every 500 frames (batch size depends on frame rate and SNR) from all localizations. Since each particle has a finite spatial extent with several fluorophores contributing to the localizations, this procedure is not yet sufficient for our purpose. To push the residual drift below 1 nm, we e apply another correction step using occasional single fluorophores as fiducial markers, after they have been distinguished by their polarization, and subtract this averaged drift trajectory. A similar issue arises in image registration: in order to achieve highest accuracy, one needs to identify individual fluorophores as fiducial markers for a non-linear mapping between the imaging channels. Therefore, after coarse registration based on an affine transformation to pair up PSFs, we establish the non-linear matrix for precise registration based on the same single fluorophores identified previously. We have attempted to clarify the workflow in the methods section.</p><p>Image analysis</p><p>L327” We analyzed raw image stacks from two polarization channels with custom-written MATLAB software. Briefly, we perform dual-channel localization using maximum-likelihood estimation with a Gaussian PSF model. The minor asymmetry due to the 3D dipole orientation causes a small bias of less than 3 nm on average after filtering the data. Mechanical drift during the long acquisition times is first corrected based on image cross-correlation. Localized coordinates from both channels are then registered via an affine transformation and a non-linear correction. Registered PSFs are grouped and their polarization is calculated from the intensities. Single fluorophores are identified via this feature and used as fiducial markers to perform additional drift correction and establish a more precise image alignment via an interpolated map. The residual drift is well below 1 nm and the median registration error is less than 2 nm. Polarization time-traces of multi-fluorophore particles are then analyzed in more detail (see Figure 1 —figure supplement 3) by a routine that is based on the DISC algorithm (White et al., 2020) to find the polarization states of multi-fluorophore conjugated particles. Once all polarization states are identified, the associated coordinates are averaged by taking their median to generate a 2D super-resolved image. We took particles which were fitted best to three polarization states and used them for further analysis (see Table supplement 1 for statistics).”</p><p>References</p><p>Backer, A. S., Lee, M.

Many published averaging techniques for LM deal exactly with the problem described by the authors &quot;In that sense, the incompletely labelled object inherently behaves as a heterogenous sample with multiple labelling configurations and distances&quot;. This is why most of the cryo-EM algorithms fail when applied to strongly under labelled data, they see the different labelling states as different classes. Please have a look at the work of Heydarian et al., (Nat Methods 2018, Nat Com 2021), Sieben et al., (Nat Methods 2018), Salas et al., (PNAS 2017), Shi et al., (PLOS one 2019) and maybe others.</p><p>The question at hand is, if the under labelling here is so severe that indeed the above methods cannot deliver a good reconstruction. From my own experience somewhere between 30-50% degree of labelling is needed to obtain a meaningful reconstruction. However, this depends also on the absolute number of sites. Some of the above papers have open access code, it might be worthwhile to try this at least.</p><p>The approach to validate their model via the AIC is good. The idea from Curd et al., have been well incorporated as this method typically only can learn something for the nearest neighbour distance, exactly what it has been used for her.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her suggestion. In general, other approaches could be used to deal with the data presented in our study. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no algorithm which is specifically designed for our problem, i.e., a partially labeled, randomly oriented structure with only a few fluorophores and 2D localizations. Nevertheless, we followed the reviewer’s suggestion and tested the code published by Heydarian et al., Nat Methods 2018.</p><p>First, we fed the coordinates of our 2D super-resolved <italic>experimental</italic> images obtained from the set of 467 particles used to generate the hexamer structure into the algorithm. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>, no clear reconstruction was obtained. To explore this code further, we simulated 3D rotations to the structure “tud_ralf” use in Heydarian et al. Nat Methods 2018 with 100% labelling efficiency. However, we applied rotations around the x axis within ± 180 degrees (i.e., not only in-plane rotations as in the original code) and used the code all2all to solve for the structure. Again, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref> shows that no clear reconstruction was obtained. Last, we also used a <italic>simulated</italic> data set of our own hexamer structure to avoid all noise. Here, we simulated 500 particles with 900 localization each, at localization precision below 1 nm, labelling efficiency of 50%, and for different 3D orientations in order to mimic our experimental conditions. Again, the algorithm fails to deliver a clear reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>). We also remark that Sieben et al., Nat Methods 2018 do account for the 3D particle orientation, and they are able to separate different species with multi-color imaging. However, their algorithm is based on a cryo-EM classification, which does not deal with strongly under-labelled data. Similarly, the work published by Salas et al., (PNAS 2017).</p><p>We believe, there are several factors that limit the use of the other published methods. The first issue concerns the fact that in our samples, structure are randomly oriented in 3D whereas the existing algorithms accounts for translations and rotations in the image plane, i.e., they require particles to be oriented in the top view. Furthermore, our structures are strongly under-labelled and contain classes that are quite similar in terms of sides lengths and angles. It would indeed be interesting to develop a rigorous mathematical formalism for analyzing the performance of each algorithm for structures of different morphological nature.</p><p>Recent reports on 3D measurements (Heydarian et al., Nat Com 2021) offer an interesting alternative to reconstruction based on 2D projections. These are currently not applicable to our data as we only have access to 2D measurements. We now mention the prospect of 3D measurements and refer to the general issues in the modified manuscript and Figure 4 —figure supplement 1:</p><p>L245: “Classification and reconstruction have recently been applied to other single-molecule localization microscopy studies, and in some cases specific algorithms have been developed to handle some degree of partial labeling (Heydarian et al., 2018, Sieben et al., 2018, Salas et al., 2017). As shown in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1, however, the existing algorithms do not provide a satisfactory solution for our data. We attribute this to the fact that the structures in our investigations are randomly oriented in 3D, are strongly under-labeled, and involve classes that are similar. A mathematical analysis of the performance of various algorithms for structures of different morphologies is beyond the scope of our current work.”</p><p>L284: “In addition, while we currently screen different symmetries to find the best model that fits to the structures under study, we plan to explore unsupervised classification schemes for identifying and classifying particles in an unknown sample. In addition, one can exploit the axial information directly and follow similar approach by (Heydarian et al., 2021).”</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Experimental data obtained from partially labelled hexamer protein, as described in the main text.</title><p>Our experimental data samples 3D different orientations.

Indeed, even in the absence of strong outliers (see scatter plot example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6</xref>) there is a minor difference in the coordinates, but it is less than 0.3 nm on average. We argue that since this is less than the localization precision, and small compared to the intermolecular distances in our sample, both estimators for the fluorophore position are acceptable. However, we share the reviewer’s view that the photon-weighted mean should be preferred, as it accounts for the different variances of the data points and results in a smaller standard error, especially in cases with higher fluctuation of the obtained photons per frame. For future experiments, we will therefore change the calculation of coordinates to photon-weighted means.</p><fig id="sa2fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>Scatter plot showing the difference between median and photon-weighted mean in the calculation of the coordinates.</title><p>Even in the absence of strong outliers (<bold>a</bold>) there is a minor difference (less than 0.3 nm on average) in the coordinates (<bold>b</bold>).

I would expect that the random dipole orientation do not average about but give rise to a large standard deviation of the localization than strictly needed with a correct model fitting. The localization will be unbiased due to the randomness, but it will result in a bit of extra blurring.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right and we would like to clarify this point again. The localizations contain a small error due to the model mismatch of a Gaussian with a dipole-like PSF. This However, in order to obtain the final reconstruction, we collect many particles. Since the dipole orientation is random, the small shift occurs in a random direction. The ‘averaged’ 3D structure will therefore be unbiased. We have answered a similar question by reviewer 1:</p><p>“The reviewer points to an important consideration. The localization bias due to the asymmetry of the dipole PSF is a major contribution to the overall localization uncertainty. However, the overall extent of this contribution is reduced by the fact that we preferentially excite the in-plane components and detect them more efficiently due to the lower NA. In addition, by discriminating against less bright fluorescence signals, we eliminate contributions from molecules that have dipole moments with substantial axial component. We estimate the contribution to the localization inaccuracy to be no more than 3 nm on average as was discussed in our recent publication (Böning et al., ACS Photonics 2021). Nevertheless, it is possible to reach sub-nanometer resolution with a more selective choice of the particles that are included in the averaging process, as validated in Figure 2b-d and Figure 3b”</p><p>References</p><p>Heydarian, H., Joosten, M., Przybylski, A., Schueder, F., Jungmann, R., Werkhoven, B.
