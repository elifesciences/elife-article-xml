reduce the overall virulence, rendering disease less severe. Here, we show that this seemingly successful disease management strategy can fail with devastating consequences for infected hosts. We deploy cooperation theory and a novel synthetic system involving the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>. In vivo infections of rice demonstrate that <italic>M. oryzae</italic> virulence is enhanced, quite paradoxically, when a public good mutant is present in a population of high-virulence pathogens. We reason that during infection, the fungus engages in multiple cooperative acts to exploit host resources. We establish a multi-trait cooperation model which suggests that the observed failure of the virulence reduction strategy is caused by the interference between different social traits. Multi-trait cooperative interactions are widespread, so we caution against the indiscriminant application of anti-virulence therapy as a disease-management strategy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18678.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18678.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic></kwd><kwd>virulence reduction strategies</kwd><kwd>competitive exclusion</kwd><kwd>synthetic ecology</kwd><kwd>public goods cooperation</kwd><kwd>metabolic trade-offs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000270</institution-id><institution>Natural Environment Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NE/E013007/3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lindsay</surname><given-names>Richard J</given-names></name><name><surname>Gudelj</surname><given-names>Ivana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000270</institution-id><institution>Natural Environment Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doctoral training grant studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lindsay</surname><given-names>Richard J</given-names></name><name><surname>Gudelj</surname><given-names>Ivana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doctoral training grant studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pawlowska</surname><given-names>Bogna J</given-names></name><name><surname>Gudelj</surname><given-names>Ivana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>no. 294702 GENBLAST</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Talbot</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name><name><surname>Gudelj</surname><given-names>Ivana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>no. 647292 MathModExp</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gudelj</surname><given-names>Ivana</given-names></name><name><surname>Talbot</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cooperation theory and a novel synthetic infection system provides a mechanistic understanding of why a seemingly successful disease management strategy can have devastating consequences for infected hosts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Targeting virulence to disarm rather than to eradicate pathogens, is a nascent disease management strategy that has been proposed to slow the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Virulence reduction strategies deploy drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clatworthy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rasko and Sperandio, 2010</xref>) but despite some success in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lowy et al., 2010</xref>), drug-resistance has already been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">García-Contreras et al., 2013</xref>). An alternative strategy is to use live organisms to reduce pathogen virulence through competitive displacement. This idea is particularly promising; proving successful in some animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harrison et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rumbaugh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pollitt et al., 2014</xref>) and plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frey et al., 1994</xref>) models, as well as clinical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerding et al., 2015</xref>) and agricultural field studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaike and Keller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cotty, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cotty and Bayman, 1993</xref>).</p><p>During competitive displacement treatments, strains with attenuated virulence are introduced into hosts, be they patients or crops, to out-compete highly virulent pathogens. Indeed, recent clinical trials exploited a low virulence, non-toxigenic strain of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> in patients to out-compete virulent toxin-producing strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerding et al., 2015</xref>). Similar treatments are commercially available in agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaike and Keller, 2011</xref>) where a low virulence non-toxigenic strain of <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> is used to prevent virulent toxin-producing strains from infecting crops through competitive exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cotty, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cotty and Bayman, 1993</xref>). Even cancers are known to evolve heterogeneous cell populations and, as a result, the exploitation of competitive interactions between tumour cells is seen as a promising disease treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korolev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jansen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tabassum and Polyak, 2015</xref>). Is the competitive displacement strategy failsafe, however, or is there a risk that such interventions might have unforeseen consequences? Here, we address this question using cooperation theory and a new synthetic system involving the rice blast fungus.</p><p>Successful infection and proliferation of a pathogen is frequently aided by cooperation between individual microbial cells. The most common type of pathogen cooperation involves production of extracellular factors used to perform a range of functions that directly or indirectly contribute to pathogen virulence and so are referred to as virulence factors. Direct virulence factors aid pathogenesis by directly interacting with and damaging the host, such as by the production of infection structures or toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Raymond et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">West et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, indirect virulence factors facilitate the survival and proliferation of the pathogen within the host. Examples include products for nutrient acquisition, suppression or evasion of host immunity, antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation and behaviours which can be coordinated by quorum sensing molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harrison et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rumbaugh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pollitt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">West et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Köhler et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Such extracellular factors can be considered public goods, because they benefit every individual in the locality and are therefore open to exploitation by cheats who do not contribute to the cost of their production, but still reap the rewards. Since public goods aid microbial growth and survival, they also affect the extent of damage that pathogens can inflict on their hosts. As a consequence, cooperators that produce extracellular factors are often more virulent than non-producing mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harrison et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rumbaugh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pollitt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Raymond et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Köhler et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckling and Brockhurst, 2008</xref>).</p><p>To develop our synthetic rice blast fungus system we exploit two key ingredients of cooperation theory: the ability of cheats to invade populations of cooperators by not paying the cost of cooperation, but reaping the benefits, and the fact that public good non-producing mutants are often less virulent than public good-producing co-operators. In that case, cooperation theory predicts that the presence of public good cheats with low virulence within a population of virulent public good cooperators leads to a reduction in overall virulence of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckling and Brockhurst, 2008</xref>). It is important to note that this does not apply to systems where cheats are more virulent than cooperators, as in the case of prudent resource use, since an introduction of cheats with high virulence into a population of cooperators with low virulence will lead to an increase in population virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bremermann, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nowak and May, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frank, 1996</xref>).</p><p>Rice blast is the most destructive disease of cultivated rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) and is caused by the filamentous fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae,</italic> which is also a leading model system for studying host-parasite interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wilson and Talbot, 2009</xref>). <italic>M. oryzae</italic> infections are polycyclic, initiated by infectious agents (spores called conidia) that exploit the host plant to replicate and form new agents for transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wilson and Talbot, 2009</xref>). To identify a cooperative public good-producing trait, we focused on traits that enable the fungus to exploit nutrients inside host tissue for proliferation and spore production, which is widely used as a proxy for pathogen fitness (see Materials and methods). Given that the most abundant storage sugar within plant tissue is sucrose, we reasoned that secreted invertase production might represent a social trait and an indirect virulence factor. Invertase catalyses the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose, which are preferred carbon sources, that are then transported into <italic>M. oryzae</italic> by hexose transporters for metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Talbot, 2010</xref>). We reasoned that in a mixed population, an invertase mutant may behave as a ‘cheat’ because it can exploit the monosaccharides liberated by invertase-secreting individuals. Here we test the competitive displacement anti-virulence strategy by investigating how fungal virulence is affected in mixed population of cooperators and cheats exhibiting different levels of virulence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>First, we set out to determine whether invertase production is a cooperative trait in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. To do this we generated a mutant, Δ<italic>inv1</italic>, by targeted deletion of the <italic>INV1</italic> gene (MGG_05785), which encodes the major invertase activity in the wild type strain of the fungus, Guy11, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). This is, to our knowledge, the first invertase mutant generated in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. However, the gene deletion of <italic>INV1</italic> that we created synthetically could potentially occur in nature because mutation, gene deletion and transposon-mediated gene disruption are all frequently found in wild populations of the fungus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonman, 1992</xref>). Moreover, natural fungal populations have been reported to show a high degree of intra-specific diversity in invertase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Naumov et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El-Said, 2002</xref>), suggesting that variation in this trait occurs in the wild.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18678.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Invertase production in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> is a cooperative trait.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Δ<italic>inv1</italic> has growth defects on sucrose minimal media, with functional complementation restoring invertase synthesis and growth morphology of Δ<italic>inv1:INV1</italic>, confirming the function of <italic>INV1</italic>.

As predicted by social evolution theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frank, 1998</xref>), the non-producers also gain a fitness advantage in mixed populations, by exploiting the public good generated by the producer, while avoiding the cost of its production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Furthermore, in sufficiently structured environments, the producer can gain a selective advantage when it is rare in a population consisting predominantly of non-producers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In this case the fitness of the producer is negative-frequency-dependent and the coexistence of both producers and non-producers is possible at intermediate frequency. This is consistent with previously studied invertase production systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacLean et al., 2010</xref>). The fitness measure used to produce frequency dependence plots assumes constant fitness differences between competitors and therefore is not necessarily a predictor of long-term equilibrium frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">(Ribeck and Lenski, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Invertase production can also be considered an exploitable social trait during plant infections, with <italic>INV1</italic> contributing to <italic>M. oryzae</italic> fitness and virulence. The △<italic>inv1</italic> mutant showed dramatically reduced fitness during plant infections when present in isolation, as measured by conidial production at the end of an infection cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and also exhibited lower virulence, measured by the area of disease lesion coverage of an infected leaf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These lesions are symptomatic of rice blast disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wilson and Talbot, 2009</xref>) and are a direct sign of damage inflicted upon the host, affecting host growth and survival. In mixed infections, live cell imaging of diseased rice tissue showed that the two isogenic strains, which expressed green and red fluorescent protein-encoding reporter genes to allow them to be easily distinguished from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), infected the same or neighbouring host plant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). This suggests that Δ<italic>inv1</italic> mutants are able access the public good generated by a co-infecting producer, Guy11. In addition, Δ<italic>inv1</italic> had a selective advantage over the producer in mixed infections (relative fitness of Δ<italic>inv1</italic> at 20% initial frequency was <italic>v</italic> = 2.11 ± 0.28 s.e.m. n = 32), suggesting that invertase production is costly and can therefore be exploited by a non-producer.

Infection studies were conducted over nine days following an entire rotation in a polycyclic disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), using infection assays that are comparable to wild infections (see Materials and methods). According to all prior theory and in vivo infection experiments, we expected that the virulence of the population would decrease in such an infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harrison et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rumbaugh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pollitt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Köhler et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckling and Brockhurst, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crespi et al., 2014</xref>). Strikingly, we observed the opposite result. Indeed, infecting populations composed of just the highly virulent strain were not the fittest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>), compared to the mixed infections. We then tested if this increased fitness in mixed infections translated into more damage to the host. Again, infecting populations comprised exclusively of the highly virulent invertase producers were not the most virulent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, introducing less virulent non-producers into a population of highly virulent producers can lead to an increase in the production of new spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and crucially to an increase in the damage to the host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), compared to infections consisting only of the highly virulent producers. Moreover, the new spores generated at the end of the mixed infection, which instigate a new infection cycle, contained both producer and non-producer strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>We next set out to understand why our observations contradict the current understanding behind virulence reduction strategies. We postulated that this might result from multiple-interacting social traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacLean et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Taylor, 2009</xref>). The impact of public goods on virulence has only ever been considered in isolation, without considering the influence of additional social dilemmas facing the pathogen. We reasoned that alongside public goods production, <italic>M. oryzae</italic> faces a second social dilemma of self-restraint or ‘tragedy of the commons’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hardin, 1968</xref>), which requires a pathogen to convert available resources into energy slowly but efficiently, as opposed to rapidly and inefficiently. When we investigated this possibility, we found evidence of a rate-efficiency trade-off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>) whereby faster-growing populations were less efficient in spore production per unit of carbon resource (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting a tragedy of the commons scenario can occur in sugar utilisation by the pathogen during plant infection. The multi-trait interactions matter most if one considers the spatial and temporal trajectory of population growth. When producers are common, invertase production is expected to result in a large spike, both spatial and temporal, in available glucose. This would enable rapid but inefficient growth of the pathogen. However, if a fraction of non-producers is introduced into the population, the glucose spike around producers in the vicinity of non-producers would be smaller, such that the population would consume finite resources more efficiently. This would lead to fitter and more virulent populations, as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref>.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18678.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Multi-trait interactions during sucrose metabolism by <italic>M. oryzae.</italic></title><p>In addition to public good invertase production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we found evidence of a rate-efficiency trade-off where resources are used less efficiently when abundant, applicable to growth on glucose (•) (<italic>ρ</italic> = −0.8, p&lt;0.0001, Spearman rank correlation, significance level α = 0.0005) and sucrose (o) (<italic>ρ</italic> = −0.5, p&lt;0.05, Spearman rank correlation, significance level α = 0.0025).

To test this idea, we generated a mathematical model incorporating both social traits and taking into account the inherently spatial nature of plant infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–d</xref>; for model details see Appendix 1B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The model successfully produced the unexpected empirical result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>) and also predicted that the presence of the second social dilemma is key to observing such an outcome. Namely, by removing the self-restraint constraint from the model, we recover the initially expected result, whereby populations consisting entirely of producers are fitter than populations containing a mixture of producers and non-producers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harrison et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rumbaugh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pollitt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckling and Brockhurst, 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). The same outcome was achieved by neutralising the influence of the rate-efficiency trade-off in spatially homogeneous environments where resources are shared equally between competitors, thus preventing the formation of glucose spikes around producers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>).</p><p>To test the mathematical predictions of our model experimentally, we used an in vitro environment in which spatial structure and resource use efficiency could be manipulated. We found that when <italic>M. oryzae</italic> was grown in spatially structured environments containing sucrose as the sole sugar in concentrations for which a rate-efficiency trade-off is effective (1%), the pathogen population fitness was maximised when it contained a mixture of producers and non-producers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). This is consistent with both infection observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and predictions of the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The result also suggests that enhanced fitness of mixed infections is not caused by compensatory up-regulation of genes in non-producers, targeting other host nutrients. In a sucrose concentration (0.01%) where the growth rate is relatively low and so the rate-efficiency trade-off will be weak or non-existent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we observed that the pathogen fitness was no longer amplified when non-producers were present in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), as predicted again by our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). The spatial structure of the fungus can be restricted through resource homogenization by supplying resources in the form of glucose (1% w/v) instead of sucrose and hence preventing glucose spikes around producers to occur, or through liquid culture in sucrose-containing growth medium (1% w/v). Consistent with the model predictions, the fitness advantage of mixed populations was lost in terms of biomass production (liquid cultures, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) and conidia production (resource homogenization, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Since invertase production in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> is sucrose-induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) producers do not pay the cost of invertase production and therefore do not suffer a reduction in fitness compared to non-producers in glucose environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18678.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Population fitness of INV1 producing Guy11 and the Δ<italic>inv1</italic> mutant in axenic and mixed-strain populations of intermediate frequencies.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>, <bold>d</bold>) Populations were established by inoculation with 1×10<sup>5</sup> conidia with varying initial frequencies of invertase producers and non-producers, with population fitness being assessed by the number of conidia recovered per plate.

While a mixture of public good cooperators and cheats has been found to maximize microbial fitness in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacLean et al., 2010</xref>), our study shows for the first time that this can be observed in a host-pathogen infection system. A major consequence of this observation is that any competitive displacement virulence reduction strategy that targets the secreted products of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerding et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cotty, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cotty and Bayman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korolev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jansen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crespi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foster, 2005</xref>) can fail due to complex multi-level interactions between strains that individually show different levels of virulence. It is therefore critical to define and understand cooperative and competitive interactions that must occur within heterogeneous pathogen populations when designing such virulence reduction strategies. This is specifically relevant for systems where pathogens secrete virulence factors into the public domain making them exploitable by non-secretors, rather than delivering virulence factors into individual host cells.</p><p>Our findings were derived using infection studies with a synthetic community of the well-studied plant pathogenic fungus <italic>M. oryzae</italic> and the tractability of the rice-fungal interaction enabled us to identify a potential mechanism that could explain the unexpected result. Based on previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacLean et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Taylor, 2009</xref>), we postulated that the interactions between two social traits, public goods production and self-restraint, may collectively increase virulence of the pathogen population. Our mathematical model and the subsequent experimental verifications are all consistent with this idea, making multi-trait interactions a credible mechanism to explain the failure of a virulence reduction strategy, based on the introduction of a reduced virulence mutant into a pathogen population.</p><p>Due to the inherent complexity of in vivo infection systems, there may of course be other mechanisms at play. One can, for example, consider a hypothetical alternative mechanism behind the amplified virulence we observed in mixed strain infections. While the invertase mutant is less virulent alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), the mutant might be able to use the metabolic energy saved from not producing invertase to increase its relative fitness, for example to fuel production of alternative virulence factors when co-infecting with the invertase-producing strain. However, this is very challenging to verify experimentally. Contrary to this scenario, the mechanism we propose has been successfully tested in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Specifically, we recover the synergy between invertase producers and non-producers when there is an interaction between public good production and a rate-efficiency trade off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). When we removed the interaction between these traits, this synergy was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–d</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, the mechanism we identified is not unique to our fungal pathogen system and may therefore have wide potential applicability for disease management, because multi-trait cooperative interactions are present in both fungal and bacterial infection. For instance, the vast majority of fungi are reliant upon feeding by secreting public goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">James et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Richards and Talbot, 2013</xref>). This, coupled with the ubiquity of rate-efficiency tradeoffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pfeiffer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beardmore et al., 2011</xref>), means that most fungal pathogens are expected to face the same multi-level social interactions as <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. Moreover, pathogenic bacteria employ multiple social traits such as secretion of extracellular signaling molecules responsible for the production and secretion of virulence related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pirhonen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee and Lee, 2010</xref>). Indeed, some bacterial populations containing a mixture of public good producers and non-producers have been found to grow better in vitro than pure producer populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In addition, our findings are potentially relevant to newly proposed cancer treatments. Tumour cells produce public goods in the form of secreted growth factors or angiogenic factors to gain access to nutrients. Treatments that promote non-producing cheats or deploy anti-angiogenic drugs have been proposed as a strategy to weaken tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korolev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jansen et al., 2015</xref>). However, tumour cells are likely to experience a tragedy of the commons through rapid glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gillies and Gatenby, 2007</xref>) - given the biophysical necessity of rate-efficiency trade-offs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, suggested treatments that disrupt cooperation and promote the evolution of non-cooperators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korolev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jansen et al., 2015</xref>) might result in an increase in tumour fitness, analogous to the observations in this study, leading to devastating consequences for the host.</p><p>Finally, in light of the antibiotic resistance crisis, there is a growing interest in synthetic biology therapies for the treatment of infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ruder et al., 2011</xref>). Engineering viruses that lower pathogen virulence, for example, is being investigated for control of plant diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nuss, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kanhayuwa et al., 2015</xref>) and was recently developed in vitro for bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lu and Collins, 2007</xref>). Similarly, synthetic low-virulence strains have been used in animal infection models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harrison et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rumbaugh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pollitt et al., 2014</xref>) and suggested as a treatment of plant pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frey et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cleveland et al., 1990</xref>). Moreover, with the development of genome editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9, the creation of low virulence strains to treat disease could very soon be a feasible strategy for a wide range of systems. This study provides a mechanistic foundation for the analysis of why such disease control strategies may fail unless social interactions between micro-organisms are fully considered.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fungal strains, growth conditions, and DNA analysis</title><p>Strains of <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> in this study are derived from the wild-type Guy-11 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leung et al., 1990</xref>) and the subsequently generated GFP expressing (<italic>ToxAp:SGFP</italic>) strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sesma and Osbourn, 2004</xref>).

Based on the previous theoretical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacLean et al., 2010</xref>) we postulate that this observation is driven by the presence of two social traits. The first trait is the extracellular production of a public good, invertase, that breaks down a complex sugar (sucrose) into simple sugars (hexose). The second social trait is intracellular self-restraint, and relates to the efficiency with which a cell exploits newly-acquired simple sugars.</p><p>To test this, we develop a mathematical model of invertase production in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> with the pathogen growth constrained by a rate-efficiency trade-off.

parameters values and the shape of the rate-efficiency functions in the above table were chosen to reflect the values obtained empirically for an invertase production system in <italic>S. cereviseae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pfeiffer et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The cost of invertase production for <italic>M. oryzae</italic> was chosen to be lower than previously estimated for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacLean et al., 2010</xref>). This lower cost experienced can be attributed to the secretome of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> predicted to be much larger than that of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> both in terms of total gene products (1885 compared to 424) and as a proportion of total genes (14.51% compared to 6.32%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2010</xref>) meaning that the burden of metabolising a single product would be proportionally less. In addition, invertase production by <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is regulated by the experienced glucose environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dodyk and Rothstein, 1964</xref>), whereas for <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, we found it to be upregulated in sucrose environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> of the main text). Therefore, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> may produce invertase wastefully in a manner that increases its overall cost because it is produced in environments which yield no products.</p><p>While the diffusion coefficients have not been obtained empirically we find that the model results are robust to changes in these parameter values as long as they are in a range which allows for sufficient spatial interactions between the producers and non-producers.</p><p>The outcome in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref> could be explained by the fact that when producers are common, the invertase production results in a large spike, both spatial and temporal, in hexose. This enables rapid but inefficient growth. However if a fraction of non-producers is introduced into the population the hexose spike around producers that are in a vicinity of non-producers is smaller, so that the population burns finite resources more efficiently.</p><p>Next, to test that the synergy between public goods production and self-restraint drives the result shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>, we remove the effect of the rate-efficiency trade-off from the model leaving only the public goods dilemma at play. In particular we assume that the efficiency of the hexose pathway (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf194"><mml:msup><mml:mi mathsize="111%">η</mml:mi><mml:mi mathsize="111%">H</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>) is a constant and find that the model predictions revert to the classical finding whereby total population size is maximised for populations containing only producers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). In this case, the hexose spike created by the producers does not lead to inefficient growth due to the absence of the rate-efficiency trade-off. Note that apart from physically removing the rate-efficiency trade-off from the model, inefficient growth can also be avoided by assuming a low initial sucrose concentration (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf195"><mml:msub><mml:mi mathsize="111%">S</mml:mi><mml:mn mathsize="111%">0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) in the environment.</p><p>Moreover, in spatially homogeneous environments both producers and non-producers share resources equally. Therefore the boost of efficiency in resource consumption observed on the boundary between producers and non-producer in spatially structured environments, will not take place in the absence of spatial structure. Indeed, performing simulations of the model (1) in spatially homogeneous environments (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf196"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathsize="111%">D</mml:mi><mml:mi mathsize="111%">S</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo mathsize="111%">=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathsize="111%">D</mml:mi><mml:mi mathsize="111%">H</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo mathsize="111%">=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathsize="111%">D</mml:mi><mml:mi mathsize="111%">N</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo mathsize="111%">=</mml:mo><mml:mn mathsize="111%">0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) we again recover the result that the total population size is maximised for a population containing only producers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>).</p><p>Since the initial sucrose concentration and spatial structure can be manipulated for in vitro environments, this enabled us to experimentally verify the qualitative predictions of our model (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of the main text).</p></sec></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="article-commentary" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18678.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kant</surname><given-names>Merijn R</given-names></name><role>Reviewing editor</role><aff id="aff3"><institution>University of Amsterdam</institution>, <country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior editor), Merijn Kant (Reviewing editor), and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript by Lindsay and colleagues makes key advances in understanding the role of social interactions in the context of pathogenic infections. The study demonstrates that invertase expression is a cooperative behavior that is subject to the spread of non-producing mutants. In addition, the authors were able to show that low levels of this mutant actually increases both virulence and pathogen population size in the plant host.</p><p>While we agreed that the data are intriguing, we did not always agree on the soundness of the data interpretation or on the urgency of additional experiments to support these interpretations. There was no consensus on the question if the evidence for frequency-dependent selection was sufficiently convincing and we would have preferred a more detailed exploration of the frequency dependence across a broader range of frequencies. However, the outcome of the discussion was that the majority of the referees felt that additional experiments will not be necessary. Therefore, we ask for textual changes and some minor changes in your analyses.</p><p>1) We feel it is important to check whether the parameter values that emerge from adjusting the model to obtain the behavior in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> are reasonable. We realize that not all the parameters are known or can be inferred. However, we ask you to add a discussion of whether each parameter value is in the range of what is physically or biologically reasonable, judging for example from values that are known for similar systems.</p><p>2) A substantial part of the referee discussion revolved around the question if this invertase can be called a virulence factor or not. This element is clearly confusing and therefore distracting. In literature, some authors discriminate two types of virulence: (I) 'direct virulence factors' that directly interact with the host to get the infection done and (II) 'indirect virulence factors' that influence the wellbeing of the pathogen in the infection site-environment (to cope with the physical conditions, host factors, etc.) and thus also influence pathogen virulence but indirectly. We feel the invertase qualifies as &quot;indirect virulence factor&quot;. For example see Figure 6 in Siddiqui &amp; Khan (2012), Parasites &amp; Vectors 5: 6. We ask you to make this explicit in the Introduction around the third paragraph.</p><p>3) In relation to point 2 we feel it will be useful to indicate that the public-good scenario you sketch – i.e. increased virulence when the strains are mixed – may not happen to pathogens that use a different infection strategy: the public-good scenario may be realistic for pathogens that deposit their virulence factors (the direct or indirect ones) into the public domain but may not be realistic for pathogens that inject virulence factors directly into individual host cells. Mentioning this in one or two sentences will suffice.</p><p>4) We also discussed the following alternative scenario that could explain your data. It could be that the invertase knock-out mutation affects virulence negatively 'simply' because the mutant is less 'healthy/fit' than the wildtype. When mixed with the non-mutated wildtype the latter may compensate for the mutant's defect via the public good. The mutant may now even have more energy available (since it is not making the invertase) to fuel its virulence, than the wildtype. This may increase the overall virulence – in principle independent from food competition – and also in a frequency dependent manner. Since the referees did not agree on the urgency of including this alternative scenario already from the start in your manuscript or only later on, we decided to ask you to address it in the Discussion and there to explain why you feel that the scenario you sketch in the fourth paragraph of the Introduction is more plausible than this alternative.</p><p>5) We feel that the current title too much suggests that there is causality between the &quot;low virulence&quot; of the mutant and the increase in the population's virulence when mixed. For accuracy we ask you to replace &quot;low virulence strains&quot; with &quot;public good mutants&quot; (also in the Abstract).</p><p>6) We ask you to change 'correctly predicts' in the Abstract with 'suggests';</p><p>7) We ask you to replace 'non-producing cheats' in the third and fourth paragraphs of the Introduction with 'non-producing mutants' (because 'cheaters' in the absence of non-cheaters do not cheat);</p><p>8) We noticed some quite one-sided t-tests (e.g. legends of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) but it is not clear why these are one-sided. Please replace them with two-sided tests or motivate this choice within the manuscript text.</p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Harbouring low virulence cheats within a pathogen population increases both fitness and virulence&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Merijn Kant as the Reviewing Editor and Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David Queller and Stephen Diggle. A further reviewer remains anonymous. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work in its present form will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The referees were fascinated by the observation that a mix of invertase and non-invertase producing fungi causes more damage to a plant host than the wild type fungus alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The referees agreed that this observation is worth perusing and that it could have consequences, for example, for virulence therapy. However, there were substantial concerns regarding the manuscript's framing and the robustness of some of the analyses. Since these concerns may require a substantial amount of work and may affect conclusions we have decided we have to reject your manuscript in its current form. However, we would welcome a revised version in which these concerns have been addressed. I will summarize the main points of discussion below:</p><p>1) A large part of the Discussion was dedicated to the question if the invertase is a virulence factor or not – and thus if the mutant really is a virulence cheat – and to which extent this matters for your story. The title reads as if you consider the mutant to be a 'virulence cheat' and later on you refer to the invertase as 'a social virulence factor' but overall you're a bit vague with respect to what virulence exactly means within the context of your work; to which extent the cheater is cheating the virulence process and how this all relates to the observed changes pathogenicity. Clarifying this may come down to merely reframing/rephrasing but this ambiguity was very distracting.</p><p>2) The second issue may be a bit more complicated. It was unclear to us why you refer to the mutant as a cheater. Although we agree that the mutant does not contribute to the production a common good, it can only be considered a cheater when this 'non-cooperation' would increase its fitness relative to the non-cheaters. We did not find this back in your data (e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> conidia production at 0 and at 1 are equal) and therefore we would like you to justify this term much more explicitly on the basis of the existing or new data.</p><p>3) The third issue concerns how you parameterized the cooperation model. It was unclear to us to which extent the parameters are realistic or not and this is important since it determines the strength of the second half of the paper on the rate-yield tradeoff. Hence, the parameterization needs to be justified.</p><p>4) Finally, we feel that you are too unclear on several descriptives such as sample sizes, experimental design and on your choice for statistical tests. These things need to be presented clearer. This is especially important because the statistical significance of your key result is borderline. Nevertheless, we are willing to accept the key observation as it is, as long as you (can) explain in the text how everything was randomized properly (otherwise you could get a low p because observations were not all independent). Still we would like you to consider repeating the key experiment to get more confidence on the statistical significance in order to strengthen your claim on its biological significance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>With the rise in antibiotic resistance, new strategies to control pathogens are needed. Anti-virulence drugs and strategies such as using 'cheats' to treat infection are two new approaches to tackle the problems we face. Given this, it is always interesting to see a new paper in this area. This new paper suggests we should be cautious in applying anti-virulence techniques because there may be unexpected outcomes as is depicted here.</p><p>The finding that mixed infections of cheats and wild-types results in higher virulence is interesting but I have a major issue where I need some convincing. The authors have chosen to work with invertase which liberates carbon sources from plant tissue. I have no issues that invertase can be considered a public good but it's the role in virulence and interpretation of the results that I question.</p><p>Invertase mutants grow poorly in a plant and this might be expected as they cannot gain easy access to the carbon source they need to grow. Conversely invertase producers grow well. In mixed cultures, invertase mutants appear to be able to grow and exploit the carbon sources liberated by the producers within the plant. Again, this might be expected if you are showing that invertase is a public good exploitable by cheats.</p><p>The interesting finding is then that the virulence of mixed cultures increases. The paper then cautions against using an anti-virulence approach with cheats because here we find an opposite effect. But invertase is not (as far as I know) a virulence factor which damages the host; it helps to promote growth. All the damage to the host will likely be due to specialised virulence factors which presumably the invertase mutant itself can make. So essentially, in a mixed culture, everyone is making virulence factors so the virulence is at least as damaging as a mono-producer infection.</p><p>In my opinion, for a true test of whether an anti-virulence strategy works or does not work, you would ideally create a mutant in a known toxin, or a system that directly regulates toxins. Happy to discuss.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Invasion of a cooperative infective bacterial population by non-cooperative &quot;cheater&quot; bacteria has been frequently discussed in recent literature as a way to reduce virulence, as an alternative to antibiotic therapy. This manuscript, which uses an experimental system consisting of infections of rice plants by the fungus <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, suggests that the introduction of cheaters can actually enhance virulence in some cases, and suggests a possible explanation for this in terms of an interplay between different cooperative traits.</p><p>Specifically, a mutant of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> was generated which fails to produce invertase, but can use invertase produced by wild type cells. Under some conditions introduction of a subpopulation of this mutant was found to increase the virulence of a rice plant infection. To explain this the authors invoke a rate-efficiency tradeoff. They suggest that, in an infection, wild type <italic>M. oryzae</italic> cells produce a large spike of glucose close to them, which they then use inefficiently, producing a relatively small number of spores. However, if cheater cells are present (which do not release glucose) the glucose spike is smaller, meaning that the cells grow more efficiently and produce more spores.</p><p>I find the first observation (that introduction of cheaters can increase virulence) interesting, since as the authors note, it contradicts established theory. However, I was not totally convinced by the explanation given for this phenomenon, in terms of the rate-efficiency tradeoff. I feel that to properly demonstrate this as the explanation, more work would need to be done.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) I would have liked a clearer definition of virulence, and a clearer distinction of how virulence is distinct from fitness. I realize that the experimental measurements of these two quantities are different, but from a theoretical point of view they seem to be assumed to be more or less interchangeable; indeed it is stated in the Introduction that &quot;since public goods aid microbial growth it also affects the extent of damage.…&quot;. However virulence factors are specific attributes of a bacterium that cause damage to a host and they can themselves be public goods (e.g. exoenzymes). I felt that a deeper discussion of the distinction between virulence and fitness was needed in the Introduction.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> does not seem to show what the authors claim it shows. Rather than showing a negative frequency-dependent fitness of the non-producers (cheats) it seems to show the producer fitness. If this figure is indeed as printed then it seems to show that the producer is more fit when at low density, which is completely contradictory to social evolution theory.</p><p>3) One important test of whether the mutant is behaving as a cheater is that it should outcompete the wild type in mixed cultures, due to the cost of public goods production. Data is given for this for in vivo infections (Results) but only for one initial cheat frequency. Surely this should also be demonstrated for in vitro growth assays (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and for a wider range of initial cheat frequencies?</p><p>4) The key result is that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which shows that the number of spores produced is greater for a mixed infection with 20% cheats than for a wild-type infection (although it is lower for higher cheat frequencies). To explain this the authors show that there is a rate-efficiency tradeoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which they hypothesize could cause the observed effect due to changes in the size of the glucose spike around the infective population. However, there are multiple reasons why I feel that this explanation is not properly demonstrated:</p><p>No comparison is made between the glucose concentrations at which the tradeoff is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and the likely concentrations proximal to an infection in the rice plant.</p><p>No calculations are made of how much the glucose concentration is likely to be reduced by the presence of the cheaters (this could be done in a simple empirical way using literature values for invertase rates etc.).</p><p>In the mathematical model, parameters are chosen to obtain the desired effect (as stated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and no attempt is made to compare these to known values. For example diffusion constants for the sugars: are these realistic? (incidentally the units for these diffusion constants are not properly stated in the table).</p><p>The results of the mathematical model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel b) are hard to compare to the experimental results because they are not plotted together and the experimental data (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) is given on a log scale whereas the model results are linear.</p><p>5) I did not follow the rationale of removing spatial heterogeneity by replacing sucrose by glucose (Results, last paragraph): wouldn't this just remove the need for invertase altogether and totally change the relevant social interactions?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper shows, in a rice-fungus system, how diluting a virulent pathogen with a less virulent one can sometimes lead to greater virulence. It uses experiments and modeling to attribute this effect to the joint action of two different social traits. The result is taken as a caution against indiscriminate use of a dilution strategy to reduce virulence.</p><p>The framing of the seems a bit disingenuous, making the result seem more surprising than I think it really was. Although this is a different species than the yeast used in MacLean et al. 2010, it is the same sucrose system and a very similar result (for population fitness, though not virulence). Yet the summary and Introduction read as if this prior study did not exist, instead springing the result and the explanation as a surprise. Still, this is an interesting extension in that it documents the phenomenon for pathogen virulence where it may have some practical relevance.</p><p>The main empirical result of the paper is that one of the mixtures (20:80) has higher virulence than the 100% virulent strain treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). I like the attention given to the fact that this requires a multiple-comparisons Bonferroni correction because there are four relevant comparisons (though I don't think you need all the Boolean algebra in the supplement to make this point). But I do have a little trouble with some aspects of the key p&lt;0.04 result. Where does the n=42 come from? That seems to imply n=7 for each of the 6 treatments (or is that n=21 for each of the two last treatments)? But <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> seems to disagree, showing 20 pictures from each of the three pictured treatments. And what were the 3 separate experiments that were pooled to get this figure? A key issue is whether they balanced by treatment – you wouldn't want all of 20-80's in one block for example. That figure also reports a 2-sided t-test in contrast to the 1-sided Mann-Whitney U in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Aren't these testing the same comparison and, if so, why are they treated differently?</p><p>I would have liked to have seen this key result repeated. It is barely significant. I concede that if p&lt;0.05 is our standard, then I shouldn't demand a repeat every time a result comes close to that. But in this case, if you look at all the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, from 0% Guy11 to 100%, they look oddly behaved. The change in conidia is irregular, first no change, then increase, decrease, increase, and decease. Doesn't that make you a little suspicious that the 20-80 result could be a fluke? You could get that kind of weird fluctuation if not everything was randomized among treatments, such as the spatial position of the plants, so a statement on randomization would be useful.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> is not a repeat of the same experiment as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, is it? It seems to show the same overall up-down-up-down pattern, but I can't match up either the conidia values reported in the two figures or the sample sizes. It's very confusing. Why aren't you doing your key Boolean/Bonferroni test of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> on this set of data, which appears to be larger?</p><p>The quadratic curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> does not really establish that there is a maximum. Yes, the quadratic fit is demonstrably better than a linear one, but that doesn't mean that this quadratic curve is the real curve. Is it significantly better than a curve that saturates for the two highest values? The real test is the kind that you did earlier, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18678.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] While we agreed that the data are intriguing, we did not always agree on the soundness of the data interpretation or on the urgency of additional experiments to support these interpretations.

We have addressed this point by including clarification of the definitions of ‘direct’ and ‘indirect virulence factors’ in general (Introduction, third paragraph) and also making explicit that in this context invertase represents an indirect virulence factor (Introduction, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) In relation to point 2 we feel it will be useful to indicate that the public-good scenario you sketch – i.e. increased virulence when the strains are mixed – may not happen to pathogens that use a different infection strategy: the public-good scenario may be realistic for pathogens that deposit their virulence factors (the direct or indirect ones) into the public domain but may not be realistic for pathogens that inject virulence factors directly into individual host cells. Mentioning this in one or two sentences will suffice.</italic> </p><p>To acknowledge this point and clarify the consequences of our finding, we have now explained that multiple trait interactions would not be relevant for virulence factors which act “privately” (Discussion, first paragraph). It is correct, that our observations are concerned with virulence factors that act as public goods.</p><p><italic>4) We also discussed the following alternative scenario that could explain your data. It could be that the invertase knock-out mutation affects virulence negatively 'simply' because the mutant is less 'healthy/fit' than the wildtype. When mixed with the non-mutated wildtype the latter may compensate for the mutant's defect via the public good. The mutant may now even have more energy available (since it is not making the invertase) to fuel its virulence, than the wildtype. This may increase the overall virulence – in principle independent from food competition – and also in a frequency dependent manner. Since the referees did not agree on the urgency of including this alternative scenario already from the start in your manuscript or only later on, we decided to ask you to address it in the Discussion and there to explain why you feel that the scenario you sketch in the fourth paragraph of the Introduction is more plausible than this alternative.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for raising the point of a possible alternative mechanism for the synergistic effect that was observed during our study. We have considered this alternative scenario and judge that the evidence obtained to verify predictions made by our mathematical model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), does address the possibility of this alternative mechanism. We appreciate that this may have not been explicit enough during the Discussion. Therefore, we have now outlined the alternative hypothesis and explained our reasoning as to why our originally proposed mechanism is indeed the more plausible (Discussion, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>5) We feel that the current title too much suggests that there is causality between the &quot;low virulence&quot; of the mutant and the increase in the population's virulence when mixed. For accuracy we ask you to replace &quot;low virulence strains&quot; with &quot;public good mutants&quot; (also in the Abstract).</italic> </p><p>We have made the edits to the title and Abstract as suggested.</p><p><italic>6) We ask you to change 'correctly predicts' in the Abstract with 'suggests';</italic> </p><p>This has now been changed as requested.</p><p><italic>7) We ask you to replace 'non-producing cheats' in the third and fourth paragraphs of the Introduction with 'non-producing mutants' (because 'cheaters' in the absence of non-cheaters do not cheat);</italic> </p><p>These edits have been incorporated as suggested.</p><p><italic>8) We noticed some quite one-sided t-tests (e.g. legends of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) but it is not clear why these are one-sided. Please replace them with two-sided tests or motivate this choice within the manuscript text.</italic> </p><p>We have replaced these one-sided tests with two-sided tests.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>[…] Since these concerns may require a substantial amount of work and may affect conclusions we have decided we have to reject your manuscript in its current form. However, we would welcome a revised version in which these concerns have been addressed. I will summarize the main points of discussion below:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) A large part of the Discussion was dedicated to the question if the invertase is a virulence factor or not – and thus if the mutant really is a virulence cheat – and to which extent this matters for your story. The title reads as if you consider the mutant to be a 'virulence cheat' and later on you refer to the invertase as 'a social virulence factor' but overall you're a bit vague with respect to what virulence exactly means within the context of your work; to which extent the cheater is cheating the virulence process and how this all relates to the observed changes pathogenicity. Clarifying this may come down to merely reframing/rephrasing but this ambiguity was very distracting.</italic> </p><p>We apologise for the confusion. This has now been corrected throughout the manuscript and made consistent, as suggested by the editor. Our study demonstrates that invertase production in <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> conforms to the definition of a cooperative trait (details presented in the first three paragraphs of the Results section). In addition, we also demonstrate that invertase non-producers have lower virulence than invertase producers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, for clarity, previously used terminology &quot;low virulence cheats&quot; and &quot;high virulence cooperators&quot; has now consistently been replaced by &quot;low virulence public goods non-producers&quot; and &quot;high virulence public goods producers&quot;, respectively. Furthermore, we now consistently refer to &quot;cooperators&quot; and &quot;cheats&quot; only in the context of invertase production.</p><p>We have also changed the title to: &quot;Harbouring low virulence strains within a pathogen population can increase both fitness and virulence&quot;,and altered the Abstract accordingly, which we hope is now clearer and which we believe will avoid the confusion.</p><p>Moreover, we now clearly explain that the pathogen virulence is measured by the area of disease lesion coverage of an infected leaf. The lesions are symptoms of rice blast disease and are a direct sign of damage inflicted upon the host, affecting the growth and yield of the plant (Results, third paragraph).</p><p>Finally, our findings and the terminology regarding the invertase production in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, are consistent with other cooperative systems involving extracellular factors, such as siderophore production (Harrison et al., BMC Biology 2006), quorum sensing (Rumbaugh et al., Current Biology 2009) and toxin production (Raymond et al., Science 2012), where cooperators have been observed to have higher virulence than cheats.</p><p><italic>2) The second issue may be a bit more complicated. It was unclear to us why you refer to the mutant as a cheater. Although we agree that the mutant does not contribute to the production a common good, it can only be considered a cheater when this 'non-cooperation' would increase its fitness relative to the non-cheaters. We did not find this back in your data (e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> conidia production at 0 and at 1 are equal) and therefore we would like you to justify this term much more explicitly on the basis of the existing or new data.</italic> </p><p>As clarified above and throughout the manuscript, the invertase production in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> conforms to the definition of a cooperative trait (details presented in the first three paragraphs of the Results section) and therefore the invertase producer is termed a cooperator while the invertase non-producer is termed a cheat (Results, fourth paragraph).</p><p>Moreover, as requested by the Editor we now include an additional data set showing that, consistent with cooperation theory, the invertase non-producer (the <italic>cheat)</italic> increases its fitness relative to the invertase producer (the <italic>cooperator)</italic> in environments where cheats are found in the vicinity of cooperators (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This is in addition to the finding that the non-producer has a selective advantage over the producer in mixed plant infections (Results, third paragraph).</p><p>The old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> (now moved to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) showed that in sufficiently structured environments, producers and non-producers can coexist, which has also been observed in other invertase cooperation systems (MacLean et al., PloS Biology 2010).</p><p>To be completely clear, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> shows population fitness in glucose (not sucrose). Invertase production in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, however, is sucrose-induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, the concern raised that &quot;conidia production at 0 and 1 frequency of producers is equal&quot; is for growth in glucose, where both strains grow equally well. As such, this data is not relevant when ascertaining the fitness advantage of non-producers over producers, which can only be determined for <italic>M. oryzae</italic> based on growth in sucrose. This has now been clarified (Results, eighth paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) The third issue concerns how you parameterized the cooperation model. It was unclear to us to which extent the parameters are realistic or not and this is important since it determines the strength of the second half of the paper on the rate-yield tradeoff. Hence, the parameterization needs to be justified.</italic> </p><p>The reason for developing a mathematical model was so that we would have a tool for generating testable predictions regarding the mechanisms driving our in plantainfection results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.</p><p>The model needed to capture key features of our experimental system, but it also needed to be sufficiently simple so that we could manipulate and probe the spatio-temporal dynamics of extracellular enzymes, resource concentrations and pathogen population densities. This is vital for generating testable predictions (as discussed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>).</p><p>Given the complexities inherent to in plantainfection studies, the parameters in our model were not inferred from empirical data obtained through these experiments. Instead, we used previous work (MacLean et al., PloS Biology 2010) to identify a parameter range for the model that produced behaviour consistent with the key observation of the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> system shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Those parameters were used because the model qualitatively captured the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, and did so for a certain neighbourhood around this point in parameter space. Given this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we then explored parameter changes that could destroy this result, meaning moving outwards towards the boundary of that neighbourhood in parameter space.</p><p>From doing this, we predicted that the interaction between resource availability aided by invertase production and the rate-efficiency trade-off is a driver of the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>. We say this because this result can be destroyed in the model simulations by (1) weakening the impact of the trade-off on pathogen growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or by (2) altering the spatial structure of the environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Since (1) and (2) can be manipulated in vitro, we subsequently conducted experiments with <italic>M. oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-D</xref>) and the outcome was consistent with the model predictions. This experimental verification is, we claim, what determines &quot;the strength of the second half of the paper&quot; as it provides empirical evidence of the role of multiple social interactions between pathogens in the success of a virulence reduction strategy.</p><p>A more detailed description of the modelling procedure and its main purpose is now included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) Finally, we feel that you are too unclear on several descriptives such as sample sizes, experimental design and on your choice for statistical tests. These things need to be presented clearer. This is especially important because the statistical significance of your key result is borderline. Nevertheless, we are willing to accept the key observation as it is, as long as you (can) explain in the text how everything was randomized properly (otherwise you could get a low p because observations were not all independent). Still we would like you to consider repeating the key experiment to get more confidence on the statistical significance in order to strengthen your claim on its biological significance.</italic> </p><p>We have now addressed all of these points. Sample sizes are now clarified in Materials and methods section (subsection “Pathogenicity and in planta fitness assay of M. oryzae”, second and third paragraphs). We use a standard notation &quot;n&quot; to denote the number of replicates per each condition tested. In particular, in plantainfection experiment determining the number of conidia per lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) has n=42 replicates per each of the 6 conditions assessed, totalling 252 data points (i.e. disease lesions assessed). On the other hand, a different in plantainfection experiment determining the size of disease lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) has n=20 replicates per each of the 3 conditions assessed, totalling 60 data points (i.e. disease lesions assessed).</p><p>The choice of statistical tests for pairwise comparisons was made based on whether the data satisfies a normal distribution and/or equal variance tests (detailed in subsection “Data Analysis”, second paragraph). For normally distributed data a 2-sample t-test (for either equal or unequal variances) was used, otherwise a Mann-Whitney U test was deployed.</p><p>Moreover, we also make a further clarification regarding the choice of statistical tests for multiple comparisons (detailed in subsection “Data Analysis”, third paragraph). If the data violated the assumptions of ANOVA, the non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test was performed, followed by two-sided Mann Whitney U test with Bonferroni corrections. Otherwise one-way ANOVA was used followed by two-sided t-test with Bonferonni corrections.</p><p>Our experimental design is now described in full in a new Supplementary file 3, demonstrating that the observations are independent of each other. We also stress the statistical significance of our two key results:</p><p>Result 1: Infecting populations composed of the highly virulent strain alone were not the fittest. This can be concluded from the in vivoinfection data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (p&lt;0.0365, two-sided Mann- Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction, n=42). Note that due to the nature of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, a non-parametric test was performed. To improve normality of the data and satisfy homogeneity of variance we also log-transform the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> as per previous studies involving microbial pathogens (Lu and Collins, PNAS 2007; Köhler et al., PloS Pathogens 2009, Raymond et al., Science 2012). Applying a parametric test to the log-transformed data increases the significance of Result 1 as detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> (p&lt;0.017, two-sided t-test with Bonferroni correction, n=42). We now report both analyses (subsection “Data Analysis”, fourth paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>Even more importantly for disease management</italic>, our study also shows that:</p><p>Result 2: <italic>Infecting populations composed of the highly virulent strain alone were not the most virulent.</italic> This can be concluded from the in vivoinfection data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> (p&lt;0.0032, two-sided t-test with unequal variances, n=20). Note that in this case the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> meets parametric test assumptions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
