nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Protein-coding genes regulated by FXR are well known, but whether FXR also acts through regulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which vastly outnumber protein-coding genes, remains unknown. Utilizing RNA-seq and global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) analyses in mouse liver, we found that FXR activation affects the expression of many RNA transcripts from chromatin regions bearing enhancer features. Among these we discovered a previously unannotated liver-enriched enhancer-derived lncRNA (eRNA), termed FXR-induced non-coding RNA (<italic>Fincor</italic>). We show that <italic>Fincor</italic> is specifically induced by the hammerhead-type FXR agonists, including GW4064 and tropifexor. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated liver-specific knockdown of <italic>Fincor</italic> in dietary NASH mice reduced the beneficial effects of tropifexor, an FXR agonist currently in clinical trials for NASH and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), indicating that amelioration of liver fibrosis and inflammation in NASH treatment by tropifexor is mediated in part by <italic>Fincor</italic>. Overall, our findings highlight that pharmacological activation of FXR by hammerhead-type agonists induces a novel eRNA, <italic>Fincor</italic>, contributing to the amelioration of NASH in mice. <italic>Fincor</italic> may represent a new drug target for addressing metabolic disorders, including NASH.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, also known as NASH, is a severe condition whereby fat deposits around the liver lead to inflammation, swelling, scarring and lasting damage to the organ.

NAFLD begins with simple steatosis but may further progress to a severe form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and later, fatal cirrhosis and liver cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedman et al., 2018</xref>). Despite its striking global increase and clinical importance, there is no approved drug for NASH. The urgent need for development of therapeutic agents for NASH has greatly increased research interest in the nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evans and Mangelsdorf, 2014</xref>).</p><p>FXR is activated by its physiological ligands, bile acids (BAs), and regulates expression of genes involved in BA, lipid, and glucose metabolism and hepatic autophagy, which maintain metabolite levels and metabolic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calkin and Tontonoz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kliewer and Mangelsdorf, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seok et al., 2014</xref>). Ligand-activated FXR also protects against hepatic inflammation and liver injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). The action of FXR, similar to other nuclear receptors, is achieved primarily by its binding to chromatin loci to regulate the transcription of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calkin and Tontonoz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with its crucial physiological functions, FXR is increasingly recognized as a promising drug target, particularly for liver diseases, such as NASH and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abenavoli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ali et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Downes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kremoser, 2021</xref>). For example, semi-synthetic or non-steroidal synthetic agonists of FXR, including obeticholic acid (OCA) and hammerhead-type agonists, such as tropifexor and cilofexor, are currently in clinical trials for NASH and PBC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abenavoli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kremoser, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanyal et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tully et al., 2017</xref>). However, how pharmacological activation of FXR mediates such beneficial therapeutic effects is poorly understood.</p><p>Non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are one of the fascinating discoveries of modern biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cech and Steitz, 2014</xref>). While a significant portion of the genome was initially thought to be ‘junk DNA’, it has been established that many non-coding regions give rise to functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cech and Steitz, 2014</xref>). Of these ncRNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group of transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides and play important roles in diverse biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mattick et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sartorelli and Lauberth, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Statello et al., 2021</xref>). A group of lncRNAs are produced from genomic regions bearing epigenetic features of enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mattick et al., 2023</xref>). This is consistent with the idea that many transcriptional enhancers actively transcribe ncRNAs that are referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs, &gt;85k in humans and &gt;57k in mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirabayashi et al., 2019</xref>), some of which are functionally important for enhancer functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lai and Shiekhattar, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sartorelli and Lauberth, 2020</xref>). A majority of eRNAs have not yet been annotated in current lncRNA databases, such as GENCODE. Exploring eRNA landscapes and functions in diverse biology and disease states will facilitate our understanding of both lncRNAs and enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mattick et al., 2023</xref>). Indeed, the landscape of eRNAs in mouse liver has been minimally explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al., 2014</xref>), and has not been well studied in response to specific nuclear receptor activation, such as by FXR. Moreover, functional roles of eRNAs in vivo in intact organisms is understudied.</p><p>FXR was shown to regulate expression of small non-coding microRNA (miR) genes, e.g., <italic>Mir34a and Mir802</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seok et al., 2021</xref>), but it has not been reported whether FXR achieves its function through regulating lncRNAs, which far outnumber miRs. Because FXR directly regulates expression of its target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>), we examined if FXR regulates eRNAs, and if such transcripts participate in its physiological or pharmacological functions. By utilizing RNA-seq and global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) analyses of livers from mice treated with FXR ligands, we identified a set of FXR-regulated eRNAs. Among these, we focused on a highly induced and abundantly expressed eRNA that we referred to as FXR-induced non-coding RNA (<italic>Fincor</italic>) for functional studies. <italic>Fincor</italic> is highly enriched in mouse liver and is induced specifically by hammerhead-type FXR agonists, including GW4064 and tropifexor. In vivo studies utilizing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated liver-specific knockdown of <italic>Fincor</italic> in dietary NASH mice indicated that <italic>Fincor</italic> is critically involved in mediating the beneficial pharmacological effects of tropifexor in reducing liver fibrosis and inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activation of FXR by GW4064 induces a novel eRNA, <italic>Fincor</italic>, in mouse liver</title><p>To identify eRNAs potentially regulated by FXR, we first obtained a list of putative enhancers in mouse liver based on ENCODE H3K27ac ChIP-seq data (ENCFF001KMI, see Materials and methods). Then, we performed ribo-depleted total RNA-seq in the livers from mice treated with a specific FXR agonist, GW4064, to identify transcripts produced from these enhancer regions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). To avoid confounding issues of RNA signals from genes, we specifically focused on intergenic enhancer regions (±3 kb from H3K27ac peak center) that harbor discernible RNA-seq signals (RPKM &gt;1).</p><p>This genomic analysis resulted in identification of 190 high-confidence eRNAs in mouse liver. Among these, 14 eRNAs were upregulated and 5 were downregulated by GW4064 treatment (FDR &lt;0.05, log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt;1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). FXR-regulated eRNAs were produced adjacent to many genes with important roles in liver metabolism and disease, e.g., <italic>Hes1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). One of the most robustly induced eRNAs was <italic>Fincor</italic>, an unannotated novel transcript located on chromosome 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B, and C</xref>). Reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) confirmed that treatment with GW4064 substantially induced expression of <italic>Fincor,</italic> more than 10-fold in mouse liver, which is similar to induction of <italic>Nr0b2</italic>, a well-known FXR target gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Claudel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evans and Mangelsdorf, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goodwin et al., 2000</xref>).

Intriguingly, a recent study showed that the gene signature regulated by tropifexor-activated FXR appears to be broader than that of OCA, partly because the tropifexor backbone allows a more favorable interaction of FXR with coactivators or epigenomic modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hernandez et al., 2019</xref>). Further, tropifexor was shown to regulate distinct sets of genes in experimental NASH as compared to other FXR agonists, particularly genes involved in fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hernandez et al., 2019</xref>).

Total RNA from each liver was extracted by RNeasy kit (QIAGEN), and two randomly selected mice liver RNAs were pooled for RNA-seq (two RNA-seq reactions from four mice livers for either vehicle or treated group). RNA-seq was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seok et al., 2018</xref>). Ribosomal RNA was removed with the Ribozero HMR Gold kit (Illumina). The sequencing library was generated by the following methods described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Construction of strand-specific RNA-seq libraries</title><p>Construction of the RNA-seq libraries and sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 were performed at the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. After DNase digestion, purified total RNAs were analyzed on a Fragment Analyzer (Agilent) to evaluate RNA integrity. The total RNAs were converted into individually barcoded polyadenylated mRNA-seq libraries with the Kapa HyperPrep mRNA kit (Roche). Libraries were barcoded with Unique Dual Indexes which have been developed to prevent index switching. The adaptor-ligated double-stranded cDNAs were amplified by PCR for eight cycles with the Kapa HiFi polymerase (Roche). The final libraries were quantitated with Qubit (Thermo Fisher) and the average cDNA fragment sizes were determined on a Fragment Analyzer. The libraries were diluted to 10 nM and further quantitated by qPCR on a CFX Connect Real-Time qPCR system (Bio-Rad) for accurate pooling of barcoded libraries and maximization of number of clusters in the flowcell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Sequencing of libraries in the NovaSeq</title><p>The barcoded RNA-seq libraries were loaded on one SP lane on a NovaSeq 6000 for cluster formation and sequencing.

The fastq read files were generated and demultiplexed with the bcl2fastq v2.20 Conversion Software (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The quality of the demultiplexed fastq files was evaluated with the FastQC software, which generates reports with the quality scores, base composition, k-mer, GC and N contents, sequence duplication levels, and overrepresented sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>GRO-seq</title><p>To harvest the nuclei from mouse liver cells, the liver was harvested at indicated time and washed with a cold swelling buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 U/ml Superase-In). The nuclei were prepared by Dounce homogenization in cold swelling buffer and filtered using a cell strainer (100 μm, BD Biosciences). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 400 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, then resuspended in the lysis buffer (swelling buffer with 10% glycerol and 1% IGEPAL) and incubated on ice for 5 min.

The BrU-labeled run-on RNAs were extracted by TRIzol and purified by anti-BrdU agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech, sc-32323 AC). The run-on RNAs were then subjected to end repair by T4 PNK, poly-adenylation, and then to cDNA first strand synthesis by a custom primer (oNTI223) that allows circularization of the cDNA. This cDNA then was re-linearized by Ape1 (NEB), size selected by TBE gel electrophoresis, and the products of the desired size were excised (~320–350 bp) for final library prep and sequencing. GRO-seq samples were run on a NextSeq 500 sequencer from Illumina with a single-end 80 nt model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Histological analyses</title><p>For histology, tissues were dissected and immediately fixed in 10% formalin overnight and processed for paraffin embedding and H&amp;E staining.

They demonstrate that FincoR significantly enhances tropifexor's effectiveness in reducing liver fibrosis and inflammation in NASH, presenting it as a promising therapeutic target. The manuscript revisions broaden the study to include both mouse and human data, showing elevated FincoR levels in various mouse models of liver disease and identifying a similar lncRNA in humans, potentially indicating a conserved therapeutic mechanism.

The revised manuscript further strengthens this contribution by incorporating additional experiments and human relevance, summarized as follows: (1) The use of GRO-seq and RNA-seq technologies has provided an in-depth and unbiased view of the transcriptional alterations driven by the FXR agonist tropifexor, especially emphasizing FincoR's pivotal role. (2) The research expands on the original findings by including diverse mouse models of NAFLD/NASH and cholestatic liver injury. These models demonstrate significant increases in hepatic FincoR levels across various conditions, such as diets high in fat and fructose, chemical induction of liver cholestasis with ANIT, and surgical induction via bile duct ligation. This broadened scope underscores FincoR's involvement in liver disease mechanisms beyond the initial models of FXR knockout (KO) and FincoR liver-specific knockdown (FincoR-LKD). (3) Incorporation of tropifexor, an investigational FXR agonist in clinical trials, alongside these experimental models bridges experimental findings to potential therapeutic applications for NASH patients. (2) The manuscript revision includes promising data on the sequence similarity between mouse FincoR and a human locus, identifying a partially conserved human lncRNA (XR_007061585.1) with elevated levels in NAFLD and PBC patients. This addition enhances the study's relevance to human health. (3) The study's design, with the inclusion of both negative and positive controls and now enriched with a wider array of mouse models and human data, ensures that the observed therapeutic effects can be confidently attributed to FincoR's modulation by tropifexor.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors acknowledge that certain questions remain unanswered within the scope of this study on FincoR, due to feasibility and technical challenges. While it's important to note that such limitations are rooted in the practical and technical complexities, these unresolved issues might limit the study's immediate impact.

They identify a new liver-specific long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), FincoR, regulated by FXR, notably induced by agonists such as tropifexor. The study shows that FincoR plays a significant role in enhancing the efficacy of tropifexor in mitigating liver fibrosis and inflammation associated with NASH, suggesting its potential as a novel therapeutic target. The study makes a promising contribution to understanding the role of FincoR in alleviating liver fibrosis in NASH, providing initial insights into the mechanisms involved. While it offers a valuable starting point, there is potential for further exploration into the functional roles of FincoR and their specific actions in human NASH cases. Building upon the current findings to elucidate more detailed mechanistic pathways through which FincoR exerts its therapeutic effects in liver disease would elevate the research's significance and potential impact in the field.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study stands out for its comprehensive and unbiased approach to investigating the role of FincoR, a liver-specific lncRNA, in the treatment of NASH. Key strengths include: (1) The application of advanced sequencing methods like GRO-seq and RNA-seq offered a comprehensive and unbiased view of the transcriptional changes induced by tropifexor, particularly highlighting the role of FincoR. (2) Utilizing a genetic mouse model of FXR KO and a FincoR liver-specific knockdown (FincoR-LKD) mouse model provided a controlled and relevant environment for studying NASH, allowing for precise assessment of tropifexor's therapeutic effects. (3) The inclusion of tropifexor, an investigational new drug in clinical trials, adds significant clinical relevance to the study. It bridges the gap between experimental research and potential therapeutic application, providing a direct pathway for translating these findings into real-world clinical benefits for NASH patients. (4) The study's rigorous experimental design, incorporating both negative and positive controls, ensured that the results were specifically attributable to the action of FincoR and tropifexor.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The study presents several notable weaknesses that could be addressed to strengthen its findings and conclusions: (1) The authors focus on FincoR, but do not extensively test other lncRNAs identified in Figure 1A. A more comprehensive approach, such as rescue experiments with these lncRNAs, would provide a better understanding of whether similar roles are played by other lncRNAs in mitigating NASH. (2) FincoR was chosen for further study primarily because it is the most upregulated lncRNA induced by GW4064. Including another GW4064-induced lncRNA as a control in functional studies would strengthen the argument for FincoR's unique role in NASH. (3) The study does not conclusively demonstrate whether FincoR is specifically expressed in hepatocytes or other liver cell types. Conducting FincoR RNA-FISH with immunofluorescent experiments or RT-PCR, using markers for different liver cell types, would clarify its expression profile. (4) Understanding the absolute copy number of FincoR is crucial. Determining whether there are sufficient copies of FincoR to function as proposed would lend more credibility to its suggested role.

It is unclear if this eRNA is conserved in humans in any way, which will provide relevance to human disease.

We also value the constructive feedback provided by the reviewer and agree that additional studies are important to fully understand the mechanisms of FincoR and the functional significance of other FXR-induced lncRNAs. In this manuscript we report the discovery and initial characterization of FincoR, as well as its potential function in FXR action in response to hammerhead agonists, but a number of interesting questions are raised. Future experiments, as suggested by reviewer, will be needed to examine the role of other FXR-induced lncRNAs, the potential role of FincoR induction by other nuclear receptors with binding sites at FincoR, whether FincoR is expressed in liver cell types in addition to hepatocytes, and the expression abundance of FincoR. These are all excellent suggestions for future experimentation which we feel are beyond the scope of the present report. For example, generating a genetic CRISPR/Cas9 of another lncRNA is not trial as it takes a significant amount of work with murine models. Also, we did not mean to exclude if other lncRNAs induced by FXR also bear functions. Technically, rescue experiment is not possible as FincoR RNA can be potentially very long (~10 kb if estimated by RNA-seq pattern in Fig.1C), and it is not feasible now to properly express it by exogenous vectors to ensure the expression levels are similar to endogenous ones. We therefore consider that these important questions are more suitable for future work to fully address. Our belief is that a comprehensive exploration of FXR-regulated lncRNAs holds the potential to unveil novel insights crucial for the development of therapies targeting NASH and other metabolic diseases. The study of FincoR is the beginning of this area of research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The manuscript, although technically proficient, does not thoroughly address the relevance of these findings to human NASH. Questions like the conservation of FincoR in humans and its potential role in human NASH should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: These are important questions. To respond to the reviewer’s comment, new experiments are presented in our final revised manuscript in which we utilized mouse models of NAFLD/NASH and cholestatic liver injury to determine FincoR’s role in these diseases. Hepatic FincoR levels were significantly increased in mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks (Figure 8A) and in mice fed a HFD with high fructose (HFHF) in drinking water for 12 weeks (Figure 8B). Elevated hepatic FincoR levels were also observed in mice treated with α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT), a chemical inducer of liver cholestasis (Figure 8C), and in mice with bile duct ligation (BDL), a surgical method to induce cholestatic liver injury (Figure 8D).</p><p>In terms of the human relevance, we have provided additional information and figures showing that there is sequence similarity between mouse FincoR and a human loci. FincoR sequence is moderately conserved between mice and humans as displayed in the UCSC genome browser (Figure 8E). Annotation of these conserved human sequences revealed that they overlap with a functionally uncharacterized human lncRNA XR_007061585.1 (Figure 8F). Further, we conducted qRT-PCR experiment from human patient’s RNA samples, which demonstrated that hepatic lncRNA XR_007061585.1 levels are elevated in patients with NAFLD and PBC, but not in severe NASH-fibrosis patients (Figure 8G-H). These results demonstrate that hepatic levels of a potential human analog of FincoR are elevated in NAFLD and PBC patients, which is consistent with FincoR’s upregulation in mouse models of chronic liver disease with hepatic inflammation and liver injury. Whether human lncRNA XR_007061585.1 is entirely analogous to mouse FincoR in terms of functions and mechanisms, and whether the elevation of this human lncRNA hasa role in liver disease progression or is an adaptive response to liver injury remains to be determined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) In the introduction Line 96, &quot;..., while the vast majority are transcribed into ncRNAs&quot; may not be accurate. Please refer to Pointing and Haerty Annu Rev 2022 for a related discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out this inaccurate information in the introduction. We have changed the content in the text, “While a significant portion of the genome was initially thought to be &quot;junk DNA&quot;, it has been established that many non-coding regions give rise to functional non-coding RNAs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 5: the authors should provide a clear illustration demonstrating the sequence targeted by the sgRNA in relation to the transcriptional and epigenetic profile (i.e., RNAseq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq data).</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The illustration (Figure 5-figure supplement 1A, right panel) demonstrating the sequence targeted by the sgRNA has been updated as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this model, the upstream of FincoR is deleted, leading to the inhibition of FincoR transcription. Does the deleted region include FXR binding sites? If so, would the phenotype be due to the deletion of these binding sequences, rather than the decreased FincoR transcripts? Accordingly, the limitation or alternative interpretation should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The reviewer made a good point. The deleted region includes FXR binding sites so that we cannot rule out decreased binding of FXR or decreased transcription of the region per se, in addition to the decreased levels of FincoR, to bear a role in the phenotypic changes we observed. In the final revision, we have added discussion of this alternative (6th paragraph in the revised discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 6C, the images should be accompanied by quantification.

The result is consistent with the triglyceride result showing that tropifexor treatment markedly reduced neutral lipids determined by Oil Red O staining of liver sections (Figure 6C) and liver TG levels (Figure 6D) and these beneficial effects on reducing fatty liver were not altered by FincoR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 7, does AST show the same pattern as ALT?

The new data have been added to Figure 7B. Col1a1 expression has been re-measured and the results have been updated in Figure 7D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Is FincoR level reduced in NASH conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the Reviewer for this question. We now added new data to examine the levels of FincoR in mouse liver disease models and also examined levels of a potential human analog of FincoR in human liver specimens from PBC, NAFLD, and NASH patients. Please see our new data and description above in the response to comment 5 by Reviewer 1 (most data now included in the new Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Please provide information on the conservation of FincoR (DNA and RNA) in humans. This would be important to provide the human disease relevance.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: As described above in the response to comment 5 of reviewer 1, a human loci shows sequence similarity to mouse FincoR and this conserved region has an annotated uncharacterized human lncRNA. We also examined the levels of this human homolog in human diseased liver samples. Our new results demonstrate that hepatic levels of a potential human analog of FincoR are elevated in NAFLD and PBC patients, which is consistent with FincoR’s upregulation in mouse models of chronic liver disease with hepatic inflammation and liver injury. Whether human lncRNA XR_007061585.1 is entirely analogous to mouse FincoR in terms of functions and mechanisms, and whether the elevation of this human lncRNA has a role in liver disease progression or is an adaptive response to liver injury remains to be determined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Several discussion points for the authors' consideration:</p><p>(7.1) human-mouse conservation as alluded to in #6;</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Potential human-mouse conservation is discussed with new data in the last paragraph of the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7.2) potential molecular mechanism involved in FincoR-regulated hepatocyte function;</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank Reviewer for this comment. We have added more discussion as shown below: “RNA inside the cells usually associates with different RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). To predict those potential binding proteins of FincoR. Additional bioinformatic analysis identified proteins that potentially binding FincoR, including KHDRBS1, RBM38, YBX2 and YBX3 (Supplemental file 4). These findings and potential functions of the binding proteins are discussed in the 5th paragraph of the discussion section in the final revised manuscript.

How do the authors reconcile the differential induction patterns?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: To clarify, the induction of FincoR after a single dose of GW4064 in vivo was transient, peaked within 1 h and then declined gradually (Figure 1-figure Supplement 1C). In the tropifexor treatment protocol (also in vivo), the mice were treated daily with tropifexor for 12 days so that the multiple doses maintained FincoR induction. The beneficial effect of tropifexor by inducing FincoR, therefore, accumulated over the 12 days.</p><p>It is worthy to note that we failed to see induction of FincoR in isolated primary mouse hepatocytes treated with GW4064 in vitro. We can only detect FincoR in primary hepatocytes isolated from GW4064-treated mice liver. This may be due to the loss of key factors mediating FincoR induction in the cultured primary hepatocytes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
