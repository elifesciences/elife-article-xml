The nervous system inside of the thorax is part of the insect equivalent of the spinal cord and contains clusters of interneurons that relay signals between the sensory nerves, the brain and the muscles. This enables the insect to perform complex actions such as walking and flying.</p><p>The thoracic interneurons are produced by a fixed set of stem cells. Each stem cell makes neurons in a pair-wise fashion by producing a sequence of neural progenitor cells, each of which then divides to produce two different types of daughter neurons. All of the daughter neurons of the same type are said to belong to the same hemilineage, and in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the majority of the interneurons in the thorax are from one of 33 hemilineages.

Furthermore, the hemilineages can be divided into different groups based on their complexity. Activating the simplest group of hemilineage clusters produces simple movements such as leg twitches and stretches. Another group of hemilineages are then able to organize these movements into more complicated behaviors, such as walking. The third, most complex, hemilineages can coordinate several complex actions to enable the flies to perform very complicated tasks, like take off for flight.</p><p>These findings suggest that hemilineages act as the basic modules of the nervous system in the fly thorax. Furthermore, the flies and techniques developed by Harris et al. will provide valuable resources for future studies into the organization and function of the nervous system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04493.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04493.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neuroblasts</kwd><kwd>lineages</kwd><kwd>flight</kwd><kwd>walking</kwd><kwd>insects</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Group Leader Budget</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Truman</surname><given-names>James W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hemilineages link neuronal stem cells to behavioral functions by providing a conserved ground plan of neuronal types that evolution then uses to sculpt different types of walking and flight behaviors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A major obstacle to understanding how the central nervous system (CNS) translates sensory inputs into appropriate motor outputs is the CNS's staggering cellular complexity. Even the small CNS of <italic>Drosophila</italic> has on the order of 100,000 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Power, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiang et al., 2011</xref>), each of which is capable of making connections with dozens of synaptic partners. To understand such a complex system, it is helpful to parse its elements into relevant units organized in a functional hierarchy. This approach can be seen in the analysis of the vertebrate brainstem and spinal cord, which are the major sites of sensorimotor processing for locomotor behaviors. In the spinal cord, for example, identified progenitor cells generate discrete pools of interneurons, which in turn have defined roles in producing functional circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grillner and Jessell, 2009</xref>). The functional organization of the spinal cord in vertebrates appears to be conserved, in that the progenitor cells and transcription factors that characterize different interneuron classes are conserved from fish through mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lupo et al., 2006</xref>) despite the marked differences in modes of locomotion. The hindbrain of the zebra fish is similarly structured from clusters of cell types that are recruited in predictable ways to assemble functional circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koyama et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Like the vertebrate spinal cord, the ventral nervous system (VNS) of insects is the site of sensorimotor patterning for complex behaviors such as walking, jumping, and flight. Years of work on grasshoppers and other orthopteroid insects (summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burrows, 1996</xref>) have defined clusters of spiking and nonspiking interneurons that transform sensory input into changes in leg position during the maintenance of stance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burrows, 1996</xref>) and organize more complex behaviors such as walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buschges et al., 2008</xref>) and flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robertson et al., 1982</xref>). As in vertebrates, these clusters follow a developmental logic in which specific clusters arise from the same neuronal stem cell (neuroblast [NB]). In the grasshopper, for example, NB 4-1 has been shown to produce the cluster of midline spiking interneurons that receive exteroceptor input and shape the receptive fields of leg motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shepherd and Laurent, 1992</xref>). Similarly, the unpaired medial NB produces the pool of local, midline GABAergic neurons that respond to sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thompson and Siegler, 1991</xref>).</p><p>The finding that specific stem cells generate pools of functionally similar interneurons has important evolutionary implications because the insect VNS develops according to a conservative plan based on a segmental set of 30 paired and one unpaired NBs that has changed little through the 350 million years of insect evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Truman and Ball, 1998</xref>). Each NB is uniquely identifiable and characterized by its position in the array, its pattern of molecular expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broadus and Doe, 1995</xref>), and the suite of early neurons that it produces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bossing et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>). Comparative studies between a basal, primitively flightless insect and flying insects showed that the number of thoracic neurons roughly doubled with the evolution of flight. This increase did not come from adding new NBs, but rather was correlated with a subset of the NBs making more neurons by extending their proliferative phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Truman and Ball, 1998</xref>). This mixed proliferative response associated with the evolution of flight is consistent with the idea that particular neuronal lineages have become adapted to specific behavioral functions, but this has yet to be comprehensively evaluated.</p><p>The systematic decoding of the behavioral roles of the segmental set of NBs can best be carried out in <italic>Drosophila</italic> because of its life history and the genetic tools available. Its metamorphic life history is advantageous because the great majority of central neurons arise during a second neurogenic period as the larva grows. During this postembryonic phase, each NB divides repeatedly, with the smaller product of each division being a ganglion mother cell (GMC), which then terminally divides to produce two neurons. By the start of metamorphosis each NB and its immature progeny form a discrete cell cluster from which one or two axon bundles project to specific regions in the larval neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Truman et al., 2004</xref>). Each axon bundle identifies the neurons of a hemilineage, a set of neuronal ‘cousins’ that includes either the ‘A’ (Notch-on) or ‘B’ (Notch-off) daughter from the GMC division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Truman et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, 25 of the 30 embryonic NBs in a hemisegment generate postembryonic lineage. Of the 50 possible hemilineages, 17 are removed by programmed cell death so that a segmental unit of the adult thoracic CNS contains neurons from only 33 hemilineage-based pools. These account for 90–95% of the neurons in the adult thoracic CNS. Hemilineages are also units for the early molecular diversity within the VNS. Expression of many early transcription factors is restricted along hemilineage lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lacin et al., 2014</xref>) and many of these transcription factors have homologs involved in fate determination in the vertebrate spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thor and Thomas, 1997</xref>). For example, the homeodomain protein Dbx1 controls the difference between the V0 and V1 fates in the mouse spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pierani et al., 2001</xref>), while the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog, <italic>dbx</italic>, controls differentiation of particular VNS cell types through interactions with <italic>even-skipped</italic> and <italic>hb9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lacin et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We developed a set of genetic tools to allow us to examine the form and function of most of the thoracic hemilineages in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We find that most hemilineages are composed of pools of similar interneurons, confirming that neuronal classes are indeed based on a hemilineage plan. Stimulation of interneurons in a hemilineage pool using the temperature-sensitive cation channel dTRPA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>) elicits a characteristic, often unique, behavioral response from each. The complexity of the elicited behavior reflects the complexity of the hemilineage's projection pattern and the neuropil region to which it projects. These findings suggest that the hemilineages provide a functional as well as an anatomical ground plan for the thoracic nervous system, and that thorax-mediated behaviors occur by combinations of simple movements elicited by relatively simple ventral hemilineages, which are then orchestrated by a hierarchy of increasingly complex dorsal hemilineages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Strategies for achieving hemilineage expression</title><p>The neurons in a hemilineage are designated by their NB of origin and whether they are the Notch-on (A) or Notch-off (B) daughters of the GMC division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Truman et al., 2010</xref>). For example, hemilineages 1A and 1B are the respective A and B daughters of NB 1. We are using the postembryonic designations of the NBs (from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Truman et al., 2004</xref>) rather than their embryonic names (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>) because there is controversy over the correspondence of the two maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birkholz et al., 2015</xref>; Lacin and Truman, in preparation). Working with isolated hemilineages has been difficult because the members are cousins rather than sisters. Consequently, a clonal approach, such as MARCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee and Luo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2010a</xref>), serves to mark the 2 daughters of the GMC division, but does not label all the neurons in one hemilineage at the exclusion of those in the other. Therefore, we devised approaches to mark the secondary neurons in a hemilineage and then track them through metamorphosis to assess their form and function in the adult. Of the 33 major thoracic hemilineages, hemilineages 0A, 4A, 16B and 17A are not addressed in this study.</p><p>Since each hemilineage can be identified in the larva based on cluster position and trajectory of its axon bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Truman et al., 2010</xref>), we screened the larval expression patterns of the Rubin GAL4 collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>) based on over 7000 cis-regulatory regions (CRMs; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</xref>), for lines that drove expression in single hemilineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2014</xref>). The larval pattern was then maintained by using a transiently expressed recombinase to remove a transcriptional stop cassette from an Actin5C -FRT&gt;-stop-FRT&gt;-LexA::p65 transgene and thereby extending expression into the adult stage. The successful application of this strategy, though, required that the recombinase activity was limited to the larval growth period when the desired hemilineage pattern was expressed.</p><p>Because of the diversity of expression patterns in the driver lines, we explored three different methods for implementing this strategy (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The results of the first method (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. In the last instar larva, line R24B02-GAL4 drives expression in the cells of hemilineage 12A from the subesophageal through the A1 segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, this expression pattern wanes during metamorphosis and is replaced by a different set of cells in the adult CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To maintain lineage expression into the adult, we used R24B02-GAL4 to drive pJFRC180-20XUAS-IVS-Flp2::PEST, hereafter referred to as UAS-Flippase, to remove the transcriptional stop from an Actin5C-FRT&gt;-dSTOP-FRT&gt;-GAL4 construct. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, when combined with the reporter construct, pJFRC2-10XUAS-IVS-mCD8::GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>), expression in the hemilineage 12A cells was maintained into the adult. A complication, though, was that expression was observed in other cells, presumably ones in which the stop cassette had been removed in earlier larval or embryonic stages, when this CRM drives a different expression pattern. To circumvent this early expression we used a GeneSwitch strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osterwalder et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roman et al., 2001</xref>) in which we fused a <italic>Drosophila</italic> codon-optimized ligand-binding domain of the human progesterone receptor to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4. R24B02-GeneSwitch should then drive expression only after larvae are treated with a progesterone mimic, such as RU486. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref> feeding larvae RU486 during the third instar resulted in strong expression of immature 12A interneurons. Removal of the drug at the start of metamorphosis was followed by a waning of GFP expression so that it was lost by adult emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris, 2012</xref>). Feeding adults with RU486 reinduced GFP expression but only in the expected adult pattern and not in the 12A interneurons. Consequently, the RU486 given to feeding larvae is effectively cleared from the animal during metamorphosis (this study). We then used the R24B02-GeneSwitch line in conjunction with UAS-flippase, Actin5C-FRT&gt;-dSTOP-FRT&gt;-GAL4, and pJFRC2-10XUAS-IVS-mCD8::GFP to reveal the adult morphology of the hemilineage 12A neurons. Without treatment with RU486 in the larva, we saw no GFP expression at any stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,F</xref>), but feeding them with the drug during the third larval instar resulted in expression in the 12A interneurons that persisted through metamorphosis and continued to be robust in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). Importantly, this adult expression pattern did not also contain the adult-specific cells characteristic of R24B02 because the RU486 was cleared from the system before these cells started to express late in metamorphosis.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04493.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The different strategies that were used to establish lines that showed selective expression in defined hemilineages.</title><p>The strategies are based on a screen through the large collection of enhancer lines built from <italic>cis</italic> regulatory modules (CRMs) of CNS expressed genes. (<bold>A</bold>) For CRMs whose thoracic expression is confined to a hemilineage, gene-switch constructs are combined with feeding larvae the progesterone mimic (RU486) in the last larval stage.

(<bold>B</bold>) When the larval expression pattern includes functional larval neurons as well as a hemilineage, expression in the larval neurons is blocked by including a nSynaptobrevin-GAL80 gene.

(<bold>C</bold>) Spatial and temporal specificity is accomplished using a conditional flippase that is the human progesterone receptor ligand-binding domain (hPR) fused to Flippase. Exposure of third instar larvae to RU486 then confines the flip event to the last larval stage.

We first confirmed that a driver for such a gene—R57C10-GAL4 that carries an 872-bp promoter fragment from the nSynaptobrevin gene (nSyb; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pfeiffer et al., 2012</xref>)—drives expression in the functioning primary neurons, but not in the clusters of arrested immature secondary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, inset). This promoter fragment was then used to drive expression of GAL80, an inhibitor of GAL4 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yun et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Traven et al., 2006</xref>), in the construct R57C10-GAL80-6, hereafter called nSyb-GAL80. When crossed into lines that contained a mixture of functioning larval neurons and clusters of arrested, postembryonic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), nSyb-GAL80 suppressed expression in the mature neurons, leaving only the expression in the arrested immature neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). When nSyb-GAL80 was used in conjunction with a GAL4 diver, UAS-flippase and Actin5C-FRT&gt;-dSTOP-FRT&gt;-LexAp::65 , we were able to fix—or ‘immortalize’—the expression pattern of that GAL4 pattern specifically in the immature neurons, now as a pattern of LexA activity, which was observed using pJFRC19-13XLexAop2-IVS-myr::GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>).

The only exceptions are hemilineages 20A and 22A, which are from neighboring NBs. These two hemilineages cannot be readily distinguished in the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Truman et al., 2004</xref>) and we were unable to differentiate them in our analysis. Consequently, they are considered as a single unit. An important diagnostic feature of each hemilineage is the neuroglian-positive tracts in which it runs. A detailed analysis of the larval-to-adult transformation of this tract system is described in Shepherd et al. (2015, in revision), so only a superficial treatment will be given here. The immortalized driver lines show the neuropil regions that are targets of a given hemilineage, but for the more complex hemilineages, that overlap either bilaterally or intersegmentally, a detailed analysis of the anatomy needs to be supplemented by a clonal approach that has been used sparingly here and will be dealt with in detail elsewhere (Shepherd, Sahota, Court, Harris, Truman and Williams, in preparation). The thoracic neuropil can be roughly divided into the paired, ventrolateral leg neuropils in each segment and a dorsal region, the tectulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Power, 1943</xref>), which has lost obvious segmental organization and is most expanded in the T2 region.</p><p>To understand the behavioral function of each hemilineage, we activated the neurons in decapitated flies and observed their response. Decapitated flies maintain a good stance and show little spontaneous leg or wing movements except for occasional grooming bouts of the front legs or of the hind legs over the wings (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Cells in the respective hemilineages were excited using the temperature-sensitive TRPA1 channel expressed in the corresponding neurons and the decapitated flies subjected to a linear heat ramp and videos were acquired through the warming process for 45 to 55 s (see ‘Materials and methods’). Decapitated flies lacking the TRPA1 effector show no response to the heat ramp, maintaining their posture with occasional bouts of grooming movements. The behavioral responses of the decapitated flies were divided into six behavioral categories. (1) <italic>Changes in posture</italic>: this category includes tonic changes in posture or in leg or joint position. (2) <italic>Uncoordinated leg movements</italic>: the flies showed phasic leg movements that had no obvious inter- or intrasegmental coordination. The decapitated flies typically stayed in place or, if they moved, their course was erratic. (3) <italic>Walking:</italic> this involved translocation of the animal over more than a body length during the test period. The movements could be forwards, sideways or backwards, but the trajectories were typically smooth. (4) <italic>Wing waving</italic>: this category includes bouts of low frequency wing movements such as wing extension, wing flicking, or wing scissoring. (5) <italic>Wing buzzing:</italic> these movements include high frequency wing movements that appeared as a blur on the 60 fps video frames. The wings could be extended laterally in the flight or singing positions or could remain over the back. During buzz episodes the decapitated fly might or might not become airborne. (6) <italic>Takeoff</italic>: these typically involved the decapitated fly launching into the air within one to two frames of the normal video (span of ∼30–60 ms). In the lines in which this response was common, we used high-speed video to confirmed the role of the t2 legs in producing the takeoff jump.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video1" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-04493-media1-v2.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04493.007</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Control, decapitated flies of the genotype R24B02-GAL4 subjected to a 24° to 37°C heat ramp and recorded at 60 frames per second (fps).</title><p>This video related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04493.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04493.007</ext-link></p></caption></media></p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Hemilineages 1A and 1B</title><p>The lineage 1 cluster in the larva is located in the anterolateral region of the segment and has a 1A bundle that projects in the ventral anterior (vA) commissure to the contralateral leg neuropil and a 1B bundle that projects to the leg neuropil in the next anterior segment.

We developed new genetic tools that allowed us to target most of the 31 interneuron clusters so that we could examine their form and function after metamorphosis. We find that the initial projections that these hemilineage groups make in the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Truman et al., 2004</xref>) prefigure their target regions in the adult CNS. Two motor hemilineages (15B and 24B) and fifteen interneuron hemilineages form the immature ‘leg neuropil’ of the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Truman et al., 2004</xref>) and all of these make neurons exclusively for the adult leg neuropil. The only mature leg hemilineage that resides outside of the larval leg neuropil is hemilineage 23B whose mature neurons have dendrites in the most ventral regions of the leg neuropil where they overlap the leg afferents. They may be excluded from the immature leg neuropil because their inputs do not grow into the CNS until metamorphosis is well underway.</p><p>The neurons in many of the leg hemilineages constitute a relatively homogeneous group with arbors in restricted regions of the leg neuropil. Presumably each of these is dedicated to a particular step in sensory-motor processing for the leg. On the sensory side, the dendrites of the above-mentioned 23B neurons and the neurons of the 9A group overlap the terminals of exteroceptors and proprioceptors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris, 2012</xref>) and are likely involved with dealing with primary sensory input. More complex computations are likely carried out by the 14A interneurons. Their NB is the persisting NB4-1 NB from the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birkholz et al., 2015</xref>), and the homologous NB4-1 in grasshoppers produces the cluster of midline spiking interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shepherd and Laurent, 1992</xref>) that conveys information from the somatosensory map to the myotopic motor map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burrows and Newland, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burrows, 1996</xref>). The neurons generated by NB 4-1 in flies are anatomically similar to the grasshopper neurons and we expect that the fly neurons are likewise involved in maintaining spatial information during the transformation from the sensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murphey et al., 1989</xref>) to motor maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brierley et al., 2012</xref>) in the leg. Outside of these spatially restricted leg hemilineages, other leg hemilineage clusters have a rather diffuse projection through the leg neuropil, as in the case of 3A and 4B, or they have arbors that also extend beyond their respective leg neuropil, such seen for the 1A and 19A neurons.</p><p>The tectulum neuropil is built from the dorsal-projecting lineages in the larva. They arise as segmentally discrete units but as metamorphosis approaches the segmental hemilineages begin to converge on the T2 region. The hemilineage groups that project to this region are either intrasegmental, joining left and right neuropils, or intersegmental. For some of the dorsal-projecting hemilineages the members in the cluster appear relatively homogeneous (e.g., 6A and 6B), as seen for most of the leg hemilineages. In other instances, though, such as the 12A and 8B groups, the hemilineage cluster is more complex and contains obvious subclasses of interneurons.</p><p>The thoracic hemilineages, then, vary in the heterogeneity of neurons that they contain. We speculate that the more homogenous hemilineages are collections of parallel components, which provide parallel but overlapping channels in the circuits that control sensory to motor transformations. The more heterogeneous hemilineages likely have more diversified integrative functions. The recent characterization of lineages in the fly brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2013</xref>) shows many brain lineages that contain a greater diversity of cell types than we see for the VNS hemilineages. Nevertheless, some of the brain lineages also appear to be simple, rather homogeneous collections of neurons and we would expect these to also represent parallel processing units. This idea is supported by a projection neuron hemilineage from the lateral antennal lobe (lAL) NB. Overall, this hemilineage contains five classes of projection neurons but they are all involved in receiving primary sensory input (olfactory, gustatory, or primary antennal mechanosensory) and relaying it to higher centers within or around the mushroom bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lin et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Relationship of behavior to anatomy</title><p>We stimulated the neurons in the hemilineages via TRPA1 activation to assess the functional roles of these interneuron groups. Would the stimulation of neurons in different hemilineage groups result in distinctive behavioral responses, and was there any evidence for a functional hierarchy amongst the various groups? As summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, most of our lines had some degree of contamination with expression in neurons that were outside of our target hemilineage. We did not use lines that showed expression in sensory neurons (such as hemilineages 3A and 19B), or that had expression in other hemilineage clusters (e.g., the hemilineage 14A line). We used lines that had expression in a few abdominal neurons per neuromere or weak expression in a few scattered thoracic neurons per neuromere. In all cases, the predominant expression in the line was from the target hemilineage. The problem of extraneous brain contamination was removed by decapitation, although we had concerns about severed descending axons that might still be activated by the heat ramp. Where this was a potential issue (i.e., presence of descending axons in the line) we circumvented the problem by ageing the animals for 24 hr after the decapitation to allow the severed axons to degenerate prior to behavior testing, or by blocking thoracic expression using tsh-GAL80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and showing that the behavioral response disappeared. We collected behavioral data for 22 of the 33 hemilineage groups.</p><p>Another issue was how much of a given hemilineage is captured in the various driver lines? We do not have quantitative data on this question, but comparison of the driver lines expression with MARCM clones for the various lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Truman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) showed that all of the neuropil features evident in the clones were also found in the lines. Therefore, the cellular diversity in the various hemilineage groups is captured in the driver lines that we used.</p><p>Our behavior testing system was quite artificial since it utilized decapitated flies. Despite lacking their heads, these flies showed a complex array of behaviors during the tests. They provide insights in how the circuitry of the thorax can operate when freed from the descending influences of the brain and subesophageal ganglia.</p><p>Using TRPA1 expression and a heat ramp to activate the hemilineage groups resulted in both tonic and sequential types of behavioral responses. Tonic responses were the more common and are defined as a persistent behavioral response that began at some point during the heat ramp and were then maintained for the remainder of the stimulus. This type of response was seen for changes in posture (such as seen for hemilineages 9A or 13B) for sustained walking (as for the 1A or the 10B neurons), and for sustained wing buzzing (the 2A interneurons). The less common pattern was for the decapitated flies to display an ordered sequence of behavioral responses that changed as the temperature increased. This was very evident for the stimulation of the 12A neurons that began with locomotion that was later joined by lateral wing waving and then finally by the onset of sustained wing buzzing. This behavioral sequencing might result from a progressive increase in neuronal firing rate of the cells in the group during the heat ramp, or by the successive recruitment of group members with higher firing thresholds. We have no data to favor either option at present.</p><p>A number of observations come from the analysis of the responses to the activation of the different hemilineage groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The response to the stimulation of the interneuron group was quite stereotyped and highly reproducible for only a few of the hemilineages. This response consistency was confined to some of the hemilineage groups that evoked postural changes. We do not have detailed transmitter information for all of the hemilineage groups but we do know that the 9A and 5B clusters are GABA-immunopositive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris, 2012</xref>). Therefore, the stereotypy resulting from their activation may be due to imposing inhibition at a particular level of sensory-motor integration. The hemilineages that evoked more complex behaviors typically showed a range of behaviors, although there was usually a dominant category of response that characterized that particular hemilineage group. Therefore, for these more complex behaviors, the response to hemilineage group stimulation was probabilistic rather than deterministic, in that the activity of these neurons enhanced the probability that a particular behavior would be performed. A similar phenomenon was seen in the behavioral responses of larval <italic>Drosophila</italic> to TRPA1 activation of different sparse sets of central neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vogelstein et al., 2014</xref>). The larval behavioral responses also tended to be probabilistic in that a given set of neurons enhanced the probability of a behavioral response but their activity did not invariably lead to this response. Our discussion below focuses on the most frequently shown behaviors seen during the stimulation of each neuronal group.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04493.038</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Relationship of hemilineages to neuron type and to classes of evoked behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Summary of the range of behaviors in decapitated flies elicited by stimulation of the neurons in each of the hemilineage groups using TRPA1 expression and a heat ramp to activate the temperature-sensitive channel. Behaviors are divided into six categories explained in the text. Hemilineages are arranged according to the complexity of their behavioral responses. Most behavioral responses were sustained but a few hemilineages (*) showed a progression of behaviors during the heat ramp. Diagrams show the extent of the hemilineage's arbor in transverse views of the ventral nervous system at the level of the mesothorax (T2). The numbers of flies analyzed in each group ranged from 15 to 25. (<bold>B</bold>) Registration of the hemilineage arbors to a common outline and then overlapping the hemilineage groups in which at least 50% of the individuals showed the indicated types of behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04493.038">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04493.038</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04493-fig9-v2"/></fig></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> orders the tested hemilineages in terms of the increasing behavioral complexity seen as the neurons were stimulated. Responses ranged from simple postural changes, through rhythmic movements of walking or flight, to the complex behavioral sequence involved in takeoff. This diversity in behavior supports a hierarchical relationship amongst the various interneuron pools with some involved in the patterning of simple movements and others having a more ‘upstream’ function of assembling these simple movements into complex movements or sequences of behavior.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> also relates the projection patterns of the various hemilineages to the most common behavior seen when these neuronal groups are stimulated. Not surprisingly, the hemilineage groups that evoke changes in leg posture have their arbors concentrated in the leg neuropils. Most are confined to the leg neuropil except for the 3B interneurons, that have major projections into the tectulum and also evoke wing movements, and the 5B neurons, that are potentially GABAergic and may have a general suppressive function. Hemilineages that evoke coordinated or uncoordinated leg movements similarly have a strong leg neuropil component but their arbors also project into the medial neuropil and into the tectulum neuropil. Strong projections into the tectulum neuropil were also evident for all of the hemilineages that evoked wing movements of either low or high frequency. Two of the three hemilineages that evoked frequent takeoff had a strong projection into the T2 leg neuropil (the site of the jump motoneurons) in addition to their extensive arbor in the tectulum. Curiously, the third takeoff lineage, lineage 11A/B, lacked a T2 arbor but had substantial projections into the T1 and T3 leg neuropils. Overall the anatomy of the hemilineages conformed to the generally held idea that the leg neuropils deal with leg function while the tectulum neuropil is involved with wing-related behavior such as singing or flight. In addition, though, the tectulum and dorsomedial neuropil may be generally involved in complex, coordinated behavior in the thorax. Hemilineages, such as 1A and 10B, that evoke walking behavior but little in the way of wing movement nevertheless have arbor extension into the dorsomedial neuropil and tectulum, suggesting that these regions may be generally involved in the coordination of complex thoracic behavior regardless of whether it involves legs or wings.</p><p>Overall the hemilineages appear to have a modular function with cells in a given group being associated with particular behavioral responses. This notion is consistent with physiological data such as that from grasshoppers in which computational circuits are built from clusters of distinct types of interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burrows, 1996</xref>), at least some types of which have been shown to arise in the same lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shepherd and Laurent, 1992</xref>). A similar strategy is seen in the vertebrate spinal cord in which different cell types arise from defined sets of precursors and the neurons from those cell types play specific roles in defined circuit motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grillner and Jessell, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our assessment of the functional roles of the hemilineages is obviously incomplete. We assayed hemilineage function only under one condition—decapitated flies standing at rest and showing occasional spontaneous grooming bouts. Stimulation of the hemilineages under other conditions, for example steady-state flight, will undoubtedly reveal more complexity in the behavioral functions of some of the hemilineages. A fuller understanding of lineage function will require a larger palate of behavioral tests.</p><p>A second caution comes from our demonstration that the vPR6 neurons, which are required for song production in the male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>), are part of hemilineage 12A cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). During the course of stimulation of the 12A interneurons the decapitated flies showed a range of behaviors, some of which mimicked the movements displayed during courtship singing, but these soon degenerated into generalized wing vibration movements. We would expect that in the more complex dorsal hemilineages there might be specializations of function within the cluster and that the stimulation of all of the neurons at once might set up conflict states that might be hard to interpret. The specialization of the function of the vPR6 neurons suggest that some neurons within a hemilineage can be adapted for specialized behaviors that are, nevertheless, related to the basic function of the hemilineage as a whole.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Hemilineages and the evolution of behavior</title><p>The segmental CNS of insects provides an unparalleled system in which to study the evolution and diversification of the nervous system. The advantage of the insect system lies in a stereotyped array of segmental NBs that has undergone little change through the course of insect evolution. Based on position, molecular markers and the types of early progeny that they produce, the homologous stem cells can be identified in insects as diverse as silverfish, grasshoppers and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Truman and Ball, 1998</xref>). Not only have the NBs been highly conserved, but their early neuronal progeny are also highly conserved as first elegantly shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas et al. (1984)</xref>. These early-born cells are the ‘primary’ neurons and their identities are determined by birth-order as encoded in a transcription factor progression within the cycling NB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Isshiki et al., 2001</xref>). Many of these early-born cells serve a pioneer function, which explains the stereotyped pattern of tracts and commissures seen in the ventral neuropil throughout the insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas et al., 1984</xref>). The later-born ‘secondary’ neurons are born after the NB starts to express grainyhead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almeida and Bray, 2005</xref>) and include late-born embryonic neurons as well as all of the neurons that are born during postembryonic life (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>; for a discussion of primary vs secondary neurons). As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, the hemilineage units of these secondary neurons typically include neurons of related phenotypes that may participate in functionally related components of behavior. The interesting question is whether these cell classes are likewise conserved across the insects? Conservation in class character in widely different groups is well illustrated by the medial lineage. In grasshoppers the A hemilineage cells are GABAergic, engrailed-positive local interneurons and the B hemilineage cells are engrailed-negative, projection cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jia and Siegler, 2002</xref>), and the same is true in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (JW Truman, unpublished). Similarly, a comparative analysis of the clusters of GABA-immunoreactive neurons in the VNS of diverse insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Witten and Truman, 1998</xref>) supports the contention that the properties of neurons in homologous hemilineages are highly conserved across much of the insects. Although one can homologize cell classes of secondary neurons across most of the insects, we think that it is unlikely that one could homologize individual neurons within a particular class.</p><p>This then brings us to the question of the conservation of function for the neurons of the various hemilineage classes. In grasshoppers ventral interneurons that run in the transverse tract receive input from wing afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Watson and Burrows, 1983</xref>) while in flies the 2A interneurons are the main neurons of the transverse tract and they can drive flight behavior. For the leg hemilineages, NB4-1 and NB3-1 in grasshopper make the medial and anteromedial spiking interneurons, respectively, of the leg circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burrows, 1996</xref>), while in flies the homologous NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Truman et al., 2004</xref>) generate the 14A and 4B interneurons which are similar appearing local interneurons in the leg neuropil. Whether the functions of the neurons are exactly the same in the two species are as of yet unknown, but their involvement in leg function is clearly conserved. We expect that the functional roles of most of all of the hemilineages to be highly conserved through much of insect evolution. For the simpler hemilineages that contain units that work in parallel, addition or reductions in the number of neurons could enhance or reduce functionality by altering the spatial or temporal resolution of their level of the computational network. Another benefit of an increase in numbers of an interneuron type could be to provide a finer control over the speed of locomotion , as seen for the control of swimming speed in larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McLean et al., 2008</xref>) in which the increase in speed involves the recruitment of new interneurons and the repression of interneurons active at the slower speed. For higher level, more complex hemilineages, changes in neuronal properties/connectivity rather than numbers might be more important for generating behavioral changes.</p><p>Our data from <italic>Drosophila</italic> provide the first systematic analysis of the hemilineages that make up a major section of the insect CNS. For the thoracic segments it provides a reference to which information from other insects can be compared. It is important to remember, though, that the flight system of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, with its mesothoracic wings and metathoracic halteres, is a highly derived system compared with more basal insect groups. Also, in the fly about a third of the thoracic hemilineages die leaving few if any members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Truman et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, some cell types that may have been important in the ancestral nervous system have been lost with the evolution of <italic>Drosophila</italic>'s derived pattern of flight. The other important caveat is that our analysis includes only the postembryonic secondary neurons, and so we are lacking access to the embryonic-born neurons, a small but extremely important component of the adult CNS.</p><p>Finally is the issue of whether the data from <italic>Drosophila</italic> have bearing on the functional organization of nervous systems outside of the arthropods, such as the vertebrate spinal cord. At this point in time we do not know. However, a thoracic unit of the fly thoracic nervous system has about 2500 pairs of neurons, most of which can be assigned to 33 hemilineage units. For many (most?) of the hemilineages one may be able to distill the functional essence of each unit down to one or two sets of cellular characteristics that may reflect the ancestral roles of these cells before the neuronal numbers were expanded. This would then provide us with a basic ‘tool-kit’ of neuron types that insects have used to construct their VNS. These features and the knowledge of the other units on which they preferably synapse may allow us to hypothesize an ancestral wiring diagram for a primitive insect/arthropod VNS. With such a wiring diagram in hand we would then be better able to look for functional homologies in a primitive vertebrate spinal cord such as the lamprey.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Flies were reared on standard cornmeal and molasses food at 25°C.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor) and four reviewers, one of whom, Leslie Griffith, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission:</p><p>While all the reviewers were very positive about this work, there was common concern about the level of description of both the anatomy and the behavioral phenotypes. This paper has the potential to be foundational for future studies of locomotor circuits, but to be useful to the field it must contain more information than it currently does. There are three areas that need to be expanded.</p><p>1) Anatomy. It is important to put the anatomy of the hemilineages, as visualized by the drivers, in context with the lineage labeled as a clone. These clones, and the pattern of neuroglian-positive tracts in the adult, have been described in the dissertation of the lead author, which is cited. It is difficult to compare the hemilineage projection patterns shown in this paper (which are presented as a single z-projection along the entire thickness of the VNS) with the clone data in Dr. Harris' thesis. More room should be given in the anatomy section of this paper to these aspects. The clones in relationship to hemilineages should be shown; logically they should encompass the two sister hemilineages labeled by drivers. If this is not always the case, it is an important fact to document.</p><p>2) Off-target cells. How was the “success of a genotype in generating a pure hemilineage” calculated? Were clones used as a comparison? The lack of information on clones (above) becomes an issue here. The only figure where the hemilineages are shown registered to a common template is the schematic Discussion <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>. This figure, and the raw data underlying it (i.e., registering the hemilineage patterns to a template) should be part of this paper. It might be good to show more clearly how the current hemilineage labeling strategies compare to MARCM labeled clones with regard to targeting Gal4/LexA activity to entire hemilineages. This would also address the question of off-target cells. The aggregate information (with numbers for each line, not simply descriptors) could be presented in table format.</p><p>3) Behavior. The behavioral phenotypes need to be documented more precisely in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref>. In many cases the reader cannot extract the author's conclusions from viewing the figures. For example, there is no figure panel that convincingly shows flies lacking interlimb coordination – one of their conclusions. High speed recordings with frames documenting each movement would provide the required information, perhaps with a simplified stick figure summary of the leg/joint movements. It would also be interesting to discuss the fact that all hemilineages generated motor output. Are there no inhibitory neurons in the thorax? Are they embedded within excitatory populations in each hemilineage?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04493.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Anatomy.

In terms of MARCM clones, a few have already been published (Brown and Truman) and we have added a few supplemental figures of MARCM clones for some of the complex lineages. A comprehensive treatment showing MARCM clones for all of the lineages and how they vary in each of the three thoracic segments is being prepared (Shepherd, Sahota, Court, Harris, Truman and Williams, in preparation) but adding this amount of data would be beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p><italic>2) Off-target cells.

Although the MARCM clone analysis was started by Dr. Harris, it was substantially expanded and carried to completing after her death. Consequently, we think it should be a separate paper. For the purpose of the present paper, our first concern was that we were getting the members of one hemilineage but none of the members of its sister hemilineage. We met this goal in all cases. Supplemental file 1 documents the amount of non-hemilineage contamination for each line. We accepted lines that had some scattered weak expressing cells in the thorax. We were more tolerant of accepting expression in abdominal interneurons. Lines with prominent sensory expression were not used. As described in the text, we also controlled for the effects of descending axons when such were present.</p><p><italic>3) Behavior.

We only have fragmentary transmitter data for the hemilineages at present. In some cases, though, such as for hemilineage 12B, we know that all of the members are GABA immunoreactive. Stimulating these cells results in tonic leg extension.</p></body></sub-article></article>
