Expression of P-glycoprotein (PGP) xenobiotic detoxification genes was elevated in <italic>osm-3</italic> mutants and their knockdown or inhibition with verapamil suppressed tunicamycin resistance. The nuclear hormone receptor <italic>nhr-8</italic> was necessary to regulate a subset of PGPs. We thus identify a cell-nonautonomous regulation of xenobiotic detoxification and show that separate pathways are engaged to mediate longevity, pathogen resistance, and xenobiotic detoxification in <italic>osm-3</italic> mutants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>longevity</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>chemosensory mutants</kwd><kwd>xenobiotic detoxification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-StG 640254</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Denzel</surname><given-names>Martin S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guerrero</surname><given-names>Gabriel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>73111208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Denzel</surname><given-names>Martin S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Denzel</surname><given-names>Martin S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Separate genetic pathways mediate longevity, pathogen resistance, and cell-nonautonomous regulation of xenobiotic detoxification in chemosensory defective <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> mutants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemosensation is a genetically tractable phenotype in various organisms. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, many mutants with defective chemosensation have been identified. Sensory phenotypes are complex in nature, and many of the classical chemosensory mutants were originally characterized by their behavioral phenotypes. Odr mutants, for example, have an abnormal odorant response, while Osm (osmotic avoidance abnormal) mutants do not avoid high-salt environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargmann, 2006</xref>). Mutations in components of neuronal G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, such as <italic>tax-4</italic> and <italic>odr-1,</italic> cause atypical chemosensory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargmann, 2006</xref>). These mutants are not only characterized by a failure to adequately respond to their environment, but show additional phenotypes linked to various life traits including pathogen resistance, increased lifespan, and drug detoxification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaglia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apfeld and Kenyon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dent et al., 2000</xref>). Many chemosensory mutants are long-lived, and this phenotype depends on the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor that is regulated by the insulin signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apfeld and Kenyon, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Beyond mutations in GPCRs, variants in genes involved in the development of amphid sensory neurons can lead to chemosensory defects. One example are mutations in intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins that prevent full cilia development of amphid sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inglis et al., 2007</xref>). Alterations in the IFT genes <italic>osm-3</italic> and <italic>daf-10</italic> disrupt the development of neuronal dendrites that project toward the tip of the nose, where they are exposed to the outer environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inglis et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, IFT mutants are usually characterized by defects in the chemical perception of their environment. Furthermore, developmental defects in lumen formation of the amphid head channel in <italic>daf-6</italic> mutants prevent the direct contact of amphid sensory neurons with the outside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perens and Shaham, 2005</xref>), resulting in chemosensory defects.</p><p>In wild-type (WT) worms, amphid and phasmid sensory neurons can be visualized using the lipophilic dye DiI (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate), which fluorescently stains them bright red. The dye is passively taken up by sensory neurons when they are fully developed and in contact with the environment. Dye filling defective (Dyf) <italic>C. elegans</italic> are defined by an inability to take up DiI into their sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inglis et al., 2007</xref>). The Dyf phenotype arises in <italic>daf-6</italic> animals and also in many IFT mutants. Interestingly, Dyf mutants have unique stress resistance phenotypes that act via different signaling pathways. One such Dyf mutant, <italic>daf-10(m79</italic>), has a unique resistance to pathogenic bacteria that was proposed to be downstream of sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaglia et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, pairs of amphid head neurons, such as ASH and ASJ that often become disrupted in Dyf mutants, help coordinate the innate immune response to bacterial stress after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>). Longevity is often associated with activation of physiological stress response pathways and has been shown to be regulated by the insulin signaling pathway in Dyf <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apfeld and Kenyon, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Conserved mechanisms of longevity and stress resistance have additionally been linked to hyposmia in higher model organisms. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, loss of the putative chemoreceptor <italic>Or83b</italic> has been shown to significantly increase lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Libert et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, mice with ablated olfactory sensory neurons have a unique metabolic signature that protects them from deleterious effects of a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Riera et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While the olfactory machinery is seemingly more complex in higher organisms, <italic>C. elegans</italic> have unique phenotypes associated with the loss or alteration of their sensory neurons. First, unbiased screens for drug resistance have independently identified the Dyf phenotype as a common feature in drug-resistant <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fujii et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ménez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2008</xref>). Selection for resistance to the anthelmintic drug ivermectin was shown to enrich for Dyf mutants in several forward genetic screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ménez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Page, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dent et al., 2000</xref>). Follow-up work identified P-glycoproteins (PGPs), a class of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, as the drivers behind ivermectin resistance in Dyf mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ardelli and Prichard, 2013</xref>). Second, some chemosensory mutations, such as in <italic>daf-10</italic>, lead to resistance to pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaglia et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we characterize a long-lived Dyf mutant, <italic>osm-3</italic>, that was previously identified in a forward genetic screen for resistance to the potent ER stressor tunicamycin (TM). From this screen, we reported the role of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in TM resistance and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denzel et al., 2014</xref>). Our aim was to uncover the mechanism by which Dyf mutants are resistant to TM. We found that the TM resistance of <italic>osm-3</italic> mutants is independent from its longevity and pathogen resistance phenotypes. Furthermore, we showed that PGPs mediate TM resistance in Dyf animals, and we found that the nuclear hormone receptor <italic>nhr-8</italic> mediates <italic>osm-3</italic> drug resistance. The ‘Green Theory’ of aging proposes that the accumulation of toxic endo- and xenobiotic debris contributes to physiological decline with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afschar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gems and McElwee, 2005</xref>). Our work highlights drug resistance as a unique characteristic of Dyf mutants and functionally uncouples it from known stress response pathways that have been implicated in stress resistance and longevity of chemosensory mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dye filling defective <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants are resistant to TM</title><p>Tunicamycin (TM) is commonly used to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by inhibiting the addition of N-glycans to nascent polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parodi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heifetz et al., 1979</xref>).

With this in mind, we tested whether <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutation could suppress the <italic>osm-3</italic> TM resistance.

PGPs are a conserved family of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters that locate to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sangster, 1994</xref>) and they are involved in toxin clearance. <italic>C. elegans</italic> have 15 <italic>pgp</italic> genes.

Indeed, we found that the upregulation of <italic>pgp-3, pgp-5, pgp-11</italic> and <italic>pgp-13</italic>, in <italic>osm-3</italic> mutants, was suppressed in the <italic>osm-3; nhr-8</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). PGP upregulation suggested a role for PGPs in the TM resistance of <italic>osm-3</italic> mutants. Therefore, we tested if RNAi-mediated PGP knockdown in <italic>osm-3</italic> mutants would suppress TM resistance. We focused on the upregulated <italic>pgp-5</italic>, <italic>pgp-11</italic> and <italic>pgp-13,</italic> and on <italic>pgp-8</italic> and <italic>pgp-12</italic>. Interestingly, knockdown of <italic>pgp-5, pgp-11</italic>, and <italic>pgp-12</italic> partially reduced the TM resistance of the <italic>osm-3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). Next, we used verapamil to inhibit PGPs. Verapamil has been used to specifically inhibit PGP activity, re-sensitizing worms to the anthelmintic compound ivermectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ménez et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, 1 nM verapamil significantly suppressed development of <italic>osm-3 C. elegans</italic> in the presence of TM, showing no effect on controls without TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>). The partial effects of <italic>pgp</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and verapamil treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) suggest that xenobiotic detoxification is achieved by multiple PGPs, which are likely to be transcriptionally orchestrated by <italic>nhr-8</italic>. This led us to ask whether <italic>osm-3</italic> TM resistance was dependent on NHR-8. Strikingly, the developmental TM assay revealed that the resistance of <italic>osm-3</italic> mutants was largely suppressed in the <italic>osm-3; nhr-8(hd117)IV</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata4">Figure 4—source data 4</xref>), suggesting that NHR-8 is necessary for <italic>osm-3</italic> TM resistance. As suggested by a role of PGPs in ivermectin resistance, we found that <italic>osm-3</italic> mutants fully developed to adults in the presence of 6 µg/mL ivermectin that is lethal to WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata5">Figure 4—source data 5</xref>).

Instead of an activated stress signaling status that might explain the TM resistance, <italic>osm-3</italic> Dyf mutants show no UPR<sup>ER</sup> induction upon TM treatment. Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apfeld and Kenyon, 1999</xref>), the lifespan extension of <italic>osm-3</italic> was <italic>daf-16</italic> dependent. Despite the established link between the insulin signaling pathway and stress resistance, the TM resistance in <italic>osm-3</italic> mutants was not insulin signaling dependent. Furthermore, <italic>osm-3</italic> mutants were pathogen resistant, and this resistance was fully dependent on the PMK-1/p38 MAPK pathway. We were surprised that neither of the two pathways weakened the TM resistance phenotype. Dyf <italic>C. elegans</italic> drug resistance is not specific to TM, as we also observed resistance to paraquat and ivermectin. While paraquat and ivermectin resistance have been previously reported in Dyf mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dent et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fujii et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ménez et al., 2016</xref>), no studies have demonstrated similar resistance mechanisms in Dyf <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants to TM. Our findings link drug resistance to increased PGP expression in Dyf worms, suggesting a causal role of xenobiotic detoxification in the drug resistance phenotype. Importantly, we found that the regulation of a subset of PGPs is mediated by the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-8. Genetic or pharmacological PGP inhibition, as well as loss of <italic>nhr-8</italic> significantly resensitized <italic>osm-3</italic> mutants to TM, ivermectin, and paraquat. Potential NHR-8 ligands are derived from cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Magner et al., 2013</xref>), and we observed that WT development on lower TM concentrations was strongly cholesterol and NHR-8 dependent.</p><p>Given that improved protein homeostasis is one of the cellular hallmarks of longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>), we presumed that selection for TM resistance would serve as a proxy phenotype for longevity given that TM specifically targets ER protein folding. More specifically, we expected that high fidelity ER protein quality control would be the driver of longevity in these mutants. Previous findings describing increased hexosamine biosynthetic pathway flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denzel et al., 2014</xref>) or constitutive XBP-1 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Taylor and Dillin, 2013</xref> have linked protein homeostasis to longevity and stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denzel and Antebi, 2015</xref>); therefore, the connection between TM resistance and longevity seemed apparent. Given that Dyf mutants are resistant to pathogenic bacteria through enhanced ER homeostasis, we speculated that TM resistance might serve as a proxy phenotype for pathogen resistance. Contrary to that, we found that TM resistance is a consequence of xenobiotic detoxification via PGPs, and NHR-8 regulated control of PGPs was not involved in the longevity of <italic>osm-3</italic> mutants. <italic>pmk-1,</italic> and <italic>daf-16</italic> were required for pathogen resistance and longevity, respectively, but not for the drug resistance of <italic>osm-3</italic> mutants. Together, these findings demonstrate that the three phenotypes of <italic>osm-3</italic> mutants (i.e. xenobiotic resistance, longevity, and protection from pathogens) are independent and controlled by separable genetic pathways. Our observations thus support a model in which the chemosensation defect activates a number of parallel pathways that are responsible for the distinct phenotypes of <italic>osm-3</italic> mutants.</p><p>Adding another dimension to the cell-nonautonomous regulation of innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aballay, 2013</xref>), we propose that the nervous system regulates systemic xenobiotic detoxification in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, likely through a sterol ligand. Our data suggest that mutants with defective amphid neurons have increased PGP expression. Several PGPs have been shown to be expressed in non-neuronal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lincke et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sheps et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, we found that PGP expression is regulated by <italic>nhr-8</italic>, which has also been shown to be expressed in the intestine of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Magner et al., 2013</xref>). Combining this previous information with our finding that Dyf mutants are resistant to several uniquely toxic drugs, we conclude that neuronal signaling controls drug resistance through nuclear hormone signaling. Based on our results, we cannot make conclusions about the sterol metabolism involved in the production of a putative NHR-8 ligand and we cannot make direct conclusions about PGP regulation by sterols. Given our observation that supplementation with cholesterol is itself sufficient for TM resistance in WT worms, it is now important to investigate the link between neuronal states and the specific cholesterol-derived signal that drives these drug resistance phenotypes.</p><p>PGPs are likely regulated in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to help them combat toxins found in their natural habitat.

Because <italic>C. elegans</italic> have no adaptive immune response, having PGPs as part of their innate immune system allows them to clear toxic molecules they may encounter in the wild. While Dyf mutants likely do not occur in the wild, our data nonetheless demonstrate a link between environmental sensing and drug resistance.</p><p>In humans, PGPs have been implicated in drug resistant malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lehne, 2000</xref>). Using <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a tool to study the cross talk between tissues, one might be able to better understand how extracellular signaling drives ABC transporter expression in chemotherapy-resistant cancer. Further studies in cell culture might also characterize TM, as well as other toxic metabolites, as substrates for <italic>C. elegans</italic> PGPs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background(<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HT115 [<italic>L4440::sel-1</italic>]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Source Bioscience</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CELE_F45D3.5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ahringer RNAi library</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background(<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HT115 [<italic>L4440::daf-16</italic>]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Source Bioscience</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CELE_R13H8.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ahringer RNAi library</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background(<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HT115 [<italic>L4440::pgp-5</italic>]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Source Bioscience</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CELE_C05A9.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ahringer RNAi library</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background(<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HT115 [<italic>L4440::pgp-8</italic>]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Source Bioscience</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CELE_T21E8.3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ahringer RNAi library</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background(<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HT115 [<italic>L4440::pgp11</italic>]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Source Bioscience</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CELE_DH11.3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ahringer RNAi library</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background(<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HT115 [<italic>L4440::pgp-12</italic>]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Source Bioscience</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CELE_F22E10.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ahringer RNAi library</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background(<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HT115 [<italic>L4440::pgp-13</italic>]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Source Bioscience</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CELE_F22E10.2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ahringer RNAi library</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent(<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>osm-3(dh441)IV</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AA1962</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">available from A.

extension, resistance to the ER stress-inducing drug tunicamycin (TM) and enhanced immunity- in a chemosensory defective mutant, osm-3(dh441). Using this mutant, the authors made the discovery that TM resistance can be entirely uncoupled from increased longevity and bacterial pathogen resistance, which depend on DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor and PMK-1/ p38 MAP kinase, respectively. Instead, the authors found that a subset of P-glycoproteins (PGPs) are moderately upregulated in the osm-3 mutants, leading them to hypothesize that PGPs serve as an efflux pump for TM, thereby conferring endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress resistance. Consistently, the authors found that the ER unfolded protein response (UPR) is dampened in the osm-3 mutants upon treatment with TM, even though the osm-3 mutants are competent for UPR induction by other means. In addition, knockdown of select pgps and treatment with the drug verapamil, a known inhibitor of PGPs, reduces TM resistance in osm-3 mutants, without an effect on longevity, supporting separate pathways for xenobiotic resistance and longevity. Finally, the authors provide evidence that a subset of the PGPs are regulated by the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-8 and mutations in this receptor render osm-3 mutants sensitive to TM and other xenobiotics. Overall this study provides useful insights into a phenomenon that has long been observed: the multiple stress-resistance phenotypes and extended longevity of worms with neuronal defects.

Using this mutant, the authors made the discovery that Tm resistance can be entirely uncoupled from increased longevity and bacterial pathogen resistance, which depend on the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor and PMK-1/ p38 MAP kinase, respectively. Instead, the authors found that a subset of P-glycoproteins (PGPs) are moderately upregulated in the osm-3 mutants, leading them to hypothesize that PGPs serve as an efflux pump for Tm, thereby conferring ER stress resistance. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that the Tm-induced activation of the ER unfolded protein response (UPR) is not apparent in the osm-3 mutants. In addition, treatment with the drug verapamil abolishes the ER stress resistance in osm-3 mutants, supporting the involvement of PGPs. Finally, the authors provide evidence that PGP expression is mediated by a nuclear hormone receptor called NHR-8 and mutations in this receptor render osm-3 mutants sensitive to Tm, while overexpression of nhr-8 alone is sufficient to confer resistance. Therefore, the ER stress resistance in osm-3 mutants seems to rely upon a general signature of xenobiotic resistance, rather than intracellular stress response mechanisms such as UPR.</p><p>Overall this is a well-executed study that provides useful insights into a phenomenon that has long been observed: the multiple stress-resistance phenotypes and extended longevity of worms with neuronal defects. In demonstrating that these different phenotypes are separable, the authors make it clear that multiple downstream pathways act in parallel to mediate multi-stress resistance and longevity in a chemosensory mutant. However, the evidence supporting the importance of PGPs and their regulator NHR-8 for Tm resistance is somewhat lacking. The following experiments should be considered in order to fully support the key conclusion of this manuscript:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) PGP involvement in Tm resistance: The importance of PGPs rests upon the observation that treatment with verapamil reduces animals' resistance to Tm. However, the specificity of verapamil is not demonstrated in the paper. This drug has been shown to block calcium channels, which may affect diverse processes. More generally, the degree of PGP overexpression in osm-3 is pretty mild: is it reasonable to conclude that degree of overexpression is sufficient to produce the observed Tm resistance? Another concern is the inconsistency between the RNA-seq and RT-qPCR data for pgp expression. For example, by RNA-seq, pgp-2, pgp-9 and pgp-14 are reported to have significant difference in expression (Figure 4A and 4B) in osm-3 (other PGPs not being discussed), but by RT-qPCR these three transporters exhibit a pretty mild upregulation in osm-3 and their expression is not reduced in nhr-8 osm-3 double mutants (Figure 5A). Can the authors provide an explanation for these discrepancies?</p><p>Specifically, the authors need to provide additional data to support the hypothesis that PGP upregulation is the basis of Tm resistance in osm-3 mutants. The authors can test whether genetic perturbations of different PGPs affect Tm sensitivity in osm-3 (dh441). Alternatively, they can construct verapamil resistant PGP mutants to demonstrate the specificity of the drug. If redundancy turns out to be a problem, the authors can try overexpressing pgps to suppress verapamil sensitivity. Even though redundancy could be a potential issues, silencing of a single PGP has been shown to be sufficient to sensitize animals to ivermectin (Menez et al., 2019). Additionally, Kurz et al. 2007 observed clear effects for pgp-5 mutants. Finally, verapamil resistant PGP variants have been reported in murine homologs (Loo and Clarke, 2001).</p><p>2) NHR-8 involvement in PFP upregulation and Tm resistance: Experiments with nhr-8 mutants should be better controlled to verify specific involvement in the tested phenotypes. Disruption of nhr-8, which the authors show is impairing pgp gene expression, is also important for <italic>C. elegans</italic> cholesterol metabolism, and could affect many additional genes; with regard to the impaired development of nhr-8 mutants (Figure 5B), alone or in combination with osm-3. It was shown that nhr-8 disruption increased dauer frequency (especially in combination with mild stress), which is likely to have contributed to the failure to develop on Tm (Magner et al. 2013). Therefore, it's important that the authors test whether ectopic expression of pgps rescues the Tm sensitivity of the nhr-8 and nhr-8 osm-3 double mutants.</p><p>3) UPR response in osm-3 (dh441): The authors emphasize that the lack of UPR induction they observe upon Tm treatment is due to a drug detoxification mechanism. However, they don't demonstrate this by confirming that the UPR can still be induced in these animals when activated by non-drug means eg. genetic activation of the UPR by expression of misfolded proteins, or by expression of spliced XBP-1. This is needed to confirm that drug detoxification is in operation here, rather than another mechanism, such as a reduction in the rate of translation, or a mechanism that increases ER homeostasis independent of the UPR. In addition, is this effect specific to Tm among the drugs that induce UPR activation, or is it a general effect? For example, does treatment with thapsigargin or another UPR-activating drug induce the UPR in osm-3 animals?</p><p>Similarly, Lines 243-245: &quot;Instead of an activated stress signaling status that might explain the TM resistance, osm-3 Dyf mutants show no ER UPR induction upon TM treatment.&quot;</p><p>The implications of this point might be worth additional discussion / speculation. Do the data suggest that UPR overactivation could be a mechanism of TM toxicity, and that osm-3 mutants prevent that overactivation? Or do the authors favor the view that osm-3 mutants detoxify TM in such a way that ER UPR never needs to get activated in the first place?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;NHR-8 regulated P-glycoproteins uncouple xenobiotic stress resistance from longevity in chemosensory <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but some issues remain that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1. The demonstration that pgp-8 KD was sufficient to increase hsp-4 expression in osm-3 mutants (Figure 5E, which is not cited in the main text, and not referred in the abstract) provides some support for the proposition that NHR-8 induction of pgp genes is responsible for TM resistance in osm-3 mutants. However, this is shown with higher TM concentration, sufficient to induce hsp-4 up-regulation even in control-treated osm-3 mutants, so that sensitization was a matter of scale rather than from nothing to something, which would have been more conclusive. Stronger support would have been provided by experiments examining the ability of pgp-8 RNAi to abolish developmental resistance to TM in osm-3 mutants (and to Ivermectin and paraquat to test the generality of detoxification mechanisms). Furthermore, additional experiments examining the effects of pgp-8 RNAi on worms over-expressing NHR-8 are important to establish that OSM-3, NHR-8 and PGP-8 function as one pathway.</p><p>2. Cholesterol experiments are rather indirect and therefore need to be interpreted carefully. The authors need to provide greater clarity in the interpretation of these data and what can or can't be concluded from them.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53174.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) PGP involvement in Tm resistance: The importance of PGPs rests upon the observation that treatment with verapamil reduces animals' resistance to Tm.

Matsuoka et al. reported an IC50 of verapamil of 0.6µM in cardiac cells (PMID: 2050292) and the reported calcium channel inhibition in worms is likewise reported with IC50 values in the μM range (PMID: 32208362).

We used RNAi against the upregulated pgp-8 and measured UPR signaling using the sensitive hsp-4::GFP reporter strain. As previously shown in the manuscript, this reporter is strongly induced by TM in the wildtype, but was not elevated at all in the osm-3 mutants. Our new data show that knocking down pgp-8 reversed the osm-3 resistance to TM thereby leading to hsp-4 induction in osm-3 mutants (Figure 5E). We conclude that the PGP upregulation is the basis for the TM resistance. Indeed, we were surprised that a single knockdown achieved a significant hsp-4 induction in osm-3 mutants.</p><p>This is potentially due to differences in tissue expression of the various PGPs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) NHR-8 involvement in PFP upregulation and Tm resistance: Experiments with nhr-8 mutants should be better controlled to verify specific involvement in the tested phenotypes. Disruption of nhr-8, which the authors show is impairing pgp gene expression, is also important for <italic>C. elegans</italic> cholesterol metabolism, and could affect many additional genes; with regard to the impaired development of nhr-8 mutants (Figure 5B), alone or in combination with osm-3. It was shown that nhr-8 disruption increased dauer frequency (especially in combination with mild stress), which is likely to have contributed to the failure to develop on Tm (Magner et al. 2013). Therefore, it's important that the authors test whether ectopic expression of pgps rescues the Tm sensitivity of the nhr-8 and nhr-8 osm-3 double mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this valuable comment regarding the specific role of nhr-8 in the control of the PGPs. Indeed NHR-8 is involved in cholesterol metabolism and its putative ligand is likely derived from cholesterol (Magner et al. PMID: 23931753). We therefore asked if NHR8 and downstream PGP expression as well as TM resistance might be affected by cholesterol. Indeed, pgp-8 was significantly upregulated in wildtype animals on high cholesterol. Further, we checked if PGP-dependent TM resistance might be affected by cholesterol. In both wildtype animals and osm-3 mutants, cholesterol was protective against TM toxicity. This protection was fully nhr-8 dependent. Together this suggests that upstream cholesterol or related metabolites act via NHR-8 and PGPs to modulate TM resistance.</p><p>We have spent considerable time and effort to generate PGP transgenic worms for overexpression in the nhr-8 and nhr-8; osm-3 double mutant. This would test if pgp expression is sufficient for TM resistance even in the absence of NHR-8. Unfortunately, despite our longstanding experience and multiple parallel approaches we did not succeed to generate pgp overexpressor <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains, potentially due to toxicity.</p><p>Nonetheless, our new data address the reviewer’s question if TM resistance in osm-3 mutants was due to NHR-8 regulation of PGPs. Expanding to upstream modulation by cholesterol or its derived signals, we avoid disruption of nhr-8 that might have pleiotropic effects and we find elevated pgp-8 expression. We demonstrate nhr-8 dependent TM resistance that requires PGPs. Together, these data clearly support the idea that NHR-8 controls pgp expression to affect TM resistance.</p><p>While nhr-8 is involved in dauer formation, this did not interfere with the interpretation of our results. First, in the TM resistance assays, nhr-8 mutants die immediately after hatching from the protective eggs, as L1 larvae, clearly before the dauer decision. Second, nhr-8 overexpression is sufficient to protect from TM toxicity, positioning NHR-8, independently from assays that might be affected by dauer formation, as an upstream regulator of xenobiotic stress resistance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) UPR response in osm-3 (dh441): The authors emphasize that the lack of UPR induction they observe upon Tm treatment is due to a drug detoxification mechanism. However, they don't demonstrate this by confirming that the UPR can still be induced in these animals when activated by non-drug means eg. genetic activation of the UPR by expression of misfolded proteins, or by expression of spliced XBP-1. This is needed to confirm that drug detoxification is in operation here, rather than another mechanism, such as a reduction in the rate of translation, or a mechanism that increases ER homeostasis independent of the UPR. In addition, is this effect specific to Tm among the drugs that induce UPR activation, or is it a general effect? For example, does treatment with thapsigargin or another UPR-activating drug induce the UPR in osm-3 animals?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ points and agree that this is a key question: is the UPR still functional in osm-3 mutants in which we do not observe any TM-induced UPR signaling?</p><p>We addressed this question in two ways:</p><p>1) We induce ER stress genetically by knocking down the ERAD gene sel-1. This led to defects in clearance of misfolded proteins in the ER and triggered the UPR. Importantly, sel-1 RNAi induces hsp-4::GFP expression in osm-3 mutants.</p><p>2) We induced ER stress using a chemical approach exposing worms to the thiol reductase DTT. Just as the wildtype, osm-3 mutants mount a significant UPR response to DTT, as measured by increased xbp-1 splicing and hsp-4 mRNA levels. Consistent with this, motility was severely reduced in both wildtype and osm-3 animals after DTT treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, Lines 243-245: &quot;Instead of an activated stress signaling status that might explain the TM resistance, osm-3 Dyf mutants show no ER UPR induction upon TM treatment.&quot;</p><p>The implications of this point might be worth additional discussion / speculation. Do the data suggest that UPR overactivation could be a mechanism of TM toxicity, and that osm-3 mutants prevent that overactivation? Or do the authors favor the view that osm-3 mutants detoxify TM in such a way that ER UPR never needs to get activated in the first place?</p><p>Our data favor the second view: Due to detoxification, TM does not lead to UPR-ER activation. Our experiments did not address, and we cannot rule out that TM toxicity in the WT is in fact mediated by overactivated UPR. However, given the disruption of N-glycosylation by TM, the toxicity, in our view, is likely caused by a massive loss of function in the secretory pathway. However, the two views are somewhat connected: regardless of TM toxicity through run-away ER UPR or massive disruption of protein processing, osm-3 mutants are protected and our data show that this is mediated by PGPs. Additionally, it is unlikely that osm-3 mutations counter TM toxicity by dampening the UPR. Then, TM would still interfere with protein processing in the ER, leading to damage.</p></disp-quote><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but some issues remain that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1. The demonstration that pgp-8 KD was sufficient to increase hsp-4 expression in osm-3 mutants (Figure 5E, which is not cited in the main text, and not referred in the abstract) provides some support for the proposition that NHR-8 induction of pgp genes is responsible for TM resistance in osm-3 mutants. However, this is shown with higher TM concentration, sufficient to induce hsp-4 up-regulation even in control-treated osm-3 mutants, so that sensitization was a matter of scale rather than from nothing to something, which would have been more conclusive. Stronger support would have been provided by experiments examining the ability of pgp-8 RNAi to abolish developmental resistance to TM in osm-3 mutants (and to Ivermectin and paraquat to test the generality of detoxification mechanisms). Furthermore, additional experiments examining the effects of pgp-8 RNAi on worms over-expressing NHR-8 are important to establish that OSM-3, NHR-8 and PGP-8 function as one pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for supporting our manuscript for publication. We have edited the final text to reflect the fact that the pgps likely act in concert and that individual knockdowns are expected to show only partial effects. We think that the effect of verapamil a the 1nM concentration is specific to PGPs and we have discussed the effects of higher concentrations in our reviewer response letter in the submission from September 2020. Therefore, we think that this is a direct pharmacological effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Cholesterol experiments are rather indirect and therefore need to be interpreted carefully. The authors need to provide greater clarity in the interpretation of these data and what can or can't be concluded from them.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carefully gone through the results and Discussion sections again and have made sure to limit our conclusions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
