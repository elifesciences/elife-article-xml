challenges the human malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, faces during its progression into its various lifecycle stages warrant the use of effective and highly regulated access to chromatin for transcriptional regulation. Microrchidia (MORC) proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across plant and animal kingdoms. Accumulating evidence has shed light on the role MORC protein plays as a transcriptional switch in apicomplexan parasites. In this study, using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool along with complementary molecular and genomics approaches, we demonstrate that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC not only modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite erythrocytic cycle, but is also essential to the parasite survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments suggests that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC binds to not only sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation but may also play a role in modulating stage transition. Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) studies indicate that downregulation of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC impairs key histone marks and induces the collapse of the parasite heterochromatin structure leading to its death. All together these findings confirm that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, validating this factor as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Malaria is an infectious disease caused by parasites that spread to humans through mosquitoes.

Among the five human-infecting species, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is the deadliest, with over 619,000 deaths in 2023 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">WHO, 2023</xref>). To adapt to extreme environmental challenges, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> possesses unique strategies that direct the tightly coordinated changes in gene expression and control transcriptional switching in genes encoded by multigene families to ensure antigenic variation and immune evasion. Changes in gene expression throughout the parasite life cycle are controlled by a surprisingly low repertoire of transcription factors (TFs) encoded in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coulson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balaji et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Silva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yuda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwanaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kafsack et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lesage et al., 2018</xref>). The 27 apicomplexan APETALA2 (ApiAP2) DNA-binding proteins are the only well-documented parasite TFs known to contribute to the modulation of gene expression throughout various stages of the parasite’s development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balaji et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yuda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwanaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kafsack et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yuda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Modrzynska et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yuda et al., 2020</xref>). Since the discovery of the AP2 gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balaji et al., 2005</xref>), evidence has alluded to their role as master regulators of gene expression throughout transitory phases of the parasite life cycle. The most well-documented are the gametocyte-specific TFs (AP2-G, AP2-G2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yuda et al., 2015</xref>) with the subsequent discovery of those associated with a transition to sexual differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yuda et al., 2020</xref>) as well as sporozoite (AP2-SP) and liver stages (AP2-L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwanaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yuda et al., 2010</xref>). The <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genome, however, encompasses well over 5,000 protein-coding genes suggesting there are most likely other molecular components responsible for gene expression. It is believed that, to offset the relatively low TF range, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> has evolved additional mechanisms regulating gene expression including mechanisms that use epigenetics factors, RNA binding proteins, or regulate chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bozdech et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Le Roch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bozdech et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Srinivasan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silvestrini et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). All together these components work in combination to regulate the dynamic organization of DNA, and the cascade of gene expression required for the parasite life cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dekker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dostie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cui et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dembélé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bunnik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batugedara et al., 2020</xref>). Despite their importance, the identification and functional characterization of regulatory players controlling chromatin remains a challenge in this intractable organism. However, with the advent of sensitive technologies capable of capturing important chromatin associated regulatory complexes such as ChIP, chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) technologies, and chromatin enrichment for proteomics (ChEP), we can now solve important facets of molecular components controlling epigenetics and chromatin structure.</p><p>MORC belongs to a highly conserved nuclear protein superfamily with widespread domain architectures that link MORCs with signaling-dependent chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation across plant and animal kingdoms, including the apicomplexan parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lorković, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weiser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2021a</xref>). In all organisms, MORC contains several domains that form a catalytically active ATPase. Apicomplexan MORC ATPases are encircled by Kelch-repeat β-propellers as well as a CW-type zinc finger domain functioning as a histone reader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farhat et al., 2020</xref>). In higher eukaryotes, MORCs were first identified as epigenetic regulators and chromatin remodelers in germ cell development. Currently, these proteins are shown to be involved in various human diseases including cancers and are expected to serve as important biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). In the apicomplexan parasite, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, <italic>Tg</italic>MORC was shown to recruit the histone deacetylase HDAC3 to particular genome loci to regulate chromatin accessibility, restricting sexual commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farhat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhong et al., 2023</xref>). <italic>Tg</italic>MORC-depleted cells also resulted in change in a gene expression with up regulation of secondary AP2 factors and a significant shift from asexual to sexual differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farhat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Saksouk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bougdour et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hillier et al., 2019</xref>). Having multiple homologs with <italic>T. gondii</italic>, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> AP2 protein conservation is primarily restricted to their AP2 DNA-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jeninga et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hiyoshi and Wada, 1990</xref>). Recently, ChEP experiments done in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> identified <italic>Pf</italic>MORC as one of the highest enriched chromatin-bound proteins at different stages of the parasite intraerythrocytic development cycle (IDC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batugedara et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Pf</italic>MORC was also detected at a relatively high level throughout the parasite life cycle, including sporozoites and liver stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farhat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Singh et al., 2021b</xref>), and has been identified in several protein pull-down experiments as targeting both AP2 TFs and epigenetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farhat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hillier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Subudhi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bryant et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Singh et al., 2024</xref>). Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC seems to interact with AP2-G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2021a</xref>), a TF that plays a critical role in the maturation of gametocytes. However, the genome-wide distribution and exact function of this protein throughout the parasite life cycle remained elusive.</p><p>In this study, we apply CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing technologies to determine the function, genome distribution, and indispensability of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC throughout the parasite’s IDC. Immunoprecipitation of an HA-tagged parasite line validates the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in heterochromatin structure maintenance. Using the downregulation of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC induced through the TetR-DOZI system, we demonstrate the functional significance of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in heterochromatin stability and gene repression. Immunofluorescence-based assays and ChIP-seq experiments show that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC localizes to heterochromatin clusters at or near <italic>var</italic> genes with significant overlap with well-known signatures of the parasite heterochromatin post-translational modification (PTM) H3K9-trimethylation (H3K9me3) marks. When <italic>Pf</italic>MORC was downregulated, a level of H3K9me3 was detected at a lower level, demonstrating a possible role of this protein in epigenetic regulation and gene repression. Finally, Hi-C analyses demonstrate that downregulation of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC results in significant dysregulation of chromatin architectural stability resulting in parasite death. All together our work provides significant insight into the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in the maintenance of the pathogens' epigenetics and chromosomal architectural integrity and validates this protein as a promising target for novel therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of <italic>P</italic>fMORC-HA transgenic line shows nuclear localization in heterochromatin clusters</title><p>To characterize the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, we applied the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool to add a 3 X-HA tag at the C-terminal coding region of the <italic>Pfmorc</italic> locus (PF3D7_1468100) in an NF54 line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ganesan et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The involvement of GDV1 as essential in sexual commitment is well substantiated and further study involving the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in sexual commitment could not be fully addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kafsack et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yuda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Filarsky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yuda et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kent et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Despite this finding, we were able to design experiments to determine the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC throughout the IDC as no other major detrimental mutations were detected in the genome. We first validated <italic>Pf</italic>MORC protein expression through Western blot analysis. Regardless of potential protein degradation, results showed an expected band size within the ~290 kDa range that was absent in NF54 control compared to our tagged line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Immunofluorescence (IFA) analysis of intracellular parasites revealed that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC is localized in the nucleus throughout the parasite IDC in punctate patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). A single foci per parasite was detected in the nuclear periphery at the ring stage. An increased number of foci with a more diffuse signal could be detected as the number of DNA copies increased at the schizont stage. Moreover, punctuates were shown to have strong colocalization signals with histone H3K9me3 marks present at the different parasite developmental stages analyzed. This was most evident during the early ring stage of the parasite IDC where the chromatin organization is more compact with a single DNA copy. Altogether, our findings indicated that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC is a true nuclear protein that is most likely associated with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> heterochromatin cluster(s).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Pf</italic>MORC-HA is associated with heterochromatin.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Illustration of the <italic>Pf</italic>MORC containing domains including Kelch type b propeller and ATPase domains using InterProScan.

Notably, two of these three proteins have been reported to interact with MORC in several studies, further supporting a strong interaction between them. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that these proteins are nuclear and are associated with heterochromatin, DNA binding, and transcription factor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).

The difference is even greater within the gene body with gametocyte genes displaying almost no reads mapped more than 200 bp downstream of the TSS and antigenic gene families containing 0.5–1.5 RPKM normalized reads.

As opposed to what was observed previously with the glmS-ribozyme system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Singh et al., 2021b</xref>), aTC removal at the ring stage induced clear signs of stress and cell cycle arrest in mid- trophozoite and schizont stages of the first intraerythrocytic cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–d</xref>) compared to (+) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC and WT parasites.

GO analyses of downregulated genes, on the other hand, were found to be closely associated with regular metabolic processes and intracellular transport mechanisms suggesting dysregulation of regular cellular activity. However, at this stage, it is probable that the limited depletion of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC (58%) has restricted effects at the transcriptional level (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and that the observed down-regulated genes are likely due to an indirect effect of cell cycle arrest.

MORC proteins from plant to animal cells have a broad range of binding sites within the genome and participate in either DNA methylation establishment or heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tencer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mimura et al., 2010</xref>). They have also been shown to co-localize with TFs in unmethylated promoter regions to alter chromatin accessibility and regulate TF binding and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mimura et al., 2010</xref>). For instance, AP2-P (PF3D7_1107800), AP2-G5, ISW1, NUP2, MCM5, and HDAC1 have been shown to interact with MORC in several published works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farhat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Subudhi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bryant et al., 2020</xref>), including this work. Protein pull-down experiments in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. and <italic>T. gondii</italic> studies have detected MORC in complexes with several AP2 TFs. In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, <italic>Tg</italic>MORC was characterized as an upstream transcriptional repressor of sexual commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farhat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhong et al., 2023</xref>). In <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC was still poorly understood. Conflicting results on the essentiality of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC using either KD or KO strategies remained unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool, we have determined the nuclear localization, genome-wide distribution, and regulatory impacts of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC on the parasite chromatin, transcriptome, and cell cycle development. We now have powerful evidence demonstrating that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC is not only critical for parasite cell cycle progression and its survival but also has a direct role in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing, including regulating immune evasion through antigenic variation. Disparities observed in the essentiality of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC for the parasite survival in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2021a</xref>) are most likely the results of weak protein disruption highlighting the need for a significant downregulation of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC for true functional analysis. Using IFA and protein pull-downs, we have confirmed that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC localizes to the nucleus and interacts with multiple ApiAP2 TFs, chromatin remodelers, and epigenetic players associated with heterochromatin regions including H3K9me3, SIP2, HDAC1, and the ISWI chromatin-remodeling complex (SWIB/MDM2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shang et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Although some discrepancies have been observed with other studies, mainly due to the fact that MORC protein was not used as the bait protein, our study validated the interaction of MORC with these partners, supporting that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC is in complex with key heterochromatin regulators. Using a combination of ChIP-seq, protein knock down, RNA-seq, and Hi-C experiments, we also demonstrated that the MORC protein is essential for the tight regulation of gene expression. We can speculate that lack of MORC impacts heterochromatin and chromatin compaction, preventing access to gene promoters from TFs and the general transcriptional machinery in a stage-specific manner. Although additional experiments will be required, our hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that downregulation of the <italic>Pf</italic>MORC significantly reduced H3K9me3 coverage in the heterochromatin cluster(s) and 5’ flanking regions of <italic>var</italic> and <italic>rifin</italic> genes. While we were unable to confirm a direct role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in the sexual conversion due to a nonsense mutation in AP2-G gene in our transfected lines, its strong interaction with AP2-G during the asexual cell cycle indicates that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in combination with other epigenetic factors may most likely control AP2-G expression and sexual differentiation. It is also important to recognize that the many pathways affected at the transcriptional level throughout the asexual stages in (-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC lines are not only the direct results of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC downregulation and decrease of its targeted DNA binding site. They are most likely a combination of direct and indirect effects of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC KD warranted by the cell cycle arrest observed at the phenotypic level and the collapse of the chromatin organization confirmed using the chromatin conformation capture experiment. These direct and indirect effects should be carefully considered, and a combination of functional genomic studies should be completed when interpreting changes in gene expression in mutant-generated lines.</p><p>All together our work-demonstrated that in addition to its direct role in heterochromatin formation and antigenic variation, <italic>Pf</italic>MORC may act as a potential repressor to control a set of parasite-specific genes including genes involved in parasite egress and invasion, and antigenic variation between the trophozoite to schizont stage transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shang et al., 2022</xref>). As our data confirm the importance of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC and the parasite specificity of several interacting partners, it is tempting to speculate that drugs targeting these protein complexes could lead to novel antiparasitic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Asexual parasite culture and maintenance</title><p>Asexual <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain NF54 or 3D7 parasites (MRA-1000, MRA-102, respectively) were propagated in 5% of human O<sup>+</sup> erythrocytes and 10 mL of RPMI-1640 medium containing 0.5% Albumax II (Invitrogen), 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 mg/L hypoxanthine, 25 mM HEPES, 0.225% NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 10 mg/mL gentamicin.

Parasites were washed in incomplete medium prior to fixing onto coverslips with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT under darkness. After fixation, samples were washed three to five times with 1 x PBS followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 25 min at RT. Subsequently, samples were subjected to PBS washes and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (2 mg/ml BSA solution in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 solution). Following overnight blocking, samples were washed and incubated for 1 hr at RT with Anti-HA Rb Ab (1:500, Abcam, ab9110) in a blocking buffer. After primary Ab incubation, samples were subject to 3 x washes with wash buffer (1 x PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20) followed by incubation with anti-rabbit DyLight 550 (Abcam ab98489; 1: 500) secondary antibody for 1  hr at room temperature. After incubation and a series of washes with wash buffer, slides were incubated with anti-H3K9me3 antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Millipore 07–442-AF488; 1:100) for 1  hr at RT.

We however agree with the comment regarding the lack of direct effects of _Pf_MORC KD and have since provided additional evidence by performing ChIP-seq experiments against H3K9me3 and H3K9ac during KD. Our new results are presented in Fig. 5.

Results have now been incorporated into the revised manuscript to confirm the identified interacting partners and the accuracy of the data we obtained in our experiment.

MORC was detected with the highest number of peptides (97 and 113) and spectra (1041 and 1177) confirming the efficiency of our pull-down. However, considering the relatively large size of the MORC protein (295kDa) and it weak detection in the control (5 and 7 peptides; 16 and 43 spectra), the Log2 FoldChange and Z-statistic after normalization are minimal compared to smaller proteins that were not identified in the control samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, can you explain why these proteins appear to be enriched at the same fold?</p></disp-quote><p>We can postulate that these proteins form a complex with a ratio of 1:1.

It would be good if authors could also put their results into perspective in light of the following pre-prints:</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. In this revised manuscript, we compared our IP-MS data to previous published manuscripts. Key proteins including the AP2-P (PF3D7_1107800) and HDAC1 were indeed identified in several experiments validating our initial findings of the formation of large complexes with MORC. However, it’s important to highlight that the MORC protein was not used as the bait protein in previously published papers, and thus some discrepancies can be observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the tendency of MORCs to form multiple complexes with AP2 factors, have you explored whether specific AP2s are conserved between Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, within the phylum?</p></disp-quote><p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> encodes for 27 putative AP2s, while <italic>T. gondii</italic> has over 60 AP2s, making direct comparison challenging.

Attempts to identify sequence homology among AP2s and the regions of conservation have been performed (PMID: 30959972, PMID: 30959972, PMID: 16040597). Although this information would provide interesting insight, we believe exploring this topic at this time would diverge from our primary objectives. It would be more appropriate to address this in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could this conservation be identified either through phylogenetic means or by using tools such as AlphaFold, especially considering not just the AP2 domains but also any existing ACDC domains?</p></disp-quote><p>Although this may reveal important information regarding the association between MORC proteins and AP2 domains, we believe investigating the conservation between AP2 across apicomplexan parasites may prove too challenging and is beyond the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Most of the genes are depicted without their immediate surroundings (Fig. 2d and Fig S2c, d). For instance, the promoter region of AP2g is not shown (Fig. 2d). It is therefore very challenging to determine the presence or absence of MORC upstream or downstream; considering that this factor, which can create DNA loop protrusions, might bind at a distance from the genes in question.</p></disp-quote><p>All gene coverage plots, including AP2-G, show 500 bp up- and downstream of the displayed gene.

The methodology behind this quantification remains ambiguous. It's essential for the authors to specify whether normalization was done using a loading control. As a benchmark, Singh et al. (2021) in their Figure 4 transparently used GAPDH as a loading control and included an untreated sample in their western blot analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for bringing this to our attention. Our initial quantification was performed using ImageJ. To address the Reviewer’s comment, we have reperformed the experiment. Our quantitative analysis was performed through Bio-Rad ImageLab software using aldolase expression as a loading control (50% of the MORC loading). This information has now been incorporated into the supplementary figures (Figure S3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There's a striking observation that, despite significant degradation of PfMORC (as depicted in Figures S1 and S3), only the upper band in the western blot diminishes. This inconsistency needs addressing, as it can raise questions about the interpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer's comment. We experienced some challenges upon performing a Western Blot on such a large protein (295kDa). Our initial attempts required long exposure that may have highlighted non-specific signals of smaller proteins. To address the reviewer’s comment, we have performed the experiment one more time and made necessary changes to our WB protocol. Our new result better reflects the expected down regulation of _Pf_MORC. These changes have been incorporated to our manuscript and Fig S3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for improving the writing and presentation.</p><p>MORC KD quantification and consistency with previous findings (Figure S3): When comparing their results with those from another study (Singh et al. 2021), it's critical to ensure that the experimental conditions, especially the methodology for KD and the quantification of protein levels, are similar.

It would be of interest to understand how this level of KD affects the parasite's biology, especially in the context of the paper's main findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this question by looking at the changes in chromatin structure in WT versus KD parasites upon atc removal. We have also validated this initial result by designing an additional ChIP-seq experiment against histone marks in WT versus KD parasites upon atc removal. Our findings showed a significant downregulation in H3K9me coverage in heterochromatin regions, specifically in genes associated with antigenic variation and invasion genes. These findings suggest that PfMORC regulates at least partially gene silencing and chromatin arrangements. The manuscript has been edited accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concluding page 5, the authors present an interpretation of their findings that suggests a multi-faceted role of PfMORC in regulating stage-specific gene families, particularly the gametocyte-related genes and merozoite surface proteins. While the narrative they present is intriguing, several concerns arise:</p><p>Over-reliance on correlation: The authors draw a direct line between the levels of PfMORC binding and the function of these genes in the parasite's life cycle. However, a mere correlation between PfMORC binding and stage-specific gene activity does not necessarily imply causation. They would need to provide experimental evidence showing that manipulation of PfMORC levels directly impacts these genes' expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer's comment. We have however partially addressed this issue by comparing our ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and Hi-C experiments. We concluded that several of the transcriptional changes observed were due to an indirect effect of PfMORC KD and were most likely induced by a cell cycle arrest and partial collapse of the chromatin structure. The collapse of the heterochromatin structure was validated using our Hi-C experiment. To further address additional concerns the review’s had, we have included additional ChIP-seq experiments targeting histone marks to confirm our initial hypothesis. Result of this additional experiment has been incorporated in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ambiguity surrounding &quot;low levels&quot; and &quot;high levels&quot;: The terms &quot;low levels&quot; and &quot;high levels&quot; of PfMORC binding are qualitative and could be subject to interpretation.

We have however quantified our change in DNA binding using normalized reads (RPKM). In trophozoite and schizont stages, most of the genes contain a mean of &lt;0.5 RPKM normalized reads per nucleotide of _Pf_MORC binding within their promoter region, whereas antigenic gene families such as <italic>var</italic> and <italic>rifin</italic> contain ~1.5 and 0.5 normalized reads, respectively (Fig. 2b).

We have edit the manuscript to clarify these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overextension of PfMORC's Role: The authors suggest that PfMORC moves to the regulatory regions around the TSS to guide RNA Polymerase and transcription factors. This is a substantial claim and would require additional experiments to validate. Simply observing binding in a region is insufficient to assign a specific functional role, especially one as critical as guiding RNA Polymerase. Historically, the MORC family has been primarily linked with gene silencing across Apicomplexan, plants, and metazoans. On page 7, the authors noted a minimal overlap between the ChIP-seq and RNA-seq signals (Fig. 4e). They also acknowledged that the pronounced gene expression shifts at schizont stages result from a combination of direct and indirect impacts of PfMORC degradation, which could cause cell cycle arrest and potential heterochromatin disintegration, rather than just decreased PfMORC binding. Therefore, the authors should adjust their conclusions in the manuscript to more accurately represent the multifaceted functions of MORC in the parasite.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer's comment and have edited the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>DISCUSSION:</p><p>The authors concluded that &quot;Using a combination of ChIP-seq, protein knock down, RNA-seq and Hi-C experiments, we have demonstrated that the MORC protein is essential for the tight regulation of gene expression through chromatin compaction, preventing access to gene promoters from TFs and the general transcriptional machinery in a stage specific manner.&quot;</p><p>Again, the assertion that MORC protein is essential for tight regulation of gene expression, based purely on correlational data (e.g., ChIP-seq showing binding doesn't prove functionality), assumes causality which might not be fully substantiated.

Asserting that MORC is essential for this function might oversimplify the process and overlook other critical contributors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comments and the conclusion has since been edited accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion is quite poor. It would be pertinent to put MORC in perspective within the broader picture of regulatory mechanisms of chromatin state at telomeres and var genes.

Or the contribution of HP1 and other non-coding RNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion. However, in order to put MORC in perspective within a broader picture, we would need to measure changes in localization of several molecular components regulating heterochromatin in WT versus KD condition. This will require access to several molecular tools and specific antibodies that we do not currently have.
