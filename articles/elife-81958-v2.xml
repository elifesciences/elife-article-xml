Several synaptic mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity have been described, but the functional properties of synapses involved in homeostasis are unknown. We used longitudinal two-photon functional imaging of dendritic spine calcium signals in visual and retrosplenial cortices of awake adult mice to quantify the sensory deprivation-induced changes in the responses of functionally identified spines. We found that spines whose activity selectively correlated with intrinsic network activity underwent tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-dependent homeostatic increases in their response amplitudes, but spines identified as responsive to sensory stimulation did not. We observed an increase in the global sensory-evoked responses following sensory deprivation, despite the fact that the identified sensory inputs did not strengthen. Instead, global sensory-evoked responses correlated with the strength of network-correlated inputs. Our results suggest that homeostatic regulation of global responses is mediated through changes to intrinsic network-correlated inputs rather than changes to identified sensory inputs thought to drive sensory processing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>homeostatic plasticty</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>sensory cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>212264/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keck</surname><given-names>Tara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>homeostasis_in_vivo</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keck</surname><given-names>Tara</given-names></name><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Georg B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wolfson Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keck</surname><given-names>Tara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004784</institution-id><institution>Novartis Stiftung für Medizinisch-Biologische Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Georg B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003136</institution-id><institution>Edmond J.

It allows for prolonged stable function during changing activity levels associated with ongoing Hebbian plasticity, changes in sensory drive or input loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keck et al., 2017</xref>). The impairment of homeostatic regulation is thought to result in prolonged periods of excessive neuronal hyper- or hypoactivity, which may impair network function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frere and Slutsky, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Litwin-Kumar and Doiron, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marder and Prinz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tetzlaff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zenke et al., 2013</xref>). Homeostatic regulation occurs through plastic changes to a broad range of synaptic, intrinsic, cellular, and network-level properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bridi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bridi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gainey and Feldman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Joseph and Turrigiano, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee and Kirkwood, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Turrigiano, 2011</xref>). These changes must facilitate rebalancing of activity while maintaining the underlying circuits established for ongoing sensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iacaruso et al., 2017</xref>), as well as for learned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jurjut et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Poort et al., 2015</xref>) and innate behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Branco and Redgrave, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans et al., 2018</xref>). Maintaining this balance is particularly challenging with synaptic forms of homeostatic plasticity, where synaptic connections form the basis for circuitry and memory, but may also undergo homeostatic changes in strength that is inversely proportional to changes in activity levels. Previous work in adult animals has shown that synaptic homeostatic changes occur in only a subset of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnes et al., 2017</xref>) or via additive changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goel and Lee, 2007</xref>), as opposed to multiplicative changes across the entire population described for some homeostatic mechanisms during development and the critical period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaneko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Turrigiano, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>). Identifying the functional properties of the subset of synapses that are homeostatically strengthened in adulthood is essential for understanding how sensory processing and homeostatic regulation are coordinated after the closure of the critical period, when sensory plasticity is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hensch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levelt and Hübener, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Sensory cortices in adult mice are known to be multimodal and receive multiple sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ibrahim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iurilli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knöpfel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Todd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoshitake et al., 2013</xref>), as well as intrinsic contextual and intracortical inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fiser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khan and Hofer, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Okun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pakan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pakan et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Petrus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saleem et al., 2018</xref>). Large populations of neurons in visual cortex have a strong correlation or coupling with the average network activity, which is thought to be largely non-sensory and represent contextual input that may be associated with behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Okun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>). High levels of network coupling are correlated with a higher probability of local intracortical connections between neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Okun et al., 2015</xref>) and could also reflect the presence of other common non-sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>). Following sensory deprivation, functional strengthening could occur in functional subsets of inputs, such as the remaining sensory inputs, other non-deprived sensory inputs, or network-correlated inputs, either independently or in a combination of subsets; however, it is currently unclear whether the synapses that undergo homeostatic strengthening encode a specific functional input.</p><p>Here, we examine the properties of inputs that undergo functional changes following sensory deprivation using repeated two-photon functional imaging of dendritic spines in awake mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iacaruso et al., 2017</xref>). We find that, following deprivation, inputs with activity that is correlated with the network activity undergo functional strengthening, while inputs that have identified sensory-evoked responses do not strengthen, independent of whether they encode a deprived or non-deprived sensory input. Despite the fact that sensory-evoked spine responses are not strengthened, we find that global sensory-evoked responses homeostatically increase following deprivation and are correlated with increases in responses of network-correlated spines on their dendrites. Together, our work suggests that homeostatic synaptic regulation occurs through changes to network-correlated inputs, rather than the sensory responsive inputs that drive ongoing sensory processing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We used chronic two-photon imaging in awake adult mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s (see Methods) to examine the functional properties of dendritic spines that undergo functional plasticity following sensory deprivation.

In these experiments, inactive spines could represent either inactivity or spine loss, which can be indistinguishable with GCaMP6s labelling. On average, the persistent (active at all time points) spines increased their functional response amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). It is important to note that the reduction of inactive spines over time may reflect spines whose activity decreased below detection thresholds immediately following deprivation and then, following subsequent homeostatic strengthening, were detectable again.</p><p>Certain forms of homeostatic synaptic changes are dependent on the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beattie et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006</xref>), so we examined if that was the case for the synaptic strengthening observed here. The increased amplitude of spine responses was blocked by an intraperitoneal injection of a dominant negative form of TNF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and F</xref>), suggesting this effect is dependent on TNF-α. Following deprivation, we found no changes over time in the average frequency of responses at the population level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Previous work has shown that spine-specific decreases in response frequency drive synapse-specific increases in response amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). We therefore examined if frequency changes were indicative of amplitude changes in individual spines. We observed no correlation between changes in frequency and amplitude within individual spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), indicating that the changes in frequency are not likely to be driving the changes in amplitude within a single spine.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identifying functional subsets of dendritic spines in visual cortex</title><p>We have previously used structural imaging of spine size as an in vivo proxy for synaptic strength and shown that not all spines undergo a TNF-α-dependent strengthening following deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnes et al., 2017</xref>). One possibility is that there could be common functional properties of spines that undergo homeostatic strengthening. We therefore characterized the response properties of individual spines prior to any form of deprivation during the baseline time points (–24 and –1 hr). We first measured the responses of spines to visual stimuli: bilateral drifting gratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>) and a sparse noise stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vries et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Spines that had time-locked responses to the visual stimulus at levels above chance (see Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ko et al., 2011</xref>) were categorized as ‘visually responsive’ spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We found that a majority of spines that were responsive to the sparse noise stimulus also responded to drifting gratings (97%). Therefore, in a subset of experiments, we characterized visually responsive spines using only the drifting gratings stimulus to allow sufficient imaging time to test other stimuli. When we examined the functional strengthening of all of the spines, we found an inverse relationship, such that the spines with the lowest visual responsiveness prior to deprivation underwent the strongest functional strengthening after deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

We therefore hypothesized that activity in some spines may reflect this network activity, potentially via local intracortical connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Okun et al., 2015</xref>).

While the average frequency of responses did not change following deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), we examined if functional groups of spines had changes in response frequency and observed a decrease in the frequency of responses of visually responsive spines over time following deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

We again measured responses of dendritic spines on layer 5 cells in the distal tufts in layer 2/3. Using the same classification approach as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, see Methods), we found that the activity of 92% of the spines was correlated with the network signal. Within this group, a subset of spines had time-locked responses to visual (18.7%) or auditory (15.9%) stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and the rest correlated only with the network signal (57.4%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Critically, this homeostatic response is hypothesized to occur through a presumed strengthening of the spared visual inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaneko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mrsic-Flogel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pandey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Turrigiano, 2017</xref>). Given that we did not observe increases in the response strength of sensory responsive spines, we examined if the global sensory responses were increased following dark exposure (a reversible deprivation paradigm) in adult mice. As a proxy for spiking, we measured the global dendritic signals from the same dendrites of layer 5 cells located in lower layer 2/3, where we also measured the spine signals, which we refer to as the ‘global dendritic responses’. In sensory cortices under our experimental conditions, the majority of dendritic signals are thought to reflect back-propagating action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Francioni et al., 2019</xref>). We found that following visual deprivation via dark exposure, the global dendritic responses in RSC to both visual and auditory stimulation were increased when compared with baseline measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>), consistent with past results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mrsic-Flogel et al., 2007</xref>). This was despite the fact that neither the visually responsive nor auditory responsive spines increased their responses to the same respective stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). Both the global visually-evoked responses and individual visually responsive spines maintained their visual tuning before and after deprivation at levels comparable to control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s1sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>We then examined the relationship between changes in post-deprivation activity relative to pre-deprivation baseline activity for both global dendritic responses and visually-evoked spine responses. Increases in global dendritic responses after deprivation were uncorrelated with the changes in visually-evoked spine responses on those dendrites, making it unlikely that increases in global dendritic responses were driven by increases in the strength of visually-evoked spine responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). There was also no relationship within a dendrite between changes in global dendritic responses and auditory-evoked spine responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). Conversely, increases in global dendritic responses were correlated with an increase in the network-correlated spine activity on the same dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). Our results suggest that increases in sensory-evoked global dendritic responses are unlikely to result from increases in the response strength of the identified sensory responsive inputs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we report a TNF-α-dependent increase in the functional responses of dendritic spines in awake mice following sensory deprivation. Surprisingly, when we examine the functional properties of spines that undergo strengthening, we find dendritic spines whose activity is correlated with the network signal are strengthened, but spines identified as sensory responsive are not. This strengthening of network-correlated spines occurs over a similar time course and magnitude in both visual cortex and RSC and in response to different deprivation paradigms. Despite the fact that we do not see an increase in responses of sensory responsive spines, we do observe a homeostatic increase in global sensory-evoked responses following sensory deprivation. This global increase is correlated with an increase in the response strength of network-correlated spines on those branches, but not of identified sensory responsive spines. Our findings suggest that in vivo synaptic homeostasis during adulthood occurs in a functional subset of inputs, specifically those correlated only with network activity, rather than the identified sensory responsive inputs that are thought to drive sensory processing.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Homeostatic regulation of network activity</title><p>Previous work has hypothesized that inputs are homeostatically strengthened following sensory deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Turrigiano, 2017</xref>), and that this process may facilitate the homeostatic regulation of cellular activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hengen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hengen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keck et al., 2013</xref>). Our results suggest that the homeostatic increase in sensory-evoked responses observed after deprivation in adult mice is not associated with increases in the response strength of identified sensory responsive inputs. Instead, we observe a correlation between increases in global sensory-evoked activity levels and increases in the functional response strength of network-correlated spines. Why do we see an increase in global sensory-evoked responses if there is not a change in the functional strength of the sensory responsive inputs? One possibility is that the strengthened network connections serve to amplify intrinsic activity, keeping cells closer to the threshold for action potential generation and thereby making incoming sensory responsive inputs more likely to elicit the observed sensory-evoked increases in post-synaptic activity. In line with this idea, previous work has shown that homeostatic recovery at the level of small networks of cells is mediated by increases in the intrinsic network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>) and that intrinsic network activity is amplified within these interconnected neural ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller et al., 2014</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that the amplification of network activity through a strengthening of network connections may underlie rebalancing of activity in the cortex following sensory deprivation affecting network activity. This provides a mechanism during adulthood by which overall activity can be modulated through the network inputs, without altering the identified sensory inputs and the established circuits thought to drive sensory processing.</p><p>If intrinsic network activity is amplified, what might these network-correlated inputs encode? Network-correlated spines do not respond: (1) in the case of visual stimulation to either drifting gratings or sparse noise visual stimuli, which are thought to drive broad visual responses, or (2) in RSC, in the case of auditory stimulation, specifically white-noise bursts. We cannot rule out that these network-correlated spines may respond to more specific visual or auditory stimuli that were not presented, or to sensory-feedback signals from higher brain regions, which may not be time-locked to the visual stimuli. The presence of the unclassified inputs as a category indicates that (1) not all inputs correlate with the network signal by default and (2) network-correlated inputs do not simply encompass inputs that were not identified as sensory responsive. The mouse cortex is known to respond to many non-sensory inputs and the network signal could reflect contextual signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khan and Hofer, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pakan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pakan et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tohmi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoshitake et al., 2013</xref>), spatial information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fiser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pakan et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saleem et al., 2018</xref>), intrinsic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Okun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>), or intracortical inputs, which are known to be preferentially strengthened in ex vivo preparations following dark exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Petrus et al., 2015</xref>). The network signal likely represents some combination of these signals. Given that our data were collected while the mice were stationary, it is unlikely that the network signal is driven by activity related to locomotion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Synaptic and molecular mechanisms</title><p>We find evidence that the functional strengthening of network-correlated spines is dependent on the cell-signalling cytokine TNF-α. Previous work has shown that soluble TNF-α is released from glial cells following reductions in glutamate levels and plays a key role in synaptic strengthening by facilitating the insertion of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006</xref>). Importantly, the synaptic localization of <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and their associated currents are unaffected by changes in TNF-α levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beattie et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2012</xref>). The specific actions of TNF-α may in part explain in vivo findings, where pharmacological blockade of TNF-α has shown selective impairments of homeostatic, but not NMDAR-dependent, Hebbian-like plasticity processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaneko et al., 2008</xref>). Further work is required to better understand the key neural circuit and molecular features that allow the selective modulation of homeostatic adaption and even more specifically, the network-correlated spines. One possibility is that TNF-α could target specific receptor profiles, potentially through differential synaptic expression of the TNF receptor 1 which is thought to be central to TNF-α-dependent synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grell et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2012</xref>); however, this would assume that homeostatic regulation occurs in the layer 5 cells.</p><p>Previous work has shown that TNF-α-dependent AMPAR insertion during homeostatic regulation is associated with the glutamate receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1), a synaptic scaffolding protein which facilitates insertion of synaptic AMPARs, thereby increasing the AMPAR current and number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gainey et al., 2009</xref>). Increases in GRIP1-dependent AMPAR insertion may be involved in the functional strengthening of spine responses that we observe here, as we have previously demonstrated that AMPAR-mediated synaptic strengthening occurs following monocular enucleation in a TNF-α-dependent manner and involves GRIP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnes et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, changes in inhibitory neural circuitry may contribute to the increased functional response strength that we observe in dendritic spines. Previous work has demonstrated that inhibitory synapses located on dendritic spines (also containing excitatory synapses) are eliminated at a higher rate following sensory deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Versendaal et al., 2012</xref>). The loss of local synapse-specific inhibition could enhance the response strength of individual spines; however, given that these changes in inhibitory synapses are only seen in a subset of spines (~15%), they are unlikely to be solely responsible for the observed amplitude increases in the network-correlated spines we report, which comprise more than 60% of the total spine population.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that while we made these measurements in layer 5 pyramidal cells, the homeostatic changes mediated by TNF-α could occur outside of layer 5, including changes to upstream inputs or changes to the presynaptic responses, either through changes in presynaptic release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vitureira et al., 2012</xref>) or through a change in activity patterns of the presynaptic cell (e.g., bursts compared to single spikes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Linden et al., 2009</xref>). Given that both sensory responsive spines (which do not strengthen) and network-correlated spines (which do strengthen) exhibit only network-correlated responses after sensory deprivation, changes in presynaptic activity patterns of network signals would require targeted changes to the network-corelated spines, but not the previously sensory responsive spines. Further research is necessary to identify the role of presynaptic plasticity in homeostatic synaptic plasticity in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Network homeostasis and sensory processing</title><p>If the network-correlated inputs are homeostatically regulated, what happens to the sensory responsive inputs following deprivation? We found evidence for a reduction in the overall activity of identified sensory responsive spines in visual cortex, with a fraction of visually responsive spines becoming inactive following enucleation. Our previous work has shown that monocular enucleation is associated with structural spine loss, suggesting that part of the functional silencing we observe here may occur through loss of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnes et al., 2017</xref>). A considerable number of identified sensory responsive spines do remain active, but in both visual cortex and RSC, they undergo no increase in response amplitude following sensory deprivation, independent of whether they are deprived or non-deprived inputs. Thus, we consistently observe that identified sensory responsive inputs are not strengthened in sensory cortices following deprivation, but that many sensory responsive inputs are preserved, which could underlie the stability of visual tuning that has been observed following sensory deprivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s1sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rose et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>What are the potential advantages of strengthening the network-correlated inputs, rather than the sensory responsive inputs? Through homeostatic regulation of the network activity, feedforward sensory input-output relationships that may encode sensory information and underlie sensory processing are not perturbed during adulthood. Our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnes et al., 2017</xref>) has suggested that scaling up the strongest sensory inputs could lead to a saturation of these inputs, due to known dendritic non-linearities in the local integration of multiple inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Branco and Häusser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Branco and Häusser, 2010</xref>). If sensory responsive inputs are saturated and no longer have distinct weights, information processing in the neuron is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnes et al., 2017</xref>). By homeostatically regulating the network-correlated inputs, the dynamic range of the sensory responsive inputs – both the remaining deprived sensory responsive inputs and the non-deprived sensory responsive inputs – is unaltered and the cortex can continue to process a wide range of external sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Panzeri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Panzeri et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>AAV</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV2/1-ef1a-GCaMP6s</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FMI vector core</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">XPRo1595</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Xencor, Inc</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Experiments were conducted according to the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 or were approved by the Veterinary Department of the Canton of Basel-Stadt, Switzerland. We used 43 adult (P60-120) male and female mice (C57BL/6) and measured 5858 individual spines. All mice were sex and age matched within experimental groups. Mice were housed with littermates (two to six mice depending on litter size) and kept on a 12 hr light-dark cycle at 21°C. Imaging experiments were time matched during the light cycle (except in dark exposure experiments).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Surgery</title><p>For in vivo imaging experiments, cranial windows were surgically implanted, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holtmaat et al., 2009</xref>), over the right hemisphere of visual cortex (coordinates 1.5–2.5 mm lateral of the midline and 0–1 mm anterior of lambda), which corresponds to the monocular region of visual cortex, or over the right hemisphere of RSC (coordinates 0.2–0.8 mm lateral of the midline and 0–1.5 mm anterior of lambda). We made a craniotomy in ketamine/xylazine (0.15 and 0.015 mg/g of body weight, respectively) anesthetized mice and replaced the skull with a glass coverslip that was attached to the bone with dental cement. Mice were injected with AAV2/1-ef1a-GCaMP6s into layer 5 (500 µm deep) before the glass coverslip was positioned. Mice were allowed to recover for at least 28 days after surgery before imaging commenced. For monocular enucleation, we applied lidocaine (Emla cream) to the area around the left (contralateral) eye in anesthetized mice prior to surgical removal of the eye. Control sham-enucleated mice were given time-matched anesthesia. For dark exposure experiments, mice were housed in a dark cabinet for 48 hr. For auditory deprivation experiments, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and the ear canal was filled with a plastic polymer (Kwik-Sil) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhuang et al., 2017</xref>) for 48 hr. The polymer was removed prior to testing at the 48 hr time point. Control sham-deprived mice were given time-matched anesthesia. Mice were randomly assigned into deprivation or sham-deprivation groups, such that half of each litter was in each group (except for dark exposure, where assignments were randomly made by cage, so as to not separate littermates). In visual cortex experiments, mice were imaged at –24 and –1 hr prior to deprivation or sham-deprivation and 12, 24, and 48 hr after. For RSC experiments, mice were imaged twice in a baseline session and then 48 hr later following deprivation or sham-deprivation. For experiments with the TNF-α inhibitor, mice were injected with XPro1595 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lewitus et al., 2014</xref>) (Xencor, Inc) at a dose of 10 mg/kg at –48 and –1 hr for RSC experiments and at −72, –24, and 24 hr for visual cortex experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Functional imaging and sensory stimulation</title><p>Measurements of functional imaging data were conducted as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sammons et al., 2018</xref>). Functional calcium imaging of volumes of visual cortex or RSC was performed on a custom-built two-photon microscope with a 12 kHz resonance scanner (Cambridge Technology) and a high-power objective Z-piezo stage (Physik Instrumente), using a MaiTai eHP laser with a DeepSee prechirp unit (Newport/Spectra Physics) set to 910 nm and a Nikon 16×, 0.8 NA objective, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>). Data were acquired with an 800 MHz digitizer (National Instruments) and pre-processed with a custom programmed field programmable gate array (National Instruments). The dynamic range of both the amplifier and the photo-multiplier tube exceeded the digitization range and the data acquisition software automatically detected digital saturation of all pixels. Imaging data were full-frame registered using a custom written registration algorithm. To remove slow signal changes in raw fluorescence traces, the 8th-percentile value of the fluorescence distribution in a ±15 s window was subtracted from the raw fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dombeck et al., 2007</xref>). Intrinsic signal imaging before enucleation was used to localize the monocular visual cortex as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keck et al., 2013</xref>), and the RSC was localized using stereotaxic coordinates. Layer 5 dendrites were identified by tracing the dendrites to the cell bodies. Separating layer 2/3 from layer 5 was aided by the fact that expression levels in layer 4 neurons were much lower in our preparation.</p><p>Mice were allowed to habituate to the setup while head-fixed and data were included from periods when the mice were stationary. Mice were presented with drifting gratings in eight directions (0–360 degrees in 45 degree steps) presented in a random order, with a spatial frequency of 0.04 cycles/degree and a temporal frequency of 2 Hz. In a subset of mice, we also presented a sparse visual noise stimulus. This consisted of a sequence of sparse noise stimuli that changed every 250 ms. Each sparse noise stimulus was a set of between 8 and 12, black or white squares (of 8 degrees of visual angle) on a gray background. The location of the squares was chosen randomly, but such that squares did not overlap in an individual sparse noise stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vries et al., 2020</xref>). Auditory stimulation consisted of the presentation of bilateral white noise bursts at 65 dB presented 30 cm from the mouse’s ears, with timing according to a uniform distribution (minimum interval of 3 s and maximum interval of 5 s). Prior to experiments, we chose a noise volume that was audible to the mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meyer et al., 2018</xref>). Mice were also imaged for a 6 min period in the dark, without auditory stimulation. The same stimulus paradigms were used at each time point before and after enucleation, dark exposure, auditory deprivation, or sham-deprivation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Spine signal extraction</title><p>Calcium responses from individual spines were isolated from global dendritic signals using a subtraction procedure described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iacaruso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>). To measure spine signals, circular ROIs were first drawn over individual dendritic spines to measure spine fluorescence and compute ΔF/F<sub>0_spine</sub>. We then drew circular ROIs of the same size as the spine ROI around the adjacent parent dendrite to the spine of interest in order to calculate the local dendritic signal, ΔF/F<sub>0_dendrite</sub>. Plotting ΔF/F<sub>0_spine</sub> against ΔF/F<sub>0_dendrite</sub> reveals two components of spine signals, a dendrite-related component and a spine-specific component. The dendrite-related component was removed from the spine signals by subtracting a scaled version of the dendritic signal, ΔF/F<sub>0_spine_specific</sub> = ΔF/F<sub>0_spine</sub> − α ΔF/F<sub>0_dendrite</sub>, where α equals the slope of a robust regression and was determined using the MATLAB function ‘robustfit’ of ΔF/F<sub>0_spine</sub> versus ΔF/F<sub>0_dendrite</sub>. To track the activity of the same dendritic spines over many days, individual single time series stacks were first full-frame registered using the motion correction software ‘Moco’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubbs et al., 2016</xref>). Stacks were then visually inspected for movement in the z-axis and discarded if a stable dendrite was not evident. Registered stacks were then concatenated across multiple imaging sessions and a running average (100 frames) was generated. The running average stack was then horizontally stitched to the raw stack and used as a template to register the raw data across multiple imaging sessions again using ‘Moco’ and ‘Manual landmark selection’ image registration software (ImageJ). Stacks were then visually inspected for active dendrites, the area around the active dendrite was cropped and this sub-section of the original stack was again motion corrected using ‘Moco’. Dendritic sections were excluded if there was evidence of crossing axons or dendrites. Calcium responses from individual spines were analyzed using peak detection to determine the onset of a spine response greater than a 15% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> threshold above baseline (threshold calculated as 3.5× RMS of spine response traces). Spine response frequency was calculated as the number of spine response peaks above threshold per second for the entire imaging session. Spine amplitude was calculated as the average area under the spine response peak which was above threshold, measured across the entire imaging session, except in RSC experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) where auditory and visual spine response amplitude was measured during auditory and visual stimulation, respectively (or as noted in figure legends). Spine activity integral was the summed area under the curve of all spine responses during the entire imaging session. All data were analyzed blind to time and experimental condition by two independent analysts and differences of more than 10% in responses were investigated. Spines were considered active during a time point if they had at least one response above threshold. Spines were considered inactive during a time point if they had no responses above threshold. Persistent spines were active at all time points. All included spines were active during at least one time point. The orientation selectivity index was calculated as in previous work for cellular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ko et al., 2011</xref>). Global dendritic signals were measured for each spine in the dendritic area adjacent to that spine. This approach avoids the ambiguity associated with determining whether or not dendritic branches are contiguous when they enter and exit the imaging depth plane.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Functional spine classification</title><p>To define functional properties of spines in visual cortex, we first classified spines as visual or not based on their responses to visual gratings and a sparse noise stimulus. Spines were determined to be visually responsive if they responded to either set of visual stimuli. First, to determine if a spine responds to the sparse noise stimulus, we used analyses as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vries et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, for each frame of the stimulus, we calculated the ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> for 0.47 s after the frame (spanning 7 frames) where F<sub>0</sub> is the response of the spine in the preceding 1.0 s (15 frames). As had been previously described, we calculated the derivative of the ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> signal immediately after the stimulus presentation and then again 100 ms later and fit a two-dimensional Gaussian-noise distribution, where outliers outside of four standard deviations were considered responsive trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vries et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We next determined if spines were responsive to the visual gratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ko et al., 2011</xref>). We first computed the correlation of the spine calcium fluorescence signal with a binarized visual stimulation signal that corresponds to the timing of the stimulus. In cases where there was a significant positive correlation with this signal, we then used a false positive threshold analysis to determine the extent to which individual spines had responses that were time-locked to the visual stimulus by chance. To set a threshold for visual responsivity, we used epochs of spine ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> signals collected when the mouse was stationary in the dark and a dummy binary visual stimulation signal identical to that used to detect visual spine correlations. Time-locked responses to the stimulus, occurring within 500 ms of the onset of the stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ko et al., 2011</xref>), were measured in the dark with respect to the dummy visual signal for each spine to determine the false positive rate (mean population false positive rate = 5.5 ± 0.1%). These values were then compared to the percentage of actual visual responses measured during grating presentations. All of the spines (100%) that were identified as visually responsive by our initial correlation analysis had a greater number of stimulus-locked visual responses than the false positive threshold. Because we found few spines that did not respond to both visual stimuli, we only used gratings in later experiments, as the sparse noise stimulus takes approximately 1 hr to present.</p><p>To classify network-correlated spines, we calculated the correlation coefficient between individual spine ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> signals and a network average ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> signal comprising of the average of all spine signals during all conditions in the imaged cortical region, excluding the spine of interest (based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Okun et al., 2015</xref>). Spine ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> signals were determined to be correlated with the network signal if the correlation value was positive and significant (p&lt;0.05). Spines whose activity had positive and significant correlations with the network activity, but not the visual stimulus, were classified as network-correlated spines. Spines were classified as visually responsive using the criteria above, even though their activity also had significant correlations with the network activity (all visually responsive spines also had positive and significant network correlations). Spines whose activity had no significant correlations with either network or visual signals were labelled unclassified.</p><p>Using the same visual stimulation threshold criteria mentioned above, 99% of the spines that were identified as network-correlated, but not visually responsive, had fewer stimulus-locked visual responses than our false positive threshold, and non-significant visual correlations. The 1% of identified network-correlated spines (10 spines) with stimulus-locked responses above the false positive threshold were excluded from further analysis. We repeated this entire process in RSC, but also included a binary signal corresponding to the presentation of auditory stimuli. Unclassified spines in both brain regions had no significant correlation with the external stimuli or network signal. Few unclassified spines had significant correlations with either whisker movement (3.2%) or pupil position or diameter (1.4%).</p><p>To test for spatial clustering of dendritic spine functional types, we calculated the probability of spines ‘n’ positions away from a spine<sub>0</sub> matching in functional property (adapted from a previous analysis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnes et al., 2017</xref>). The average probability of a functional match was calculated for spines 1,2,3,…,n spines away from spine<sub>0</sub>, where a match was given a value of 1 and a non-match a value of 0. We repeated this measure for each spine on a branch serving as spine<sub>0</sub>. We then randomly shuffled spine positions, repeated our analysis to generate a shuffled condition for each branch and compared the shuffled distribution to the experimentally observed distribution.</p><p>For within spine comparisons of normalized frequency and amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>), we compared frequency at 12 hr and amplitude at 48 hr, since a decrease in synaptic frequency preceded an increase in the strength in past work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed in either MATLAB or SigmaPlot.

loss of input activity is counterbalanced by the upregulation of synaptic activity. In this study, the authors have addressed homeostatic responses in adult animals and provide evidence that instead of synapses that directly represent the sensory information, synapses that show correlated intrinsic network activity are the ones that undergo the change upon sensory deprivation. This fundamental and important paper whose key claims are well supported by the data, will be useful to readers in the fields of experience-dependent plasticity, sensory cortical coding, and homeostatic plasticity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81958.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Goda</surname><given-names>Yukiko</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02qg15b79</institution-id><institution>Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Goda</surname><given-names>Yukiko</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02qg15b79</institution-id><institution>Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Hengen</surname><given-names>Keith B</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00cvxb145</institution-id><institution>Washington University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.08.02.502580">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.02.502580v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Lu Chen as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Yukiko Goda (Reviewer #1); Keith B Hengen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers have found the work to be important and of considerable general interest. Please carefully address individual points raised by the three reviewers, which can be dealt with by text edits or minor figure modifications. In particular, the fact that the present study used adult animals and that homeostatic plasticity in the adult brain could follow different rules from juvenile animals should be stressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Figure 2C – It would be important to include also a histogram of % visual stimuli eliciting time-locked responses for all deprived spines following deprivation as a measure of how well the system is responding to deprivation. In other words, is there an effect of enucleation on the reliability with which visual stimuli trigger responses?</p><p>2) Figure 2 – Related to the point above, only panel B appears to show results pertaining to post-enucleation, which is quite confusing. One should reconsider the panel order, perhaps moving panels B and C with both plots including the respective control and deprived data.</p><p>3) Figure 3C – Some network spines do show loss of activity upon sensory deprivation. Given that the proportion of network spines is 65% compared to 24% of visual spines, to begin with, one would expect that increase in the proportion of inactive spines by 10% for network spines (Figure 3F) represents a larger total number of spines than 20% increase for visual spines (Figure 3D). Could the increase in normalized amplitude shown by network spines be a consequence of the reduced activity of some of the network spines and secondary to the direct effects of loss of visual inputs? This point requires consideration/discussion. It would be informative to include a blind assessment of relative proportions of visual, network, and unclassified spines following enucleation and a comparison of the numbers to those of baseline in a graphical representation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Methods: &quot;Intrinsic signal imaging before enucleation was used to localize the visual cortex…&quot; Were the recorded spines/dendrites in binocular or monocular V1? Baseline visual stimulation (gratings) was bilateral? It seems surprising that each spine's ocular dominance was not determined at baseline – please explain. I would expect different reactions to enucleation in a neuron that was mainly driven by the missing eye vs the intact eye.</p><p>2. In the example trace Figure S1B, please label all spine events that were counted for the frequency analysis (Figure S1E).</p><p>3. Figure 1E Are these spine calcium transients' responses to a visual stimulus (aligned to stimulation time) or are they 'spontaneous' events aligned by peak or max. slope? If the latter, please don't call them responses but find a more neutral term (e.g. EPSCaTs).</p><p>4. Figure 2B: &quot;When we examined the functional strengthening of the maintained visually responsive inputs, we found an inverse relationship, such that the spines with the lowest visual responsiveness prior to deprivation underwent the strongest functional strengthening after deprivation.&quot; Why is there a data point at zero visual responses, wouldn't that be an unclassified or network spine?</p><p>5. Figure 3 G-I: It is not well explained why you show this lack of correlation and what can be concluded from it. To me, frequency changes point to presynaptic plasticity (either release at the observed synapse or spike frequency of the presynaptic neuron), and amplitude changes to a postsynaptic mechanism. It seems you have both, but rarely in the same spines. I don't like the binning – why not show a cloud of all spines and the correlation coefficient? Try drawing a conclusion from these plots.</p><p>6. Figure 4 B: Please show raw traces under conditions of TNF α block. Was the amplitude of Ca transients at baseline affected by the inhibitor? It is my understanding that you use the blocker mainly as a diagnostic criterion for &quot;true homeostatic plasticity&quot;, as you draw no further conclusions (e.g. about the potential involvement of glia cells).</p><p>7. Figure 4J: How many branches were analyzed? (N missing in Table S4).</p><p>8. L.337: &quot;Further work is required to better understand the key neural circuit and molecular features that allow TNF-α to selectively modulate homeostatic adaption and even more specifically, the network correlated spines.&quot; You see the enhanced activity of network-correlated spines, but homeostatic plasticity could well happen elsewhere, e.g. in L4. It cannot be concluded that TNF-α selectively acts on the spines you happen to look at (a.k.a. streetlight effect). It would be good to spell out that the locus of homeostatic plasticity could be upstream of the synapses under scrutiny (unless you have good arguments that plasticity is local).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Do the authors have the capacity to separate V1m and V1b in their imaging sessions? The responses to monocular deprivation (via enucleation) in V1m should be purely homeostatic, while the effect in V1b is most likely a combination of homeostatic and Hebbian. The TNF α experiments suggest that a significant component of the data is homeostatic (assuming all TNF α plasticity is homeostatic), but it would be powerful to show that the key effects are evident in V1m. This is certainly not necessary for the paper, but if it were possible, it would be quite nice to see and would complement the TNF experiments.</p><p>2. Line 64: change &quot;Following deprivation&quot; to &quot;Following sensory deprivation&quot;. At this point, there's been no definition of deprivation so readers from outside the field might be confused.</p><p>3. Figure 4: the yellow and gray bars (e.g., 4B) are very confusing – my first impression was that they indicated normal vision and 48h dark deprivation. Then, in F through I, I read the figure as if animals were simultaneously deprived of vision and auditory input (note that there is both a gray bar and plugged ears), but the legend says, &quot;timeline for dark exposure (B) OR auditory ear plug (F)&quot;, which seems to suggest that these were not performed concurrently.</p><p>4. The authors cite Barnes 2017 and Bridi 2018 as the basis of the hypothesis that subsets of spines are subject to compensatory changes. Barnes 2017 clearly shows this, as well as being in adult animals. Bridi 2018 is based on CP animals and, as far as I can tell, doesn't make any claims about synaptic specificity: they measured extracellular spikes and mEPSCs (in whole cell patch), which cannot resolve synaptic subsets. Their key finding (to my eye) is a novel mechanism for compensatory plasticity, not synaptic specificity:</p><p>&quot;In sum, our manipulations of visual input combined with manipulations of spontaneous neuronal activity reveal that (i) changes in overall neuronal firing rate alone are not sufficient to mediate the lowered modification threshold for LTP/LTD nor the increased mEPSC amplitude observed after visual deprivation, (ii) changes in mEPSC amplitude induced by visual deprivation reflect Hebbian potentiation of excitatory synapses enabled by the reduced synaptic modification threshold, and (iii) changes in mEPSC amplitude induced by extreme reductions in neuronal activity reflect NMDAR-independent synaptic scaling.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81958.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers have found the work to be important and of considerable general interest.

We have first made sure that the age of the animals is clear throughout the manuscript (abstract, introduction, results, and discussion).

It is important to clarify that the visual cortex experiments in our study were done in monocular visual cortex, which we have now specified throughout the manuscript. Because all visual spines also have significant network signals (Figure 2), the spines that were identified as visually responsive during baseline (prior to sensory deprivation), only have network responses following visual deprivation, since there is no longer visual input from the contralateral eye. None of the spines have visually-evoked responses above chance after deprivation. We have specified this in the text now. Lines:</p><p>“It is important to note that following sensory deprivation, we no longer observed responses to visual stimuli in the visually responsive spines, since the feedforward input had been permanently removed. The responses of the previously categorized visually responsive spines consisted of network responses following deprivation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2 – Related to the point above, only panel B appears to show results pertaining to post-enucleation, which is quite confusing.

Could the increase in normalized amplitude shown by network spines be a consequence of the reduced activity of some of the network spines and secondary to the direct effects of loss of visual inputs? This point requires consideration/discussion. It would be informative to include a blind assessment of relative proportions of visual, network, and unclassified spines following enucleation and a comparison of the numbers to those of baseline in a graphical representation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. We have adjusted the text to reflect this point that while the relative fraction of visual spines that become inactive is higher than the relative fraction of inactive network spines, the absolute number of network spines that become inactive is larger. Lines:</p><p>“While a larger fraction of visually responsive spines become inactive, the absolute number of network-correlated spines that became inactive was higher, since network-correlated spines reflect a larger proportion of the total spine population. These results suggest that the increase in spine loss previously reported following enucleation (Barnes et al., 2017) may include both spines that were visually responsive and network-correlated prior to deprivation (Figure 3D-F).”</p><p>Secondly, the increase in the number of inactive network spines and subsequent strengthening only occurs in deprived animals, so even if the effect is secondary to visual deprivation, our data indicate that it is triggered by deprivation. We consistently see that there are not systematic changes in density/size/functional response strength of spines without the visual deprivation in our previous work (Barnes et al., 2017), as well as in this study.</p><p>As for the proportion of spines in each category following enucleation, the spines fall into only two categories, network and unclassified, since we do not observe visually-evoked responses following enucleation, as we are recording in monocular visual cortex. We do not see a difference in the unclassified spines following deprivation (0% of unclassified spines (categorized prior to deprivation) correlate with the network signal after deprivation), so there is no change in categorization, other than the visual spines would now be categorized as network-correlated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

All visual stimulation was bilateral, which we have now clarified in the methods. Given that we were measuring in monocular visual cortex, we did not measure ocular dominance. Furthermore, given that we see no visually-evoked responses to bilateral visual stimulation following sensory deprivation, we think that it is unlikely that spines are responding to inputs from the intact ipsilateral eye, consistent with expectations in monocular visual cortex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In other words, the frequency of responses in a spine goes down (likely presynaptically mediated) and then the response amplitude of that spine increases. The correlation we are measuring here tests that directly and finds that decreases in frequency in an individual spine is unlikely to be driving the increases in amplitude. We have included this conclusion in the manuscript now. Lines:</p><p>“Previous work has shown that spine specific decreases in response frequency drive synapse-specific increases in response amplitude (Lee et al., 2010). We therefore examined if frequency changes were indicative of amplitude changes in individual spines. We observed no correlation between changes in frequency and amplitude within individual spines (Figure 1 – —figure supplement 1F), indicating that the changes in frequency are not likely to be driving the changes in amplitude within a single spine.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 4 B: Please show raw traces under conditions of TNF α block. Was the amplitude of Ca transients at baseline affected by the inhibitor? It is my understanding that you use the blocker mainly as a diagnostic criterion for &quot;true homeostatic plasticity&quot;, as you draw no further conclusions (e.g. about the potential involvement of glia cells).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these traces to Figure 4B. The baseline amplitude of Ca transients is not altered by the TNF-α inhibitor (TNF-α 79.2 ± 4.2 vs Control 81.8 ± 3.1 % ∆F/F, p&gt;0.5, t-test). As the reviewer suggests, we have used this experiment to determine whether or not our effect is dependent on TNF-α, which is often used as an indicator of synaptic scaling. It is still unclear exactly how TNF-α interacts with synaptic strengthening, but we have included the known role of glia in this interaction in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 4J: How many branches were analyzed? (N missing in Table S4).</p></disp-quote><p>In order to measure the global dendritic signals, we measured the dendrite signal adjacent to the dendritic spine. Thus, the number of spine and dendrite measurements are the same. This particular approach is critical to avoid any ambiguity that occurs in identifying contiguous dendritic branches when a dendrite exits and re-enters the imaging plane. We have clarified this point in the methods. Lines:</p><p>“Global dendritic signals were measured for each spine in the dendritic area adjacent to that spine.

Lines:</p><p>“Finally, it is important to note that while we made these measurements in layer 5 pyramidal cells, the homeostatic changes mediated by TNF-α could occur outside of layer 5, including changes to upstream inputs or changes to the presynaptic responses, either through changes in presynaptic release (Vitureira et al., 2012) or through a change in activity patterns of the presynaptic cell (e.g., bursts compared to single spikes) (Linden et al., 2009). Given that both sensory responsive spines (which do not strengthen) and network-correlated spines (which do strengthen) exhibit only network-correlated responses after sensory deprivation, changes in presynaptic activity patterns of network signals would require targeted changes to the network-corelated spines, but not the previously sensory responsive spines. Further research is necessary to identify the role of presynaptic plasticity in homeostatic synaptic plasticity in vivo.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

The authors cite Barnes 2017 and Bridi 2018 as the basis of the hypothesis that subsets of spines are subject to compensatory changes. Barnes 2017 clearly shows this, as well as being in adult animals. Bridi 2018 is based on CP animals and, as far as I can tell, doesn't make any claims about synaptic specificity: they measured extracellular spikes and mEPSCs (in whole cell patch), which cannot resolve synaptic subsets. Their key finding (to my eye) is a novel mechanism for compensatory plasticity, not synaptic specificity:</p><p>&quot;In sum, our manipulations of visual input combined with manipulations of spontaneous neuronal activity reveal that (i) changes in overall neuronal firing rate alone are not sufficient to mediate the lowered modification threshold for LTP/LTD nor the increased mEPSC amplitude observed after visual deprivation, (ii) changes in mEPSC amplitude induced by visual deprivation reflect Hebbian potentiation of excitatory synapses enabled by the reduced synaptic modification threshold, and (iii) changes in mEPSC amplitude induced by extreme reductions in neuronal activity reflect NMDAR-independent synaptic scaling.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful point and we have taken this point out of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
