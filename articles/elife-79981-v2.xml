diphtheriae</italic> are characterized by their complex, multi-layered envelope. In addition to a peptidoglycan layer, these organisms possess an additional polysaccharide layer made of arabinogalactan and an outer membrane layer composed predominantly of long-chain fatty acids called mycolic acids. This so-called mycolata envelope structure is both a potent barrier against antibiotic entry into cells and a target of several antibacterial therapeutics. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying mycolata envelope assembly therefore promises to reveal new ways of disrupting this unique structure for the development of antibiotics and antibiotic potentiators. Because they engage with receptors on the cell surface during infection, bacteriophages have long been used as tools to uncover important aspects of host envelope assembly. However, surprisingly little is known about the interactions between Corynebacteriales phages and their hosts. We therefore made use of the phages Cog and CL31 that infect <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> (<italic>Cglu</italic>), a model member of the Corynebacteriales, to discover host factors important for phage infection. A high-density transposon library of <italic>Cglu</italic> was challenged with these phages followed by transposon sequencing to identify resistance loci. The analysis identified an important role for mycomembrane proteins in phage infection as well as components of the arabinogalactan and mycolic acid synthesis pathways. Importantly, the approach also implicated a new gene (<italic>cgp_0396</italic>) in the process of arabinogalactan modification and identified a conserved new factor (AhfA, Cpg_0475) required for mycolic acid synthesis in <italic>Cglu</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Corynebacterium</italic></kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>mycolic acid</kwd><kwd>cell envelope</kwd><kwd>arabinogalactan</kwd><kwd>porin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernhardt</surname><given-names>Thomas G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009559</institution-id><institution>Life Sciences Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKitterick</surname><given-names>Amelia C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Using bacteriophages as probes, new genes involved in cell surface construction were identified in a class of bacteria that includes important pathogens like <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The envelope surrounding bacteria is essential for the structural integrity of the cell in addition to serving as the interface with the environment. Members of the Corynebacteriales order, including pathogens such as <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) and <italic>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</italic>, have a particularly complex surface architecture referred to as the mycolata envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jankute et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daffé and Marrakchi, 2019</xref>). Like most bacteria, the cytoplasmic membrane is fortified with a cell wall made of the crosslinked heteropolymer peptidoglycan (PG). However, unique to these organisms are the additional layers attached to the PG matrix. Namely, branched chains of arabinogalactan (AG) are covalently linked to the PG, and the AG layer is further modified through the esterification of long acyl chains of mycolic acids. Free mycolic acid glycolipids linked to trehalose in the form of trehalose monomycolate (TMM) and trehalose dimycolate (TDM) as well as other glycolipid species join with the covalently linked mycolic acids to form a mycomembrane outer layer that includes embedded proteins and is thought to be the functional equivalent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> (<italic>Cglu</italic>) envelope and adaptation of corynephages to the lab strain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon of the multi-layered cell envelope of <italic>Cglu</italic> and other members of the Corynebacteriales.

The envelope also serves as a barrier to the entry of certain antibiotics. Therefore, in addition to providing fundamental insights into the growth and morphogenesis of the Corynebacteriales, studies of the mechanisms of envelope assembly in these organisms also promises to identify new vulnerabilities that will enable the development of novel therapies effective against mycobacterial pathogens. <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> (<italic>Cglu</italic>) is an excellent model organism for studies of mycolate envelope biogenesis due to its rapid doubling time and relatively small genome. Additionally, unlike mycobacterial models, mutants lacking the mycomembrane or arabanan chains of the AG layer are viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Portevin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alderwick et al., 2005</xref>), simplifying the genetic analysis of envelope assembly.</p><p>Viruses that infect bacteria, called bacteriophages or simply phages, have long served as useful probes of envelope assembly in addition to being interesting biological entities in their own right. To initiate infection, phages require specific cell surface receptors, which can be proteins, glycolipids, or polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertozzi Silva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunne et al., 2018</xref>). Phages engage with these receptors through both reversible and irreversible interactions and often require a combination of receptors to fully engage the cell surface and undergo the conformational changes necessary to penetrate the envelope. Host factors have additionally been implicated in facilitating the phage translocation through the layers of the cell envelope and into the cytoplasm where DNA is injected for replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scandella and Arber, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cumby et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wenzel et al., 2020</xref>), demonstrating that there are multiple steps involved in initiation of phage infection beyond engagement with the primary host receptor(s). Studies of phage-host interactions at the cell surface have been particularly helpful in uncovering mechanisms involved in envelope biogenesis. For example, the identification of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> porin LamB as the lambda phage receptor provided a powerful genetic system for investigating the process of protein transport from the cytoplasm to the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Randall-Hazelbauer and Schwartz, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szmelcman and Hofnung, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Emr et al., 1978</xref>). Similarly, the inner membrane mannose transporter subunits IIC<sup>Man</sup> and IID<sup>Man</sup> of <italic>E. coli</italic> were also demonstrated to be required for lambda phage DNA injection and have been used to investigate the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Williams et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Esquinas-Rychen and Erni, 2001</xref>). Surprisingly little is known about the receptor requirements for phages that infect members of the Corynebacteriales. The few studies that have been undertaken have hinted at roles of lipids in facilitating phage infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Furuchi and Tokunaga, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2009</xref>), but the essential role of the mycomembrane in most Corynebacteriales has made further investigation challenging. We therefore used two phages, Cog and CL31, that infect <italic>Cglu</italic> to probe envelope assembly in the Corynebacteriales. A high-density <italic>Cglu</italic> transposon library was challenged with each phage to identify genes required for phage sensitivity. This analysis led to the discovery of new factors involved in mycolic acid synthesis and AG modification that are conserved in C<italic>orynebacterial</italic> pathogens, highlighting the utility of phage resistance profiling for enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying mycolata envelope biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adaptation of environmental corynephages to the laboratory <italic>Cglu</italic> strain MB001</title><p>The corynephages CL31 and Cog were obtained from the Félix d’Hérelle Reference Center for Bacterial Viruses along with a susceptible environmental corynebacterial host strain for each (ATCC 15990 and LP-6, respectively). The phages were then adapted to form plaques on the lab strain MB001, and the genomes of the adapted phages were sequenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Notably, the lab-adapted variants of both Cog and CL31 had mutations in genes encoding putative tail proteins, suggesting that the surface of MB001 differs in some way from the environmental hosts necessitating a change in the phage particle for effective engagement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). In the case of Cog, the mutations were found in the initial lab-adapted isolate whereas for CL31, the mutations were associated with a change in plaque morphology. Lysates of CL31 grown on the environmental host (<sup>env</sup>CL31) formed plaques with two different morphologies on the lab host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Most of the plaques were large and turbid, but a small percentage were small and clear. A similar heterogeneity in plaque morphology for lab-adapted CL31 was recently reported, but the cause of the phenomenon was not investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hünnefeld et al., 2021</xref>). Phage purified from the clear plaques retained this phenotype and gave rise to only clear plaques on the MB001 host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Whole-genome sequencing of the clear plaque CL31 isolate (<sup>CP</sup>CL31) identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3’ end of <italic>clg55</italic>, which encodes a predicted tail protein in the structural protein locus of the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Notably, previous work has identified a putative variable region within Clg55, independent of the region in which these mutations occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hünnefeld et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that <italic>clg55</italic> is under selection, possibly due to its role in receptor recognition. Four additional <sup>CP</sup>CL31 variants were isolated, and Sanger sequencing revealed that all also had mutations in <italic>clg55</italic>, further implicating this structural gene in the altered plaque morphology phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). To understand how changes in Clg55 influence plaque morphology, the ability of the different phages to adsorb to <italic>Cglu</italic> was assessed. Adsorption assays comparing <sup>WT</sup>CL31 with a <sup>CP</sup>CL31 variant indicated that the mutant forming clear plaques binds more efficiently to MB001, suggesting that the changes in Clg55 promote better engagement of the phage with a receptor or co-receptor on the surface of <italic>Cglu</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), thereby leading to more efficient infection and the clear plaque phenotype. Structural predictions of the C-terminus of Clg55 detected remote homology with C1q-like domains involved in eukaryotic immune recognition by engaging with ligands such as lipopolysaccharide. Thus, Clg55 is a good candidate for the receptor binding protein of CL31.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Transposon sequencing reveals host requirements for phage infection</title><p>With MB001-adapted corynephages in hand, we were positioned to use our recently constructed high-density transposon library of MB001 to perform a global genetic analysis for the identification of host factors required for phage infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2019</xref>). To this end, the library was challenged with a high multiplicity of infection (MOI = 5) of lab-adapted Cog, <sup>WT</sup>CL31, or <sup>CP</sup>CL31 in two independent replicates. After allowing time for phage adsorption, the challenged libraries, along with an untreated control sample, were plated on brain-heart infusion (BHI) agar. Colonies from each sample were then separately scraped and pooled, and genomic DNA (gDNA) was prepared from the resulting cell suspensions. Transposon sequencing (Tn-Seq) was then used to analyze the profile of insertion mutants remaining in each of the libraries following phage challenge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Mutations that block phage infection were expected to promote survival following phage treatment. Therefore, relative to the profile of the untreated control, we anticipated that the Tn-Seq profiles of phage-treated samples would be enriched for transposon insertions in genes encoding factors involved in the synthesis and/or localization of phage receptor(s) as well as other genes required for infection. Indeed, in the profiles of the phage challenged samples, transposon insertions were concentrated in just a small collection of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which were highly reproducible bewteen replicates (r=0.877). Notably, there was little overlap in the set of genes that were strongly enriched for insertions when comparing profiles from the Cog- and CL31-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, the two phages appear to require a distinct set of factors for the efficient infection of <italic>Cglu</italic>. Conversely, there was more overlap between the two variants of CL31, with only a few genes having a differential enrichment profile. The results for each phage challenge experiment will be presented in turn below along with the new insights into cell envelope biogenesis gained from them.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CL31 and Cog have distinct requirements for host envelope components.</title><p>The heatmap shows genes that displayed a log<sub>2</sub> fold change in transposon insertion reads of <underline>&gt;</underline>5 in the transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) analysis following challenge with the indicated phage.

Genes were clustered based on predicted or published functions, which are indicated on the left.

Several of these genes are related to those from <italic>Mtb</italic> that have been implicated in decorating the AG layer with a galactosamine (GalN) modification that has been implicated in <italic>Mtb</italic> pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Draper et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Skovierová et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wheat et al., 2015</xref>). A recent analysis of the AG layer of <italic>Cglu</italic> found that it contains small amounts of GalN, suggesting that <italic>Cglu</italic> modifies its AG using a similar pathway to that found in <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marchand et al., 2012</xref>). Cgp_0391 is homologous to Rv3634c, which has been demonstrated in vitro to be a UDP-Gal/GalNAc-epimerase that catalyzes the interconversion of UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pardeshi et al., 2017</xref>). The GalNAc sugar is transferred from UDP to the polyprenyl-phosphate (PolyP-P) lipid carrier by <italic><sup>Mtb</sup></italic>PpgS with the assistance of Rv3632 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Skovierová et al., 2010</xref>), which is a homolog of Cgp_0393. The lipid linked sugar is then flipped and deacetylated by as yet unidentified factors to expose a GalN moiety to the extracellular surface of the membrane where it is then transferred to the AG polymer by Rv3779, which is an ortholog of Cgp_0658. The Cgp_0396 protein does not have a homolog in the <italic>Mtb</italic> AG modification system; however, it is a member of the GT2 family of glycosyltransferases, and mutants inactivating this protein have a phenotypic profile that clusters with the other <italic>Cglu</italic> factors predicted to function in AG modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Porins are proteins embedded in the outer cell membrane that allow nutrients and other molecules to cross this surface layer. In Gram-negative bacteria, beta-barrel porins are often used as receptors for phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertozzi Silva et al., 2016</xref>).

The genes encoding these porins are located adjacent to one another in the <italic>Cglu</italic> genome and form an apparent operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Deletion of both <italic>porA</italic> and <italic>porH</italic> as well as the deletion of <italic>porA</italic> alone was found to severely reduce the plating efficiency of Cog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), albeit to a lesser degree than <italic>ΔprotX</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Inactivation of <italic>porH</italic> alone did not affect plaque formation by Cog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting that this gene was a hit in the Tn-Seq analysis due to polar effects of <italic>porH</italic> insertions on <italic>porA</italic> expression. However, the deletion of <italic>porAH</italic> had a more severe effect on Cog plaque formation than the inactivation of <italic>porA</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting some contribution of PorH to Cog infection, likely in the context of hetero-oligomers with PorA. Deletion of the <italic>porB</italic> and <italic>porC</italic> porin-encoding genes, which are also adjacent to one another on the chromosome, did not interfere with <italic>Cglu</italic> infection by Cog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, the phage appears to have a specific requirement for the PorA porin to promote the efficient infection of <italic>Cglu</italic>. Consistent with the Tn-Seq results, neither the <italic>protX</italic> deletion nor any of the porin gene deletions negatively affected the plaquing efficiency of the CL31 phage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and E</xref>). Therefore, unlike Cog, the CL31 phage does not require a specific porin to infect <italic>Cglu</italic>.</p><p>Surprisingly, unlike Δ<italic>protX</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), no significant defects in phage adsorption were observed for mutants lacking the PorA and PorH porins or the putative AG modification system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). However, analysis of the ability of the phages to successfully infect their hosts following adsorption by monitoring the ability to form a plaque (infectious center) on a lawn of a permissive wild-type host showed a significant drop in the number of infectious centers formed by Cog following adsorption to either of the mutant hosts compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Despite the high enrichment of transposon insertions following phage challenge, the results indicate that neither PorAH nor decorations of the AG are essential for the phage to engage with the cell surface. Instead, these factors appear to be necessary for Cog infection post-attachment to ProtX, possibly by facilitating genome injection, similar to the inner membrane transport channels used by lambda and HK97 for DNA injection following attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scandella and Arber, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cumby et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mycolic acids are required for CL31 infection</title><p>The collection of genes enriched in insertions following CL31 challenge differed significantly from those that protected against Cog infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Rather than porin or AG modification, the inactivated genes that were enriched encode factors involved in mycolic acid synthesis or protein mycoloylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). Mycolic acid synthesis begins in the cytoplasm where acyl chains contributed by FadD2 and the ACC complex are condensed by Pks to form an extended lipid moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Portevin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Portevin et al., 2005</xref>). This long-chain lipid is then attached to trehalose, which is primarily synthesized by the OtsAB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murphy et al., 2005</xref>). The resulting TMM precursor is then reduced and acetylated before being transported across the inner membrane by the CmpL1 or CmpL4 transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lea-Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamaryo-Botte et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Once exposed to the extracytoplasmic space, the TMM molecule is deacetylated by an unknown mechanism and either attached to the AG layer, transferred to proteins, or delivered to the mycomembrane. Covalent attachment of mycolic acids to proteins or the AG layer is performed by corynemycoloyltransferase (Cmt) enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brand et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dautin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mycolic acids are required for CL31 infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon of the mycolic acid synthesis pathway.

Concurrently, (2) OtsAB synthesizes trehalose from UDP-glucose (UDP-G) and glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P).

This growth defect is reflected in the low level of transposon insertions detected in loci-encoding factors involved in the biosynthetic pathway when the Tn-Seq profile of the untreated library was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). By contrast, following CL31 exposure, insertions in genes like <italic>fadD2</italic>, <italic>pks</italic>, and <italic>otsA</italic> were highly enriched despite their poor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To validate the Tn-Seq results, we tested for CL31 and Cog plaque formation on hosts that are defective for synthesizing mycolic acid. A <italic>Δpks</italic> host was unable to support phage infection by either phage, but the poor growth of the mutant made this result hard to interpret.

Thus, the deletion analysis confirms the more stringent requirement of CL31 phage for mycolic acids relative to Cog.</p><p>In addition to factors involved in mycolic acid synthesis, insertions in the <italic>cmt1</italic> gene encoding a corynemycoloyltransferase were also enriched following challenge with <sup>WT</sup>CL31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>).

Consistent with the Tn-Seq results, <sup>WT</sup>CL31 is diminished in its ability to infect a <italic>Δcmt1</italic> mutant, forming hazy, diffuse plaques indicative of poor adsorption or injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Notably, <sup>CP</sup>CL31 appeared to be much less dependent on Cmt1 for infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). However, its ability to infect the <italic>Δcmt1</italic> mutant was also reduced relative to wild-type cells.

As expected from the Tn-Seq analysis, both <sup>WT</sup>CL31 and <sup>CP</sup>CL31 were unable to form plaques on a <italic>ΔahfA</italic> mutant due in part to a reduced ability to adsorb to the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Similar to other mutants inactivated for mycolic acid synthesis, the <italic>Cglu ΔahfA</italic> mutants had severe growth defects, forming small, rough colonies on plates and forming aggregates in liquid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This defect was not due to polar effects of the <italic>ahfA</italic> deletion on the adjacent <italic>murB2</italic> gene as ectopic expression of <italic>ahfA</italic> was able to complement the phage plating defect and the slow growth phenotypes of the deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and D</xref>). Additionally, the phage infection defect was not simply due to poor growth, as Cog was able to form plaques on the <italic>ΔahfA</italic> mutant, although at a slightly reduced efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether AhfA has a role in mycolic acid synthesis, we made use of the fluorescent trehalose analog 6-TAMRA-Trehalose (6-TMR-Tre), which is extracellularly incorporated by the Cmt enzymes into newly synthesized and translocated mycolic acids in the mycomembrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rodriguez-Rivera et al., 2018</xref>). A mixture of wild-type cells that were constitutively expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker and GFP-free cells of <italic>ΔahfA</italic> or <italic>Δpks</italic> mutants were labeled with 6-TMR-Tre and visualized by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The GFP-expressing wild-type cells showed a strong peripheral labeling with 6-TMR-Tre as expected, whereas the Δ<italic>pks</italic> mutant lacked any detectable signal. Label incorporation was also dramatically reduced in the <italic>ΔahfA</italic> mutant, but unlike the Δ<italic>pks</italic> mutant, a very low but detectable signal was observed that was most evident at cell septa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In addition to poor labeling with 6-TMR-Tre, cells of the two mutants appeared shorter and rounder than wild-type. A similar morphological phenotype has been reported for <italic>Mtb</italic> cells depleted for factors involved in mycolic acid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Wet et al., 2020</xref>). To further investigate the 6-TMR-Tre labeling phenotype of cells inactivated for AhfA, dye incorporation was quantified using a fluorimeter. As expected, the <italic>Δpks</italic> mutant incorporated very little measurable dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Consistent with the imaging results, the Δ<italic>ahfA</italic> mutant incorporated about threefold more dye than a mutant lacking the Pks synthase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>), and this defect was complemented by expression of <italic>ahfA</italic> from a plasmid. The effect of AhfA inactivation on mycolic acid synthesis was additionally assessed by analyzing total lipid extracts by thin-layer chromatography.

For example, coliphages T4 and lambda played critical roles in defining the processes of LPS biogenesis and outer membrane protein transport, respectively. Additionally, phages of Gram-positive bacteria like <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> phage ΦT3 have served as useful probes for the synthesis of teichoic acids and other surface polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Freymond et al., 2006</xref>). The receptors of phages that infect bacteria in the Corynebacteriales order have only just begun to be characterized. Gaining a greater understanding of the receptors recognized by these phages will aid the development of new tools for dissecting the assembly mechanism of the complex mycolata envelope surrounding their hosts. Among the multitude of phages that infect Corynebacteriales that have been isolated and genetically defined, receptor requirements for infection remain largely uncharacterized. In previous studies, lipids have been implicated in the initiation of infection by mycobacteriophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Imaeda and Blas, 1969</xref>), but in only one example has a requirement for a defined surface glycolipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2009</xref>) been demonstrated. We therefore sought to globally define the factors required for phages to infect members of the Corynebacteriales using <italic>Cglu</italic> as a model system and two unrelated corynephages adapted to the lab strain MB001. Recent work has demonstrated the ability of high-throughput genome-wide analyses to reveal phage receptors for both characterized and novel phages that infect Gram-negative hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kortright et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mutalik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 2021</xref>). Here, Tn-Seq analysis of resistant host mutants following phage challenge of a high-density transposon library successfully identified phage infection requirements, including both glycolipids and porin proteins in the mycomembrane. Additionally, the analysis identified new genes involved in AG modification and mycolic acid synthesis, highlighting the utility of the phage resistance profiling approach in revealing previously hidden aspects of mycolata envelope assembly for further functional characterization.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Potential role of mycolic acids and/or <italic>O</italic>-mycoloylated proteins as phage receptors</title><p>The analysis of transposon insertion enrichment following challenge with CL31 or Cog revealed a requirement for genes in the mycolic acid synthesis pathway for optimal infection. The dependence on this gene set was near absolute for CL31 whereas the Cog phage was found to retain the ability to plaque on cells defective for mycolic acid synthesis, albeit at a reduced efficiency. Notably, the severity of the plating phenotypes was reversed for a mutant defective in the mycoloyltransferase Cmt1 with Cog phage showing the strongest defect and CL31, especially the <sup>CP</sup>CL31 variant, retaining plaquing ability on the Δ<italic>cmt1</italic> strain. Thus, the two phages appear to rely on mycolic acids for infection, but in differing ways.</p><p>For Cog, the dependence on Cmt1 for infection suggests that it uses a mycoloylated protein as a receptor. Accordingly, we observed a strong dependence on the mycomembrane proteins ProtX and PorA for Cog infection. ‘Protein X’ (ProtX) was initially identified through analysis of mycoloylated proteins with the <italic>protX</italic> gene being identified only recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huc et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Issa et al., 2017</xref>). While little is known about the function of ProtX, the strong inhibition of plaque formation in parallel with the defects in adsorption indicate that ProtX is likely to be the outward facing receptor with which Cog engages to initiate infection. PorA and the other known porins are mycoloylated, and in several cases this modification has previously been found to depend on the Cmt1 transferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huc et al., 2013</xref>). Biochemical data has suggested that PorA forms an oligomer and can promote cation exchange across a lipid bilayer either alone or in complex with PorH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lichtinger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barth et al., 2010</xref>), and PorA is thought to be the most dominant protein in the mycomembrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marchand et al., 2012</xref>). Cog only required PorA for infection, not PorH, suggesting that PorA is functional in cells without PorH. We also observed that Cog plaquing was independent of the other porins PorB and PorC. Notably, Cog remained capable of efficiently adsorbing to Δ<italic>porAH</italic> cells but was defective in forming centers of infection following adsorption. Thus, Cog displays a relatively specific dependence on PorA for a stage of infection following its initial association with the cell surface, likely via ProtX. The finding that Cog has a stricter requirement for a mycoloylated protein for infection than the mycolic acid synthesis pathway itself suggests that a defect in mycolic acid synthesis and loss of the mycomembrane bypasses the need for ProtX and PorA to promote infection. We therefore infer that, following engagement with ProtX, Cog likely uses the porin as a conduit to penetrate the mycomembrane for DNA injection and potentially engages with a secondary receptor in the AG layer to promote the injection process (see below).</p><p>The requirement of Cmt1 for CL31 infection is much less pronounced than that observed for Cog. The wild-type phage forms light hazy plaques on a lawn of the Δ<italic>cmt1</italic> mutant, but the absolute efficiency of plaque formation appears near normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Relative to the wild-type phage, the <sup>CP</sup>CL31 mutant forms much more robust plaques on the Δ<italic>cmt1</italic> strain, but they are also hazier than the plaques formed on wild-type <italic>Cglu</italic>, which in the case of <sup>CP</sup>CL31 are clear. The hazy plaque phenotype and the observed adsorption defect of cells lacking Cmt1 suggest that these phages have a reduced ability to bind to the cell surface of the Δ<italic>cmt1</italic> mutant, possibly due to the reduced display of a mycoloylated protein receptor. <sup>CP</sup>CL31 may be less affected by the reduction in receptor concentration because the changes in its putative receptor binding protein Clg55 enhance its affinity for the receptor. Deletion analysis indicates that none of the known porins are used as the receptor. Also, none of the genes identified from the Tn-Seq as being required for CL31 infection besides <italic>cmt1</italic> encode a known mycoloylated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kavunja et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that CL31 employs multiple redundant protein receptors, which could explain why a strong phage resistance phenotype requires inactivation of the mycolic acid synthesis pathway. However, this observation could also indicate that CL31 directly recognizes glycolipids in the mycomembrane as part of the infection process instead of, or in addition to, mycoloylated protein(s). Although further work will be required to test these possibilities and determine the identity of the putative receptor(s), the Tn-Seq analysis clearly implicates mycolic acids in <italic>Cglu</italic> infection by corynephages.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>AG modification and Cog infection</title><p>In addition to the PorA and Cmt1 requirements, we also observed that the Cog phage was dependent on a collection of genes implicated in AG modification to properly infect <italic>Cglu</italic>. As with mutants lacking PorA, Cog was found to effectively adsorb to <italic>Cglu</italic> cells lacking these genes. Thus, the putative AG modification is needed for a stage of infection after engagement with the <italic>Cglu</italic> cell surface, which is consistent with the fact that the AG layer is covered by the mycomembrane. A requirement for modified cell wall polymer is common among phages that infect Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunne et al., 2018</xref>). For example, phages that require specific modifications of wall teichoic acids (WTAs) or lipoteichoic acids are often used to type strains, such as the use of phages that infect <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> to differentiate pathogenic serovars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loessner and Busse, 1990</xref>). Additionally, structural studies of the <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> phage 80α has led to the model that binding to WTAs leads to conformational changes in the virion that allow for activation of a structurally encoded phage hydrolase to degrade the PG layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kizziah et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore suspect that AG modification and association with the AG layer may be playing a similar role for Cog in promoting <italic>Cglu</italic> infection.</p><p>The high degree of similarity between the <italic>ppgS</italic>, <italic>cgp_0658, cgp_0391,</italic> and <italic>cgp_0393</italic> genes with the analogous gene set in <italic>Mtb</italic> strongly suggests that they encode a related AG modification system. Whether this system also adds GalN moieties to the AG as in <italic>Mtb</italic> or modifies the envelope layer with a different decoration remains unclear. Notably, there does not appear to be an analog of <italic>cgp_0396</italic> in the mycobacterial system. However, given the similar phenotypic profile of <italic>cgp_0396</italic> with the AG modification gene set and its importance for Cog infection, we conclude that this gene is also likely to encode an AG modification enzyme. Given that Cgp_0396 is part of the GT2 family of glycosyltransferases, we propose that it adds an additional sugar moiety to the PolyP-P-linked GalN synthesized by the other components of the system, but this possibility will require further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A new factor involved in mycolic acids synthesis</title><p>In addition to genes known to be important for mycolic acid synthesis, resistance profiling with the CL31 phage also identified AhfA (Cgp_0475) as a new factor required for the biogenesis of this critical envelope component. Unlike mutants lacking the Pks enzyme that directly synthesizes the lipid chain of mycolic acids, in which the TMM and TDM lipids are undetectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Portevin et al., 2004</xref>), cells inactivated for AhfA retain a very low but detectable level of these molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–C</xref>). Thus, although AhfA is critical for proper mycolic acid synthesis, it does not appear to be absolutely required for TMM production. AhfA is predicted to have a helix-grip fold domain implicated in lipid binding. The protein also lacks a predicted secretion signal, suggesting it is cytoplasmic. Notably, mutants of <italic>Cglu</italic> inactivated for its redundant pair of transmembrane TMM transporters (flippases) CmpL1 and CmpL4 also display a loss of extractable TMM glycolipids, indicating that proper glycolipid transport is somehow linked to its synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore propose that AhfA may similarly function in TMM transport, potentially as a carrier protein that shuttles the lipids from the synthetic enzymes to the CmpL1 and CmpL4 transporters.</p><p>AhfA is conserved in both <italic>Msmeg</italic> and <italic>Mtb</italic>, but it has not been found to be essential in these organisms that require mycolic acid synthesis for viability. <italic>Msmeg</italic> possesses two <italic>ahfA</italic>-like genes in tandem (MSMEG_0927 and MSMEG_0926) at a similar locus to that of <italic>ahfA</italic> in <italic>Cglu. Mtb,</italic> on the other hand, only encodes a single <italic>ahfA</italic> gene (Rv0481c) at this genomic position, but both <italic>Mtb</italic> and <italic>Msmeg</italic> encode other predicted SRPBCC family proteins, at least one of which is essential (MSMEG_0129/Rv0164) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the closest homolog of <italic>Cglu ahfA</italic> in these organisms may not be essential due to redundancy with other related genes. Nevertheless, the strong requirement for AhfA for mycolic acid synthesis in <italic>Cglu</italic> indicates that this gene and/or its relatives are likely to play important roles in the biogenesis of the mycomembrane and further dissection of their function promises to reveal new ways of compromising the pathway for antibiotic development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

The mixture was then vortexed and applied to a standard BHI agar plate (1.5% agar). After allowing the plate to dry under a flame for 10 min, 3 µL of each dilution in a 10-fold dilution series of phage were applied to the top agar and allowed to dry on the surface. Dried plates were then incubated overnight at 30°C and imaged using a digital scanner. To generate high-titer phage stocks, 200 µL of a mid-log <italic>Cglu</italic> culture (or culture of 0.3&lt;OD&lt;0.5) was mixed with 10 µL of various dilutions of a phage stock. After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, 4 mL of molten BHI top agar was added and poured onto a Petri dish. Each mixture was then vortexed and applied to a separate standard BHI agar plate. After solidifying, plates were incubated at room temperature overnight. Plates displaying confluent lysis of the <italic>Cglu</italic> lawn were overlaid with 8 mL of STE buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 8, 1 mM EDTA) and rocked overnight at 4°C. The overlay buffer was then collected and centrifuged to remove bacterial debris. The remaining supernatant was either concentrated through an Amicon centrifugal column (50 kDa cutoff) or precipitated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 and resuspended in SM buffer (100 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.002% gelatin). For quantification of phage stock titers, <italic>Cglu</italic> hosts were grown to midlog (OD<sub>600</sub>=0.3–0.4), and 100 µL of the culture was mixed with 10 µL of a phage stock dilution.

To adapt CL31, diluted purified <sup>env</sup>CL31 was plaqued on <italic>Cglu</italic> MB001 in BHI top agar and a single plaque was recovered into SM buffer. Phage from this plaque was again plated onto MB001, wherein two plaque morphologies were apparent. Each plaque morphotype (<sup>WT</sup>CL31 and <sup>CP</sup>CL31) was picked and plaque purified independently two more times. Further isolation of other <sup>CP</sup>CL31 alleles was performed by plaquing <sup>WT</sup>CL31 onto MB001, picking clear plaques formed among a high density of turbid plaques, and then plaque purifying on MB001. <sup>env</sup>Cog was initially unable to form plaques on MB001. We therefore tested the ability of <sup>env</sup>Cog to plaque on MB001 derivatives with mutations in potential restriction-modification (RM) systems, as well as MB001 grown on different media (LB 0.4% glucose (LBG) compared to BHI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> ). Clear plaques were formed on a lawn of the RM mutant grown in LBG top agar following infection with a high concentration of phage.

Phage was added to a 1 mL aliquot of the culture at an MOI between 0.1 and 0.01. The infection mixture was then vortexed and incubated at 30°C with rolling for the indicated timepoints. At each timepoint, 200 µL of the infected sample was removed and centrifuged for 3 min at 5000×<italic>g</italic>. The supernatant was collected and tittered in single or technical duplicate on wild-type <italic>Cglu</italic>. For measurements of terminal phage adsorption to mutant strains, overnight cultures were grown as above. Phage was added to a 200 µL aliquot of culture at a concentration of ~4 × 10<sup>5</sup> pfu/mL (0.001&lt;MOI&lt;0.01), vortexed, and incubated with rotation at 30°C for 30 min. The same phage inoculum was added to 200 µL of sterile media, vortexed, and immediately harvested to determine phage input. The infection and mock-infection mixtures were centrifuged to separate cells from free phages, and the supernatant was collected and tittered in technical duplicate on wild-type <italic>Cglu</italic> (mid-log culture) to determine the percent of adsorbed phages. The remaining cell pellet was used to quantify the centers of infection. The pellet was washed twice in BHI supplemented with 50 mM sodium citrate to remove any remaining unbound phages, resuspended in 100 µL BHI, and tittered in technical duplicate in a lawn of wild-type <italic>Cglu</italic> (mid-log culture). For improved visualization of Cog plaque formation, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> was added to the top agar. Each adsorption and infectious centers experiment was performed independently in biological triplicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Phage infection and Tn-Seq</title><p>Two independent rounds of infection of transposon-mutagenized cells were performed on a previously created <italic>Cglu</italic> high-density transposon library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2019</xref>). Frozen aliquots of the library were seeded into a BHI culture supplemented with Kan to an approximate OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.01. This culture was grown at 30°C to an OD<sub>600</sub>=0.3–0.4, and 2 mL aliquots were removed into fresh culture tubes to be infected with phage at an MOI of 5 or to serve as an uninfected control. The culture tubes were then returned to the incubator and rolled for 30 min. Following incubation, the cultures were pelleted, washed once with BHI, and resuspended in 1 mL BHI. For cultures that had been exposed to phage, the entirety of the resuspension was plated as 100 µL aliquots across 10 BHI Kan plates. For the uninfected cultures, the resuspension was diluted to 10<sup>–2</sup> in 1 mL BHI and similarly plated. Plates were incubated overnight at 30°C and followed by a second day of incubation at room temperature. After incubation, the colonies from each set of plates counted and pooled. gDNA was prepped with the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega) and further cleaned using the Genomic DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator (Zymo). Library preparation was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2019</xref>). Due to predicted low complexity, phage-challenged libraries were pooled at a 1:100 ratio relative to the unchallenged libraries. Libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq with 1×50 single paired end reads. All NGS data from this study are deposited under BioProject PRJNA834153.

To identify genes of interest in phage conditions, we normalized the number of phage infected reads to the total number of paired control reads and calculated the fold change in normalized read counts between each phage and its paired uninfected control. Additionally, a Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine whether the differences were statistically significant. Visual inspection of the insertion sites was performed using the Sanger Artemis Genome Browser and Annotation Tool. Genes of interested were determined to be those in which the fold change of insertions was greater than log<sub>2</sub> of 2 and with more than one unique insertion in both replicates of the Tn-seq. Additionally, an exception was made for Cog <italic>porA</italic> and <italic>porH</italic>, due to the small size of the genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Bacterial spot plating for single-colony imaging</title><p>Bacteria were scraped from a plate and resuspended in BHI.

The frozen pellets were resuspended in PBS and moved to a pre-weighed microcentrifuge tube, and the pellet weight was attained. For each sample 12 mg of cells were used per extraction. First, the pellet was resuspended in 1:2 chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>):methanol (MeOH) for 2 hr at room temperature, pelleted for 5 min at 500×<italic>g</italic>, and the organic layer containing the lipids was collected.

receptors) important for infection by two phages in the model bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum. Using their established high-density transposon library, they identify genes required for infection with the phages Cog and CL31. They also identified a spontaneous phage-resistant mutant that led to the discovery of a gene involved in mycolic acid synthesis. Overall, the work is of broad interest to scientists in the field of cell wall biogenesis, phage infection, and bacterial cell biology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79981.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kana</surname><given-names>Bavesh D</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03rp50x72</institution-id><institution>University of the Witwatersrand</institution></institution-wrap><country>South Africa</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Jacobs</surname><given-names>William R</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05cf8a891</institution-id><institution>Albert Einstein College of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Bramkamp</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04v76ef78</institution-id><institution>Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Gross</surname><given-names>Carol</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/043mz5j54</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.05.16.492151">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.16.492151v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: William R Jacobs (Reviewer #1) (co-reviewed by Brianna Weiss); Marc Bramkamp (Reviewer #2); Carol Gross (Reviewer #3) (co-reviewed by Horia Todor).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Although the authors’ experimental design is fundamentally sound, there is the possibility of “jackpotting”, which could affect their results, particularly in the uninfected control experiment. If the authors’ Tn-seq library is ~200,000 strains, and they don’t plate at 10-100x fold access of colonies, then any given strain (regardless of its phenotype) may or may not be represented in the output of the experiment, causing false phenotypes to be ascribed to genes based on chance. This is particularly problematic for the uninfected control, where the authors choose to dilute the culture 1000-fold to mimic the number of colonies that survive infection. They may be better served by plating the whole culture on the plates, to ensure adequate representation of the library. Part of the reason for this concern is that an overwhelming majority of statistically significant hits (something like 80-90%) appear to confer susceptibility rather than resistance (source data Figure 2) – something the authors’ experimental design should not be able to measure. The lack of accurate representation of distributions of strains in the starting culture also calls into question the quantitative differences presented in the results.</p><p>a. L138. Where the authors describe their initial experimental design it would be helpful to add more details. What is the size of the Tn library? What is the coverage in their experiment? Approximately how many colonies are recovered on the plates after phage infection and in the uninfected control?</p><p>b. It is important to know how the number of colonies on the plates compares to the number of reads in the experiment. In the analysis of most HT screens, one implicitly assumes that each read corresponds to 1 cell, hence each read can be treated as statistically independent. This assumption is critical to the statistical methods used to analyze this data. By scraping a plate of colonies (which may be required for efficient phage infection), the authors potentially violate this assumption (since the number of cells → the number of colonies, are the actual statistically independent entities in the experiment). Does this assumption hold (or approximately hold) for the screen? If not, a different statistical method should be used to determine p-values.</p><p>2. The authors’ Tn-seq methodology is different from previously published HT-phage screens (e.g. Mutalik et al., 2020 and Rousset et al., 2018). Whilst it is clear that plating the infected cells has advantages, this rationale will not be clear for most people’performing such experiments. Please explain the rationale for the experimental protocol:</p><p>a. Why did the authors plate the cultures after initial phage absorption instead of allowing them to remain in liquid?</p><p>b. How reproducible are the authors’ Tn-seq results? The SRA ascension shows multiple replicates but this is not described in the manuscript nor reflected in the supplementary data. Given the potential for bottleneck and jackpotting effects in this assay, some measure of reproducibility is important for interpreting the results (see point 1).</p><p>c. L587 “Significant hits with fewer than 10 insertions on each strand were manually removed.” Why did the authors choose this criterion? Almost all of the genes they removed have very asymmetric distributions (e.g. in the Cog experiment, cgp3051 has 47853 fwd reads and 6 rev reads). Asymmetric distribution of insertions suggests that overexpression of downstream genes has an important (positive or negative) effect. This is a worthwhile pursuit, and many automated analysis pipelines can disambiguate these effects, including those developed in the Walker Lab (e.g. doi: 10.1038/s41589-018-0041-4). These genes shouldn’t be thrown away when they are arguably some of the most informative hits!</p><p>3. There is a somewhat extensive phylogeny of M. smegmatis phages (phagesdb.org). Are the phages that the authors work on related to any of these phages? If so, what cluster do they map to? What is the host range of other phages in that cluster? If not, may be worthwhile to mention that these are quite distinct from other studied phages.</p><p>4.

Is there any relationship between the growth rate of the mutants and their phage susceptibility? This can be analyzed using the authors’ previous studies of this library.</p><p>6.

The Tn-Seq experiments were repeated with the uninfected controls plated at a density that maintains the representation of the original library. The overall results are largely unchanged because we maintain our focus on hits that become greatly enriched following phage infection not those that become depleted. The vast majority of these hits were validated for their involvement by constructing mutant strains, indicating the robustness of the current and previous analyses. With respect to the depletion of insertion mutants, we mentioned in the original submission that they are unlikely to be biologically meaningful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a.

In our view, a slurry of colonies from a plate is no different than a culture. Both contain a mixture of cells containing an array of different transposon mutants each represented multiple times in the population due to replication of the original mutant. We do not think there is any meaningful difference when it comes to the analysis whether this replication occurs in liquid or on a plate. In both cases, a read corresponds to a single cell/molecule of purified genomic DNA from the population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

These plates were incubated overnight and resistant colonies were scraped, pelleted, and DNA prepped in a similar manner to the approach we took.</p><p>We prefer plating over liquid growth because colony formation is an easy way to ensure that the mutant population has undergone numerous rounds of doubling under a given condition before the analysis is performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.

The hit lists remained largely unchanged from our initial analysis and those that were previously selected for further analysis in the prior submission were also enriched for insertions in both new data sets. Thus, the results are highly reproducible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c.

Our concern in this report was to investigate mutants that affect phage infection when inactivated. We will pursue genes that affect phage infection when overexpressed (as indicated by asymmetric insertion orientation distributions) in a follow-on study. We think such a study would best be carried out with a different transposon containing a strong outward facing promoter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Very few phages that infect <italic>Cglu</italic> have been isolated and sequenced, let alone studied.

In the prior phenotypic analysis, <italic>cgp_0475</italic> was identified as having severe fitness defects across many conditions. However, it was not possible to correlate its phenotype with other genes involved in mycolic acid synthesis like <italic>pks</italic> and <italic>fadD2</italic> because they were found to be so sick in the phenotypic outgrowth that they were classified as essential.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

This can be analyzed using the authors’ previous studies of this library.</p></disp-quote><p>While some of the phage resistant mutants are associated with poor fitness (namely those involved in mycolic acid synthesis), not all were associated with decreased growth. For example, there were minimal fitness defects associated with deletions of either <italic>porAH</italic> or the genes involved GalN decoration. However, loss of these genes greatly inhibited the ability of Cog to infect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The information on the localization of AhfA is sparse.
