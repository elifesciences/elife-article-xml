their favor. It remains unclear how many species harbor them and how diverse their mechanisms are. Here, we discover two spore killers from a natural isolate of the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. Both killers belong to the previously uncharacterized <italic>wtf</italic> gene family with 25 members in the reference genome. These two killers act in strain-background-independent and genome-location-independent manners to perturb the maturation of spores not inheriting them. Spores carrying one killer are protected from its killing effect but not that of the other killer. The killing and protecting activities can be uncoupled by mutation. The numbers and sequences of <italic>wtf</italic> genes vary considerably between <italic>S. pombe</italic> isolates, indicating rapid divergence. We propose that <italic>wtf</italic> genes contribute to the extensive intraspecific reproductive isolation in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, and represent ideal models for understanding how segregation-distorting elements act and evolve.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26057.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26057.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26057.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>During evolution, new species emerge when individuals from different populations of similar organisms no longer breed with each other, or when the offspring produced if they do breed are sterile. This process is known as “reproductive isolation” and, for over 100 years, evolutionary biologists have tried to better understand how this process happens.</p><p>Animals, plants and fungi produce sex cells – known as gametes – when they are preparing to reproduce. These cells are made when cells containing two copies of every gene in the organism divide to produce new cells that each only have one copy of each gene. Therefore, a particular gene copy usually has a 50% chance of being carried by an individual gamete. There are genes that selfishly increase their chances of being transmitted to the next generation by destroying the gametes that do not carry them. These “gamete killer” genes reduce the fertility of the organism and lead to reproductive isolation.</p><p>Fission yeast is a fungus that is widely used in research. There are different strains of fission yeast that are reproductively isolated from each other, but it is not known whether gamete killers are responsible for this isolation. To address this question, Hu et al. investigated the causes of reproductive isolation in fission yeast.</p><p>The experiments identified two gamete killers, referred to as <italic>cw9</italic> and <italic>cw27</italic>. Both genes belong to the <italic>wtf</italic> gene family. Each gene is believed to encode two different proteins, one that acts as a poison and one that acts as an antidote. The poison is capable of killing all gametes, but the antidote protects the cells that contain the gamete killer gene. Further experiments show that the antidote produced by one of the gamete killer genes cannot protect cells against the poison produced by the other gene.</p><p>A separate study by Nuckolls et al. found that another member of the <italic>wtf</italic> family also acts as a gamete killer in fission yeast. Together, these findings shed new light on the causes of reproductive isolation, and will contribute to deeper understanding of speciation and evolution in general.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26057.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26057.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>segregation distortion</kwd><kwd>meiotic drive</kwd><kwd>spore killer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Basic Research Program of China 2014CB849901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Li-Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two members of a large fission yeast (<italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>) gene family are shown to act as spore killers that enhance their own transmission into progenies by impeding the maturation of spores not inheriting them.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mendel’s law of equal segregation stipulates that paternal and maternal alleles of a gene should have an equal chance of being transmitted to progenies. This law guarantees a fair competition between different alleles and enables beneficial ones to prevail during natural selection. Meiotic drivers, a type of selfish genetic element, break Mendel’s law by skewing transmission ratios to their advantage, and thus can spread in a population even when having a deleterious effect on organismal fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lindholm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Werren, 2011</xref>). The term ‘meiotic drive’ was initially coined to describe segregation distortion resulting from preferential inclusion in the gamate during asymmetric female meiosis but has now been used more broadly to include biased transmission caused by postmeiotic mechanisms. In fact, some of the best-known meiotic drivers, such as <italic>Segregation Distorter</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and the <italic>t</italic> haplotype in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lyon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Larracuente and Presgraves, 2012</xref>), act postmeiotically to disable male gametes (sperms) that do not inherit them. This type of meiotic driver, called gamete killer, exists in animals, plants, and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burt and Trivers, 2006</xref>). Fungal gamete killers, or spore killers, have been found in several filamentous ascomycetes, most notably <italic>Neurospora</italic> and <italic>Podospora anserina</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalstra et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hammond et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Turner and Perkins, 1979</xref>). It is unclear how widespread spore killers are among fungal species.</p><p>The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> is a prominent model organism for molecular and cell biology and has been increasingly used to study natural variation and genome evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeffares et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rhind et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>S. pombe</italic> natural isolates, which are nearly all haploids and have pair-wise nucleotide differences of less than 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeffares et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rhind et al., 2011</xref>), can readily mate with each other to form hybrid diploids, but the viability of spores derived from inter-isolate crosses is often below 5% and in many instances under 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gutz and Doe, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kondrat’'eva and Naumov, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Naumov et al., 2015</xref>). This is in stark contrast to <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, whose natural isolates have a similar level of nucleotide diversity but much better spore viability when inter-crossed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hou et al., 2014</xref>). One explanation for the within-species hybrid sterility in <italic>S. pombe</italic> is chromosomal rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avelar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>). However, because one rearrangement reduces spore viability at most by half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avelar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hou et al., 2014</xref>), other factors are likely in play. It was shown recently that when the <italic>S. pombe</italic> laboratory strain, which was isolated from French grape juice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Osterwalder, 1924</xref>), was crossed to a strain isolated from fermented tea (initially called <italic>Schizosaccharomyces kambucha</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Singh and Klar, 2003</xref>], later renamed <italic>S. pombe var. kambucha</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rhind et al., 2011</xref>]), at least three spore killers contributed to hybrid sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bomblies, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>), but the identities of the killer genes were unknown.</p><p>In this study, through investigating the causes of intraspecific hybrid sterility of fission yeast, we uncovered the molecular identities of two active spore killers, which both belong to the <italic>wtf</italic> gene family. We analyzed their killing behaviors in both native and non-native genomic contexts. Furthermore, we performed comparative genomic analysis of <italic>wtf</italic> genes and revealed interesting patterns of divergence among them.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We have previously studied CBS5557, an <italic>S. pombe</italic> strain isolated from grapes in Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rankine and Fornachon, 1964</xref>). Like most <italic>S. pombe</italic> isolates, CBS5557 differs from the laboratory strain, whose genome is the <italic>S. pombe</italic> reference genome, in a 2.23 Mb pericentric inversion on chromosome I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2011</xref>). After introducing the same inversion into the laboratory strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2015</xref>), the viability of spores derived from the cross between the laboratory strain and CBS5557 increased from 14% to 22% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To uncover the causes of the remaining sterility, we performed next-generation sequencing (NGS)-assisted bulk segregant analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2015</xref>) and found that among the viable progenies from the cross, SNP alleles of the laboratory strain (reference alleles) on chromosome III were markedly under-represented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Two broad transmission distortion peaks, one on the left arm (hereafter referred to as the left peak) and one on the right arm (hereafter referred to as the right peak), were observed, suggesting that there are at least two spore killer genes on chromosome III of CBS5557.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26057.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The identification of <italic>cw9</italic> and <italic>cw27</italic> genes as spore killers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) NGS-assisted bulk segregant analysis of viable progenies from a cross between DY9974, a heterothallic derivative of CBS5557, and DY8531, a laboratory strain harboring the 2.23 Mb chromosome I inversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2015</xref>).

We selected two backcrossed strains that retained the ability to skew inheritance of markers inserted in the left and right peak regions, respectively. These two strains, referred to as backcrossed-1 and backcrossed-2, respectively, were crossed to the laboratory strain and viable progenies were subjected to NGS-assisted bulk segregant analysis, which revealed the locations of the CBS5557 genomic segments present in the two backcrossed strains and confirmed the allele transmission bias (left-side plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).</p><p>Through inspecting the Illumina and PacBio sequencing data of the CBS5557 genome, we discovered that, within the CBS5557 genomic segments in the two backcrossed strains, sequences most divergent from the reference genome are those containing <italic>wtf</italic> family genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). <italic>wtf</italic> (for <underline>w</underline>ith <underline>Tf</underline> LTRs) genes were so named because they are often in close proximity to solo long terminal repeats (LTRs) derived from Tf retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wood et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>wtf</italic> genes are predicted to contain multiple introns and encode multi-transmembrane proteins and have been shown to be highly up-regulated transcriptionally during meiosis and sporulation by large-scale analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowen et al., 2003</xref>). No homologs of <italic>wtf</italic> genes have been found in any other species, including other <italic>Schizosaccharomyces</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rhind et al., 2011</xref>). We deleted from the backcrossed-1 strain a <italic>wtf</italic> gene locating at the position of <italic>wtf9</italic> in the reference genome but exhibiting a low sequence identity (42%) to <italic>wtf9</italic> in the 5’ portion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and found that the deletion notably reduced the segregation distortion (right-side plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that this <italic>wtf</italic> gene, which we named <italic>cw9</italic> (the nomenclature of <italic>wtf</italic> genes in the CBS5557 genome will be explained later in this paper), is a spore killer. The residual allele frequency bias is probably due to additional spore killer gene(s) in the CBS5557 genomic segments present in the backcrossed-1 strain. Within the CBS5557 genomic segment in the backcrossed-2 strain, we found a <italic>wtf</italic> gene absent in the reference genome, possibly owing to a deletion event mediated by homologous recombination between LTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Removing this <italic>wtf</italic> gene, which we named <italic>cw27</italic>, from the backcrossed-2 strain completely abolished segregation distortion (right-side plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>To determine how <italic>cw9</italic> and <italic>cw27</italic> behave in their native strain background, we generated <italic>h<sup>+</sup></italic>/<italic>h<sup>-</sup></italic> CBS5557 diploid strains containing homozygous or heterozygous deletion of <italic>cw9</italic> or <italic>cw27</italic>, and performed tetrad analysis to evaluate spore viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

At this time point, organelles inside spores were clearly visible. 18 hr after the shift, the cytoplasm of spores derived from the control cells became electron-dense and organelles were no longer discernable, owing to a little-understood spore maturation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yoo et al., 1973</xref>). Interestingly, at the same time point, asci derived from the <italic>cw27</italic>-containing cells often exhibited a 2:2 pattern of spore morphology: two spores in an ascus looked like the matured spores in the control sample, whereas the other two spores exhibited cytoplasm with a lower electron density and visible organelles, an electron-lucent spore wall, and frequently a non-spherical shape. These data suggest that killer-affected spores fail to undergo a proper maturation process.</p><p><italic>cw9</italic> and <italic>cw27</italic> are both flanked by solo LTRs, and upstream of their predicted start codons they share a nearly identical 288-bp-long sequence (hereafter referred to as the conserved_up sequence) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is also conserved upstream of the coding sequences of many other <italic>wtf</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowen et al., 2003</xref>). To determine whether these and other sequence features are important for spore killing, we performed truncation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The truncated versions were named Ta, Tb, Tc, Td, and Te. Their effects on spore viability in a heterozygous cross of laboratory strains were examined. The Ta versions, which lack the LTRs, caused spore killing phenotypes similar to those caused by longer constructs containing the flanking LTRs, indicating that the LTRs are not important. Interestingly, the Tb versions missing the sequence between the upstream LTR and the conserved_up sequence caused spores containing the killer to suffer a moderate viability loss, suggesting that these truncated killer genes partially lost the ability to protect killer-containing spores from being harmed. Removing from the Ta versions, the sequence downstream of the predicted stop codon (Tc versions) did not have a notable effect. Removing from the Tc versions, the last 10 amino-acid-coding codons (Td versions) greatly diminished spore killing, whereas removing from the Tc versions the sequences upstream of the start codons (Te versions) resulted in more indiscriminate killing than that caused by the Tb versions. These results suggest that intact C termini are important for the killing activity, and the upstream sequences are important for the protecting activity.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26057.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Sequence requirement for the killing and the protecting activities of <italic>cw9</italic> and <italic>cw27</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Truncation analysis to assess the involvement of the 5’ and 3’ sequences of <italic>cw9</italic> and <italic>cw27</italic> in spore killing.

Given that the genome-wide nucleotide difference between CBS5557 and the laboratory strain is only 3.1 SNPs/kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>wtf</italic> genes must have diverged at a much faster pace than average genes.</p><p>To examine the phylogenetic relationship among all 57 <italic>wtf</italic> genes of the two genomes, we performed a maximum likelihood analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In the resulting phylogenetic tree, we used colored rectangles to highlight 16 pairs of genes, with each pair consisting of phylogenetic neighbors, defined as two genes separated by a single internal node that has an ultrafast bootstrap support value &gt;= 95% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, only 11 of these 16 pairs conform to typical orthologous relationship where two members of a pair are syntenic (highlighted by green rectangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), whereas the five other pairs each consist of two genes that are non-syntenic (highlighted by yellow rectangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This pattern suggests that ectopic gene conversion (also called non-allelic or interlocus gene conversion) may contribute to the inter-isolate difference of <italic>wtf</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Petes and Hill, 1988</xref>). Interestingly, genes belonging to the same gene cluster (pair or triplet), despite being subject more strongly to the homogenizing effect of gene conversion due to their physical proximity, are without exception very distinct from each other. One possible explanation is that diversifying selection may have prevented sequence homogenization within gene clusters.</p><p>The substantial difference in the numbers and sequences of <italic>wtf</italic> gene between the laboratory strain and CBS5557 suggests that rapid sequence divergence and independent loss/gain of <italic>wtf</italic> genes have resulted in different <italic>S. pombe</italic> natural isolates harboring distinct sets of active spore killers, which become reproductive barriers during inter-isolate crosses and contribute to the extensive and severe hybrid sterility within this species.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Only a small number of gamete killers have been characterized at the molecular level. Two well-studied gamete killers in animals, <italic>Segregation Distorter</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and the <italic>t</italic> haplotype in mouse, both contain at least two key loci, a killer locus and a target locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lyon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burt and Trivers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Larracuente and Presgraves, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lindholm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauer et al., 2012</xref>). In fungi, spore killers of <italic>Neurospora</italic> also appear to comprise of two genes, <italic>rsk</italic> (<italic>resistant to Spore killer</italic>) and a yet-to-be-identified killer gene, which are proposed to act together in a fashion similar to the toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems of bacterial plasmids, in which a stable toxin and a labile antitoxin together ensure that bacterial cells cannot lose the plasmid expressing them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hammond et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McLaughlin and Malik, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saupe, 2012</xref>). The involvement of more than one gene renders these gamete killer systems vulnerable to recombination that may separate the component genes, and as a consequence, they have all evolved recombination-suppressing features such as chromosomal inversions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burt and Trivers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harvey et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, two types of single-gene spore killers, [Het-s] prion and the <italic>Spok</italic> genes, have been found in the filamentous fungus <italic>Podospora anserina</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalstra et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>). The killing activity of the [Het-s] prion requires the presence of the HET-S protein, whereas the <italic>Spok</italic> genes can act autonomously. Fission yeast <italic>wtf</italic> killers share two prominent features with the <italic>Spok</italic> killers: being composed of a single predicted coding sequence and acting in a self-sufficient manner. These features arguably make <italic>wtf</italic> and <italic>spok</italic> killers the most compact and efficient forms of gamete killers.</p><p>Despite the similarities they share, <italic>wtf</italic> and <italic>spok</italic> killers are very different entities. Firstly, <italic>wtf</italic> genes only exist in a single fission yeast species <italic>S. pombe</italic>, indicating that they probably have arisen after the divergence of <italic>S. pombe</italic> from its closest relatives <italic>S. octosporus</italic> and <italic>S. cryophilus</italic> around 120 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rhind et al., 2011</xref>), and have not jumped across the species barriers. In contrast, <italic>Spok</italic> family genes have a patchy but widespread distribution among Pezizomycotina species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>), whose last common ancestor dates to 400 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prieto and Wedin, 2013</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Spok</italic> killers have originated much earlier than <italic>wtf</italic> killers or have been especially prone to transfer horizontally across species. Secondly, <italic>spok</italic> family genes encode soluble proteins with a C-terminal kinase-like domain (InterPro:IPR011009), whereas <italic>wtf</italic> genes are predicted to encode multi-transmembrane proteins, suggesting that the detailed molecular mechanisms of these two types of killers are likely to be quite distinct.</p><p>The single-gene nature of <italic>wtf</italic> killers begs the question: how does a single gene encode both the killing and the protecting activities? Our findings on the mutations that can disrupt one but not the other activity suggest the possibility that more than one type of expression products can be generated from a <italic>wtf</italic> killer gene. Consistent with this idea, Nuckolls et al. showed that the <italic>wtf4</italic> gene from the <italic>S. pombe var. kambucha</italic> strain (<italic>Sk wtf4</italic>) acts as a spore killer by expressing two overlapping transcripts, with the shorter transcript encoding a spore-killing poison and the longer transcript encoding an antidote that protects the spores from the killing effect of the poison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nuckolls et al., 2017</xref>). This dual-transcript model can satisfactorily explain why the Tb and Te forms of <italic>cw9</italic> and <italic>cw27</italic> lost protecting activities but not killing activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Presumably, the transcription of the longer isoforms, which encode antidote proteins initiated from a start codon in the predicted exon 1, partially relies on the sequence between the upstream LTR and the conserved_up sequence and absolutely requires the conserved_up sequence; in contrast, the transcription of the shorter isoforms, which encode poison proteins initiated from a downstream alternative start codon, is not affected by removing the upstream sequences.</p><p>We hypothesized that the transcription of the poison isoforms may depend on a special promoter residing within the predicted intron 1 of <italic>cw9</italic> and <italic>cw27</italic>. Indeed, through inspecting the DNA sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>), we found that <italic>cw9</italic>, <italic>cw27</italic>, and 10 other <italic>wtf</italic> genes in the reference genome and the CBS5557 genome share a 150 bp conserved sequence in the predicted intron 1, and this sequence is closely upstream of the transcription start site of a shorter-than-predicted <italic>wtf23</italic> transcript isoform uncovered by the Iso-Seq long-read RNA sequencing method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuang et al., 2017</xref>). These 12 genes can be classified into two subtypes, which we call Intron-1-ATG genes (<italic>wtf4</italic>, <italic>wtf13</italic>, <italic>cw4</italic>, <italic>cw18</italic>, and <italic>cw23</italic>) and Exon-2-ATG genes (<italic>wtf19</italic>, <italic>wtf23</italic>, <italic>cw8a</italic>, <italic>cw9</italic>, <italic>cw21</italic>, <italic>cw22</italic>, and <italic>cw27</italic>), based on the locations of the first ATG codons downstream of the 150 bp sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). These ATG codons are all in frame with the predicted coding sequences. The within-intron-1 ATG codons in the 5 Intron-1-ATG genes are only 7 bp away from the predicted exon 2, and if used as start codons, would result in proteins beginning with three intron-1-coded amino acids (Met, Leu, and Ser). The two active spore killer genes found in the <italic>S. pombe var. kambucha</italic> strain by Nuckolls et al., <italic>Sk wtf4</italic> and <italic>Sk wtf28</italic>, also possess this 150 bp sequence and can be classified as an Intron-1-ATG gene and an Exon-2-ATG gene, respectively. We propose that this 150 bp sequence is a hallmark of the ‘poison-and-antidote’ genes that can, at least potentially, generate both poison and antidote isoforms according to the dual-transcript model proposed by Nuckolls et al.</p><p>The other 45 <italic>wtf</italic> genes in the reference genome and the CBS5557 genome lack this 150 bp sequence. In addition, except for the eight most divergent genes (<italic>wtf7</italic>, <italic>cw7</italic>, <italic>wtf11</italic>, <italic>cw11</italic>, <italic>wtf14</italic>, <italic>cw14</italic>, <italic>wtf15</italic>, and <italic>cw15</italic>), they do not have an in-frame ATG codon in intron one or in the 5’-section of exon 2, suggesting that most of these genes are not able to generate a shorter isoform according to the dual-transcript model, and are thus ‘antidote-only’ genes. Alternatively, it is possible that they may generate two different protein products using other mechanisms, such as alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuang et al., 2017</xref>), overlapping proteins translated in different frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duncan and Mata, 2014</xref>), and post-translational processing and modification.</p><p>Five <italic>wtf</italic> genes in the reference genome, <italic>wtf1</italic>, <italic>wtf2</italic>, <italic>wtf3</italic>, <italic>wtf22</italic>, and <italic>wtf24</italic>, are annotated by PomBase as pseudogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McDowall et al., 2015</xref>). Our analysis of the gene structures of the 57 <italic>wtf</italic> genes in the reference genome and the CBS5557 genome showed that in addition to these five genes, four other <italic>wtf</italic> genes in the reference genome (<italic>wtf6</italic>, <italic>wtf8</italic>, <italic>wtf12</italic>, and <italic>wtf17</italic>), and three <italic>wtf</italic> genes in the CBS5557 genome (<italic>cw3</italic>, <italic>cw12</italic>, and <italic>cw16</italic>), appear to have suffered pseudogenizing mutations (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>), which include loss of start codons (<italic>wtf3</italic> and <italic>cw3</italic>), premature stop codons (<italic>wtf1</italic>, <italic>wtf12</italic>, <italic>cw12</italic>, and <italic>cw16</italic>), frameshifting indels (<italic>wtf6</italic>, <italic>wtf8</italic>, <italic>wtf22</italic>, and <italic>wtf24</italic>), and segmental deletions (<italic>wtf2</italic> and <italic>wtf17</italic>). These ‘dead’ <italic>wtf</italic> genes presumably are not able to generate either antidote or poison proteins.</p><p>Most of the <italic>wtf</italic> genes in the reference genome and the CBS5557 genome are predicted to contain either 5 or 6 exons. Interestingly, the 6-exon genes, including <italic>cw9</italic>, <italic>cw27</italic>, and all but one of the other ten 150-bp-sequence-containing genes, clustered together in the DNA sequence-based phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), and their protein products are predicted to be longer and contain two or three more transmembrane helices than the protein products of 5-exon genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). For each of the 12 150-bp-sequence-containing genes, the antidote protein product is approximately 50 amino acids longer than the poison protein product at the N-terminal soluble region. The 10 C-terminal amino acids missing from the protein products of the Td forms of <italic>cw9</italic> and <italic>cw27</italic> are downstream of the last transmembrane helix, and are strongly conserved among the predicted protein products of 6-exon genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating that Td-like mutations do not occur naturally to a significant extent.</p><p>How do transmenbrane proteins act as killers? In the prokaryotic toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, many toxins are transmembrane proteins and kill cells by damaging cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schuster and Bertram, 2013</xref>). The best-known examples include the type I TA toxins Hok and TisB, and the type V TA toxin GhoT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerdes et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Unoson and Wagner, 2008</xref>). We speculate that Wtf proteins may also possess abilities to disrupt the integrity of certain cellular membranes.</p><p><italic>wtf</italic> genes were named after their association with the solo LTRs of the Tf retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wood et al., 2002</xref>). It was initially hypothesized that retrotransposition may aid the expansion of the <italic>wtf</italic> gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wood et al., 2002</xref>). However, the presence of introns in <italic>wtf</italic> genes and the lack of sequence similarity between <italic>wtf</italic>-flanking LTRs indicate that <italic>wtf</italic> genes have not been retrotransposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowen et al., 2003</xref>). Bowen et al. have put forward an explanation for the enrichment of LTRs near <italic>wtf</italic> genes: the regions flanking <italic>wtf</italic> genes may have been favored insertion targets of Tf retrotransposons, perhaps owing to the high transcription levels of <italic>wtf</italic> genes during meiosis and sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowen et al., 2003</xref>). Our findings that LTRs flanking <italic>cw9</italic> and <italic>cw27</italic> are dispensable for spore killing support the idea that the <italic>wtf</italic>-LTR association does not benefit <italic>wtf</italic> genes but may rather reflect an exploitation of <italic>wtf</italic> genes by Tf retrotransposons for their own expression and/or inheritance benefit. Furthermore, we show that three singleton <italic>wtf</italic> genes (<italic>cw26</italic>, <italic>cw27</italic>, and <italic>cw28</italic>) appear to have been lost in the laboratory strain due to LTR-mediated recombination, suggesting that the <italic>wtf</italic>-LTR association promotes <italic>wtf</italic> gene loss and is detrimental to the long-term persistence of <italic>wtf</italic> genes. In addition, it may not be coincidental that both <italic>cw9</italic> and <italic>cw27</italic> require an approximately 90-bp-long sequence between the upstream LTR and the conserved_up sequence for the full protecting activity, raising the possibility that some <italic>wtf</italic> genes that lack such an intervening sequence (e.g. <italic>wtf4</italic> and <italic>cw4</italic>) may have suffered functional loss due to a Tf insertion too close to the conserved_up sequence or may have become functionally dependent on the upstream LTR.</p><p>In terms of the number of genes per genome, <italic>wtf</italic> genes are probably the most evolutionarily successful gamete killers known to date. During a relatively short evolutionary time span, <italic>wtf</italic> gene family has emerged and become the largest species-specific gene family in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lespinet et al., 2002</xref>). The compactness (minimal sizes of fully functional <italic>cw9</italic> and <italic>cw27</italic> are both around 1.9 kb) and the self-sufficiency of the <italic>wtf</italic> killers likely have been advantageous to its family size expansion. Furthermore, given the dramatic divergence of <italic>wtf</italic> genes between the reference genome and the CBS5557 genome, and the mutual-killing behaviors of <italic>cw9</italic> and <italic>cw27</italic>, it is possible that two identical copies of a <italic>wtf</italic> gene generated by a gene duplication event can undergo relatively rapid sequence diversification to become mutually non-resistant, so that their selective advantage is not diminished by resistance. Ectopic gene conversion is known to play a causal role in the sequence diversification of animal major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohta, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takuno et al., 2008</xref>), plant disease-resistance genes (R genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mondragon-Palomino and Gaut, 2005</xref>), and <italic>Plasmodium falciparum var</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claessens et al., 2014</xref>). Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that ectopic gene conversion may also contribute to the historical expansion and the ongoing dynamic change of the <italic>wtf</italic> gene family.</p><p>It is intriguing that most of the <italic>wtf</italic> genes locate on chromosome III, the smallest of the three fission yeast chromosomes. To explain this phenomenon, Bowen et al. proposed that the laboratory strain may have inherited only chromosome III but not the other two chromosomes from an ancestor strain in which <italic>wtf</italic> genes were abundant on all three chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowen et al., 2003</xref>). Our finding here of the same kind of chromosomal distribution bias in CBS5557, whose nucleotide diversity from the laboratory strain is higher on chromosome III than on the other two chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2015</xref>), makes this explanation less likely. The only type of viable aneuploidy in fission yeast is chromosome III disomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Niwa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Niwa and Yanagida, 1985</xref>), which occurs at a frequency of &gt;1% during normal meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Molnar et al., 1995</xref>). We speculate that the tolerance of chromosome III disomy may in some way be advantageous to the expansion of the <italic>wtf</italic> gene family on this chromosome.</p><p>Spore killers and other meiotic drivers, despite having only been found in a small number of taxa, are believed to exist in a wide range of species, where they are an important force influencing genome organization, gametogenesis, and speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burt and Trivers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lindholm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Werren, 2011</xref>).

Through crossing the two resultant strains with each other, we obtained a strain whose chromosome I and II are from the laboratory strain and whose chromosome III is from CBS5557. This strain was then crossed to a <italic>rec12<sup>+</sup></italic> laboratory-background strain carrying an antibiotic resistance marker at a locus on the left arm of chromosome III (<italic>mug123:hphMX</italic>) and another antibiotic resistance marker at a locus on the right arm of chromosome III (<italic>rps2802:natMX</italic>) (first backcross). Progeny strains with only one of the loci marked were kept. They were then crossed to laboratory-background strains with the other locus marked by <italic>kanMX</italic> (second backcross). By scoring the marker segregation ratios of the second backcross, we selected those first-backcross progenies that conferred strong segregation distortion at the <italic>kanMX</italic>-marked locus.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Nick Rhind (Reviewer #2); Michael Lichten (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Hu et al. have identified, in the genome of <italic>S. pombe</italic> strain CBS5557 two members of the <italic>wtf</italic> repeated gene family that serve as meiotic drive elements when crossed to the reference strain. Using deletions of the two loci, they show that the protective function can be separated from the killing function, and show that the C-terminus of the putative open-reading frame is important for killing but not for protection. In addition, they show that the two genes actually kill their sister spores, using both viability and EM-based assays. They then analyze the ensemble of <italic>wtf/cw</italic> loci in CBS5557 and show that these elements appear to frequently &quot;move&quot; by ectopic gene conversion. Combined with Nuckolls et al., this paper makes an intriguing and interesting story.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The switch in nomenclature, from <italic>k1wtf</italic> and <italic>k2wtf</italic> to <italic>cw9</italic> and <italic>cw27</italic>, is needlessly confusing. Why not simply call these loci <italic>cw9</italic> and <italic>cw27</italic> from the start, and just say that the reasons for doing so will be presented below? Along similar lines, the <italic>wtf</italic> nomenclature depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> seems unnecessarily complicated. In situations in which similarity and synteny make homology unambiguous, ambiguous nomenclature is not useful. For instance, <italic>cw[3-4]a</italic> and <italic>cw[3-4]b</italic> should be named <italic>cw3</italic> and <italic>cw4</italic>, respectively, likewise the homologs of <italic>wtf11, 12, 14, 15, 17</italic> and <italic>18</italic> are unambiguous.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B/C</xref> is confusing, especially since it hides the fact that there actually are no SNPs segregating in the regions where the red line is at 1. Why not simply display the rolling median for regions where there actually are SNPs? The first and last 40 SNPs will not be displayed, but there appear to be so many that this will not materially affect the presentation. The terms &quot;left-peak&quot; and &quot;right-peak&quot; strain are also confusing; we suggest adding a panel that shows a chr 3 map for the two strains with the reference and CBS5557-introgressed sequences in different colors, and including that color code on the X-axis of the plots in panel B.</p><p>3) It's not clear why <italic>k1wft</italic>∆ does not restore reference allele recovery to 50% in the left-peak strain x laboratory strain cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Is it possible that <italic>cw[11-12]c</italic> also has drive activity?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel C would be considerably more useful if it contained a horizontal scale, to roughly indicate the extent of divergence between different alleles. Criteria for considering two alleles to be paired should also be indicated; for example, it's not clear why <italic>cw8a</italic> and <italic>cw24</italic> are considered to be a homeologous pair, but <italic>wtf24</italic> and <italic>cw6b</italic> are not. Furthermore, the phylogeny should be shown as an unrooted tree – the authors reconstructed the phylogeny as unrooted and they should depict it that way too.</p><p>5) For readers interested in further numerical analysis, it would be useful if the actual numerical data underlying all of the bar graphs were included in a supplementary file. For example, we were wondering if the loss of spore viability in <italic>k1</italic>∆ <italic>k2</italic>∆ double mutant spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is greater than what one would expect on an additive basis of spore viability loss in the two single mutant spore types-it looks as if it is, but with the current presentation it's impossible to check.</p><p>6) It would be useful to use the translation start site-criterion outlined in Nuckolls et al. for whether the <italic>cw</italic> loci are &quot;dead&quot;, &quot;antidote-only&quot;, or &quot;antidote-toxin&quot;. Similarly, since the C-termini of <italic>cw9</italic> and <italic>cw27</italic> appear to be important for toxin activity, is this region more conserved among the wtf loci than other parts of the protein? In &quot;antidote-only&quot; or in &quot;antidote-toxin&quot; loci?</p><p>7) It is not clear why the variation of allele frequency depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is so large. If over 150 segregants were sequenced, how can some loci in regions that segregate 50:50 (e.g. on the left end of Chromosome I) be represented by only one allele?</p><p>8) The authors should extend the discussion of their findings and take into account the findings of Nuckolls et al. In particular:</p><p>What do the other <italic>wtf</italic> genes do? Could they be acting as rescuers but not as killers? Could they have assumed other unrelated functions?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows an unusual concentration of <italic>wtf</italic> genes in chr III. Why is that the case? (Could it have to do with the fact that it is the only chromosome where disomy is tolerated?)</p><p>On the second page of the Discussion, the authors speculate as to how one locus could produce both a toxin and an antidote. It should be possible to eliminate, or at least deprioritize, one or more of the proposed mechanisms by inspecting the sequence of the loci and perhaps publicly available RNA-seq data. It would be of great interest to have some speculation on how a putative trans-membrane protein could function in a toxin-antidote system.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26057.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The switch in nomenclature, from k1wtf and k2wtf to cw9 and cw27, is needlessly confusing.

Furthermore, the phylogeny should be shown as an unrooted tree – the authors reconstructed the phylogeny as unrooted and they should depict it that way too.</italic></p><p>During the revision, we have improved the de novo assembly of CBS5557 genome by adding a polishing step using the software Pilon. With polished sequences of the <italic>cw</italic> genes, we have generated a new phylogenetic tree, which has a topology similar to, but not exactly the same as, the tree in the original manuscript. This new tree is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> of the revised manuscript. We now include a scale bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, as suggested by the reviewers. In the Results section and in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we have now more precisely defined the criteria for highlighting a pair of genes, which we now term phylogenetic neighbors. Two genes are considered phylogenetic neighbors if they are separated on the phylogenetic tree by a single internal node with an IQ-tree-calculated ultrafast bootstrap support value &gt;= 95%. We agree with the reviewers that it is inappropriate to draw unrooted tree in a rooted format. We have now rooted the tree using midpoint rooting, which is a widely used method for rooting a phylogenetic tree when no suitable outgroup is available (see the reference Hess &amp; De Moraes Russo, 2007).</p><p><italic>5) For readers interested in further numerical analysis, it would be useful if the actual numerical data underlying all of the bar graphs were included in a supplementary file. For example, we were wondering if the loss of spore viability in k1∆ k2∆ double mutant spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is greater than what one would expect on an additive basis of spore viability loss in the two single mutant spore types-it looks as if it is, but with the current presentation it's impossible to check.</italic></p><p>Numerical data are now provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> of the revised manuscript. The double mutant spores indeed appeared to have suffered a greater loss of viability than expected from a simple additive effect, but the exact reason is not clear at this moment.</p><p><italic>6) It would be useful to use the translation start site-criterion outlined in Nuckolls et al. for whether the cw loci are &quot;dead&quot;, &quot;antidote-only&quot;, or &quot;antidote-toxin&quot;. Similarly, since the C-termini of cw9 and cw27 appear to be important for toxin activity, is this region more conserved among the wtf loci than other parts of the protein? In &quot;antidote-only&quot; or in &quot;antidote-toxin&quot; loci?</italic></p><p>We have more carefully examined the sequences of the 57 <italic>wtf</italic> genes in the reference genome and the CBS5557 genome, and uncovered a within-intron-1 150-bp sequence shared by all currently known active <italic>wtf</italic> killers (<italic>cw9</italic> and <italic>cw27</italic> found in our study and <italic>Sk wtf4</italic> and <italic>Sk wtf28</italic> found by Nuckolls et al.). We added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) about this sequence. We propose that this sequence may serve as a promoter driving the transcription of the poison isoforms and the presence of this sequence is a useful criterion for identifying &quot;poison-and-antidote&quot; genes. In the Discussion section of the revised manuscript, we added three paragraphs to discuss &quot;poison-and-antidote&quot; genes that share this 150-bp sequence, &quot;antidote-only&quot; genes lacking this 150-bp sequence, and the &quot;dead&quot; genes that have suffered pseudogenizing mutations, respectively.</p><p>Based on the predicted gene structures of the <italic>wtf</italic> genes, most of them have either 5 or 6 exons. All currently known active <italic>wtf</italic> killers are 6-exon genes. We have added two new figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>) depicting the sequence alignments of the protein products of the 6-exon genes and the 5-exon genes, respectively. From the alignment, it can be seen that the C-terminal sequences of Cw9 and Cw27 proteins are strongly conserved among the protein products of 6-exon genes, regardless of whether they are &quot;poison-and-antidote&quot; genes or &quot;antidote-only&quot; genes.</p><p><italic>7) It is not clear why the variation of allele frequency depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is so large. If over 150 segregants were sequenced, how can some loci in regions that segregate 50:50 (e.g. on the left end of Chromosome I) be represented by only one allele?</italic></p><p>For cost reasons, we usually limit the Illumina sequencing of the bulk segregant analysis (BSA) samples to an average read depth of between 10× and 20×. Therefore, the read depth at any SNP loci is much lower than the number of segregants, and as a consequence, the allele frequency data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are much noisier than expected from the number of segregants. We have now listed in the Materials and methods section the average read depths of the five BSA sequencing datasets.</p><p><italic>8) The authors should extend the discussion of their findings and take into account the findings of Nuckolls et al. In particular:</italic> </p><p><italic>What do the other wtf genes do? Could they be acting as rescuers but not as killers? Could they have assumed other unrelated functions?</italic></p><p>We have added several paragraphs in the Discussion section to describe the classification the 57 <italic>wtf</italic> genes in the reference genome and the CBS5557 genome into &quot;poison-and-antidote&quot; genes, &quot;antidote-only&quot; genes, and &quot;dead&quot; genes.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows an unusual concentration of wtf genes in chr III. Why is that the case? (Could it have to do with the fact that it is the only chromosome where disomy is tolerated?)</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that tolerance of chromosome III disomy may be a reason why <italic>wtf</italic> genes concentrate on chromosome III. We have added a paragraph in the Discussion section to discuss the possible reasons behind this intriguing phenomenon.</p><p><italic>On the second page of the Discussion, the authors speculate as to how one locus could produce both a toxin and an antidote. It should be possible to eliminate, or at least deprioritize, one or more of the proposed mechanisms by inspecting the sequence of the loci and perhaps publicly available RNA-seq data. It would be of great interest to have some speculation on how a putative trans-membrane protein could function in a toxin-antidote system.</italic></p><p>In the newly added paragraphs of the Discussion section, by more carefully inspecting the sequences, we have classified the 57 <italic>wtf</italic> genes in the reference genome and the CBS5557 genome into &quot;poison-and-antidote&quot; genes, which conform to the dual-transcript model of Nuckolls et al., &quot;antidote-only&quot; genes, and &quot;dead&quot; genes. We speculate that it remains possible that the &quot;antidote-only&quot; genes may be able to generate poison isoforms through mechanisms other than alternative transcription start sites. We have also added a paragraph in the Discussion section to speculate on how transmembrane proteins can act as spore killers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
