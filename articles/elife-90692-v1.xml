steering. Recently, we showed that arpin stabilizes the epithelial barrier in an Arp2/3-dependent manner. However, the expression and functions of arpin in endothelial cells (EC) have not yet been described. Arpin mRNA and protein are expressed in EC and downregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Arpin depletion in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells causes the formation of actomyosin stress fibers leading to increased permeability in an Arp2/3-independent manner. Instead, inhibitors of ROCK1 and ZIPK, kinases involved in the generation of stress fibers, normalize the loss-of-arpin effects on actin filaments and permeability. Arpin-deficient mice are viable but show a characteristic vascular phenotype in the lung including edema, microhemorrhage, and vascular congestion, increased F-actin levels, and vascular permeability. Our data show that, apart from being an Arp2/3 inhibitor, arpin is also a regulator of actomyosin contractility and endothelial barrier integrity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>actin cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>vascular permeability</kwd><kwd>tight junctions</kwd><kwd>Arp2/3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003141</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>284292</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schnoor</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Arpin regulates actomyosin contractility and endothelial barrier integrity by controlling the activity of the kinases ROCK1 and ZIPK, but not Arp2/3.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Arpin was discovered 11 years ago in fibroblasts as a protein that binds to and inhibits the heptameric actin nucleator actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dang et al., 2013</xref>). Arpin competed with WAVE2, a nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) that activates Arp2/3, at the lamellipodial tip of migrating fibroblasts to steer random migration by regulating migration speed and directional persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dang et al., 2013</xref>). However, later studies demonstrated that arpin did not regulate chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dang et al., 2017</xref>). Subsequently, arpin has been studied in different cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lomakina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2019a</xref>), where its downregulation correlated with poor prognosis of the disease and high migratory capability and invasiveness of the tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lomakina et al., 2016</xref>). We have shown that arpin was expressed in colon epithelial cells and that patients with ulcerative colitis had lower levels of arpin in acutely inflamed tissue areas. Arpin colocalized with junctional proteins and stabilized epithelial barrier integrity under basal and inflammatory conditions in an Arp2/3-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chánez-Paredes et al., 2021</xref>). However, nothing is known about arpin expression in endothelial cells (EC) and its functions in endothelial barrier regulation during inflammation.</p><p>The endothelium forms a semi-permeable barrier that separates the blood from tissues. During inflammation, the weakening of cell-cell adhesive structures including adherens junctions (AJ) and tight junctions (TJ) is important for allowing the passage of plasma proteins and immune cells to the inflamed tissue and inflammation resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reglero-Real et al., 2016</xref>). The correct regulation of AJ and TJ stability and thus vascular permeability is controlled by dynamic actin cytoskeletal remodeling including the formation of stabilizing cortical actin filaments and destabilizing contractile stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Prasain and Stevens, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">García-Ponce et al., 2015</xref>). As an important actin cytoskeletal regulator, the Arp2/3 complex regulates the maintenance and recovery of the pulmonary endothelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belvitch et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, Arp2/3 is also involved in the endocytosis of occludin at the blood-brain barrier during inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, Arp2/3 and its activator WAVE2 stabilize endothelial barrier functions by promoting the formation of junction-associated intermittent lamellipodia (JAIL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu Taha et al., 2014</xref>). These studies are only a few examples highlighting the importance of the Arp2/3 complex for controlling vascular permeability. While Arp2/3 activators such as WAVE2 have been studied in this context, the role of Arp2/3 inhibitors in endothelial barrier regulation remains elusive. Therefore, we hypothesized that arpin is expressed in endothelial cells and that it contributes to the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics at junctions to fine-tune the regulation of endothelial permeability under basal and inflammatory conditions. To test this hypothesis, we generated arpin-depleted Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) and arpin-deficient mice to analyze the role of arpin in endothelial barrier regulation in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Arpin is expressed in endothelial cells</title><p>Arpin was discovered in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dang et al., 2013</xref>), and it was subsequently described to be expressed in other cells including colon epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chánez-Paredes et al., 2021</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether arpin is expressed in endothelial cells.

First, arpin is expressed in endothelium in vitro and in vivo and downregulated during inflammation. Second, arpin is required for proper endothelial permeability regulation and junction architecture. Third, and most surprisingly, arpin exerts these functions in an Arp2/3-independent manner; instead, it rather controls actomyosin contractility in a ROCK1/ZIPK-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Finally, we present the first total arpin knock-out mice that are viable and breed and develop normally but show histological characteristics of a vascular phenotype in the lung and increased permeability similar to what we observed in arpin-depleted HUVEC.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Current working model for arpin functions in endothelial cells.</title><p>Under basal conditions, arpin is located throughout the cell and enriched at cellular junctions. During inflammation, arpin is downregulated causing the formation of actomyosin actin stress fibers, junction disruption and increased permeability.

Such ubiquitous but diffuse subcellular location in (endothelial) cells is not surprising for an actin-regulating protein as it has been also described for other actin cytoskeleton regulators such as WAVE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mooren et al., 2014</xref>) and the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu Taha et al., 2014</xref>). The enrichment at junctions, however, suggested that arpin plays a role in the regulation of endothelial barrier integrity. In fibroblasts, arpin was enriched at the lamellipodial tip and accordingly regulated migration speed and directionality, one of the main functions thus far described for arpin. It will be important to reveal in future studies whether arpin also regulates endothelial cell movement for example during angiogenesis.</p><p>Of note, arpin is downregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines suggesting that the removal of arpin is required for the changes in EC occurring during inflammation including actin cytoskeleton remodeling and junction weakening that allow for inflammation-related vascular events such as plasma protein leakage and leukocyte recruitment essential for combating the cause of inflammation and inflammation resolution. This finding is in line with our previous report showing downregulation during epithelial inflammation. Particularly, we demonstrated that arpin is not only reduced in colon epithelial cells after treatment with pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also in a DSS-induced colitis mouse model and in patients with ulcerative colitis, where loss of arpin was particularly evident in acutely inflamed tissue regions. Importantly, loss of arpin significantly correlated with epithelial barrier disruption in all models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chánez-Paredes et al., 2021</xref>) indicating that loss of arpin in the context of epithelium is related to pathogenic events. This is in contrast to our new findings in endothelium where barrier weakening is required for proper inflammation resolution. However, the recovery of arpin expression during inflammation resolution and the role of arpin in vascular diseases remain to be investigated. Besides, in macrophages infected with human rhinovirus, arpin was also reduced leading to impaired phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jubrail et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, arpin downregulation seems to be relevant in different cell types to regulate different cellular functions. Our qRT-PCR results suggest that arpin reduction occurs at the transcriptional level. However, more research is needed to characterize the promoter region of arpin and regulatory mechanisms controlling arpin mRNA levels. Given the strong downregulation induced by cytokines such as TNFα, it is tempting to speculate that arpin mRNA levels are controlled by inflammatory pathways that are well known to be induced by TNFα such as NF-κB.</p><p>The Arp2/3 complex is critical for endothelial barrier formation, maintenance, and recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu Taha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belvitch et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it was logical to assume that an Arp2/3 inhibitory protein such as arpin would be important for endothelial barrier integrity regulation. This idea was further supported by our study showing that arpin is involved in epithelial barrier regulation in an Arp2/3-dependent manner. Surprisingly, our results in EC suggest that arpin functions independently of the Arp2/3 complex. Instead, we described here that arpin is involved in the formation of actomyosin stress fibers in a ROCK/ZIPK-dependent fashion. It is well known that in EC ROCK1 and ZIPK are activated downstream of several pro-inflammatory mediators including TNFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mong and Wang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zeng et al., 2021</xref>), which leads to the phosphorylation of MLC and MYPT1 that together drive stress fiber formation, actomyosin contractility, reduction of the barrier-stabilizing cortical actin ring and barrier dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Millán et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angulo-Urarte et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, our findings in arpin-depleted HUVEC of increased actomyosin stress fibers may well explain the observed increased permeability. ZIPK is not just activated but also overexpressed by TNFα in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zeng et al., 2021</xref>), its depletion and inhibition reduces thrombin-induced MLC phosphorylation and actomyosin contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2019b</xref>), which is in line with our observation in arpin-depleted HUVEC. Together, these data indicate a mechanistic link between arpin and ZIPK for EC barrier regulation during inflammation, but more research is required to unravel in detail the exact nature of this link. On the other hand, the spatiotemporal interplay between non-muscle-myosin II-dependent contractility and Arp2/3 complex activity regulates the formation of dactylopodia, a lamellipodia-related membrane protrusion of invasive EC implicated in sprouting angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Figueiredo et al., 2021</xref>). How such interplay may contribute to inflammatory EC barrier regulation and whether arpin connects the two different actin dynamics mechanisms are questions to be answered by future research.</p><p>Loss of the actin-binding protein (ABP) cortactin, which has also been implicated in the regulation of Arp2/3-induced actin branches, has also been shown to cause increased actomyosin contractility and as a consequence increased EC hyperpermeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">García Ponce et al., 2016</xref>). It remains elusive why barrier functions in EC and epithelial cells are regulated by arpin via different mechanisms, but this question is the focus of ongoing studies.</p><p>Although originally not described as an ABP, we do not discard the possibility that arpin can directly regulate actin cytoskeleton remodeling because a recently published actin interactome revealed that actin can interact transiently with arpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Viita et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it will be important to unravel whether arpin interacts with G-actin, F-actin, or both; and how this direct interaction would contribute to the regulation of the actin dynamics, junction architecture, and barrier regulation in EC.</p><p>In this study, we also report for the first time a total arpin knockout C57BL/6 mouse generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic engineering. These mice developed and grew normally as C57BL/6 mice at least until week 12 when the arpin-deficient mice were used for experiments. Also, these mice did not show any phenotype identifiable by visual inspection. Thus, arpin is not essential for embryonic, fetal and early adult development similar to what has been described for other ABP knockout mice including those deficient for PICK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Steinberg et al., 2006</xref>), gadkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schachtner et al., 2015</xref>), cortactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schnoor et al., 2011</xref>), α-actinin3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">MacArthur et al., 2008</xref>) and coronin-1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Punwani et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, mice deficient for the Arp2/3 subunits ArpC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">van der Kammen et al., 2017</xref>) and ArpC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yae et al., 2006</xref>) and the NPF WAVE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dahl et al., 2003</xref>) and N-WASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Snapper et al., 2001</xref>) are not viable, thus further highlighting the difference between Arp2/3 inhibitors and ABP and the Arp2/3 complex and its activators. Importantly, our permeability and histological data revealed a clear vascular phenotype in the lung and, therefore, the importance of arpin in maintaining endothelial barrier integrity in the lung in vivo, a phenotype that is in line with our observations in arpin-depleted HUVEC. Such a strong vascular phenotype in the lung can be caused by several factors including an increase in the intravascular or interstitial hydrostatic pressure, endothelial injury or disruption of tissue barriers, or lymphatic insufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malek and Soufi, 2023</xref>). While this phenotype in the <italic>Arpin<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice is notorious, it apparently does not compromise the life of the mice at least into early adulthood. It will be critical to characterize older mice; and to investigate whether these mice are more susceptible to inflammatory or infectious diseases of the lung that are also characterized by the loss of tissue barrier functions. Moreover, future investigations need to analyze arpin functions in other organs such as the heart and brain in which arpin is highly expressed.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that arpin, besides being an Arp2/3 inhibitor is a fundamental component of the molecular machinery that controls actomyosin contractility and endothelial barrier integrity. We propose a model in which arpin is downregulated during inflammation to induce the formation of actomyosin stress fibers and vascular permeability. This study will hopefully pave the way for additional studies on the role of arpin in vascular diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Polyclonal antibodies against arpin were obtained by immunizing rabbits with purified full-length human arpin (described below).

reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p><p>Arpin is a negative regulator of Arp2/3 activity. Here the authors investigated the role of arpin in vascular permeability using appropriate cultured human and murine endothelial monolayers and successfully developed an arpin KO mice. The results clearly show arpin is expressed in blood vessels (not clear about lymphatics but given leaky vessels, one wonders). The data show that arpin is important for vessel barrier function yet its genetic loss still leads to viable animals in the C57Blk strain albeit with leaky blood vessels. The data are well presented and controls are included. However, the evidence that arpin loss/knockdown causes increased actin functions independent of Arp2/3 is based on pharmacological data and is indirect. Authors conclude ROCK1 activity is elevated and the cause of lost barrier function by arpin reduction. I do have one suggestion for the authors that involves a new study in these animals, which could strengthen their proposed mechanism that the vascular defects are independent of Arp2/3 activity and rather involve ROCK1 but not ZIPK.</p><p>(1) If arpin is working via ROCK1, as the authors infer, perhaps treatment of arpin-/- mice with ROCK1 inhibitor(s) would attenuate vessel permeability while HS38 treatment would not. This type of study would strengthen the conclusion that ROCK1, but not ZIPK, was involved. Including CK666 if active in mouse cells, could also be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>To analyze vascular permeability in vivo, we performed Miles assays in arpin+/+ and arpin-/- mice using the inhibitors of ROCK1 (Y27632) and ZIPK (HS38). Both Y27632 and HS38 reduced the permeability caused by absence of arpin (new Figure 8E), thus confirming what we observed before in HUVEC (shown in old Figure 7). CK666 did not change the permeability in arpin-/- mice, thus confirming the conclusion that arpin does not regulate vascular permeability via Arp2/3 but rather via ROCK1/ZIPK-mediated stress fiber formation (page 13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Fig 5. Data demonstrate that Arpin regulates actin filament formations and permeability in HUVEC, but this does not demonstrate its occurring in an Arp2/3-independent manner. If I understand your data this is indirect evidence. One needs more information to reach this conclusion. Can authors measure Arp2/3 directly and then test whether arpin knockdown and CK666 have the same capacity to reduce Arp2/3 activity in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>Arp2/3 activity cannot be measured directly. The commonly used approach is therefore Arp2/3 inhibition via CK666. Our new in vivo permeability assays (see answer above) together with our HUVEC data in Figure 5 clearly show that CK666 does not have the same effect as arpin knock-down, and neither does CK666 rescue the effects of arpin deficiency in vitro and in vivo. Together, these findings clearly suggest that arpin does not regulate endothelial permeability via Arp2/3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor issues:</p><p>Fig 2, 3 or other Figs: In presented western blots, all proteins should include appropriate mw labels.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. Molecular weights have been added to all Western blots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 2. Suggest that like your arpin analysis, amounts of AP1AP and PICK1 at baseline and TNF-treatment by blotting should be included. A minor point is yellow color for labels does not stand out and should be changed to another color - as the authors used in Fig 2C.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included Western blots and quantifications for PICK1 in Figure S1A and S1C. An antibody against AP1AP was unfortunately not available.</p><p>The yellow color has been changed to purple for better visibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 2C. The arpin loss at junctions and actin filaments (Figure 2C) is very minor even though it reached statistical significance. It really is not an obvious loss from your 3 color overlay.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. It is indeed hard to see. We included now magnifications in Figure 2C that better show the loss of arpin at junctions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 8, text 303-310 shows in vivo evidence of lung congestion and edema. Also appear to be inflammatory cells present in images. If these are inflammatory cells, it begs the question if these mice have an abnormal complete blood cell count (CBC). Suggest adding CBC data for arpin-/- vs control arpin +/+ mice in Fig 8.</p></disp-quote><p>The pathologist observed the presence of lymphocytes and macrophages, indicating the possibility of a (low level) chronic inflammation in arpin-deficient lungs. However, we now also performed hemograms of the mice (new Table S2) that showed no significant difference in the blood cell count of arpin-/- and arpin+/+ mice. Thus, the presence of lymphocytes and macrophages cannot be explained simply by higher leukocyte counts (page 14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 289, pg 13, Fig 8: Lung levels of arpin are not shown in Fig 8B. Authors must mean another fig?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry. Arpin protein levels in lungs are shown in figure 8C. This has been corrected on page 13.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>This is a solid piece of work that adds a small amount of additional factual information to our understanding of cell-cell junctions. The experimental work is of good quality and is sufficient to support the aims of the paper. I think the value of the work is to add this small amount of new knowledge to the archive. I do not believe that further experimental work would add to the paper - it's done. But this doesn't have the impact or completeness for this journal. It belongs in a for-the-record journal.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your overall positive evaluation and your comments that our study represents a solid piece of work with good quality experimental work. However, we are not sure what you mean by “it belongs in a for-the-record journal”. Anyway, we agree that our study does not reveal a complete mechanism of how arpin regulates actin stress fibers, but we respectfully disagree that our study only adds a “small amount of additional factual information”. We may not have been very clear about it, but we present in this study several new discoveries and although some are descriptive in nature that does not make them trivial or less important. We provide for the first time experimental evidence that: (1) arpin is expressed in endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo, and downregulated during inflammation; (2) presence of arpin is required for proper endothelial permeability regulation and junction architecture; (3) arpin exerts these functions in an Arp2/3-independent manner; (4) arpin controls actomyosin contractility in a ROCK1- and ZIPK-dependent fashion; (5) arpin knock-out mice are viable and breed and develop normally but show histological characteristics of a vascular phenotype and increased vascular permeability that can be rescued by inhibition of ROCK1 and ZIPK. The fact that arpin fulfills its functions in endothelial cells independently of the Arp2/3 complex is of special relevance as previously the only known function of arpin was the inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex. Thus, we believe that our study adds a significant amount of new information to the literature. Thank you very much.</p></body></sub-article></article>
