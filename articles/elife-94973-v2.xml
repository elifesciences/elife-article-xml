The association of PPIs with influenza is unexplored, while that with pneumonia or COVID-19 remains controversial. Our study aims to evaluate whether PPI use increases the risks of these respiratory infections.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>The current study included 160,923 eligible participants at baseline who completed questionnaires on medication use, which included PPI or histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA), from the UK Biobank. Cox proportional hazards regression and propensity score-matching analyses were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Comparisons with H2RA users were tested. PPI use was associated with increased risks of developing influenza (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.12–1.56) and pneumonia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26–1.59). In contrast, the risk of COVID-19 infection was not significant with regular PPI use (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.99–1.17), while the risks of severe COVID-19 (HR 1.19. 95% CI 1.11–1.27) and mortality (HR 1.37. 95% CI 1.29–1.46) were increased. However, when compared with H2RA users, PPI users were associated with a higher risk of influenza (HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.19–2.54), but the risks with pneumonia or COVID-19-related outcomes were not evident.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>PPI users are associated with increased risks of influenza, pneumonia, as well as COVID-19 severity and mortality compared to non-users, while the effects on pneumonia or COVID-19-related outcomes under PPI use were attenuated when compared to the use of H2RAs. Appropriate use of PPIs based on comprehensive evaluation is required.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), as one of the most commonly used medications worldwide, have been utilized for treating various conditions related to excessive gastric acid secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vaezi et al., 2017</xref>). In the United States, the prescription of PPIs has doubled from 1999 to 2012, and the number of people taking PPIs is still increasing due to their availability over the counter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kantor et al., 2015</xref>). However, concerns are being raised regarding the long-term and inappropriate use of PPIs, which have been linked to a wide range of adverse conditions, including osteoporotic fractures, renal failure, and vitamin deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Targownik et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abtahi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xie et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>PPI-induced hypochlorhydria and gastrointestinal residence of pathogens might increase the risk of respiratory infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Malfertheiner et al., 2017</xref>). Cohort studies in the United Kingdom and the United States reveal the risks of developing community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia are increased by approximately 100% and 30%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herzig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van der Sande et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, a nested case-control study based on the UK General Practice Research Database indicates long-term PPI therapy is not associated with increased risk for community-acquired pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sarkar et al., 2008</xref>), and a retrospective cohort study involving 593,265 patients in Canada demonstrates no increased risk in developing pneumonia among PPI recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Redelmeier et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, attention has also been paid to the susceptibility to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Based on 53,130 participants in the United States, a dose-dependent increased risk of COVID-19 positivity among PPI users is found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Almario et al., 2020</xref>). Another Danish study also indicate a marginally increased risk of COVID-19 positivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Israelsen et al., 2021</xref>), whereas studies based on the UK Biobank and a Korean cohort indicate nonsignificant association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). Meta-analyses on the associations between the use of PPI and SARS-CoV-2 infection also demonstrate conflicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Israelsen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To date, the association between PPI and influenza remains unknown. The current evidence referring to PPI, pneumonia and COVID-19 is controversial. Previous studies had several limitations. For instance, the study based on the UK General Practice Research Database did not adjust for potential confounding variables for PPI indications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Othman et al., 2016</xref>).

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding, were included as they are main indications for the use of PPIs. The comorbidities (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, renal failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], asthma) were examined using self-reported data and adjusted due to their impact on the risk of respiratory infections. Since PPI and H2RA have highly similar indications, the use of H2RA was also adjusted. Data on medication use including aspirin, non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS, including ibuprofen), and cholesterol-lowering medications were extracted and adjusted. For influenza and COVID-related outcomes, vaccinations were additionally adjusted. The linearity between continuous variables and outcomes was assessed by Martingale residuals plots, while the variables detected with non-linearity were regarded as categorical variables for further analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title><italic>CYP2C19</italic> genetic variants</title><p>PPIs are mainly cleared by <italic>CYP2C19</italic>, and therefore their metabolism and effects are affected by different variants of <italic>CYP2C19</italic>.

Self-reported infections, except for COVID-19-related outcomes due to the lack of data, were also included for the outcomes as sensitivity analyses. The self-reported cases were reported at the baseline or subsequent UK Biobank assessment center visit. Moreover, propensity score-matching analysis was conducted. The same set of covariates was used to derive propensity scores, and the PPI users and non-users were matched with a ratio of 1:4 using the ‘MatchIT’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stuart et al., 2011</xref>), which estimated the propensity scores in the background and matched observations based on the nearest neighbor method.

The association with influenza remains robust across different subgroups stratified by population characteristics and <italic>CYP2C19</italic> phenotypes.</p><p>The correlation between PPI use and the risk of influenza remains unexplored. For the past two decades, accumulating evidence indicates increased risks of pneumonia under the use of PPIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herzig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van der Sande et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meijvis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeon and Kim, 2022</xref>), whereas others failed to show such associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sarkar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Redelmeier et al., 2010</xref>). Conflicting findings also exist for studies referring to the risk of COVID-19 infection and related outcomes among PPI users, including several meta-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Almario et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Israelsen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shah et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shupp et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shafrir et al., 2022</xref>). Compared with existing studies, our study more comprehensively adjusts for a variety of critical covariates by utilizing the latest data from the UK Biobank. In addition, distinct from previous population-based studies, we compared the risks with H2RA users to further reduce protopathic and other unmeasured bias, since the users of acid suppressants, including PPIs and H2RAs, can have matched information on different characteristics, including indications. Although the risks of pneumonia were initially increased in Cox and propensity-score-matched analyses, direct comparison with H2RA users showed negative results, which indicates that previously observed associations could be due to unmeasured confounders.</p><p>Several proposed mechanisms can account for the association between the use of PPIs and respiratory tract infections. Since a low pH of gastric acid rapidly inactivates microorganisms, one critical issue is that reduced acidity induced by PPIs leads to the overgrowth of microorganisms, which can contribute to the development of infections in the respiratory tract through microaspiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scholtissek, 1985</xref>). Colonization and growth of pathogens under hypochlorhydria could increase the risk of respiratory infections. Although initial assessments indicated the use of PPIs might increase the risk of pneumonia, the head-to-head comparison with H2RAs yielded impacted effects. It could be due to the similar acid-suppressive effects of H2RAs and reduced sample size, which therefore warrants further investigations.</p><p>Concerns over protopathic bias due to non-specific and overlapping symptoms between influenza/pneumonia and acid-related diseases were raised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Horwitz and Feinstein, 1980</xref>). Nevertheless, pneumonia and influenza often present with acute cough, and other concomitant symptoms distinct from acid-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Irwin et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, patients with chronic cough are more commonly GERD-related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Irwin et al., 2018</xref>). The American College of Chest Physicians Clinical Practice Guidelines for Management of Reflux-Cough Syndrome also recommend against using PPI therapy alone for patients with chronic cough but without heartburn or regurgitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kahrilas et al., 2016</xref>). In our study, the use of PPIs is defined as taking the medication for most days of the week in the last 4 weeks, which is uncommon for acute cough. Although we cannot completely rule out protopathic bias, we have attempted to minimize it by adjusting for covariates including PPI indications, matching with propensity scores, and comparing with H2RA users.</p><p>For the risk of developing influenza, we analyzed the risks among different <italic>CYP2C19</italic> metabolizers for the first time, and further observed a significant increase among <italic>CYP2C19</italic> normal metabolizers compared to rapid and ultrarapid metabolizers. Although the risks of several outcomes, for example, influenza and pneumonia, for <italic>CYP2C19</italic> likely intermediate, intermediate and poor metabolizers are not statistically significant, they could be due to the limited sample size, and the risk estimates are higher compared to those among other types of metabolizers. Intriguingly, the risks of developing influenza and pneumonia are higher among <italic>CYP2C19</italic> rapid and ultrarapid metabolizers regularly taking PPIs compared to other types of metabolizers. Since our study exclusively involves participants with valid primary care data, such an increased risk might be to some extent contributed by the over-prescription or self-taking of PPIs under the undesired effects without following the proper strategy. Our findings are generally consistent with the assumption that slower metabolizers are associated with higher risks of adverse effects, while larger samples are needed to increase statistical power. Prescription of PPIs based on different <italic>CYP2C19</italic> metabolism subtypes is therefore important to reduce the adverse effects.</p><p>Our study has several strengths. First, our study utilizes the updated large-sample data from the UK Biobank and exclusively includes participants with valid records from primary care, which reduces the information bias. Second, a variety of covariates, especially for the indications of PPIs and the use of aspirin, which might contribute to indication or protopathic bias, have been adjusted to enhance the robustness of our results. Third, genotypic data of metabolic enzymes has been integrated into our study. Fourth, propensity score-matching analysis reduces a greater portion of bias, and analyses by propensity-score matching or multiple imputation derive consistent results. Fifth, adjustments for vaccination for COVID-19 and influenza has been performed in our study to reduce the confounding effects by vaccination. Furthermore, the comparison with participants using H2RA, a less potent acid suppressant with similar indications, further reduces the confounding by indication. The findings on the risk of influenza remain highly consistent across different strata and sensitivity analyses.</p><p>Limitations exist in our study. Information on dose and duration of PPI use, discrimination between prescription and over-the-counter use of PPIs, health-seeking behavior, different types of pneumonia, and pneumococcus vaccination is currently not available from the UK Biobank. Given that the PPI exposure was mainly assessed at the baseline recruitment, it was possible that a small proportion of PPI users was misclassified during the follow-up due to the medication discontinuation, which may result in an underestimation of potential risk. However, the prevalent user design could underestimate the actual risks of PPI use for respiratory infections, which indicates the real effect might be stronger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, no effect moderation was observed in subgroup analyses for the main outcome among PPI users with indications (more likely to regularly use PPIs for a long period) compared to those without indications, indicating the risks remained increased among long-term PPI users. Since the follow-up prescription data was lacking in our study to precisely identifying the long-term users, further evaluation using cohorts with close follow-up is needed. PPIs are indicated for <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> eradication, whereas the UK Biobank does not contain adequate data. Thus, the indication for eradicating <italic>H. pylori</italic> is not adjusted in this study. The data on different PPI subtypes and COVID-19 infection and related outcomes are relatively small, which limits their power and still needs further investigation. Moreover, patients with exacerbations of comorbid disorders (e.g. diabetes, asthma, COPD) might suffer from a wide range of gastrointestinal symptoms that lead to the use of PPIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Etminan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Due to the lack of data for respiratory severity and close follow-up for medication use, residual confounding might still exist due to the observational nature. Residual genotyping impacts of other enzymes, although affecting the metabolism to a lesser extent, might also exist. Although no significant differences were found between PPIs and H2RAs regarding the association with pneumonia and COVID-19-related outcomes, this could be due to the reduced sample size and power, which require larger cohorts to validate the effects. Furthermore, the highly selective nature of the UK Biobank might create collider stratification bias for the evaluation of COVID-19-related outcomes, and thus the conclusions should be interpreted with cautions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Griffith et al., 2020</xref>). The current study is principally based on white British ancestry in the United Kingdom, and future exploration of other ancestries with comparisons is warranted.</p><p>Our findings could have essential implications for the prevention of respiratory infections and the de-prescribing of PPIs in clinical practice. Administration of PPIs can rapidly increase intragastric pH to higher than 6 after 2–4 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laine et al., 2008</xref>). Emerging evidence has revealed the inappropriate prescription of PPIs in both the primary and secondary care settings, and 33–67% of the patients did not take the drug according to their countries’ criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Forgacs and Loganayagam, 2008</xref>). Similarly, the baseline characteristics of the included participants in our study demonstrate that approximately 60% of the regular PPI users do not have main indications. In addition, although influenza is usually self-limiting in healthy individuals, its risk of complications is significantly increased among pregnant women and people with immunosuppression or chronic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ghebrehewet et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, comprehensive evaluation of PPI use is needed in clinical practice.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, compared to non-users, people regularly taking PPIs are associated with increased susceptibility to influenza, pneumonia, as well as COVID-19 severity and mortality, while their association with pneumonia and COVID-19-related outcomes is diminished after comparison with H2RA use and remains to be further explored.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Supplementary information for the analyses.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Generic name and examples of trade name of proton pump inhibitors.

the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The current study aims to quantify associations between the regular use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) - defined as using PPI most days of the week during the last 4 weeks at one cross-section in time - with several respiratory outcomes up to several years later in time. There are 6 respiratory outcomes included: risk of influenza, pneumonia, COVID-19, other respiratory tract infections, as well as COVID-19 severity and mortality.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Several sensitivity analyses were performed, including (i) estimation of the e-value to assess how strong unmeasured confounders should be to explain observed effects, (ii) comparison with another drug with a similar indication to potentially reduce (but not eliminate) confounding by indication.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for your pointing out the strengths in our article, particularly the assessment of e-values and the comparison with another medication to mitigate confounding by indication. We extend our sincere gratitude to the reviewer for identifying multiple concerns and offering constructive feedback to help improve our manuscript. We will incorporate these suggestions into our revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The main exposure of interest seems to be only measured at one time-point in time (at study enrollment) while patients are considered many years at risk afterwards without knowing their exposure status at the time of experiencing the outcome. As indicated by the authors, PPI are sometimes used for only short amounts of time. It seems biologically implausible that an infection was caused by using PPI for a few weeks many years ago.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that PPIs are sometimes used for only short amounts of time, as indicated in our manuscript. We acknowledge that it is a limitation of the UK Biobank cohort, and we have discussed this in the discussion section as follows:</p><p>“Given that the PPI exposure was mainly assessed at the baseline recruitment, it was possible that a small proportion of PPI users was misclassified during the follow-up due to the medication discontinuation, which may result in an underestimation of potential risk.” (Page 14, Line 8-10)</p><p>In addition, to alleviate these concerns, we have conducted effect medication for the subgroup of potential long-term users, which were defined by participants with indications of PPI use. This information has been included in the discussion section:</p><p>“In addition, no effect moderation was observed in subgroup analyses for the main outcome among PPI users with indications (more likely to regularly use PPIs for a long period) compared to those without indications, indicating the risks remained increased among long-term PPI users.” (Page 14, Line 12-15)</p><p>We hope that in the future, the concerns highlighted by the reviewer can be resolved by utilizing datasets with close follow-up, especially regarding medication use:</p><p>“Since the follow-up prescription data was lacking in our study to precisely identifying the long-term users, further evaluation using cohorts with close follow-up is needed.” (Page 14, Line 15-17)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Previous studies have shown that by focusing on prevalent users of drugs, one often induces several biases such as collider stratification bias, selection bias through depletion of susceptible, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Because of the limitations of data from the UK Biobank, such as the absence of details on initiation of medications and regular monitoring, we were restricted to using a prevalent user design to assess the associations between PPI use and respiratory outcomes. We have discussed it in the limitation section:</p><p>“Given that the PPI exposure was mainly assessed at the baseline recruitment, it was possible that a small proportion of PPI users was misclassified during the follow-up due to the medication discontinuation, which may result in an underestimation of potential risk. However, the prevalent user design could underestimate the actual risks of PPI use for respiratory infections, which indicates the real effect might be stronger [38]……Since the follow-up prescription data was lacking in our study to precisely identifying the long-term users, further evaluation using cohorts with close follow-up is needed.” (Page 14, Line 8-17)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It seems Kaplan Meier curves are not adjusted for confounding through e.g. inverse probability weighting. As such the KM curves are currently not informative (or the authors need to make clearer that curves are actually adjusted for measured confounding).</p></disp-quote><p>Your kind suggestions are greatly appreciated. We have plotted Kaplan Meier curves adjusted for confounding by inverse probability weighting with the measured confounders according to the reviewer’s advice. The methods and results are demonstrated as follows:</p><p>“The event-free probabilities were compared by Kaplan-Meier survival curves with inverse probability weights adjusting for the measured covariates.” (Page 8, Line 13-15)</p><p>“Regular PPI users had lower event-free probabilities for influenza and pneumonia compared to those of non-users (Supplementary Figure 2 A-B).” (Page 9, Line 21-23)</p><p>“PPI users had lower event-free probabilities for COVID-19 severity and mortality, but not COVID-19 positivity compared to those of non-users (Supplementary Figure 2 C-E).” (Page 10, Line 9-10)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Throughout the manuscript the authors seem to misuse the term multivariate (using one model with e.g. correlated error terms to assess multiple outcomes at once) when they seem to mean multivariable.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for misusing the term “multivariate” and “multivariable” in our previous manuscript. We have corrected the misused terms throughout the manuscript:</p><p>“Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were utilized to assess the association between regular use of PPIs and the selected outcomes.” (Page 7, Line 19-20)</p><p>“The remaining imbalanced covariates (standardized mean difference ≥ 0.1) after propensity score matching were further adjusted by multivariate multivariable Cox regression models to calculate HRs and 95% CIs.” (Page 8, Line 23-25)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Given multiple outcomes are assessed there is a clear argument for accounting for multiple testing, which following the logic of the authors used in terms of claiming there is no association when results are not significant may change their conclusions. More high-level, the authors should avoid the pitfall of stating there is evidence of absence if there is only an absence of evidence in a better way (no statistically significant association doesn't mean no relationship exists).</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised our interpretation for the results, particularly for those without statically significant association based on the reviewer’s advice, and clearly recognize that the conclusions should be interpreted with cautions:</p><p>“In contrast, the risk of COVID-19 infection was not significant with regular PPI use…” (Page 2, Line 11-12)</p><p>“PPI users were associated with a higher risk of influenza (HR 1.74, 95%CI 1.19-2.54), but the risks with pneumonia or COVID-19-related outcomes were not evident.” (Page 2, Line 14-16)</p><p>“…while the effects on pneumonia or COVID-19-related outcomes under PPI use were attenuated when compared to the use of H2RAs.” (Page 2, Line 18-19, in the Abstract)</p><p>“…while their association with pneumonia and COVID-19-related outcomes is diminished after comparison with H2RA use and remains to be further explored.” (Page 15, Line 21-22, in the Conclusion)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) While the authors claim that the quantitative bias analysis does show results are robust to unmeasured confounding, I would disagree with this. The e-values are around 2 and it is clearly not implausible that there are one or more unmeasured risk factors that together or alone would have such an effect size. Furthermore, if one would use the same (significance) criteria as used by the authors for determining whether an association exists, the required effect size for an unmeasured confounder to render effects 'statistically non-significant' would be even smaller.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there might still exist one or more unmeasured risk factors that have effect sizes larger than 2. Hence, we cannot affirm that the findings are robust to unmeasured confounding in the current analysis, which is a limitation of our study. We have deleted the previous statement, and added more discussion in the limitation section:</p><p>“Moreover, patients with exacerbations of respiratory disorders (e.g., asthma, COPD) might suffer from a wide range of gastrointestinal symptoms that lead to the use of PPIs [38]. Due to the lack of data for respiratory severity and close follow-up for medication use, residual confounding might still exist due to the observational nature.” (Page 14, Line 23-27)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Some patients are excluded due to the absence of follow-up, but it is unclear how that is determined. Is there potentially some selection bias underlying this where those who are less healthy stop participating in the UK biobank?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. The reasons for the absence of follow-up are mainly classified into five categories, including: (1) Death reported to UK Biobank by a relative; (2) NHS records indicate they are lost to follow-up; (3) NHS records indicate they have left the UK; (4) UK Biobank sources report they have left the UK; (5) Participant has withdrawn consent for future linkage. According to the data from UK Biobank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=190">https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=190</ext-link>), the major reason for the loss of follow-up among participants is their departure from the UK (84.7% of participants who were lost to follow-up). In addition, not including those who were less healthy in the study might also underestimate the risk, leading to lower estimated effects of PPIs for respiratory infections. We have supplemented this in our revised manuscript:</p><p>“Among them, 1,297 participants without follow-up, which were mainly determined by reported death, departure from the UK, or withdrawn consent, had been removed after initial exclusion.” (Page 4, Line 25-27)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Given that the exposure is based on self-report how certain can we be that patients e.g. do know that their branded over-the-counter drugs are PPI (e.g. guardium tablets)? Some discussion around this potential issue is lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your concerns. In the data collection by the UK Biobank, the participants can enter the generic or trade name of the treatment on the touchscreen to match the medications they used. We have added this important information to the method section:</p><p>“The exposure of interest was regular use of PPIs. The participants could enter the generic or trade name of the treatment on the touchscreen to match the medications they used (Supplementary Table S1).” (Page 5, Line 6-8)</p><p>We acknowledge that specific information on prescribed or over-the-counter use of medications is lacking in the UK Biobank. We have discussed it in the limitation section:</p><p>“Limitations exist in our study. Information on dose and duration of PPI use, discrimination between prescription and over-the-counter use of PPIs, health-seeking behavior, different types of pneumonia, and pneumococcus vaccination is currently not available from the UK Biobank.” (Page 14, Line 5-8)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Details about the deprivation index are needed in the main text as this is a UK-specific variable that will be unfamiliar to most readers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question on the definition of deprivation index. We have proved the details about the deprivation index in the manuscript:</p><p>“…socioeconomic status (deprivation index, which was defined using national census information on car ownership, household overcrowding, owner occupation, and unemployment combined for postcode areas of residence)…” (Page 6, Line 14-17)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) It is unclear how variables were coded/incorporated from the main text. More details are required, e.g. was age included as a continuous variable and if so was non-linearity considered and how?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not elucidating how variables were incorporated into the main text. Previously, the linearity between continuous variables and outcomes was assessed by Martingale residuals plots, while the variables detected with non-linearity were regarded as categorical variables for further analyses.

They conclude that compared to non-users, people regularly taking PPIs have increased susceptibility to influenza, pneumonia, as well as COVID-19 severity and mortality. By performing several different statistical analyses, they try to reduce bias as much as possible, to end up with robust estimates of the association.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study comprehensively adjusts for a variety of critical covariates and by using different statistical analyses, including propensity-score-matched analyses and quantitative bias analysis, the estimates of the associations can be considered robust.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for pointing out the merits of our articles, which include adjusting for a wide range of covariates, employing diverse statistical analyses, and using robust data. We will revise our manuscript further based on the reviewer's suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>As it is an observational cohort study there still might be bias. Information on the dose or duration of acid suppressant use was not available, but might be of influence on the results. The outcome of interest was obtained from primary care data, suggesting that only infections as diagnosed by a physician are taken into account. Due to the self-limiting nature of the outcome, differences in health-seeking behavior might affect the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your questions for information on the dose/duration of acid suppressants, the source of diagnosis, and the health-seeking behavior of participants. For the data from the UK Biobank, the dose or duration of acid suppressant use was not available since the information was not collected as baseline or follow-up. In addition, the outcome of interest was also retrieved from the hospital ICD diagnosis. We apologize for not clarifying it in our previous manuscript. Moreover, we agree with the reviewer that the health-seeking behavior could have an impact on the analyses, whereas the correlated data are still not available from the UK Biobank. We have discussed them in the method and limitation section:</p><p>“Briefly, the first reported occurrences of respiratory system-related conditions within primary care data, and hospital inpatient data defined by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)- 10 codes were categorized by the UK Biobank.” (Page 5, Line 21-25)</p><p>“Limitations exist in our study. Information on dose and duration of PPI use, discrimination between prescription and over-the-counter use of PPIs, health-seeking behavior, different types of pneumonia, and pneumococcus vaccination is currently not available from the UK Biobank.” (Page 14, Line 5-8)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Analysis code should be made available.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question.
