However, little is known about the cellular mechanisms sperm use to gain competitive advantage or how these mechanisms are regulated genetically. In this study, we utilize a forward genetic screen in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to identify a gene, <italic>comp-1</italic>, whose function is specifically required in competitive contexts. We show that <italic>comp-1</italic> functions in sperm to modulate their migration through and localization within the reproductive tract, thereby promoting their access to oocytes. Contrary to previously described models, <italic>comp-1</italic> mutant sperm show no defects in size or velocity, thereby defining a novel pathway for preferential usage. Our results indicate not only that sperm functional traits can influence the outcome of sperm competition, but also that these traits can be modulated in a context-dependent manner depending on the presence of competing sperm.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05423.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05423.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05423.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The ornate feathers of a peacock and the antlers of a stag are both traits that have evolved because they help a male to outcompete his rivals and mate with more females. Similarly, in species where each female mates with multiple males, a male can improve his reproductive success if his sperm outcompetes the other males' sperm and fertilizes the female's eggs. One way that males try to gain a competitive edge is by producing large quantities of sperm. However, it is also possible that males could compete by generating higher-quality sperm, for example, cells that are better at migrating through the reproductive tract.</p><p>A microscopic worm called <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is often used to investigate sperm competition. Each worm is either a hermaphrodite or a male; and hermaphrodites store their sperm within a storage structure and use it later to fertilize their own eggs. However, if a hermaphrodite mates with a male, the male's sperm displaces the hermaphrodite's stored sperm and fertilizes the eggs instead. The male's sperm cells were thought to be more competitive because they are larger and faster than the hermaphrodite's sperm, but recent findings suggest a more complex scenario.</p><p>Hansen et al. identified a genetic mutation that causes male <italic>C. elegans</italic> sperm cells to lose their competitive advantage. Male worms with a mutation in a gene called <italic>comp-1</italic> produce sperm cells that are normal in size, but that cannot outcompete sperm from a non-mutant hermaphrodite. Although sperm cells from a <italic>comp-1</italic> mutant male can migrate through the reproductive tract and fertilize eggs when other sperm are not present, in competitive situations the mutant sperm cells have difficulties migrating and are often absent from the hermaphrodite's sperm storage structure. Thus, they no longer come into contact with the eggs that they seek to fertilize.</p><p>Sperm cells from hermaphrodite <italic>comp-1</italic> mutants have similar defects; but when a <italic>comp-1</italic> mutant male mates with a <italic>comp-1</italic> mutant hermaphrodite, the mutant male sperm regains its fertilization advantage. The identification of the <italic>comp-1</italic> gene provides a preview into a complex network of environmental cues and genetically encoded traits that influence which sperm cells are most likely to fertilize an egg cell, and thus live on in the next generation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05423.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05423.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>sperm competition</kwd><kwd>sexual selection</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>reproductive success</kwd><kwd>nematode</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM087705</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stanfield</surname><given-names>Gillian M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM007464</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>Jody M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nematode sperm respond to competitive environments by modulating cellular pathways involved in migration and storage to ensure their access to oocytes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sexual selection operates at the level of reproductive success to promote traits that improve offspring production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darwin, 1871</xref>). It thus influences a wide array of processes that affect not only the likelihood of mating, but also the probability that gametes will interact within a female to form a viable zygote. In many species, a female can mate with multiple males, resulting in competition between male ejaculates, known as sperm competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parker, 1970</xref>). In addition, having multiple mates provides opportunities for a female to influence the outcome, known as cryptic female choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eberhard, 1996</xref>). These post-copulatory forms of sexual selection have driven the diversification of sperm and reproductive tract morphologies as well as the divergence of reproductive proteins, and have likely contributed to reproductive isolation and speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ritchie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Howard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Manier et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Sperm competition is a widespread phenomenon that occurs in species utilizing a wide range of reproductive strategies, and a variety of different patterns of preferential usage, generally referred to as precedence, have been observed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Smith, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birkhead and Møller, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">1998</xref>). For example, in some species, the first male to mate may show precedence, while in others, the last mate's sperm may win, and the strength of such effects varies widely. By their nature, events in the reproductive tract that determine the outcome of competition are difficult to study, so in most cases the mechanistic basis for a particular precedence pattern is poorly understood. When sperm competition is intense, males often respond by production and transfer of numerous smaller sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomendio et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Simmons, 2001</xref>). However, in some cases, sperm may gain an advantage by modulating functional traits, for example, by increasing migration velocity, promoting retention, or blocking subsequent access to the site of fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wigby and Chapman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gomendio and Roldan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pizzari and Parker, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Due to the difficulty of distinguishing sperm from different ejaculates or of observing sperm directly within the selective environment, indirect assays have often been employed to measure sperm usage. The cell behaviors underlying sperm competition have only been investigated in a few species that are amenable to such analyses, and little is known about the genetic basis for differences in competitive ability among cells. However, in vivo imaging studies have recently begun to reveal the cellular mechanisms of sperm behavior in competitive contexts, where multiple males have mated with a female (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Civetta, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Manier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marie-Orleach et al., 2014</xref>). For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, analyses of genetically labeled fluorescent sperm have revealed that stored sperm are highly motile and that modulation of sperm storage, release, and ejection by the female contribute strongly to second-male precedence in that organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Manier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lupold et al., 2012</xref>). Some genetic loci that affect male reproductive success have recently been identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in mammals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fiumera et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sutton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yeh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Civetta and Finn, 2014</xref>). Specific seminal fluid components have been shown to play an important role in male competitive advantage by affecting sperm motility and storage, as well as female responses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mueller et al., 2008</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avila et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Simmons and Fitzpatrick, 2012</xref>). However, very few examples are known of genes that function in sperm to control characteristics directly involved in sperm competition. An open question is whether genes exist that specifically regulate competition, without affecting core sperm functions, or whether competitive advantage is always gained by modulating the activity of genes involved in other processes.</p><p>The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> provides a model system to address the cellular behaviors and molecular pathways that mediate sperm competition. <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a male-hermaphrodite species in which hermaphrodites produce their own self sperm but also can be inseminated by males. In a self-fertilizing context, hermaphrodite self sperm reside in the spermathecae, sperm storage organs where fertilization occur, and are used with very high efficiency. Typically, more than 99% of sperm go on to fertilize an oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ward and Carrel, 1979</xref>). However, if mating occurs, male sperm migrate through the uterus to the spermathecae, where they encounter and must compete with stored self sperm. Importantly, during male-hermaphrodite sperm competition, male sperm are used preferentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ward and Carrel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LaMunyon and Ward, 1995</xref>). Male precedence is very robust, and many crosses result in male sperm exclusively fertilizing oocytes. Simple numerical advantage, seminal fluid factors, and the order of introduction into the reproductive tract have been ruled out as potential causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ward and Carrel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LaMunyon and Ward, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">1995</xref>). Instead, the competitive advantage of <italic>C. elegans</italic> male sperm has been shown to rely on intrinsic differences between male and hermaphrodite sperm cells. While the form of male and hermaphrodite sperm is the same, male sperm are generally larger than hermaphrodite sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LaMunyon and Ward, 1999</xref>). Consistent with the idea that this is significant, experimental evolution under crossing conditions has been shown to lead to increased sperm size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">LaMunyon and Ward, 2002</xref>). Like those of other nematodes, <italic>C. elegans</italic> sperm move by crawling using a pseudopod, and this motility is required for precedence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nelson et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Singson et al., 1999</xref>). Larger sperm crawl faster in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LaMunyon and Ward, 1998</xref>), and male sperm displace self sperm from the walls of the spermathecae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ward and Carrel, 1979</xref>). However, male sperm need not fertilize oocytes to outcompete hermaphrodite sperm; mutant males whose sperm are motile, but fertilization-defective, block self progeny production even though their sperm cannot be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Singson et al., 1999</xref>). These data suggest a model for male precedence in which the presence of larger, faster, male sperm leads to the exclusion of self sperm from the fertilization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LaMunyon and Ward, 1998</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ellis and Stanfield, 2014</xref>). Differences in the migration behaviors of male and hermaphrodite sperm could affect the processes of sperm migration towards, retention in, or localization within the spermathecae, where there could be sites especially favorable for sperm–egg interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Han et al., 2009</xref>). Although many mutants defective for spermatogenesis and/or fertilization have been identified in genetic screens, most mutations affect both male and hermaphrodite sperm equally and none specifically affect male precedence (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nishimura and L'Hernault, 2010</xref>). Thus, the underlying mechanisms, in terms of either cellular behaviors or genetic controls, remain unclear.</p><p>In this study, we report the use of a genetic screen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to identify a sperm competition gene. While sperm lacking <italic>comp-1</italic> activity are used efficiently in the absence of competition, <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm are outcompeted by wild-type sperm from either hermaphrodites or males, resulting in reduced reproductive success for both <italic>comp-1</italic> mutant males and the hermaphrodites that mate with them. Strikingly, <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm are normal in size. However, they show defects in sperm motility and storage in vivo, coupled with context-dependent defects in pseudopodial extension in vitro. These results suggest a model in which <italic>comp-1</italic> functions in sperm to coordinate environmental signals that influence motility-related functions required for sperm to compete with one another. Our findings provide key insight into the genetic regulation of sperm competition and suggest that in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, sperm gain advantage by modulating their motility and storage depending on their competitive milieu.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Isolation of a <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutant with defects in male precedence</title><p>We took advantage of the male-hermaphrodite reproductive system and robust sperm precedence order of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to perform a forward genetic screen for males with less-competitive sperm. After a wild-type male mates with and transfers sperm to a hermaphrodite, his sperm rapidly migrates to the spermathecae and begins fertilizing oocytes, and in ideal conditions, most crosses result in more than 90% cross progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ward and Carrel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LaMunyon and Ward, 1995</xref>). However, the underlying mating and sperm transfer behaviors are variable in efficiency, so that in practice a wide range of cross-progeny frequencies are often observed, and some crosses fail altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ward and Carrel, 1979</xref> and unpublished observations). Thus, for our screen, we developed a sperm competition assay, using <italic>spe-8; dpy-4</italic> hermaphrodite recipients, that allowed us to exclude crosses for which cross progeny numbers were decreased due to behavioral defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’). <italic>spe-8</italic> hermaphrodites are self-sterile due to a defect in the ability to activate their self sperm to become motile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">L'Hernault et al., 1988</xref>). In the absence of mating, they produce no offspring. However, if a male mates with and transfers seminal fluid to a <italic>spe-8</italic> recipient, both the male and self sperm are activated to become motile and fertilization-competent, and since male sperm are superior, they fertilize the vast majority of oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LaMunyon and Ward, 1995</xref>). The <italic>dpy-4</italic> mutation is recessive and allows discrimination of self progeny from cross progeny on the basis of the Dumpy phenotype. For our assay, we established mating conditions in which most crosses were successful and fewer than five total Dumpy self progeny were produced in the vast majority of cases, providing a readily scored cutoff for candidate mutants (data not shown).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05423.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Isolation of the male precedence mutant <italic>me69</italic> in a genetic screen.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Screening assay for mutants with reduced male precedence, showing outcomes for mating failure, mating by wild-type males, and mating by males with less-competitive sperm.

In the standard laboratory strain of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (N2), sequential male matings normally show no precedence pattern, i.e., the first and second males to transfer sperm are equally likely to sire offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ward and Carrel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LaMunyon and Ward, 1998</xref>).

In control crosses, in which two wild-type males were sequentially mated to hermaphrodites, progeny numbers from the first and second male were variable, but no consistent bias was observed, other than a weak trend in which non-<italic>mIs11</italic> males seemed to be slightly favored over <italic>mIs11</italic>-containing males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Notably, <italic>comp-1</italic> males showed full fertility in crosses to <italic>fog-2</italic> hermaphrodites, which lack their own sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Wild-type male sperm usage increased rapidly after mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), consistent with previous evidence that male sperm are used preferentially over hermaphrodite self sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Ward, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ward and Carrel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LaMunyon and Ward, 1995</xref>). However, <italic>comp-1</italic> mutant males sired almost no progeny until late in the hermaphrodite lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Furthermore, while mating with wild-type males suppressed usage of self sperm, mating with <italic>comp-1</italic> males had no effect on self-progeny production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, <italic>comp-1</italic> males show severe long-term defects in their ability to produce offspring after mating, and hermaphrodites that mate with <italic>comp-1</italic> males produce a decreased number of total offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, although they are initially unsuccessful in fertilizing eggs, at least some <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm are eventually used, indicating that they can remain in the reproductive tract.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05423.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title><italic>comp-1</italic> male sperm have long-term precedence defects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Crosses with <italic>comp-1</italic> males result in a low percentage of cross progeny.

To determine whether the COMP-1 protein was localized to a specific subcellular location, we performed co-labeling experiments with the vital dye Mitotracker, a marker of mitochondria, and PEEL-1::GFP, which labels the sperm-specific membranous organelles (MOs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Seidel et al., 2011</xref>).

COMP-1 did not colocalize with any of these markers of sperm structure or with the sperm nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–P</xref>), and its absence from the pseudopod suggests that it is not involved directly with cellular locomotion, at least by modulating cytoskeletal dynamics.</p><p>The absence of obvious differences between males and hermaphrodites in the expression and localization of COMP-1 raised the question of a potential role for <italic>comp-1</italic> in hermaphrodite self sperm.

Matings of wild-type males to <italic>comp-1</italic> hermaphrodites resulted in even higher levels of cross progeny production than those seen in crosses to wild-type hermaphrodites, consistent with <italic>comp-1</italic> hermaphrodite sperm having reduced ability to compete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q</xref>). Interestingly, when <italic>comp-1</italic> males were mated to <italic>comp-1</italic> hermaphrodites, mutant male sperm usage was indistinguishable from that of wild-type, suggesting that the male precedence order is regained when <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm compete against each other. These results indicate that <italic>comp-1</italic> functions to promote sperm usage not only in males, but also in hermaphrodites. In addition, factors other than <italic>comp-1</italic> must influence the outcome of competition, as a strong precedence effect can be observed in the absence of its activity in both competing populations of sperm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title><italic>comp-1</italic> function is not required for sperm development</title><p>One potential explanation for the male precedence defect in <italic>comp-1</italic> mutants was that sperm do not undergo proper spermatogenesis or spermiogenesis necessary to mature into functional sperm. Loss of function of <italic>spe</italic> or <italic>fer</italic> genes required for spermatogenesis generally leads to hermaphrodite self sterility and male infertility, and reduction of gene function can result in partial fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kadandale and Singson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nishimura and L'Hernault, 2010</xref>). We thus examined available markers of sperm morphology to determine if <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm harbor any general defects. Males and hermaphrodites both produce immotile, spherical spermatids that must be activated to become mature, pseudopod-bearing sperm competent for motility and fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wolf et al., 1978</xref>). <italic>comp-1</italic> mutant spermatids and sperm appear grossly normal by light microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,G</xref> and data not shown). In addition, several markers of sperm structures localized appropriately in the <italic>comp-1</italic> mutant. As in wild-type sperm, mitochondria and membranous organelles were restricted to cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–H</xref>), and the GSP-3/4 phosphatase was polarized within pseudopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–L</xref>). The presence of properly polarized sperm structures in mutant sperm indicates that <italic>comp-1</italic> is not required to complete spermatogenesis, nor is it necessary for proper localization of sperm structures in mature sperm cells.

By 12 hr after transfer, both wild-type and mutant sperm were rarely found in zones 1 and 2, instead localizing to zone 3 and/or the spermatheca (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; see below). Thus, mutant male sperm show a delay in reaching the spermathecal region.

Taken together, these results suggest that mutant male sperm are not used because they are present at lower numbers in the spermathecae during periods when these structures are occupied with large numbers of self sperm. Since fertilization can occur only within these structures, this defect is likely the primary reason for the reduction in the competitive ability of <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm.</p><p>Since <italic>comp-1</italic> functions in both male and hermaphrodite sperm, we also analyzed self sperm in <italic>comp-1</italic> hermaphrodites to assess whether localization defects might still be present in a non-competitive context. We quantified the position of sperm in different zones in DAPI-stained 24 hr adult hermaphrodites. In wild-type hermaphrodites, most of the sperm resided in zone 3, tightly concentrated just outside of the spermathecae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> and data not shown); a smaller number was present within the spermathecae.

While mutant sperm are used at normal levels in non-competitive contexts, they display severe usage defects in all competitive contexts. When wild-type sperm are present, <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm are largely absent from the spermathecae and thus are virtually excluded from opportunities to fertilize oocytes. This usage pattern leads to severe defects in male reproductive success for males as well as failure to benefit from outcrossing for hermaphrodites. Consistent with their localization defects in vivo, <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm have in vitro defects in pseudopodial extension that, like their usage defects, are dependent on context. Together, these phenotypes suggest a cellular role for <italic>comp-1</italic> in modulating the response of sperm to their environment. To our knowledge, <italic>comp-1</italic> is the first gene identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to specifically regulate sperm competition and one of few implicated in this process in any organism. Its pattern of conservation in related species suggests a role in male–male sperm competition outside the male-hermaphrodite mode of reproduction used by <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Our findings demonstrate that functional traits can influence the outcome of sperm competition in <italic>C. elegans</italic> in a manner independent of sperm size.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>comp-1</italic> and sperm success</title><p>For males, reproductive success depends on several aspects of sperm function. To fertilize oocytes, sperm must be transferred, become motile, and migrate to the site of fertilization in response to guidance signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ward and Carrel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kubagawa et al., 2006</xref>). Overall fecundity depends on the number of sperm that accomplish these behaviors as well as their ability to be stored so as to ensure long-term usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murray and Cutter, 2011</xref>). We have found that <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm are transferred at rates comparable to the wild type, so they achieve initial entry into the reproductive tract, but they then show varying defects in the ensuing steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Although <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm show delays in migration toward the spermathecae, at least some sperm migrate rapidly and directionally, arguing against a defect in locomotion per se. Large numbers eventually accumulate in the spermathecal region, suggesting that they respond to directional cues, but they are generally found outside the spermathecal valve. Once self-sperm stores are depleted, <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm concomitantly gain residency in the spermathecae and begin to fertilize oocytes. Since fertilization occurs only in these structures, it is likely that this localization defect underlies the reduced competitive ability and generally poor reproductive success of <italic>comp-1</italic> males.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05423.019</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model: <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm have localization defects that result in failure to compete with wild-type sperm.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild-type male sperm (blue) migrate to the region of the spermathecae, where they displace hermaphrodite self sperm (pink) and preferentially fertilize oocytes.

Male sperm could thus increase their numbers in the spermathecae either by resisting removal, for example, by increasing adhesion to the spermathecal walls, and/or by migrating quickly back into the spermathecae, for example, by increasing their crawling velocity. Defects in pseudopodial extension like those observed in vitro for <italic>comp-1</italic> could affect either of these processes, allowing wild-type sperm to preferentially associate. Future studies will be necessary to differentiate between the two models, as well as to characterize the dynamics of sperm behavior in storage.</p><p>A unique feature of the <italic>comp-1</italic> phenotype is its dependence on the presence of wild-type sperm in recipient hermaphrodites. Do <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm defects occur because wild-type sperm behavior is superior, leading to their physical displacement, or does the presence of wild-type sperm make <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm inferior, through an indirect mechanism such as signaling? In some organisms, sperm may cooperate by associating with one another to promote fertility or by providing different functions within an ejaculate (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Higginson and Pitnick, 2010</xref>), but neither cooperative nor detrimental interactions between sperm have been described for <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Some defects in localization of <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm are observed in the absence of competing cells; a few sperm can be found scattered throughout the uterus, though this mislocalization apparently does not lead to significant reduction in usage or loss from the reproductive tract. These findings are consistent with the migration and localization defects we observed in competitive contexts, and they indicate that <italic>comp-1</italic> defects are not solely induced by the presence of wild-type sperm. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that sperm–sperm interactions influence the outcome of competition between <italic>comp-1</italic> and wild-type cells.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated a strong association between precedence and cell size in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LaMunyon and Ward, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Murray et al., 2011</xref>). However, loss of <italic>comp-1</italic> has no effect on cell size. Furthermore, <italic>comp-1</italic> activity appears to override the contribution of size, since large <italic>comp-1</italic> male sperm are completely outcompeted by small wild-type hermaphrodite sperm. Interestingly, the normal male precedence order is restored when both male and hermaphrodite sperm lack <italic>comp-1</italic> function, consistent with the idea that the size effect again predominates. Our data thus suggest that multiple activities contribute to precedence and can be independently modulated to affect sperm competitive ability. We note that a mechanism involving altering the activity of COMP-1 is likely to be less costly than production of larger sperm, which is associated with a reduced rate of sperm production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LaMunyon and Ward, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Murray et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The cellular role of COMP-1</title><p>How does COMP-1 function in sperm to alter motility-related behaviors? For crawling cells, locomotion and interaction with substrate are dependent on maintenance of polarity and extension of the lamellipodium or the pseudopod in the case of nematode sperm (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lammermann and Sixt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reig et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> sperm are stably polarized, though the shape and size of their pseudopods is dynamically regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nelson et al., 1982</xref>). Markers of the cell body and pseudopod are appropriately localized in <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm, suggesting polarity is not disrupted. However, treatment with Pronase in vitro, which is thought to mimic the endogenous male activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smith and Stanfield, 2011</xref>), generates activated cells with severely shortened pseudopods. The sperm cytoskeleton lacks actin and instead consists of Major Sperm Protein (MSP), which generates a network of fibers that drives cell protrusion via its expansion and contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Italiano et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roberts and Stewart, 2012</xref>). In the related nematode <italic>Ascaris</italic>, MSP filament assembly is mediated by MPOP, a pH-dependent phosphoprotein that is active at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">LeClaire et al., 2003</xref>) and the soluble proteins MFP1 and MFP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buttery et al., 2003</xref>). MSP dynamics are also governed in part by the PP1 phosphatase GSP-3/4, which localizes to the proximal pseudopod near the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). Since COMP-1 localizes to the cell body, it seems unlikely to interact directly with the MSP cytoskeleton, but rather might function upstream of locomotion per se. COMP-1 contains a protein kinase-like domain, which might suggest a role in signal transduction. Like many other reproductive proteins, it represents a divergent member of its family, and its primary sequence suggests that it is unlikely to be catalytically active. However, in spite of lacking or having reduced enzymatic activity, pseudokinases have been shown to play important roles in cell signaling via interactions with active kinases or their substrates, scaffolding or tethering of signaling complexes, and other mechanisms (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reiterer et al., 2014</xref>). The punctate localization of COMP-1 within the sperm cell body is intriguing in this context.</p><p>Our finding that <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm have reduced pseudopod lengths in an in vitro assay fits with their altered patterns of localization in vivo. However, measurements of cell velocity indicate that cells lacking <italic>comp-1</italic> are capable of wild-type crawling speeds and they eventually accumulate near their appropriate target. Therefore, it is probable that the cellular defects of <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm in vivo are less severe than those of Pronase-treated <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm, which have severely shortened pseudopods and should be nearly incapable of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nelson et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LaMunyon and Ward, 1999</xref>). The <italic>comp-1</italic> phenotype is also distinct from that caused by lack of prostaglandin cues involved in guidance toward oocytes, which leads to a severe reduction in crawling velocity along with loss of directionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kubagawa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edmonds et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm are capable of directional migration, though some aspect of sensing or responding to prostaglandins could be impaired. Alternatively, the altered localization of <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm could stem from decreased adhesion to the substrate, leading to a reduced ability to crawl directionally and/or maintain position within the spermathecae. Overall, the context dependence of <italic>comp-1</italic> sperm usage suggests that cellular defects may be limited to a subset of sperm cells or may be manifested only some of the time, for example during interaction with particular substrates within the reproductive tract. Sperm migrate across a variety of tissues including uterine and spermathecal cells and fertilized eggs, each of which could be more or less permissive for migration of <italic>comp-1</italic> mutant cells due to effects on either adhesion or signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title><italic>comp-1</italic> and reproductive success</title><p>The role of <italic>comp-1</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is evident by the reduction in reproductive success for both sexes in crosses to <italic>comp-1</italic> males. Wild-type males who mate successfully can produce hundreds (up to thousands) of offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wegewitz et al., 2008</xref>), but <italic>comp-1</italic> males produce very few cross progeny, and these are delayed until other sperm are no longer available. Hermaphrodites mated to wild-type males increase their overall progeny production, but this increase is significantly lower in crosses to <italic>comp-1</italic> males, and few cross progeny are generated. Even in crosses between <italic>comp-1</italic> males and <italic>comp-1</italic> hermaphrodites, where the male precedence order is largely restored, males show reduced success as compared with wild-type to wild-type matings. Thus, sperm with <italic>comp-1</italic> function should be highly selected for usage when competing with sperm without <italic>comp-1</italic>. In male-female species, we expect that <italic>comp-1</italic> may have a similar function in improving male reproductive success, depending on the rate of polyandry in a given population.</p><p>Although self fertilization allows <italic>C. elegans</italic> to propagate without the need to mate and eliminates the cost of producing males, it also leads to reduced genetic variation (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>). The rate of outcrossing in wild populations is estimated to be low, yet males exist, suggesting that some outcrossing may be selected for, or alternatively, that androdioecy has arisen sufficiently recently that the specialized developmental and behavioral characteristics of males have not had time to degrade. Selective pressure has been shown to increase the rate of outcrossing in <italic>C. elegans</italic> in several experimental schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lopes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Morran et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Morran et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>). By promoting the preferential usage of male sperm, COMP-1 should function to increase the genetic diversity of offspring and thus may confer a fitness benefit in situations where adaptation is beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Sperm competition in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>The outcome of sperm competition depends on the arena in which it occurs, which depends on the specialized reproductive biology and anatomy of the species in question. In particular, differences in the capacity of the sperm storage organ(s), functional characteristics of sperm and seminal fluid, and the degree of sperm mixing lead to distinct patterns of sperm usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Parker and Pizzari, 2010</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the spermathecae are somewhat limited as storage sites, which likely reduces the incentive for males to produce and transfer vast numbers of sperm. Instead, the arms race between the sexes leads to males producing sperm that are functionally superior. Once male sperm reach the spermathecae, they are immediately used even though they lack numerical superiority (GMS, unpublished data). Interactions between competing ejaculates can be divided into offense, the ability to displace previous sperm, and defense, the ability to block subsequent sperm. Observations of the processes of ovulation, sperm migration, and fertilization in wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic>, as well as the ability of fertilization-incompetent sperm to sterilize hermaphrodites, suggest that wild-type male sperm most likely block the access of self sperm to the site of fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ward and Carrel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Singson et al., 1999</xref>). However, they fail to block the sperm of another male, as no precedence order is observed in sequential wild-type matings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ward and Carrel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LaMunyon and Ward, 1998</xref>). <italic>comp-1</italic> male sperm lack the ability to suppress self progeny production, and they also show severe defects in male–male competition whether they are the first or a subsequent mate. Thus, they appear to totally lack the offensive capabilities of normal sperm and also show defects in defense against new rivals.</p><p>COMP-1 is present in both male-hermaphrodite and male-female species of nematodes.

For all experiments involving measurements of progeny numbers, wild-type and mutant animals were tested in parallel to control for variations in temperature and/or media quality that can affect mating and fertility. Each experiment was repeated 2–4 times, and figures show representative results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Microscopy and immunohistochemistry</title><p>To release spermatids, adults were dissected in a drop of sperm medium (SM; 50 mM HEPES pH7.8, 50 mM NaCl, 25 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM dextrose). Virgin 48 hr post-L4 males grown at 20°C were used. Where necessary, spermatids were incubated in SM containing 60 mM TEA or 200 µg/ml Pronase to induce activation into motile sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shakes and Ward, 1989</xref>). Antibody staining followed a protocol similar to that in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wu et al. (2011)</xref>. Briefly, an equal volume of 4% paraformaldehyde in SM was added to the dissected cells. The slides were then incubated in a humid chamber for 5 min, freeze-cracked on a metal block placed in liquid nitrogen, incubated in 95% ethanol for 1 min, and washed with PBST (phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA). Antibody incubations were performed for 16 hr at 4°C with rabbit anti-GSP-3/4 (rb1496, 1:500) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wu et al., 2011</xref>) and 1 µg/mL DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and for 2 hr at 4°C in goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 488- or AlexaFluor 568-labeled IgG (Life Technologies) at 1:1000; antibodies were diluted and washes were performed in PBST with 1% BSA (bovine serum albumin). Slides were mounted with VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Confocal images were acquired using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>in vivo sperm migration and localization assays</title><p>To analyze localization of male sperm up to 2.5 hr after transfer, Mitotracker Red CMXRos (Life Technologies) was used to label male sperm as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stanfield and Villeneuve, 2006</xref>. To analyze sperm localization more than 2.5 hr after transfer, virgin 24 hr post-L4 males carrying the <italic>Pcomp-1::GFP::H2B</italic> transcriptional reporter were mated for 45 min to 24 hr post-L4 N2 hermaphrodites anesthetized in 0.1% tricaine and 0.01% tetramisole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McCarter et al., 1997</xref>), and males were then removed. At 12 hr or 24 hr post-mating, images of each recipient were captured in multiple focal planes to capture an entire gonad arm. Analysis of sperm position was performed as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edmonds et al. (2010)</xref>. Depending on the experiment, either all GFP-positive male sperm in a gonad arm were counted, or those in the focal plane that had the most sperm in the spermatheca were counted. To analyze localization of self sperm, 24 hr post-L4 hermaphrodites were fixed with Carnoy's fixative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ellis and Horvitz, 1986</xref>) and stained with DAPI at 1 µg/ml in M9.

(2006)</xref> using an AxioImager M1 microscope, Axiocam camera, and Axiovision software (Zeiss, Germany). Cells within Zone 2 that moved for at least four consecutive frames were analyzed using the plugins Manual Tracking and Chemotaxis and Migration Tool (Ibidi, Germany) in ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>in vitro sperm morphology and function assays</title><p>Sperm were activated in vitro as described previously and DIC (differential interference contrast) images were captured every 60 s for 30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shakes and Ward, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fenker et al., 2014</xref>). To quantify activation, sperm were scored for the presence of either spikes or a pseudopod at 30 min after adding Pronase. Non-activated sperm from control slides lacking activator were used to measure spermatid size. Aspect ratio was measured by dividing the total length of the pseudopod and cell body by the width of the cell body. The center of the cell body was determined by fitting a circle or ellipse around the cell body and finding the center of that object. The length was then determined by drawing a line from the tip of the pseudopod to an edge of the cell body, with the line dissecting the center of the cell body, and the width of the cell was measured by drawing a line perpendicular to the length and dissecting the center of the cell body. Velocity was measured in TEA-activated sperm that moved for at least 3 consecutive frames. Measurements were obtained using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank K Fenker, T Shimko, and C Thummel for comments on the paper.

We agree that either the K-S or M-W test could be used. However, our understanding is that whereas the M-W primarily detects differences in the median and is better used to compare distributions with similar shape, the K-S test is sensitive to differences in either median or shape of a given distribution. Since the K-S test requires fewer assumptions about the underlying distributions involved, we believe it is most appropriate for the majority of our data. Systematic comparison of the two tests for our data sets found that they give completely concordant results in nearly all cases; where differences in p value cutoffs were observed, the K-S actually tended to give a lower p value. We hope that this explanation is sufficient to address questions about our use of the K-S test.</p><p>The reviewers’ rough calculation for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> is correct that the p value for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> should have been lower than that shown in the original submission; however, in fact, their analysis uncovered an error in which we had reported the significance values for a different technical repeat of that experiment other than the one shown in the figure.

Since hermaphrodite sperm are very small and have correspondingly shorter pseudopods than male sperm, male sperm should provide a more sensitive assay for alterations in cell morphology. In addition, we have shown that <italic>comp-1</italic> hermaphrodite sperm are functional and localize properly the majority of the time in non-competitive contexts, consistent with having functional pseudopods. Our data suggest that <italic>comp-1</italic>’s pseudopod extension defects, like other phenotypes, are context-dependent rather than sex-specific.</p><p><italic>8) The Introduction is scholarly and complete, but I am wondering if it could be a little shorter</italic>.</p><p>Our goal was to succinctly present the broader context of our work along with key background from studying sperm competition in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

We have not quantified mating behaviors in our strains, for several reasons. 1) In experiments using mitotracker to visualize sperm, the quantity of transferred sperm, as assessed by fluorescence intensity, appears similar for wild-type and <italic>comp-1</italic> males, suggesting that 2) most of our assays allow us to exclude cases in which mating fails altogether: these include precedence and fertility assays using <italic>spe-8, dpy-4</italic> or <italic>fog-2</italic> recipients, male-male precedence assays, fertility time-course assays, migration assays, and counts of sperm in the spermatheca. 3) In the case of one of our assays, male-hermaphrodite precedence tests using <italic>dpy-4</italic> recipients, differences in mating efficiency would be expected to contribute to the magnitude of the phenotype we observe; but our conclusions do not rely on this assay alone. In summary, we believe that any effect due to mating is minor compared to the severe deficits in progeny production by <italic>comp-1</italic> males, which we observe even in cases where sperm transfer is directly confirmed.</p><p><italic>10)</italic> comp-1 <italic>sperm seem competent to respond to directional cues.
