We have discovered this sequence was mislabeled in that study and is actually complementary to the SdsR sRNA. Therefore, we have re-probed the northern blot in Figure 6B with a probe of the correct sequence. This blot now shows ChiX levels decrease with the overexpression of ChiZ. This does not change the main conclusion of the figure, which provides evidence for the ChiZ sRNA sponging of ChiX and the consequences of this for the ChiX target <italic>chiP</italic>.</p><p>Figure 6 has been updated, and the sequence of the ChiX oligonucleotide has been corrected in Supplementary file 4. Additionally, the text has been changed by a few words in three places to correct statements that are no longer accurate.</p><p>The following two sentences have been corrected in the text (changes are underlined):</p><p>“Upon ChiZ overexpression in the WT background, we observed increased levels of the chiP mRNA, without a change in ChiX levels (Figure 6B).”</p><p>to</p><p>“Upon ChiZ overexpression in the WT background, we observed increased levels of the <italic>chiP</italic> mRNA, <underline>with a reciprocal</underline> change in ChiX levels (Figure 6B).”</p><p>“In this model, when chitooligosaccharides need to be imported, ChiZ prevents ChiX from base pairing, but does not promote degradation of this sRNA. When metabolic needs shift, ChiX could be released from ChiZ allowing ChiX to regulate <italic>chiP</italic> and other targets. This may work in competition, conjunction, or at separate times from the <italic>chbBC</italic> intergenic mRNA sequence, which also sponges ChiX, but results in ChiX decay (Overgaard et al., 2009).”</p><p>to</p><p>“In this model, when chitooligosaccharides need to be imported, ChiZ prevents ChiX from base pairing, <underline>and promotes degradation</underline> of ChiX.
