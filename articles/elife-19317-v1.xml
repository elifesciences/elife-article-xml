In the original version of our article, TP53 mutation calls were defined based on the integration of various sources available in 2011, including exon capture sequencing (ECS) data for the majority of cell lines. Using a more recent version of the ECS with full CCLE cell line coverage complemented by the more sensitive Raindance technology, 13 cell lines initially called p53 wt have now been found to be mutant among the 356 cell lines used in the discovery analysis. Similarly, among the 52 cell lines used for validation of the 13-gene signature (external set), 10 cell lines initially called p53 wt have now been found to be p53 mut. A total of 55 PDX models were also used for in vivo validation purposes. Among them, two models initially called p53 wt have been found mutated for p53, and one model initially called p53 mutant has now been confirmed p53 wt.</p><p>In Sonkin’s 2015 report, the reannotation of cell lines affected two of our key datasets: 29 cell lines in the 'discovery set' (CCLE panel) (see supplemental file 1C, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Sonkin, (2015)</xref> and 13 cell lines in the 'validation set' ('external set') (see Table 1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Sonkin, 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> below summarizes the genetic features, including mutation, copy number and mRNA expression published by Sonkin of these cells in both sets.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Summary of reannotated p53 mut cell lines by Sonkin in the ‘discovery’ and ‘validation sets, based on 'inactivating p53 alterations'.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Cell line <break/>name</th><th>TP53 inactivating mutation(s)</th><th>Alternative reads/reference reads</th><th>TP53 mRNA <break/>(MAS5-150 201746_at)</th><th>TP53 CN <break/>ratio</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="3">‘<italic>Discovery set</italic>’</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td style="color: #D50000;">1</td><td style="color: #D50000;">HPB-ALL</td><td style="color: #D50000;">p.C124*</td><td>183/21</td><td>28</td><td>0.55</td></tr><tr><td style="color: #D50000;">2</td><td style="color: #D50000;">NCI-H1373</td><td style="color: #D50000;">p.E339*</td><td>8/0</td><td>16</td><td>0.77</td></tr><tr><td style="color: #D50000;">3</td><td style="color: #D50000;">SW403</td><td style="color: #D50000;">p.E51*</td><td>5/0</td><td>53</td><td>0.68</td></tr><tr><td style="color: #D50000;">4</td><td style="color: #D50000;">U-937</td><td style="color: #D50000;">p.G187_splice</td><td>75/0</td><td>15</td><td>0.84</td></tr><tr><td style="color: #D50000;">5</td><td style="color: #D50000;">HLF</td><td style="color: #D50000;">p.G244A</td><td>69/0</td><td>252</td><td>1.13</td></tr><tr><td style="color: #D50000;">6</td><td style="color: #D50000;">HEL 92.1.7</td><td style="color: #D50000;">p.M133K</td><td>22/0</td><td>179</td><td>0.76</td></tr><tr><td style="color: #D50000;">7</td><td style="color: #D50000;">BICR 31</td><td style="color: #D50000;">p.173_174VR&gt;G</td><td>267/1</td><td>537</td><td>0.9</td></tr><tr><td style="color: #D50000;">8</td><td style="color: #D50000;">SCaBER</td><td style="color: #D50000;">p.R110L</td><td>3/0</td><td>215</td><td>0.75</td></tr><tr><td style="color: #D50000;">9</td><td style="color: #D50000;">SU-DHL-8</td><td style="color: #D50000;">p.R249G, p.Y234N</td><td>26/31, 31/27</td><td>1804</td><td>0.94</td></tr><tr><td style="color: #D50000;">10</td><td style="color: #D50000;">KMM-1</td><td style="color: #D50000;">p.S241F</td><td>43/68</td><td>46</td><td>0.73</td></tr><tr><td style="color: #D50000;">11</td><td style="color: #D50000;">HCC-78</td><td style="color: #D50000;">p.S241F</td><td>76/0</td><td>201</td><td>0.52</td></tr><tr><td style="color: #D50000;">12</td><td style="color: #D50000;">ES-2</td><td style="color: #D50000;">p.S241F</td><td>79/0</td><td>154</td><td>0.97</td></tr><tr><td style="color: #D50000;">13</td><td style="color: #D50000;">JHOS-2</td><td style="color: #D50000;">p.S261_splice</td><td>47/51</td><td>198</td><td>0.65</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>KMS-11</td><td/><td/><td>2</td><td>0.02</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>COR-L23</td><td/><td/><td>795</td><td>0.03*</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>MDA-MB-453</td><td/><td>6</td><td>0.07</td><td/></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>MPP 89</td><td/><td/><td>1</td><td>0.1</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>NCI-H358</td><td/><td/><td>7</td><td>0.1</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>SK-N-AS</td><td/><td/><td>1</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>MG-63</td><td/><td/><td>1</td><td>0.7</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>COV644</td><td/><td/><td>1</td><td>0.74</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>NCI-H2452</td><td/><td>1</td><td>0.9</td><td/></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>PE/CA-PJ49</td><td/><td>1</td><td>1.01</td><td/></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>KP4</td><td/><td/><td>3</td><td>1.01</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>NCI-H2347</td><td/><td>20</td><td>0.54</td><td/></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>NCI-H2172</td><td/><td>24</td><td>0.93</td><td/></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>L3.3</td><td/><td/><td>27</td><td>0.72</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>VMRC-RCZ</td><td/><td>29</td><td>0.52</td><td/></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>RERF-LC-AI</td><td/><td>31</td><td>1.31</td><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="3">‘<italic>Validation set</italic>’</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td style="color: #D50000;">1</td><td style="color: #D50000;">KASUMI-1</td><td style="color: #D50000;">p.

By doing so, he did not select these cell lines only based on their p53 mutation status, but rather on their p53 functional status. Potential confusion may have arisen based on Sonkin’s title, since his approach was to select cells based on their p53 functional status and not only p53 mutation status.</p><p>The purpose of our work was to identify a gene expression signature that could serve as a proxy of p53 functional status. Thus, it is not surprising that Sonkin reported that both approaches yielded similar results. This supports the validity of our approach, namely that we have identified a gene expression signature that is capturing p53 functional status.</p><p>In addition, we argue that such a gene expression signature only requires a single technology and hence would be easier to implement in the clinic, since it remains technically challenging, despite the advances in NGS and corresponding gains in sensitivity, to implement Sonkin’s approach. Sonkin’s approach would require multiple technologies to measure p53 gene expression and p53 copy number in addition to sequencing the full-length of p53 for mutation status. Thus, we and others have utilized p53 mutation status (and not p53 expression, copy number, and mutation status) in the clinic, or have explored the use of gene expression-based signatures due to the complexity required in Sonkin’s approach.</p><p>It is for these reasons that we developed a gene expression stratification signature and used p53 mutation status as the appropriate benchmark. Importantly, in Sonkin’s report (2015), 13/29 reannotated cell lines in the ‘discovery set’ harbor p53 mutations (shown in red in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Similarly, 10/12 reannotated cell lines in the ‘validation set’ harbor p53 mutations (shown in red in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, we selected these cell lines in both sets that were miscalled for their p53 mutation status only, as it is currently implemented in the clinic, to correct our original manuscript (<italic>i.e.</italic> 13 mutated cells in the ‘discovery set’ and 10 mutated cells in the ‘validation set’ shown in red in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and not Sonkin’s reannotation (<italic>i.e.</italic> 29 and 12 cell lines in the ‘discovery set’ and ‘validation set’, respectively). Importantly, we continue to show that our gene expression signature with the reannotation is more predictive than p53 mutation status alone.</p><p>The corrected version of our manuscript now encompasses the revised analyses of the performance of the 13-gene signature based on the updated p53 mutation calls of the cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) used in our study. This correction changes the quantitative numbers in the original paper but none of the conclusions are affected. Below are the corrected tables, figures, and text that changed.</p><p>The article (text and figures) has been corrected accordingly, and 2 supplementary figures have been added.

We have simplified the p53 mutation status based modeling. Indeed we have not observed any improvements given by the naive Bayes probabilistic algorithm when the p53 mutation status was used in a single feature model. Predictions were identical to the ones given by the mutation status coded into a simple probabilistic model where 0 is the likelihood to be sensitive and 1 the likelihood to be insensitive. Additionally, these probabilities show no variability (a sample will always have the same prediction by its mutation status) and the associated prediction scores take no other values than 0 or 1. It is therefore not informative to use ROC analysis and cross-validated repeats for prediction performance assessment. Thus, the ROC curves for the p53 mutation-based predictions have been removed.

Tumor-bearing mice (n = 4/dosing group/model) received vehicle or 100 mg/kg of NVP-CGM097 daily for 4 weeks. The response is reported as percentage change in tumor volume at a given day of treatment relative to day 0 (start of treatment). The cut-off used for sensitivity to NVP-CGM097 was based on RECIST adapted for full tumor volume measurement. The sensitivity call was made at the maximum effect time-point during the treatment period. Sensitivity predictions for each PDX model were generated using the 13-gene signature (Figure 6—source data 2).
