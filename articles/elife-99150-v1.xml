the prodigious challenges of aggregation which are the pathological hallmark of aging and are critically responsible for a wide spectrum of rising human diseases. Here, we combine a joint-venture of complementary wet-lab experiment and molecular simulation to discern the potential ability of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as solubilizer of protein aggregates. We show that ATP prevents both condensation of aggregation-prone intrinsically disordered protein Aβ40 and promotes dissolution of preformed aggregates. Computer simulation links ATP’s solubilizing role to its ability to modulate protein’s structural plasticity by unwinding protein conformation. We show that ATP is positioned as a superior biological solubilizer of protein aggregates over traditional chemical hydrotropes, potentially holding promises in therapeutic interventions in protein-aggregation-related diseases. Going beyond its conventional activity as energy currency, the amphiphilic nature of ATP enables its protein-specific interaction that would enhance ATP’s efficiency in cellular processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>condensation</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered protein</kwd><kwd>ATP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001502</institution-id><institution>Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RTI 4007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sarkar</surname><given-names>Susmita</given-names></name><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>Saurabh</given-names></name><name><surname>Mahato</surname><given-names>Chiranjit</given-names></name><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>Dibyendu</given-names></name><name><surname>Mondal</surname><given-names>Jagannath</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001409</institution-id><institution>Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRG/2023/001426</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mondal</surname><given-names>Jagannath</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ATP prevents condensation of aggregation-prone intrinsically disordered protein by modulating its conformation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), universally present in all living organisms, is recognized as a fundamental energy currency essential for a myriad of cellular processes. While its traditional role in energy metabolism is well-established, recent investigations have unveiled novel dimensions of ATP’s involvement, specifically in protein stabilization and solubilization. Although the canonical functions of ATP are comprehensively understood, its impact on cellular protein homeostasis, particularly in the prevention of aggregation and the maintenance of membraneless organelles, remains a subject of growing interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishizawa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Beyond its well-known chemical actions originating from high-energy phosphate bond breaking or allosteric effects during enzymatic catalysis, ATP exhibits contrasting physical biological roles, including the stabilization of soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Song, 2021</xref>) and the solubilization of insoluble proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aida et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pal and Paul, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sarkar and Mondal, 2021</xref>). Proteome-wide profiling analyses emphasize ATP-mediated protein stabilization as a prevalent trait within the ensemble of proteins featuring an ATP recognition site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>). Subsequent independent studies further validate ATP-mediated enhancement of protein stability for specific proteins, such as ubiquitin, malate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ou et al., 2021</xref>), and the TDP-43 RRM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Song, 2021</xref>), all possessing an ATP-binding motif. Intriguingly, these proteins, where ATP functions as a substrate or allosteric modulator, typically require a low concentration of ATP (approximately 500 µM) for its effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Notably, the cellular cytoplasm maintains a significantly higher concentration of ATP (~5 mM), prompting questions about potential additional purpose for this elevated cytoplasmic ATP concentration beyond its conventional roles as an energy source and in protein stabilization, both typically requiring micromolar concentrations of ATP. As a potential function of the excess ATP concentration within the cell, a substantial influence on cellular protein homeostasis is observed, particularly in preventing protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pal and Paul, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Greiner and Glonek, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sarkar et al., 2023b</xref>) and maintaining the integrity of membraneless organelles (at a millimolar range of ATP concentration). ATP has demonstrated its capability to prevent the formation of protein aggregates, dissolve liquid–liquid phase-separated droplets, and disrupt pathogenic amyloid fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Investigations into ATP’s impact on protein solubility and aggregation encompass a diverse array of proteins, including phase-separating proteins like FUS, TAF15, hnRNPA3, and PGL-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patel et al., 2017</xref>), as well as the aggregates of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayes et al., 2018</xref>). Elevated ATP concentrations are also observed in metabolically quiescent organs, such as the eye lens, where they prevent the crowding of γS-Crystallin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2020</xref>). Proteome-wide profiling analyses underscore ATP’s ability to manage the solubility of numerous proteins, indicating a broad impact on cellular protein solubility and aggregation propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, a majority of proteins lacking any ATP-binding motif, are reported to undergo solubilization in the presence of ATP. Despite past conformational analyses of water-soluble ATP-binding proteins in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>), the role of ATP in biomolecular solubilization, specifically how ATP influences the structural plasticity of insoluble, non-ATP-binding proteins, has yet to receive mainstream attention. In this investigation, we employ a combination of computer simulations and experimental techniques to explore how ATP influences the conformational behavior of two proteins situated at opposite ends of the structural spectrum of non-ATP-binding proteins: the folded globular mini-protein Trp-cage and the amyloidogenic intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) Aβ40, associated with Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Our study, incorporating Thioflavin T (ThT) assay and transmission electron microscopy, validates hypotheses generated through computer simulations regarding ATP’s impact on the nucleating core of the Aβ40 peptide segment. The results establish a clear correlation between ATP’s effect on the conformational landscape of these proteins and its ability to impede the aggregation process, affirming its role as a solubilizing agent.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic Representation of ATP's Role in Modulating Protein Aggregation and Conformational Plasticity.</title><p>A schematic representation shows protein undergoes spontaneous aggregation in aqueous medium through specific conformational transformation prone to aggregation. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) can prevent protein aggregation and improves its solubility. ATP’s effect in protein conformational plasticity has been tested for two contrasting protein molecules belonging from two extreme spectrums of the protein family. One is the globular, structurally ordered protein Trp-cage and the other one is intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), Aβ40, containing comparatively more charged residues (according to the nature of typical IDPs). The highly aggregation-prone Aβ40 protein is popularly well known for causing neurodegenerative disorders (<italic>Alzheimer’s disease</italic>, <italic>AD</italic>). The structures of both the proteins are shown in the new cartoon representation highlighting the protein region-wise coloration scheme. For Trp-cage the three distinct regions, (1) Helix (H1, 1–9), (2) 3–10 Helix (H2, 10–15), and (3) Coil (coil, 16–20) are shown in green, pink, and navy blue colors, respectively. For Aβ40, the (1) N-terminal region (NTR, 1–16), (2) central hydrophobic core (CHC, 17–21), (3) turn (TR, 24–27), (4) secondary hydrophobic region (SHR, 30–35), and the (5) C-terminal regions (CTR, 36–40) are shown in gold, purple, blue, green, and red colors, respectively. The hydrophobicity index of each of the proteins is shown in pie chart representation containing acidic (gold), basic (green), hydrophobic (red), and neutral (blue) residue content. Each of the proteins shown in the surface model is colored according to the respective hydrophobicity nature. Protein–ATP (base part: red, sugar moiety: cyan, and phosphate group: green) site-specific interactions are tested. The current study of ATP’s effect on protein conformational plasticity is performed combining both simulation and experiment based on computational predictions validated by experimental measurement followed by computational reasoning and correlation of ATP-driven conformational modification to protein aggregation scenario.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig1sdata1"><label>Figure 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Sequence-based analysis.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="elife-99150-fig1-data1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99150-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ATP’s impact on a globular mini-protein</title><p>We initiated our investigation via computationally simulating ATP’s effect on the archetypal monomeric form of mini-protein Trp-cage which is known to have a well-defined fold under native conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The effects of ATP on the structure of the Trp-cage protein were investigated using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The protein was modeled with a99SB-<italic>disp</italic> force field and solvated with TIP4P-<italic>disp</italic> water molecules. The system was neutralized with chloride ions. The protein was simulated in aqueous solution and also in presence of ATP, at a temperature of 303 K. The precedent studies reporting the effect of ATP on structured proteins, had been performed by maintaining ATP:protein stoichiometric ratio in the range of 0.01 × 10<sup>3</sup> to 0.03 × 10<sup>3</sup>. Likewise, in our simulation with Trp-cage, the ATP:protein ratio of 0.02 × 10<sup>3</sup> was maintained. In this study, we opted to maintain the ATP stoichiometry consistent with biological conditions and previous in vitro experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patel et al., 2017</xref>). Instead of keeping the protein concentration within the micromolar range and ATP concentration at the millimolar level, we chose this approach to avoid the need for an extremely large simulation box, which would greatly reduce computational efficiency by more than 150-fold.</p><p>Simulations were performed at three different concentrations of ATP.Mg<sup>+2</sup>: 0 (aqueous media), 0.1, and 0.5 M. For ensuring exhaustive exploration of protein conformational landscape condition, each condition was extensively simulated via replica exchange MD simulation (see method). The results showed that ATP caused the Trp-cage protein to unfold. This was evident from an increase in the protein’s radius of gyration (<italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub>) and a decrease in the number of intra-chain contacts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). The <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> of the protein monotonically increased by the action of ATP compared to that of the neat water system in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The number of overall intra-chain contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and native subset of intra-chain contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) monotonically decreased upon increasing the concentration of ATP from 0.1 to 0.5 M. This is also evident from the inter-residue contact map (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). The two-dimensional free energy landscape of the Trp-cage protein was also calculated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). Since multiple previous studies have reported benchmarking of several features of proteins as well as IDPs using both linear and artificial neural network-based dimension reduction techniques and have demonstrated that <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub>, in combination with fraction of native contact serves as optimum features, we have chosen these two metrics for developing the 2D-free energy profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahalawat and Mondal, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Menon et al., 2024</xref>). The landscape showed that the protein prefers to remain in its folded form (with less <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> and high native contacts) in the absence of ATP. However, in the presence of ATP, the landscape becomes more populated with conformations that have a higher <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> and fewer intra-chain contacts. This suggests that ATP drives the unfolding of the Trp-cage protein by stabilizing conformations that are more extended and disordered. The observation remains robust over the choice of force field. Similar to the results obtained with a99SB-<italic>disp</italic> force field, when the similar simulations were performed with Charmm36 force parameters of protein (with Charmm TIP3P water model) in 0 and 0.5 M of ATP (modeled with Charmm36 force field parameters), the extension of the protein chain has been noted, as was characterized by the stabilization of protein conformations with higher <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> and lower native contacts is attained in presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The event of unfolding of the protein upon addition of ATP is also evident from the simulation snapshots (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G, H</xref>). A comparative molecular analysis of secondary structure of Trp-cage in neat water versus ATP indicates reduction of both alpha-helical and 3–10 helical content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>) along with inter-residue hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the protein’s solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) increases slightly in presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), implying that ATP can increase the solubility of protein, a point that we would later come back to.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ATP facilitates the chain extension of the globular protein Trp-cage.</title><p>(A) The probability distribution of <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> of Trp-cage compared in neat water and in 0.1 and 0.5 M adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

Consistently higher preferential interaction coefficient (Γ) profile of the aromatic base indicated that ATP’s interaction with the protein is primarily driven by this moiety. This finding is supported by the hydrophobic nature of a significant fraction of Trp-cage residues (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for a pie chart of residue) and the predominance of van der Waals interactions in the favorable base part of ATP–protein interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

Consequently, the prominent interaction with the helical region results in a greater disruption of the helical structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) compared to others (3–10 helical or coil), leading to improved solubilization potential. These results provide valuable insights into the specific interactions between ATP and protein as the key for ATP’s actions and also enhance our understanding of the interplay between ATP and protein structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ATP’s impact on an IDP</title><p>The observation of ATP’s unfolding effect on a model globular protein across a range of concentrations encouraged us to explore how its impact would vary on an IDP Aβ40, which sits at the other end of the spectrum of protein family. Aβ40 has also remained a regular subject of pathological neurodegeneration due to its self-aggregation propensity. Accordingly, extensively long MD (30 μs) simulation trajectory of monomeric Aβ40 in 50 mM aqueous NaCl media, as obtained from D. E. Shaw research, was analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robustelli et al., 2018</xref>). To realize the effect of ATP on the conformational ensemble of Aβ40, we simulated the conformational repertoire of the monomeric form of Aβ40 in 0.5 M aqueous ATP solution containing 50 mM NaCl salt. The former experiments investigating protein (unstructured) aggregation in presence of ATP, had been performed by maintaining ATP:protein stoichiometric ratio in the range of 0.1 × 10<sup>3</sup> to 1.6 × 10<sup>3</sup>, similarly we have also maintained ATP/protein stoichiometry 0.1 × 10<sup>3</sup> in our investigation ATP’s effect on disordered protein Aβ40. The protein was modeled with Charmm36m force field parameters and was solvated with TIP3P water molecules. To facilitate exhaustive sampling of Aβ40 in ATP medium, replica exchange MD (REMD) simulation was performed with a total 64 replicas in a temperature range of 290–460 K (see Method). A comparison of 2D-free energy map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>) along <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> and the total number of inter-residue contacts of Aβ40 in aqueous media (later referred as water) containing no ATP and that in presence of 0.5 M aqueous ATP (later referred as ATP) indicates a clear shift of relative population of Aβ40 conformational sub-ensemble toward a basin with higher <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> and lower number of contacts in presence of ATP, suggesting unfolding of the protein chain by ATP. To verify that the effect of ATP on conformational landscape is not an artifact of difference in sampling method (long conventional MD in absence of ATP versus REMD in presence of ATP), we repeated the conformational sampling in absence of ATP via employing REMD, augmented by adaptive sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We find that the free energy map remains qualitatively similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) irrespective the sampling technique.

Representative snapshot of the conformation of Aβ40 in aqueous ATP media reveals significantly enhanced disorder in protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Aβ40 is also very prone to form β-sheet in aqueous medium and thus gets associated in extensive protein aggregation.

The salt bridge interaction of D23–K28 stabilizes the β-turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Larini and Shea, 2012</xref>) in the region of V24–N27 which consequently favors the hydrophobic contacts between the CHC and the C-terminal part of Aβ40. The structural bend in the zone of residue 23–28 through salt bridge interaction helps the CHC (residues 17–21) and SHR fragments (residues 30–35) to adopt β-sheet formation which gets further stabilized with L17–I32 hydrophobic interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tarus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sgourakis et al., 2007</xref>).

The vertical lines (black colored) show the error bars in the estimation.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99150-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>For a quantitative assessment of ATP’s efficiency over NaXS, we calculated the bound percentage of protein monomers in each of the three cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). NaXS in water reduces the percentage of bound slightly, indicating a decrease in protein aggregation. However, ATP outperforms NaXS by significantly reducing the propensity of Aβ40 dimerization.</p><p>The potency of ATP in inhibiting protein aggregation and maintaining solubility in an aqueous environment, compared to NaXS, is further evident from the estimation of the total number of inter-protein contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). As we move from neat water to 0.5 M NaXS solution and finally to 0.5 M ATP solution, the number of intermolecular contacts between the two protein chains gradually decreases, highlighting ATP’s efficiency over NaXS.</p><p>The contact map (residue-wise inter protein contact map) difference (contact map of ATP/NaXS + water from that in neat water only) reveals that in the presence of ATP, there is a significant decrease in the probability of inter-protein contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>), a crucial factor in protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In contrast, in the presence of NaXS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>), along with a decrease in some contact probabilities, there is an increase in inter-protein contacts, especially involving the CHC and TR regions of one chain with the SHR region of the other protein.</p><p>In nutshell, ATP acts more efficiently compared to NaXS by effectively inhibiting inter-protein interactions, preventing aggregation, and maintaining protein solubility in an aqueous environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G, H</xref>). To elucidate the factors contributing to ATP’s superiority over NaXS, we examined the interaction energy (Coulombic interaction) of both ATP and NaXS with the protein molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I</xref>). The analysis revealed that, in comparison to NaXS, ATP exhibits a stronger interaction with the proteins, resulting in higher interaction energy. This heightened interaction energy plays a crucial role in preventing protein–protein interactions, ultimately leading to the effective inhibition of aggregation.</p><p>Comparing the effects of ATP with other nucleotides such as ADP and GTP, we emphasize that previous studies have demonstrated GTP can dissolve protein droplets (such as FUS) with efficiency comparable to ATP. However, in vivo, the concentration of GTP is significantly lower than that of ATP, resulting in negligible impact on the solubilization of liquid compartments. In contrast, ADP and AMP show much lower efficiency in dissolving protein condensates, indicating the critical role of the triphosphate moiety in protein condensate dissolution. Furthermore, only TP-Mg exhibited a negligible effect on protein droplet dissolution, suggesting that the charge density in the ionic ATP side chain alone is insufficient for this process. These findings underscore ATP’s superior efficacy as a protein aggregate solubilizer, attributed to its specific chemical structure rather than merely its amphiphilicity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>While previous efforts have explored ATP-driven protein disaggregation, its impact on protein conformational plasticity, crucial for self-assembly, is understudied. Our computational investigation prioritizes the examination of ATP’s influence on protein conformational thermodynamics and correlates it with preventing protein aggregation. Regardless of biomolecular structure (globular or intrinsically disordered), ATP is found to induce protein chain extension, disrupting specific secondary structures and promoting flexibility for solvation in water. We demonstrate ATP’s direct enhancement of protein aqueous solubility through calculations of solvation-free energy and SASA. The substantial increase in accessible surface area and more negative solvation-free energy in aqueous ATP solution compared to ATP-free solution highlights ATP’s pivotal role in preventing protein aggregation by increasing aqueous solubility through protein chain extension.</p><p>We followed up the simulation’s prediction on ATP’s role on protein conformation via a set of proof-of-concept experiments, in which we investigated ATP’s impact on the fibrillogenic nucleating core of Aβ40 (residues 16th to 22nd). ThT assays revealed a monotonically decreasing intensity over time with increasing ATP concentrations (0–20 mM), indicating the dissolution of Aβ40 peptide assemblies. TEM confirmed the dissolution of peptide assemblies within 18 hr in ATP-treated samples, contrasting with control systems containing only Ac-KE, which showed no significant alteration in fibrillar morphologies. This experimental evidence, coupled with insights into ATP’s role in enhancing aqueous solubility, necessitates an understanding of its molecular inhibitory mechanisms at the oligomerization level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kurisaki and Tanaka, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Computational studies focused on the primitive aggregation stage, specifically Aβ40 dimerization, revealed that ATP disrupts dimer formation compared to the rapid dimerization observed in water. ATP’s ability to guide conformational changes, particularly by disfavoring β-sheet adoption between the CHC and SHR fragments, efficiently inhibits Aβ40 dimerization. Direct interactions between ATP molecules and the protein were identified as crucial, preventing pathological interactions (CHC–CHC, CHC–SHR, and SHR–SHR) associated with the β-sheet motif. Additionally, ATP not only inhibits aggregation but also disintegrates previously formed dimers, highlighting its capability to dissolve existing protein aggregates. Overall, ATP’s multifaceted action, from inhibiting dimerization to disrupting existing dimers, underscores its potential in preventing pathological protein aggregation.</p><p>In conclusion, beyond its role in various energetic modulations, ATP contributes significantly and independently of energy expenditure to the proper functioning of proteins in crowded cellular environments with high salt concentrations, mitigating biomolecular instabilities linked to diseases involving pathological protein aggregation. Our study demonstrates that ATP’s micromanagement starts at the protein monomeric level, orchestrating conformational modifications to ensure adequate aqueous solubility. By perturbing intramolecular contacts, ATP induces structural flexibility, facilitating effective water solubilization of protein monomers. Simultaneously, ATP discourages the adoption of fibrillogenic protein conformations prone to aggregation. Recently described as hydrotropic activity, our findings provide a detailed understanding of the biological rationale for the exceptionally high concentration of ATP in cells compared to other nucleotides, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patel et al., 2017</xref>. While previous studies highlighted ATP’s antiaggregation property, our investigation elucidates its mechanism: ATP’s remarkable influence on protein conformational modification helps hydrophobic protein molecules remain favorably soluble in the cellular aqueous medium, thereby reducing their propensity for self-aggregation. Overall, ATP’s regulatory role in conformational plasticity emerges as a key factor behind its hydrotropic function in biological systems.</p><p>The mechanistic details of ATP’s interaction with proteins have been subjected to various interpretations. Few studies proposed a nonspecific ATP–protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishizawa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zalar et al., 2023</xref>), contrasting with the some reports explaining ATP’s preferential binding to conserved residues (Arg and Lys or Tyr and Ser) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Song, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coskuner and Murray, 2014</xref>). Some studies highlighted ATP’s role as a solvation mediator with the capabilities of ATP in hydrophobic, π–π, π–cation, and electrostatic interactions with proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pal and Paul, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sarkar and Mondal, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dec et al., 2023</xref>). In our investigation, we found that ATP interacts directly with Trp-cage and Aβ40 proteins in a protein-specific manner, utilizing its chemically distinct parts—negatively charged PG group, hydrophilic sugar moiety, and hydrophobic aromatic base—to engage in electrostatic, H-bond-like, and hydrophobic interactions with protein residues. The nature of ATP’s interactions varies significantly based on the amino-acid composition of the protein. For the hydrophobic Trp-cage, ATP favors van der Waals’ interactions over electrostatic ones, while for the charged Aβ40, Coulombic interactions dominate. This protein-dependent specificity enhances ATP’s efficiency in cellular processes, aligning with recent proteome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>) studies showing diverse effects of ATP on protein thermal stability and solubility. Notably, IDPs experience enhanced solubility with ATP, while some proteins exhibit decreased solubility.</p><p>In our literature survey of ATP’s concentration-dependent actions, as detailed in the Introduction section, we observed a dual role where ATP induces protein liquid–liquid phase separation at lower concentrations and promotes protein disaggregation at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Song, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ren et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu and Wang, 2023</xref>). These versatile functions emphasize ATP’s pivotal role in maintaining a delicate balance between protein stability (at low ATP concentrations) and solubility (at high ATP concentrations) for effective proteostasis within cells. Notably, ATP-mediated stabilization primarily targets soluble proteins, particularly those with ATP-binding motifs, while ATP-driven biomolecular solubilization is observed for insoluble proteins, typically lacking ATP-binding motifs. The question arises: how does ATP selectively stabilize or destabilize proteins? Recent proteome-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>) investigations align with previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saraste et al., 1990</xref>) indicating that ATP predominantly stabilizes soluble biomolecules, especially those featuring the P-loop motif (GK[X]nS/T or G[X]nK[X]nK). Our sequence-based analysis of reported proteins, including ubiquitin, malate dehydrogenase, and TDP-43 RRM domain, reveals conservation of the P-loop motif in their respective ATP recognition site (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Conversely, proteins like Trp-cage and Aβ40, undergoing ATP-driven solubilization at the expense of conformational stability, lack the P-loop motif (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). This suggests that ATP deciphers information from the primary structure (protein sequence) to govern secondary and tertiary structures, selectively stabilizing ATP-binding proteins and inducing solubilization in the absence of ATP-binding motifs during protein unfolding.</p><p>In summary, while previous reports emphasize ATP’s role in inhibiting protein aggregation, our work connects these findings by highlighting ATP’s influence starting at the monomeric level, thereby preventing proteins from becoming aggregation prone. The distinctive protein-dependent and region-specific interactions between ATP and protein molecules play a pivotal role in regulating protein structure. This interaction mechanism leads to an exceptionally efficient inhibition of protein aggregation compared to conventional chemical hydrotropes. ATP orchestrates a two-stage hydrotropic action, from monomer destabilization to early-stage aggregation prevention. The necessity for higher cellular concentrations of ATP underscores its significance, potentially explaining the frequent onset of protein aggregation-related diseases with aging, attributed to ATP deficiency. The collaborative efforts of simulation and experimentation in this study suggest potential implications and therapeutic interventions using ATP for future treatments of various neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Simulation model and methods</title><p>In this work, we have studied the effect of ATP on the conformational plasticity of two different types of proteins belonging from the contrasting protein spectrum: (1) folded globular protein, Trp-cage which stands as one of the very suitable prototypical computational mini-protein models with less charge content and (2) the IDP, Aβ40 containing higher proportion charged residues (in line with the typical nature of IDP), which is popularly known for its characteristic high aggregation propensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Here, we have individually investigated the conformational dynamics of both the proteins in absence and presence of ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The folded protein Trp-cage, PDB: 1L2Y (both the N- and C-terminal of the protein was capped with acetyl group and methyl amide, respectively) was studied in neat water and in 0.1 and 0.5 M aqueous ATP solution (protein/ATP stoichiometry of 0.02 × 10<sup>3</sup>). Further equivalent number of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions was incorporated into the simulation box. The system was charge neutralized with an equivalent number of chloride ions. The protein was modeled with a99SB-<italic>disp</italic> force field parameters and solvated with TIP4P-<italic>disp</italic> water molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robustelli et al., 2018</xref>). The ion parameters were taken from a99SB-<italic>disp</italic> force field. During simulation with ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> (0.1 and 0.5 M), ATP molecules were modeled with Amber force field parameters. For Trp-cage simulations in neat water and 0.5 M ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> aqueous solution the box volume was 4.4 × 4.4 × 3.1 nm<sup>3</sup> and for 0.1 M ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> simulation with Trp-cage the box dimension was kept fixed as 8.2 × 8.2 × 5.7 nm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>First each system was energy minimized followed by two consecutive steps of equilibration: (1) NVT equilibration for 1 ns at an equilibrium temperature of 300 K utilizing the Nosé–Hoover thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nosé, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoover, 1985</xref>) (1 ps time constant) and then (2) equilibration in NPT ensemble for 2 ns at 300 K temperature and 1 bar pressure maintained using the Nosé–Hoover thermostat (time constant of 1 ps) and Berendsen barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berendsen et al., 1987</xref>) (time constant of 1.0 ps), respectively. Further, the system was again equilibrated in the NPT ensemble for 10 ns at an equilibrium temperature of 300 K and an equilibrium pressure of 1 bar, maintained by employing the Nosé–Hoover thermostat (time constant of 1 ps) and the Parrinello–Rahman barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>) (time constant of 1.0 ps), respectively. The particle-mesh Ewald (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darden et al., 1993</xref>) method with a grid spacing of 0.12 nm was applied for managing long-range electrostatics. For constraining the bonds associated with hydrogen atoms and the bonds and angle of water molecules, the LINCS method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hess, 2008</xref>) and SETTLE algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hess, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miyamoto and Kollman, 1992</xref>), respectively, were used. To perform all the MD simulations GROMACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>) software of version 2018.6 software was utilized.</p><p>To ensure exhaustive exploration of protein conformational landscape conditions, each condition (Trp-cage in neat water and 0.1 and 0.5 M ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> aqueous solution of Trp-cage) was simulated via REMD simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sugita and Okamoto, 1999</xref>). For performing REMD simulation the former equilibrated systems were employed. REMD simulation was done in the temperature range of 280–540 K with a total of 54 replicas (for 0.1 M ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> solution the temperature range was 290–460 K with 64 replicas). At first each of the replicas was well equilibrated for 5 ns in the NVT ensemble at the respective replica temperature employing the Nosé–Hoover thermostat (time constant 1 ps). Eventually the production simulations were performed for 400 ns (250 ns for 0.1 M ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> solution of Trp-cage) at each replica with a replica exchange interval of 10 ps. Finally, the trajectory corresponding to the replica temperature of 303 K was considered for subsequent analysis. Further to test the robustness of our estimation across the choice of force field, the similar set of simulations for the Trp-cage protein in neat water and in 0.5 M ATP are performed with Charmm36 force field parameters for protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best et al., 2012</xref>) and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hart et al., 2012</xref>) and using Charmm TIP3P water model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sarkar and Mondal, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">MacKerell et al., 1998</xref>). For these simulations in the Charmm36 force field the similar simulation protocol has been utilized.</p><p>Apart from folded globular protein, for studying ATP’s effect on the conformation plasticity of an IDP we have chosen Aβ40 which is routinely investigated in the context of protein aggregation-related pathogenic conditions. Accordingly, the 30 µs long MD simulation trajectory of monomeric Aβ40 in 50 mM aqueous NaCl media, from D. E. Shaw research was utilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robustelli et al., 2018</xref>). To realize the impact of ATP on the conformational dynamics of Aβ40, we simulated the conformational repotiare of monomeric form of Aβ40 (initial structure same as D. E. Shaw research group) in 0.5 M (ATP/protein stoichiometry 0.1 × 10<sup>3</sup>) aqueous ATP solution containing 50 mM NaCl salt. At first the protein was incorporated in the simulation box of dimension 8.2 × 8.2 × 5.7 nm<sup>3</sup> followed by addition of ATP molecules to maintain ATP concentration of 0.5 M. Equivalent numbers of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions were added. Finally, the system was solvated with water molecules sufficient to fill up the box. The protein was modeled with Charmm36m force field parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robustelli et al., 2018</xref> and for water molecules, Charmm TIP3P water model was employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sarkar and Mondal, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">MacKerell et al., 1998</xref>). The ion parameters are obtained from the Charmm 36m force field. ATP molecule is modeled with Charmm36 force field parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hart et al., 2012</xref>). For exhaustive sampling of the protein in ATP medium, REMD simulation was performed with a total 64 replicas in a temperature range of 290–460 K. Each of the replicas was simulated for 400 ns at the replica exchange interval of 10 ps, leading to a cumulative sampling aggregate equivalent to around 26 µs. The REMD conformations corresponding to 303 K were further clustered into 213 clusters via the <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> and total number of inter-residue contacts of the protein chain based on regular space clustering algorithm. Finally, 213 independent MD simulations were performed for 100 ns (each) with the different initial configurations (Aβ monomer dissolved in 0.5 M ATP in 50 mM aqueous NaCl solution) chosen randomly from individual clusters. The concatenated short trajectories were employed for generating 2D energy profiles and for all other calculation 303 K REMD simulation trajectory was employed. The 213 short MD simulation trajectories are used separately for building a Markov state model (MSM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Husic and Pande, 2018</xref>) in order to statistically map the complete process of protein conformational change using PyEMMA software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Husic and Pande, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scherer et al., 2015</xref>). From MSM, the stationary populations of the discrete microstates were calculated and eventually utilized for reweighing the free energy surfaces obtained from these short trajectories. To test the robustness, we have also estimated the 2D-free energy profile of Aβ40 in absence of ATP by performing similar REMD simulation followed by adaptive sampling simulation following the similar protocol described above.</p><p>Further to test the correlation of ATP’s effect on protein monomeric level with its potency to inhibit aggregation, we have carried out equilibrium dimer simulations with the aggregation-prone amyloidogenic protein aβ40. We have started our simulation from three different conformations involving the protein chains at three different distances 1, 2, and 4 nm. Two replica simulations are performed with each of the configurations for 500 ns following the similar simulation protocol as mentioned above. The similar set of dimer simulations were performed for the two copies of the Aβ40 proteins in the 50 mM aqueous NaCl solution and also 0.5 M aqueous ATP solution containing 50 mM NaCl salt. The same box size was maintained for each of the dimer simulations as 8.2 × 8.2 × 5.7 nm<sup>3</sup> (same as the monomeric Aβ40 simulation with ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup>). Later we have repeated the similar dimer simulations for 0.5 M NaXS in the 50 mM aqueous NaCl solution, following the similar simulation protocol.</p><p>To assess the impact of ATP on the pre-existing protein droplets, we have tested ATP’s effect on the preformed dimer. We have started our simulation with preformed Aβ40 dimer (three dimer conformations were obtained from the previously described Aβ40 dimerization simulation in 50 mM NaCl salt solution and simulations were carried out corresponding to each of the dimer conformation) dissolved in 0.5 M ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> in 50 mM aqueous NaCl solution. Simulation was performed in the same box size of 8.2 × 8.2 × 5.7 nm<sup>3</sup> following the similar simulation protocol. Simulation was continued up to 1 µs.</p><p>GROMACS software analysis tools were utilized for computing the radius of gyration (<italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub>), number of hydrogen bonds of the proteins. The fraction of native contacts (for Trp-cage) was estimated using PLUMED software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tribello et al., 2014</xref>) with a cutoff of 0.7 nm. For calculating the total number of contacts and residue-wise contact map MDAnalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gowers et al., 2016</xref>) tool was employed along with python scripting. The secondary structure content of each of the proteins was estimated using the STRIDE program of VMD. The calculation of the SASA was performed with the help of the GROMACS analysis tool (gmx sasa). The 2D-free energy profiles were computed for each of the systems using the PyEMMA tool.

We appreciate your detailed review and the constructive comments you have provided.</p><p>We appreciate your understanding of the inherent limitations in MD simulations. The use of higher ATP concentrations in our simulations stems from the computational challenges of all-atom MD simulations. Due to the practical constraints of simulating micromolar protein concentrations in atomistic detail, we employed millimolar protein concentrations, which necessitated the use of ATP concentrations that are proportionally higher to maintain appropriate stoichiometry between ATP and proteins.</p><p>We fully agree with your point that this is a common issue faced by researchers in the MD simulation community. While it is challenging to directly replicate physiological ATP concentrations in atomistic simulations, we believe that our approach still captures the fundamental interactions between ATP and proteins. In particular, our focus was on the relative behaviors and mechanistic insights, rather than absolute concentration effects. We based our choice of ATP concentration on maintaining stoichiometric ratios with the protein concentration to ensure that the molecular mechanisms observed remain relevant. We hope our clarification addresses your concerns.</p><p>We would like to share that in an ongoing study focused on the role of ATP in influencing the liquid-liquid phase separation behavior of several intrinsically disordered proteins, we are employing a coarse-grained model. This approach allows us to maintain ATP concentrations within physiologically relevant ranges, as simulating micromolar protein concentrations becomes computationally feasible with this method. We believe that this complementary work will provide additional insights into the behavior of ATP at concentrations more reflective of cellular conditions and further validate the findings from our current study.</p><p>We would also like to emphasize that the complementary experiments presented in this study were conducted at physiologically relevant concentrations for both protein and ATP. The experimental results are in strong agreement with our computational findings, supporting the hypothesis that the mechanisms observed in the simulations closely reflect the actual biological process.</p><p>--—-</p><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations along with experimental elucidation of the efficacy of ATP as a biological hydrotrope.

However, there are a few points that could be discussed or elucidated further to broaden the scope of the conclusions drawn in this work as discussed below:</p><p>(i) The concentration of ATP used in the simulations is significantly higher (500 mM) as compared to those used in the experiments (6-20 mM) or cellular cytoplasm (~5 mM as mentioned by the authors). Since the authors mention already known concentration dependence of the effect of ATP, it is worth clarifying the possible limitations and implications of the high ATP concentrations in the simulations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their concern regarding the ATP concentration used in our simulation. The reviewer correctly noted our statement about cellular ATP concentrations being in the range of a few millimolar. We would like to highlight that, in a cellular environment, millimolar ATP concentrations coexist with micromolar protein concentrations in the aqueous phase [1].</p><p>In our study, we focused on the impact of ATP on protein conformational dynamics, primarily simulating a protein monomer within the simulation box. If one was required to maintain a micromolar protein concentration (e.g., 20 μM [1]) for a monomeric protein, a MD simulation box of significant dimensions (~44x44x44 nm³) would be required, which is computationally challenging to simulate at an atomistic resolution due to the excessive computational cost and time. We had observed a severe reduction of performance of simulation (with Gromacs software of version 2018.6) of more than 150 times for the 20 μM Aβ40 protein in 20 mM ATP solution containing 50 mM NaCl salt which is comprised in the simulation box of ~ 44x44x44 nm³ in comparison to the current simulation set up we have employed in our study.</p><p>To ensure computational efficiency, we employed a simulation protocol that would maintain the cellular protein/ATP stoichiometry. Similar to the stoichiometry in the cellular environment (i.e., micromolar protein : millimolar ATP ~ 103), our simulations maintained a consistent ratio (i.e., millimolar protein : molar ATP ~ 103). This approach allowed us to use a smaller simulation box while preserving the relevant stoichiometry, enabling us to leverage data within a realistic timeframe.</p><p>Based on the reviewer comment we have included the explanation in the revised manuscript as “In this study, we opted to maintain the ATP stoichiometry consistent with biological conditions and previous in vitro experiments. Instead of keeping the protein concentration within the micromolar range and ATP concentration at the millimolar level, we chose this approach to avoid the need for an extremely large simulation box, which would greatly reduce computational efficiency by more than 150-fold.” (page 4).</p><p>However, during our experimental measurements we have maintained micromolar concentration of protein and ATP concentration in the millimolar range, which lies consistent with the former in vitro experimental studies [1].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems ATP can stabilise the proteins at low concentrations, but the current work does not address this possible effect. It would be interesting to see whether the effect of ATP on globular proteins and IDPs remains similar even at lower ATP concentrations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We would like to refer you to the Discussion and Conclusion sections of our manuscript (on page 18), where we have noted ATP’s concentration-dependent actions on protein homeostasis, incorporating insights from previous literature as well: “In our literature survey of ATP's concentration-dependent actions, as detailed in the Introduction section, we observed a dual role where ATP induces protein liquid-liquid phase separation at lower concentrations and promotes protein disaggregation at higher concentrations [2–4]. These versatile functions emphasize ATP's pivotal role in maintaining a delicate balance between protein stability (at low ATP concentrations) and solubility (at high ATP concentrations) for effective proteostasis within cells. Notably, ATP-mediated stabilization primarily targets soluble proteins, particularly those with ATP-binding motifs, while ATP-driven biomolecular solubilization is observed for insoluble proteins, typically lacking ATP-binding motifs.”. We explain that ATP stabilizes proteins at lower concentrations, primarily targeting those with ATP-binding motifs, as illustrated by a sequence-dependent analysis. Since the proteins we studied (Trp-cage and Aβ40) do not contain any ATP-binding motifs, ATP-guided protein stabilization is not expected for these proteins. Additionally, we presented a set of simulations for Trp-cage with a comparatively lower concentration of ATP (see Figure 2), which also suggests</p><p>ATP-driven protein chain elongation. Thus, we believe that ATP’s effect on globular proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) lacking ATP-binding motifs would remain similar at lower ATP concentrations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) The authors make a somewhat ambitious statement that the role of ATP as a solubilizer of pre-formed fibrils could be used as a therapeutic strategy in protein aggregation-related diseases. However, it is not clear how it would be so since ATP is a promiscuous substrate in several biochemical processes and any additional administration of ATP beyond normal cellular concentration (~5 mM) could be detrimental.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors thank the reviewer for this comment. In conjunction with earlier studies on the non-energetic effects of ATP, our study underscores ATP’s anti-aggregation properties and its ability to dissolve preformed aggregates, thereby maintaining regular protein homeostasis within cells and inhibiting protein aggregation-related diseases. Consequently, ATP has been proposed as a probable therapeutic agent in multiple previous reports [5–8]. Patel et al. also noted that as ATP levels decrease with age, this can lead to increased protein aggregation and neurodegenerative decline [1]. Therefore, the problem of excessive protein aggregation in cells may be linked to the reduction of ATP levels with aging [1,8–12]. In such circumstances, authors hypothesize introducing ATP as part of a therapeutic treatment might address the issue of excessive protein aggregation and neurodegenerative diseases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iii) A natural question arises about what is so special about ATP as a solubilizer. The authors have also asked this question but in a limited scope of comparing to a commonly used chemical hydrotrope NaXS. However, a bigger question would be what kind of chemical/physical features make ATP special? For example, (i) if the amphiphilic property is important, what about some standard surfactants? (ii) how would ATP compare to other nucleotides like ADP or GTP? It might be useful to explore such questions in the future to further establish the special role of ATP in this regard.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the significance and value of our exploration into the unique properties of ATP as a solubilizer. In response to the reviewer’s comment regarding the specific features that make ATP special, we would like to emphasize our analysis of ATP's region-specific interactions with biomolecules. ATP's unique structure, comprising three distinct moieties- a larger hydrophobic aromatic base, a hydrophilic sugar moiety, and a highly negatively charged phosphate group, enables it to perform multiple modes of interactions, including hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions with proteins. This combination of interactions leads to its pronounced effect in a protein-specific manner. We believe that, together with its amphiphilic property, the specific chemical structure of ATP makes it an efficient solubilizer. A previous study by Patel et al. demonstrated the efficiency of ATP as a biological hydrotrope compared to other classical chemical hydrotropes (NaXS and NaTO). Our current study further rationalizes ATP’s efficiency through its effective interactions with biomolecules, driven by the chemically distinct parts of the ATP molecule.</p><p>Regarding the reviewer’s point about comparing ATP as a hydrotrope with standard surfactants, we would like to add that typically, hydrotropes are amphiphilic molecules that differ from classical surfactants due to their low cooperativity of aggregation and their effectiveness at molar concentrations. Hydrotropes tend to preferentially accumulate non stoichiometrically around the solute, and their aggregation depends on the presence of solute molecules. Unlike surfactants, hydrotropes do not form any well-defined superstructure on their own.</p><p>In response to the reviewer’s comment on comparing ATP’s effect with other nucleotides like ADP and GTP, we would like to highlight that previous studies have shown GTP to dissolve protein droplets (FUS) with similar efficiency to ATP. However, in cells, the concentration of GTP is much lower than that of ATP, resulting in negligible effects on the solubilization of liquid compartments in vivo. Conversely, ADP and AMP exhibited comparatively lower efficiency in dissolving protein condensates, suggesting the triphosphate moiety plays a considerable role in protein condensate dissolution. Additionally, only TP-Mg had a negligible effect on protein drop dissolution, indicating that the charge density in the ionic ATP side chain alone is insufficient for dissolving protein drops. Together, these findings highlight the efficiency of ATP as a protein aggregate solubilizer, which stems from its specific chemical structure and not merely its amphiphilicity.</p><p>According to the suggestion of the reviewer we have included the discussion in the revised manuscript as “Comparing the effects of ATP with other nucleotides such as ADP and GTP, we emphasize that previous studies have demonstrated GTP can dissolve protein droplets (such as FUS) with efficiency comparable to ATP. However, in vivo, the concentration of GTP is significantly lower than that of ATP, resulting in negligible impact on the solubilization of liquid compartments. In contrast, ADP and AMP show much lower efficiency in dissolving protein condensates, indicating the critical role of the triphosphate moiety in protein condensate dissolution. Furthermore, only TP-Mg exhibited a negligible effect on protein droplet dissolution, suggesting that the charge density in the ionic ATP side chain alone is insufficient for this process. These findings underscore ATP's superior efficacy as a protein aggregate solubilizer, attributed to its specific chemical structure rather than merely its amphiphilicity.” (page 15).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iv) In Figure 2F, it seems that in the presence of 0.5 M ATP, the Rg increases (as expected), but the number of native contacts remains almost similar. The reduction in the number of native contacts at higher ATP concentrations is not as dramatic as the increase in Rg. This is somewhat counterintuitive and should be looked into. Normally one would expect a monotonous reduction in the number of native contacts as the protein unfolds (increase in Rg).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment. As noted, the presence of 0.5 M ATP results in an increase in the protein’s radius of gyration (Rg) and a decrease in native contacts, indicating that ATP promotes protein chain extension. However, the extent of the changes in Rg and native contacts are not identical. It is important to recognize that even the disruption of a few native contacts can significantly impact protein folding, leading to considerable protein chain extension. Therefore, it is not necessary for the extent of variation in Rg and native contacts to be similar. The appropriate measure is whether the alterations in these two variables are consistent with each other, such that an increase in Rg is accompanied by a decrease in native contacts, and vice versa.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(i) There are several references repeated multiple times, e.g. (a) 1, 9, 14, (b) 25, 29, 31, 33.

Currently, there are no experiments in the literature supporting their simulation results of ATP on Trp-cage. The simulation protocol employed for the Aβ40 monomer system is conventional MD simulation, while REMD simulation (an enhanced sampling method) is used for the Aβ monomer + ATP system.

As shown below in Author response image 1, the free energy profiles obtained from conventional MD simulation (using DESRES trajectory) as well as those obtained via REMD simulations for the same system (in neat water) are qualitatively similar.

Moreover, to elucidate their experimental results that ATP can dissolve preformed Aβ fibrils, the authors need to study the influence of ATP on Aβ fibrils instead of on Aβ dimer in their MD simulations. The novelty of this study is limited. The role of ATP in inhibiting Aβ fibril formation and dissolving preformed Aβ fibrils has been reported in previous experimental and computational studies (Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, 2014, 41: 561; Science 2017, 2017, 356, 753-756 J.

We would like to highlight our results (Figure 5G and H) which demonstrate the dominance of Coulombic interactions (over LJ interactions) of ATP with the protein. Based on this, we compared the Coulombic interaction energy of ATP and NaXS with the protein Aβ40, as depicted in Figure 9I. We observed that ATP-protein electrostatic interactions occur more favorably than those with NaXS, leading to better action of ATP over NaXS. The favorable electrostatic interaction of ATP with the protein, compared to NaXS, is evident because ATP possesses a large and highly charged triphosphate group that can strongly interact with the protein, whereas NaXS contains a very small sulfonate group with much less charge. Therefore, due to the favorable Coulombic interaction of ATP with the protein over NaXS, ATP acts more efficiently as a hydrotrope.

Science 2017), there have been several studies on the phenomenon in which ATP functions as a biological hydrotrope of protein aggregates. In this manuscript, by conducting molecular dynamics simulations of three different proteins, Trp-cage, Abeta40 monomer, and Abeta40 dimer at a high concentration of ATP (0.1, 0.5 M), Sarkar et al. find that the amphiphilic nature of ATP, arising from its molecular structure consisting of phosphate group (PG), sugar ring, and aromatic base, enables it to interact with proteins in a protein-specific manner and prevents their aggregation and solubilize if they aggregate. The authors also point out that in comparison with NaXS, which is the traditional chemical hydrotrope, ATP is more efficient in solubilizing protein aggregates because of its amphiphilic nature.</p><p>Trp-cage, featured with a hydrophobic core in its native state, is denatured at high ATP concentration. The authors show that the aromatic base group (purine group) of ATP is responsible for inducing the denaturation of helical motifs in the native state.</p><p>For Abeta40, which can be classified as an IDP with charged residues, it is shown that ATP disrupts the salt bridge (D23-K28) required for the stability of beta-turn formation.</p><p>By showing that ATP can disassemble preformed protein oligomers (Abeta40 dimer), the authors argue that ATP is &quot;potent enough to disassemble existing protein droplets, maintaining proper cellular homeostasis,&quot; and enhancing solubility.</p><p>Overall, the message of the paper is clear and straightforward to follow. I did not follow all the literature, but I see in the literature search, that there are several studies on this subject. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021, 143, 31, 11982-11993; J. Phys. Chem. B 2022, 126, 42, 8486-8494; J. Phys. Chem. B 2021, 125, 28, 7717-7731; J. Phys. Chem. B 2020, 124, 1, 210-223).</p><p>If this study is indeed the first one to test using MD simulations whether ATP is a solubilizer of protein aggregates, it may deserve some attention from the community. But, the authors should definitely discuss the content of existing studies, and make it explicit what is new in this study.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors showed that due to its amphiphilic nature, ATP can interact with different proteins in a protein-specific manner, a. finding more general and specific than merely calling ATP a biological hydrotrope.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) My only major concern is that the simulations were performed at unusually high ATP concentrations (100 and 500 mM of ATP), whereas the real cellular concentration of ATP is 1-5 mM. Even if ATP is a good solubilizer of protein aggregates, the actual concentration should matter. I was wondering if there is a previous report on a titration curve of protein aggregates against ATP, and what is the transition mid-point of ATP-induced solubility of protein aggregates.</p><p>For instance, urea or GdmCl have long been known as the non-specific denaturants of proteins, and it has been well experimented that their transition mid-point of protein unfolding is ~(1 - 6) M depending on the proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their concern regarding the ATP concentration used in our simulation. The reviewer correctly noted our statement about cellular ATP concentrations being in the range of a few millimolar. We would like to highlight that, in a cellular environment, millimolar ATP concentrations coexist with micromolar protein concentrations in the aqueous phase.</p><p>In our study, we focused on the impact of ATP on protein conformational dynamics, primarily simulating a protein monomer within the simulation box. To maintain a micromolar protein concentration (e.g., 20 μM [1]) for a monomeric protein, a simulation box of significant dimensions (~44x44x44 nm³) would be required. This size would be computationally challenging to simulate at an atomistic resolution due to the excessive computational cost and time.</p><p>To ensure computational efficiency, we employed millimolar protein concentrations instead of micromolar, thus requiring a higher ATP concentration to maintain the cellular protein stoichiometry. Similar to the stoichiometry in the cellular environment (i.e., micromolar protein : millimolar ATP ~ 103), our simulations maintained a consistent ratio (i.e., millimolar protein : molar ATP ~ 103). This approach allowed us to use a smaller simulation box while preserving the relevant stoichiometry, enabling us to leverage data within a realistic timeframe.</p><p>Based on the reviewer comment we have included the explanation in the revised manuscript as “In this study, we opted to maintain the ATP stoichiometry consistent with biological conditions and previous in vitro experiments. Instead of keeping the protein concentration within the micromolar range and ATP concentration at the millimolar level, we chose this approach to avoid the need for an extremely large simulation box, which would greatly reduce computational efficiency by more than 150-fold.” (page 4).</p><p>However, during our experimental measurements we have maintained micromolar concentration of protein and ATP concentration in the millimolar range, which lies consistent with the former in vitro experimental studies [1]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The sentence &quot;... a clear shift of relative population of Abeta40 conformational subensemble towards a basin with higher Rg and lower number of contacts in the presence of ATP&quot; is not a precise description of Figures 4A and 4B. It is not clear from the figures whether the Rg of Abeta40 is increased when Abeta40 is subject to ATP. The authors should give a more precise description of what is observed in the result from their simulations or consider a better-order parameter to describe the change in molecular structure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Figure 4A and 4B depicting the 2D free energy profile of the Aβ40 protein with respect to Rg and total number contacts are presented to pinpoint the alteration of protein conformational landscape in influence of ATP. To further elucidate ATP driven protein conformational alteration, the overlaid snapshots corresponding to absence and presence of ATP were also provided. Together the author believes that the descriptions of Figures 4A and 4B in the article are appropriate and effectively incorporate the analysis provided in the article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the disruption of beta-sheet from Figure 4E to 4F is not very clear. The authors may want to use an arrow to indicate the region of the contact map associated with this change.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript the authors have highlighted the region of the contact map associated with the changes in the beta-sheet propensity with an arrow for each of the plots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the full atomistic simulations were carried out, the analyses demonstrated in this study are a bit rudimentary and coarse-grained (e.g, Rg is a rather poor order parameter to discuss dynamics involved in proteins). The authors could go beyond and say more about how ATP interacts with proteins and disrupts the stable configurations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We understand the reviewer's concern regarding the choice of the order parameter (Rg), which has been a topic of long-standing debate. However, we would like to note that in the current study, we employed Rg based on recent investigations by Dr. D. E. Shaw Research group [23] (specifically concerning the protein Aβ40 and the Charmm36m force field), which reported an almost negligible Rg penalty compared to experimental values. The experiments characterizing IDPs utilize Rg as a choice of metric. We also would like to highlight that previous investigations of our group have done careful benchmarking of several features of proteins as well as IDPs using both linear and artificial neural network based dimension reduction techniques and have demonstrated that Rg, in combination with fraction of native contact serves as optimum features [24,25]. Therefore, we believed that Rg would be a suitable order parameter for analyzing the structural behavior of this protein. Additionally, we have also analyzed other relevant characteristics, including the total number of contacts, residue-wise protein contact map, percentage of secondary structure, solvent-accessible surface area, and distances between key interacting residues, to provide a comprehensive understanding.</p><p>The justification of our choice of collective variable has been discussed in the revised manuscript as “Since multiple previous studies has reported benchmarking of several features of proteins as well as IDPs using both linear and artificial neural network based dimension reduction techniques and have demonstrated that Rg, in combination with fraction of native contact serves as optimum features, we have chosen these two metrics for developing the 2D free energy profile.” on page 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Although the amphiphilic character of ATP is highlighted, a similar comment can be made as to GTP. Is GTP, whose cellular concentration is ~0.5 mM, also a good solubilizer of protein aggregates? If not, why? Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s comment on comparing ATP’s effect with other nucleotides GTP, we would like to highlight that previous studies have shown GTP’s ability to dissolve protein droplets (FUS) with similar efficiency to ATP [1,26]. However, in cells, the concentration of GTP is much lower than that of ATP, resulting in negligible effects on the solubilization of liquid compartments in vivo [1].</p><p>According to the suggestion of the reviewer we have included the discussion in the revised manuscript as “Comparing the effects of ATP with other nucleotides such as ADP and GTP, we emphasize that previous studies have demonstrated GTP can dissolve protein droplets (such as FUS) with efficiency comparable to ATP. However, in vivo, the concentration of GTP is significantly lower than that of ATP, resulting in negligible impact on the solubilization of liquid compartments. In contrast, ADP and AMP show much lower efficiency in dissolving protein condensates, indicating the critical role of the triphosphate moiety in protein condensate dissolution. Furthermore, only TP-Mg exhibited a negligible effect on protein droplet dissolution, suggesting that the charge density in the ionic ATP side chain alone is insufficient for this process. These findings underscore ATP's superior efficacy as a protein aggregate solubilizer, attributed to its specific chemical structure rather than merely its amphiphilicity.” (page 15).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Spell-check should be carried out throughout the manuscript. e.g., sollubilizer, sollubilizing, ...</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.
