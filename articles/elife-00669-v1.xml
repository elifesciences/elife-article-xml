decrease approximately linearly with time at night to support metabolism and growth. We find that the rate of decrease is adjusted to accommodate variation in the time of onset of darkness and starch content, such that reserves last almost precisely until dawn. Generation of these dynamics therefore requires an arithmetic division computation between the starch content and expected time to dawn. We introduce two novel chemical kinetic models capable of implementing analog arithmetic division. Predictions from the models are successfully tested in plants perturbed by a night-time light period or by mutations in starch degradation pathways.

Plants, for example, use energy from the sun to produce starch during the day, which is then used as a source of energy during the night. In some plants the amount of starch increases linearly with time during the day, and declines linearly with time during the night, so that the plant contains very little starch when the sun rises the following day. Although a plant is likely to starve if it cannot store or consume starch effectively, very little is known about the mechanisms that plants use to ensure that they store enough starch and do not use it up too quickly.</p><p>Plants are able to track the time to dawn using their internal circadian clock so, as Scialdone et al. point out, if they can also track how much starch they have stored, they might somehow be dividing the amount of starch by the time to dawn to work out the rate at which starch can be consumed so that it lasts until sunrise. But could plants actually perform such calculations?</p><p>To gain some insight into this puzzle, Scialdone et al. constructed mathematical models in which information about the size of the starch store and the time until dawn was encoded in the concentrations of two kinds of molecules (called <italic>S</italic> for starch and <italic>T</italic> for time). In one model, they propose that the <italic>S</italic> molecules stimulate starch consumption, and the <italic>T</italic> molecules prevent this from happening, with the rate of starch consumption being equal to the concentration of <italic>S</italic> molecules divided by the concentration of <italic>T</italic> molecules. These models were able to reproduce the results of previous experiments, including experiments in which dawn arrived unexpectedly early or unexpectedly late.</p><p>Scialdone et al. then performed experiments which confirmed predictions of the models for the pattern of starch consumption in plants lacking relevant enzymes. These experiments also revealed that an enzyme called PWD may be the point at which results of the division computation are integrated into the starch consumption pathway. More generally, this work shows that sophisticated arithmetic computations can be important in biology. Moreover, whereas computers rely on digital logic, Scialdone et al. show that arithmetic computations can also be performed by exploiting the analogue dynamics that take place between molecules.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00669.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00669.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Brachypodium</kwd><kwd>Post-translational arithmetic</kwd><kwd>Starch degradation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (UK)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J004561/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Alison M</given-names></name><name><surname>Howard</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union FP7</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Collaborative project grant 245143 (TiMet)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Alison M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The John Innes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Alison M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Gatsby Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Alison M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Plants implement arithmetic division to optimize use of carbohydrate reserves and thus maintain metabolism and growth at night.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Organisms must control the rate of consumption of their stored food reserves to prevent starvation during periods when food acquisition is not possible. A classic example of this requirement is provided by the response to the light/dark cycle in plants. During the day, plants utilize solar energy for carbon assimilation through photosynthesis. During the night, when solar energy is unavailable, plants utilize stored carbohydrate—usually starch—to allow continued metabolism and growth. In the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> this phenomenon is essential for productivity: mutants with defects in either the accumulation or the degradation of starch have reduced productivity and exhibit symptoms of starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Usadel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Yazdanbakhsh et al., 2011</xref>). The leaf starch content of Arabidopsis increases approximately linearly with time during the day: more than half of the carbon assimilated via photosynthesis may be stored as semi-crystalline starch granules inside chloroplasts. At night, starch content decreases approximately linearly with time such that 95% of starch is utilized by dawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gibon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graf et al., 2010</xref>). This pattern of utilization is extremely robust, and is achieved even when darkness comes unexpectedly early (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graf et al., 2010</xref>). It is also likely to be optimal for the efficient utilization of carbohydrate over the light/dark cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gibon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Smith and Stitt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graf and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Stitt and Zeeman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feugier and Satake, 2013</xref>). However, despite the high importance for plant productivity of precise control of starch degradation, the way in which such dynamics are generated is very poorly understood. One intriguing possibility is the existence of a mechanism that dynamically measures the starch content and the expected time to dawn, then arithmetically divides these two quantities to compute the appropriate starch degradation rate. Such a mechanism could ensure complete utilization of available starch reserves at dawn despite variation in both the starch content at the onset of darkness and the subsequent duration of darkness. Consistent with this idea, we have recently shown that computation of the appropriate starch degradation rate in a normal night requires the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graf et al., 2010</xref>), which indicates how information about the expected time to dawn is obtained.</p><p>Although levels of transcripts for starch-degrading enzymes undergo large daily changes, levels of the enzymes themselves do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kötting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yu et al., 2005</xref>; and our unpublished data). Therefore, it is likely that an arithmetic division mechanism would control flux through starch degradation at a post-translational level. Post-translational control would also permit swifter modulation of the catalytic capacity of these abundant proteins than would be possible via transcription/translation. Accordingly, in this paper we propose appropriate analog division mechanisms that operate through post-translational chemical kinetics. More generally, we also consider analog chemical kinetic schemes that generate addition, subtraction and multiplication operations. To the best of our knowledge the starch degradation system constitutes the first concrete realization of such arithmetic operations in biology. In this context, we therefore introduce two mathematical models which can both implement arithmetic division between the starch content and the expected time to dawn. We then successfully test predictions from the two models by examining the pattern of starch degradation in abnormal light/dark cycles and in a range of mutant plants defective in components of the starch degradation apparatus. Finally, our experiments also indicate which components of the starch degradation apparatus may be important for the appropriate implementation of arithmetic division.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We first investigated the robustness of a potential arithmetic division calculation to perturbations in both the numerator (starch content) and denominator (expected time to dawn). Previously, we showed that the rate of starch degradation is appropriately adjusted in response to an unexpectedly early night (imposition of darkness 8 hr after dawn on plants grown in 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycles) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graf et al., 2010</xref>). We found that adjustment also occurs in response to an unexpectedly late night. Plants grown in 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycles were subjected to darkness at either 12 hr or 16 hr after dawn. In both cases starch content decreased approximately linearly with time during the night, but with different slopes such that starch reserves were almost exhausted by dawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We also found that similar adjustments could be performed in a <italic>cca1/lhy</italic> circadian clock mutant which has a free-running period of &lt;24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabadi et al., 2001</xref>). In 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycles, this mutant degrades its starch by approximately 21 hr after dawn, rather than the normal 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).When subjected to an unexpected early night, the starch degradation rate in the mutant was adjusted, such that starch reserves were again exhausted at around 21 hr after dawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Appropriate adjustments of the rate of starch degradation also occurred in wild-type plants in which environmental manipulations produced different starch contents at the end of the 12-hr light period. A subset of a uniform batch of plants was transferred to a reduced light level for a single light period, leading to a twofold reduction in the starch content at the onset of darkness. For these and control plants subjected to normal light levels, starch content decreased approximately linearly with time during the night, but with different slopes such that starch reserves were almost exhausted by dawn in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Appropriate adjustment of starch degradation also occurred in subsets of plants exposed to three different regimes of varying light intensity over a single light period that generated two different starch contents at the onset of darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To investigate whether this phenomenon is widespread among plants, we examined the model grass <italic>Brachypodium distachyon.</italic> Ancestors of Arabidopsis and <italic>Brachypodium</italic> diverged at least 140 Myr ago. Starch content in <italic>Brachypodium</italic> leaves increased through the light period. As in Arabidopsis, the approximately linear decrease of starch with time following either a normal night (12 hr after dawn) or an unexpectedly early night (8 hr after dawn) was such that starch reserves were almost depleted by dawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00669.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Starch content levels from experiments with unexpected variation in either starch content at the onset of darkness or the time of onset of darkness.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Starch turnover in Arabidopsis grown in 12-hr light/12-hr dark, then subject to unexpected early (8 hr, n = 6 individual rosettes, circles) normal (12 hr, n = 6, squares) or unexpected late (16 hr, n = 5, triangles) onset of darkness.

Although the rate of degradation is different in a circadian clock mutant with an altered period from that in the wild-type, the capacity to adjust starch degradation in response to an unexpectedly early night is not compromised. It is also likely that the mechanism underlying this control is present in evolutionarily-distant species of plants.</p><p>Robust computation of the appropriate starch degradation rate in response to perturbations of both the expected time to dawn and starch content is clearly consistent with the implementation of arithmetic division. Since it is conceptually unclear how such a computation might be performed, we turned to mathematical modeling to generate possible mechanisms.</p><p>The fact that starch exists as large polymers that are mostly inaccessible within granule matrices means that a separate measure is likely required to provide information about the total amount of starch present at any given time. Hence, we assume the existence of a soluble molecule <italic>S</italic> whose concentration is proportional to the amount of starch in a granule. Since plants are able to adjust the rate of starch degradation according to variations in two independent quantities (the expected time to dawn and the amount of starch present), two separate species of molecule are clearly required. Therefore, we further assume the existence of a molecule <italic>T</italic> whose concentration encodes information about the expected time to dawn.</p><p>In our first model the <italic>T</italic> molecule concentration is proportional to the expected time to dawn, except during a period after dawn when its value must be reset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To compute the appropriate degradation rate, the <italic>S</italic> and <italic>T</italic> molecule concentrations must therefore be arithmetically divided. We propose that computations of this form can be carried out most simply using analog chemical kinetics. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, it is straightforward to perform addition, subtraction and multiplication operations. Subtraction can be implemented through efficient sequestration and multiplication by a two-species chemical reaction. Division is slightly more intricate, but can be implemented using the model introduced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> (other conceptually similar models are discussed in the ‘Materials and methods’). Here, <italic>S</italic> molecules associate with the starch granule surface, where they permit starch degradation (presumably in combination with other elements, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and where the <italic>S</italic> molecules can also be degraded. <italic>T</italic> molecules inhibit <italic>S</italic> molecule and starch degradation by binding to <italic>S</italic> and causing its detachment from the granule surface. In this way, it can be seen intuitively that a division-like operation can be implemented (for rigorous calculations, see ‘Materials and methods’). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,H,J</xref>, we show the best fit of this model to the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref> with good results.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00669.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Chemical kinetic models capable of implementing analog arithmetic operations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pictorial summaries of schemes for analog implementation of addition, subtraction and multiplication between the concentrations of two molecules <italic>S</italic> and <italic>T</italic>.

We now assume that the <italic>T</italic> molecule concentration increases as the expected time of dawn approaches, before being reset. If this increase is such that the <italic>T</italic> molecule concentration is approximately proportional to 1/(expected time to dawn) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) then the appropriate degradation rate can be computed by multiplying the <italic>S</italic> and <italic>T</italic> concentrations. This is implemented by the reaction scheme shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>: <italic>S</italic> molecules associate with the starch granule surface, where they recruit <italic>T</italic> molecules from the stroma. The resulting molecular complex permits the degradation of starch (again presumably in combination with other elements, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and of the <italic>S</italic> molecule itself. The output of this second model is very similar to that of the first model (fits to data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref> shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,I,K</xref>) in that a division computation is still performed, but now the timing information is encoded differently in the <italic>T</italic> molecule concentration. One potential difficulty is the need to pre-compute the reciprocal of the expected time to dawn. A simple possible scheme to achieve this goal is outlined in the ‘Materials and methods’. Of course, a combination of the two above models is also possible, involving both multiplication and division by factors dependent on the expected time to dawn, such that overall an appropriate division computation is still performed. However, the additional complexity required for such implementations makes such a combined model less likely.</p><p>Importantly we assume that the granule surface area does not limit the reaction rate as the granule shrinks, consistent with an approximately linear decrease of starch content with time. Accordingly, in both models the degradation reactions (for both the starch and the <italic>S</italic> molecules) occur only in region(s) of granule surface of overall fixed area as each granule shrinks. This would be the case if one or more of the additional components required for starch degradation (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>) is present at a fixed number on the granule surface as the granule shrinks. Clearly the assumption of a non-limiting surface area cannot remain true if the granule shrinks to very small volumes, as could happen at the end of the night. However, our models still fit the experimental data well even at these times (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–K</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our modeling results show that arithmetic division (as well as other arithmetic operations) can be implemented simply using analog post-translational chemical kinetics. Furthermore, output from both models fits our experimental data well. We note that there is some variation in the fitted parameters for both models (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3 tbl4 tbl5 tbl6">Tables 3–6</xref>), which arises due to variation between experimental data sets even for a single genotype. Such variation is widely observed for measurements of primary metabolites over the light/dark cycle and could arise from batch to batch variation in expression levels of degradation or clock components.</p><p>As the fit of the two models to the data is equally good, distinguishing between them is currently challenging. However, we can test two critical predictions common to both models. The first prediction is that the degradation rate is continuously computed via arithmetic division during the night. Such a scheme clearly has advantages in its flexibility and potential to recover from unexpected perturbations. To test whether this prediction is correct, we interrupted a normal night with a period of light, ending 5 hr before the expected time of dawn. During this night-time light period starch accumulated to levels very similar to those present at the end of the day-time light period. Comparison of the rate of starch degradation following the night-time light period with the rate before this period, and with the rate that would have been expected over a normal 12-hr night, allowed a robust assessment of whether the degradation rate had been reset. We confirmed that the night-time light period did not re-entrain the circadian clock, by monitoring expression of the clock gene <italic>LHY</italic> (see ‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). For three independent experiments we found that the rates of starch degradation immediately following the night-time light period (between 19 hr and 21 hr after dawn) were significantly greater than both the corresponding actual rates before this period (between 12 hr and 14 hr after dawn) and the corresponding rates that would have been expected during a normal 12-hr night, see insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref> (p = 1.6 × 10<sup>−3</sup> and 3.8 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, respectively, details of the statistical analysis in the ‘Materials and methods’). The latter rates are those that would have ensured the complete depletion of the starch content measured at 12 hr at the expected time of dawn (24 hr). We obtained the same result by changing the duration and the starting time of the night-time light period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This increase in starch degradation rate is consistent with our prediction that the rate is continuously computed during the night, rather than set only once at the first onset of darkness. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> we show the best fits of the first model to the data, with good results. As before, the second model produced very similar fits (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00669.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Starch content levels from experiments incorporating night-time light period.</title><p>Arabidopsis plants grown in 12-hr light/12-hr dark were subjected to onset of darkness at 12 hr, followed by an unexpected period of light, followed by extended darkness.

To reproduce the normal pattern—in which starch is almost completely degraded by the expected time of dawn—our models require that a factor involved in specifying the relative degradation rates of the starch and <italic>S</italic> molecules must be fine-tuned to one (see ‘Materials and methods’). If instead this factor is &lt;1, so that the starch is degraded too slowly, then rather than complete degradation the models predict that only a certain percentage of the starch will be consumed during the night regardless of the starch content at the end of the preceding light period (for full calculations, see ‘Materials and methods’). Accordingly, we predict that perturbations to parts of the arithmetic division or degradation apparatus might result in degradation of only a fraction of starch during the night. Interestingly, several mutants defective in proteins involved in, or related to, starch degradation exhibit approximately linearly decreasing starch content with time during the night, but have an elevated starch content at the end of the night. These include beta-amylase mutants <italic>bam3</italic> and <italic>bam4</italic>, the debranching enzyme mutant <italic>isa3</italic>, and mutants lacking phosphoglucan water dikinase (<italic>pwd</italic>, also called <italic>gwd3</italic>), a glucan phosphate phosphatase (<italic>sex4</italic>) and a glucan phosphate phosphatase-like protein (<italic>lsf1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Smith, 2012</xref>). We showed previously that this abnormal pattern of starch turnover was rapidly regained in <italic>lsf1</italic> mutants that were transferred to normal light/dark cycles after starch was reduced to very low levels by prolonged darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Comparot-Moss et al., 2010</xref>). We re-analyzed these data and also performed a similar experiment on the <italic>sex4</italic> mutant. For both mutants, we found that the fraction of end-of-light period starch content degraded during the night was approximately the same on successive nights (around 30% for the <italic>sex4</italic> mutant and 45% for the <italic>lsf1</italic> mutant), regardless of the starch content at the end of the respective preceding light period. This resulted in a progressive increase in the end-of-night starch content to an approximately constant value over 3–4 days after return to normal light/dark cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Thus the pattern of starch degradation in these mutants is as predicted from the models for a situation in which the above factor is incorrectly set to a value &lt;1.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00669.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Starch content levels in mutant Arabidopsis plants defective in components of the starch degradation apparatus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Starch content in wild-type (WT) plants and <italic>lsf1</italic> and <italic>sex4</italic> mutant plants during four days of 12-hr light/12-hr dark following 5 days of continuous darkness, where plants were transferred back into the light (at time 0 hr on the x-axis) 132 hr after the end of the previous light period (n = 6 individual rosettes).

In our models the computation of the starch degradation rate is the result of interactions between the molecules encoding the information about starch content and time to dawn (<italic>S</italic> and <italic>T</italic>) and the starch degradation apparatus. If this idea is correct, we expect that mutants lacking components of the degradation apparatus involved in these interactions may also lack the ability to adjust the rate of starch degradation in response to variation in starch content or time of onset of darkness.</p><p>To look for a mutant in this category, we imposed an unexpectedly early night on six mutants, each lacking a protein involved in starch degradation (<italic>lsf1</italic>, <italic>sex4</italic>, <italic>bam3</italic>, <italic>bam4</italic>, <italic>isa3</italic>, <italic>pwd</italic>). All six mutants show approximately linear decreases in starch content with time during the night, but they have higher end-of-night starch contents than wild-type plants. This mutant collection covers the majority of currently-known components of the chloroplastic starch degradation apparatus. For five of the six mutants, the rates of starch degradation (as determined from linear fits) were lower during an unexpectedly early night (starting 8 hr after dawn) than in a normal night (starting 12 hr after dawn), as is the case in wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To quantify the adjustment of the starch degradation rates in the mutants, we calculated the ratio <italic>R</italic> between the degradation rates (normalized by the respective end-of-light period starch content) during the normal and the early night. For wild-type plants, the expected value of <italic>R</italic> is 16/12 ≈ 1.33, that is, the ratio between the expected lengths of the early and the normal night. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> we show that the values of <italic>R</italic> for five of the six mutants are consistent with the wild-type value.</p><p>However for the sixth mutant, <italic>pwd</italic>, the rate of starch degradation was not adjusted in response to an unexpectedly early night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>), as we found an <italic>R</italic> which was significantly different from the wild-type value (p = 0.01, details of the statistical analysis in the ‘Materials and methods’). This finding indicates that PWD—phosphoglucan, water dikinase—may be a node at which information about expected time to dawn and starch content is integrated to set an appropriate rate of starch degradation.</p><p>PWD contributes to a cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of glucosyl residues within starch polymers that is essential for normal starch degradation. Two enzymes—glucan water dikinase (GWD) and PWD—add phosphate groups to starch polymers at the granule surface, and two further enzymes SEX4 and LSF2—remove them. All four enzymes are necessary for normal rates of starch degradation, and loss of GWD almost completely prevents degradation at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Smith, 2012</xref>). The phosphate groups are thought to disrupt the ordered packing of the starch molecules at the granule surface, allowing access to starch degrading enzymes (beta-amylases and isoamylase 3). Subsequent removal of the phosphate groups is essential for full degradation of the starch polymers because the phosphates block the action of the exo-acting beta-amylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baunsgaard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kötting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ritte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hejazi et al., 2009</xref>). The cycle as a whole is thus an attractive candidate for integration of factors that modulate flux through starch degradation.</p><p>Because the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle modifies the granule surface, it is a potential candidate not only for flux modulation but also for the storage of information about starch content. To discover whether phosphate groups may provide information about starch content, we measured the amount of granule-bound phosphate (on the 6-position of glucosyl residues, representing about 80% of the total phosphate) over the light/dark cycle. If phosphorylation simply tracks starch polymer synthesis during the day, phosphate levels per unit mass of starch will be constant and will thus contain no information about starch content. Surprisingly, however, we found a large increase/decrease in the level of phosphate per unit mass of starch over the light/dark cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This discovery implies that the <italic>S</italic> molecule may be a modulator of activities of enzymes of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle, thus generating a daily pattern of change in the accessibility of the granule surface to hydrolytic enzymes that approximately tracks starch content.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00669.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Daily change in starch phosphate content (measured as glucose 6-phosphate, G6P) in Arabidopsis leaves.</title><p>Results are normalized by total amount of glucose (Glc) in starch at each time point.

Our experiments provide strong support for an implementation of arithmetic division in night-time starch degradation. We used mathematical modeling to generate two simple mechanisms capable of analog implementation of such an operation. Predictions from the models were then verified and a potential point identified at which the division computation could be integrated into the starch degradation pathway. We also showed that the phosphorylation state of the starch granule surface could provide information about starch content through the day.</p><p>Our analysis may also be relevant to a broader class of biological processes, where food reserves accumulated in advance of periods of predictable length without further food intake are just sufficient to permit survival to the expected end of the period. For example, migrating little stints (<italic>Calidris minuta</italic>) arriving at their Arctic summer breeding grounds after a 5000-km journey have sufficient remaining lipid reserves for an average of only 0.6 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tulp et al., 2009</xref>). During the 4-month fast period of egg-incubating male emperor penguins (<italic>Aptenodytes forsteri</italic>), lipid reserves are used such that they reach a critical depletion level at approximately the point at which the females are expected to return. Unexpected extension of the fast period leads to catabolism of protein and abandonment of offspring in favor of hunting for food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Groscolas and Robin, 2001</xref>). As in Arabidopsis leaves, the rate of reserve utilization in these examples can potentially be computed by arithmetically dividing the reserve levels by the anticipated time of fasting.</p><p>It is a longstanding idea that cells are able to use proteins to store and process information through networks of interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bray, 1995</xref>).

Our analysis here has underlined the utility of analog chemical kinetics in performing arithmetic computations in biology. Importantly, we have for the first time provided a concrete example of a biological system where such a computation is of fundamental importance.

the possibility that the <italic>T</italic> dynamics given by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equations 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">2</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>) can be phase shifted by a time <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>. The addition of <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> as an extra fitting parameter for the night-time light period experiments was justified by our data on transcripts of the clock gene <italic>LHY</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), showing that the night-time light period may induce a phase shift in the expression of some genes.</p><p>The phase shift of the <italic>T</italic> dynamics determines a shift in the time of expected dawn, that, in Model 1, is defined as the time at which [<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub>] falls to zero (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and which in Model 2 is the time at which [<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub>] would diverge without a reset (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, if the <italic>T</italic> dynamics are phase shifted by <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>, in our models the starch degradation rates are adjusted in such a way so as to deplete the starch reserves at (24 + <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>) hr after the previous dawn, instead of the normal 24 hr. We found this phenotype in <italic>cca1/lhy</italic> plants, which run out of starch earlier than 24 hr after the previous dawn. Hence, to reproduce the phenotype of <italic>cca1/lhy</italic> in our models, <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> was also used as a fitting parameter.

Indeed, the starch reserve is exhausted around 21–22 hr after the previous dawn, instead of 24 hr as in the wild type. Interestingly, if these mutant plants are given an early night, the starch degradation rate is adjusted such that all the starch is again degraded around 21–22 hr after previous dawn (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The models we discussed previously can straightforwardly explain such a phenotype by assuming that in this mutant, the time of expected dawn is shifted to a time <italic>t &lt;</italic> 24 hr after the previous dawn.

This mutation generated an approximately linear decrease of starch content with time during the night, but with a rate which was too low to ensure the complete utilization of the starch reserve by the time of expected dawn. Yet, as opposed to the previously discussed mutations, this mutant did not have the ability to adjust the starch degradation rate in response to an unexpected early night (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Indeed, for this mutant we found that the ratio between the degradation rates (normalized by the respective end-of-light period starch content) during the normal and the early night was <italic>R</italic> = 1.10 ± 0.10, which is significantly less than the wild-type value (<italic>R</italic> = 16/12, one-tailed Z-test, p = 0.01).</p><p>This finding indicates that PWD is potentially a key node where information about starch content and expected time to dawn from the circadian clock are integrated to control starch degradation dynamics.

Once bound to the surface, <italic>S</italic> and <italic>T</italic> can form a complex <italic>ST</italic> (reaction <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>ST</italic></sub>) that permits <italic>S</italic> molecule and starch degradation (through reactions <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>D1</italic></sub> and <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>D2</italic></sub> respectively).

Such re-entrainment might affect the level of the <italic>T</italic> molecule. To discover whether our experimental conditions gave rise to such problems, we investigated the behavior of transcript levels of <italic>LHY,</italic> a central clock gene, by qPCR analysis. For the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <italic>LHY</italic> transcript levels were slightly elevated during the night-time light period, then peaked about 2 hr later than in plants that were not exposed to the light period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result indicates that the night-time light period has only minor effects on the clock, which is not re-entrained: if this were the case the peak of <italic>LHY</italic> expression observed with the night-time light period would not be expected to occur at around 24 hr after the previous dawn.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Mark Stitt and
