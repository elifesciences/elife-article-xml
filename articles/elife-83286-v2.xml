These proteins interact with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, suggesting that methylation levels at these CpGs might be reactive to nicotine exposure. All 13 CpGs have been previously associated with smoking in unrelated individuals and data from monozygotic pairs discordant for former smoking indicated that methylation patterns are to a large extent reversible upon smoking cessation. We further showed that differences in smoking level exposure for monozygotic twins who are both current smokers but differ in the number of cigarettes they smoke are reflected in their DNA methylation profiles.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In conclusion, by analysing data from monozygotic twins, we robustly demonstrate that DNA methylation level in human blood cells is reactive to cigarette smoking.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>We acknowledge funding from the National Institute on Drug Abuse grant DA049867, the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO): Biobanking and Biomolecular Research Infrastructure (BBMRI-NL, NWO 184.033.111) and the BBRMI-NL-financed BIOS Consortium (NWO 184.021.007), NWO Large Scale infrastructures X-Omics (184.034.019), Genotype/phenotype database for behaviour genetic and genetic epidemiological studies (ZonMw Middelgroot 911-09-032); Netherlands Twin Registry Repository: researching the interplay between genome and environment (NWO-Groot 480-15-001/674); the Avera Institute, Sioux Falls (USA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH R01 HD042157-01A1, MH081802, Grand Opportunity grants 1RC2 MH089951 and 1RC2 MH089995); epigenetic data were generated at the Human Genomics Facility (HuGe-F) at ErasmusMC Rotterdam.

In particular, previous research has revealed differences in patterns of DNA methylation, a type of chemical modification that helps cells switch certain genes on or off. However, most of these studies could not establish for sure whether these changes were caused by smoking, predisposed individuals to smoke, or were driven by underlying genetic variation in the DNA sequence itself.</p><p>To investigate this question, van Dongen et al. examined DNA methylation data from the blood cells of over 700 pairs of identical twins. These individuals share the exact same genetic information, making it possible to better evaluate the impact of lifestyle on DNA modifications.</p><p>The analyses identified differences in methylation at 13 DNA locations in pairs of twins where one was a current smoker and their sibling had never smoked. Two of the genes code for proteins involved in the response to nicotine, the primary addictive chemical in cigarette smoke. The differences were smaller if one of the twins had stopped smoking, suggesting that quitting can help to reverse some of these changes.</p><p>These findings confirm that DNA methylation in blood cells is influenced by cigarette smoke, which could help to better understand smoking-associated diseases. They also demonstrate how useful identical twins studies can be to identify methylation changes that are markers of lifestyle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>twin study</kwd><kwd>identical twins</kwd><kwd>discordant twins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA049867</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neale</surname><given-names>Michael C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001826</institution-id><institution>ZonMw</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWO-Groot 480-15-001/674</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Willemsen</surname><given-names>Gonneke</given-names></name><name><surname>de Geus</surname><given-names>Eco JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Boomsma</surname><given-names>Dorret I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of data from monozygotic twins reveals that DNA methylation level in human blood cells is reactive to cigarette smoking.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) have identified robust differences in DNA methylation between smokers and non-smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heikkinen et al., 2022</xref>). In a meta-analysis of blood-based DNA methylation studies (<italic>N</italic> = 15,907 individuals; the largest EWAS of smoking to date), 2623 CpG sites passed the Bonferroni threshold for genome-wide significance in a comparison of current and never smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Joehanes et al., 2016</xref>). Based on comparison with loci identified in large genome-wide association studies (GWASs), differentially methylated sites were significantly enriched in genes implicated in well-established smoking-associated diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory disease, and lung disease, as well as in genes associated with schizophrenia and educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Joehanes et al., 2016</xref>). It has been hypothesized that smoking-induced methylation changes might also contribute to the addictive effect of smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zillich et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, smoking-associated DNA methylation levels, as established in human EWA studies, may reflect different mechanisms. They may reflect causal effects of smoking on methylation, causal effects of methylation on smoking behaviour, methylation differences associated with epiphenomena of other exposures that correlate with smoking e.g. alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) , or they may reflect a shared genetic predisposition to smoking and methylation level. To distinguish these different mechanisms require incisive study designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vink et al., 2017</xref>). Establishing whether methylation levels in smokers revert to levels of never smokers upon smoking cessation is a first step. A previous study of 2648 former smokers with cross-sectional methylation data from the Framingham Heart Study suggested that methylation levels at most CpGs return to the level of never smokers within 5 years after quitting smoking, but 36 CpGs were still differentially methylated in former smokers, who had quit smoking for 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Joehanes et al., 2016</xref>). In the large EWAS meta-analysis of smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Joehanes et al., 2016</xref>), 185 CpGs were differentially methylated between former and never smokers (compared to 2623 between current and never smokers). In addition, differences between former and never smokers were smaller than between current and never smokers. Reversible DNA methylation patterns may suggest that DNA methylation is reactive to smoking. However, it is also possible that the different methylation level in current smokers reflects a higher genetic liability to smoking behaviour (that makes them more likely to initiate and keep smoking). Similarly, differences between former smokers and never smokers could reflect that smoking has caused a persistent methylation change but can also be driven by genetic factors.</p><p>In population-based studies, smoking cases and non-smoking individuals may differ on many aspects, including their genetic predisposition to smoking. On the other hand, monozygotic twins are genetically identical (except for de novo mutations, but these are rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jonsson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ouwens et al., 2018</xref>]), share a womb, and are matched on sex, age, and childhood environment. They have been exposed to similar prenatal conditions, which may include second hand smoke from smoking mothers and others. Differences in prenatal environment of monozygotic twins due to for instance unequal vascular supply are also recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hall, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martin et al., 1997</xref>), although it remains to be investigated to what extent the impact of prenatal smoke exposure might differ between monozygotic twins. Smoking discordant monozygotic twin pairs offer a unique opportunity to assess smoking-reactive DNA methylation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leeuwen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vink et al., 2017</xref>). Despite the large number of previous population-based smoking EWASs, only one previous study compared genome-wide DNA methylation in smoking discordant monozygotic twin pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allione et al., 2015</xref>). This study analysed whole-blood Illumina 450k array methylation data from 20 discordant pairs, and reported 22 top loci, many of which had been previously associated with cigarette smoking in previous studies. However, following the correction for multiple testing, none of the differentially methylated loci were statistically significant, and this previous twin study did not examine reversibility of smoking effects, that is, where methylation status changes again following smoking cessation.</p><p>Here, we analyse unique data from a large cohort of monozygotic twin pairs. This cohort is sufficiently large to include current smoking discordant and concordant pairs, as well as pairs discordant for former smoking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These groups allow identification of loci that are reactive to smoking, and examination of the extent to which effects are reversible upon quitting smoking. Monozygotic pairs in which both twins are current smokers, but who differ in quantity smoked, enable examination of the effects of smoking intensity. Finally, concordant pairs who never smoked allow assessment of the amount of DNA methylation variation at smoking-reactive loci that is due to non-genetic sources of variation other than smoking. In secondary enrichment analyses, we examined whether smoking-reactive methylation patterns are enriched (1) at loci detected in previous EWASs of other traits and exposures, (2) at loci detected in a previous large GWAS meta-analysis of smoking initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2019</xref>) – these loci are presumed to have a causal effect on smoking behaviour, and (3) within Gene Ontology and Kegg pathways. Finally, we examined the relationship between DNA methylation and RNA transcript levels in blood for smoking-reactive loci.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DNA methylation analysis in smoking discordant and smoking concordant monozygotic twin pairs.</title><p>Blood DNA methylation profiles (Illumina 450k array) from six groups of monozygotic twin pairs were analysed.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83286-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>In the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR), DNA methylation data are available for 3089 whole-blood samples from 3057 individuals in twin families, as described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Dongen et al., 2016</xref>). The samples were obtained from twins and family members, who participated in NTR longitudinal survey studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ligthart et al., 2019</xref>) and the NTR biobank project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Willemsen et al., 2010</xref>). In the current study, methylation data from monozygotic twin pairs were analysed. Among 768 monozygotic twin pairs with genome-wide methylation data and information on smoking and covariates, we identified the following discordant pairs: 53 discordant pairs, in which one twin was a current smoker at blood draw and the other never smoked, 72 discordant pairs, in which one twin was a former smoker at blood draw and the other never smoked, 66 discordant pairs of which one twin was a former smoker and the other a current smoker at blood draw. In addition, we identified the following concordant pairs: 83 twin pairs concordant for current smoking, 88 twin pairs concordant for former smoking, and 406 concordant twin pairs who never smoked. A flowchart is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The twin pairs were primarily of Dutch-European ancestry. For 753 of the 768 MZ pairs who are included in the current study, ancestry could be derived from principal components (PCs) calculated from genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) array data that were available for the twins (750 pairs) or for both of their parents (3 pairs). According to the genotype data PCs, 4.5% of the pairs classify as ancestry outliers.The study was approved by the Central Ethics Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects of the VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, an Institutional Review Board certified by the U.S. Office of Human Research Protections (IRB number IRB00002991 under Federal-wide Assurance – FWA00017598; IRB/institute code, NTR 03-180).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Study flowchart.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83286-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Peripheral blood DNA methylation and cell counts</title><p>Genome-wide DNA methylation in whole blood was measured by the Human Genomics facility (HugeF) of ErasmusMC, the Netherlands (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.glimdna.org/">http://www.glimdna.org/</ext-link>). DNA methylation was assessed with the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Genomic DNA (500 ng) from whole blood was bisulfite treated using the Zymo EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo Research Corp, Irvine, CA, USA), and 4 μl of bisulfite-converted DNA was measured on the Illumina 450k array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bibikova et al., 2011</xref>) following the manufacturer’s protocol. A custom pipeline for quality control and normalization of the methylation data was developed by the BIOS consortium. First, sample quality control was performed using MethylAid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Iterson et al., 2014</xref>). Next, probe filtering was applied with DNAmArray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sinke et al., 2019</xref>) to remove: ambiguously mapped probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), probes with a detection p-value &gt;0.01, or bead number &lt;3, or raw signal intensity of zero. After these probe filtering steps, probes and samples with a success rate &lt;95% were removed. Next, the DNA methylation data were normalized using functional normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fortin et al., 2014</xref>), as implemented in DNAmArray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sinke et al., 2019</xref>) using the cohort-specific optimum number of control probe-based PCs. Probes containing an SNP, identified in a DNA sequencing project in the Dutch population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">The Genome of the Netherlands Consortium, 2014</xref>), within the CpG site (at the C or G position) were excluded irrespective of minor allele frequency, and only autosomal probes were analysed, leading to a total number of 411,169 methylation sites.

The questions are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Participants were asked: ‘Did you ever smoke?’, with answer categories: (1) no, I never smoked, (2) I’m a former smoker, and (3) yes. Current smokers were asked how many years they smoked and how many cigarettes per day they smoked at present, while ex-smokers were asked how many years ago they quit, for how many years they smoked and how many cigarettes per day they smoked (note that the question on cigarettes per day to former smoker did not specify a particular time period, which may introduce variation in responses). Data were checked for consistencies and missing data were completed by linking this information to data from surveys filled out close to the time of biobanking within the longitudinal survey study of the NTR. More details on these checks are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Packyears were calculated as the (number of cigarettes smoked per day/20) × number of years smoked. Plasma cotinine level measurements have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bot et al., 2013</xref>). Body mass index (BMI) was obtained at blood draw. Educational attainment was obtained in multiple longitudinal surveys and was defined as the highest completed level of education at the age of 25 or higher. It was classified on a 7-point scale: 1 = primary school only, 2 = lower vocational schooling, 3 = lower secondary schooling (general), 4 = intermediate vocational schooling, 5 = intermediate/higher secondary schooling (general), 6 = higher vocational schooling, 7 = university.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Statistical analyses</title><sec id="s2-4-1"><title>Overview and hypotheses</title><p>All analyses were performed in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">R Development Core Team, 2013</xref>). Analyses were performed in six groups of monozygotic twin pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To identify DNA methylation differences in smoking-discordant monozygotic twin pairs, we first compared the twin pairs, in which one twin had never smoked, and the other was a current smoker at the time of blood sampling. Second, to identify which of these DNA methylation differences might be reversible, we analysed data from (1) monozygotic pairs in which one twin had never smoked, and the other was a former smoker at the time of blood sampling, (2) from monozygotic pairs in which one twin was a current smoker, and the other was a former smoker at the time of blood sampling, and (3) from monozygotic pairs who were both former smokers. Third, to quantify within-pair methylation differences that occur by chance alone, we compared the within-pair differences monozygotic twins concordant for never having smoked. Forth, data from monozygotic twins concordant for current smoking were analysed to examine the effects of smoking intensity. Our hypotheses were as follows: (1) if DNA methylation level is reactive to cigarette smoking, methylation differences will be present between smokers and non-smokers after ruling out genetic differences, that is in smoking-discordant monozygotic twin pairs, and these differences will be larger than in monozygotic pairs concordant for never smoking, (2) if DNA methylation patterns are reversible upon quitting smoking, methylation differences (∆M) in monozygotic pairs will show the following pattern: ∆M discordant current-never &gt; ∆M discordant current-former and ∆M discordant former-never &gt; ∆M concordant never, (3) a correlation between time since quitting smoking and ∆M in pairs discordant for former smoking is consistent with a gradual reversibility of methylation levels upon quitting smoking, and (4) a correlation between ∆M and the difference in number of cigarettes smoked per day in smoking concordant pairs is consistent with smoking-reactive methylation patterns that show a dose–response relationship with amount of cigarettes smoked.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Epigenome-wide association study</title><p>In the entire dataset of 3089 blood samples, we used linear regression analysis to correct the DNA methylation levels (<italic>β</italic>-values) for commonly used covariates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van Rooij et al., 2019</xref>), including HM450k array row, bisulphite plate (dummy-coding) and white blood cell percentages (% neutrophils, % monocytes, and % eosinophils). White blood cell percentages were included to account for variation in cellular composition between whole-blood samples. Lymphocyte percentage was not included in models because it was strongly correlated with neutrophil percentage (<italic>r</italic> = −0.93), and basophil percentage was not included because it showed little variation between subjects, with a large number of subjects having 0% of basophils. We did not adjust for sex and age, because monozygotic twins have the same sex and age. The residuals from this regression analysis were used in the within-pair EWAS analyses. Specifically, the residuals were used as input for paired <italic>t-</italic>tests to compare the methylation of the smoking twins with that of their non-smoking co-twins. Similarly, paired <italic>t</italic>-tests were applied to data from smoking concordant pairs. Statistical significance was assessed following stringent Bonferroni correction for the number of methylation sites tested (<italic>α</italic> = 0.05/411,169 = 1.2 × 10<sup>−7</sup>). For each EWAS analysis, the R package Bacon was used to compute the Bayesian inflation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van Iterson et al., 2017</xref>). A previous power analysis for DNA methylation studies in discordant monozygotic twins indicated that with 50 discordant pairs, there is 80% power to detect methylation differences of 15% (at epigenome-wide significance; that is following multiple testing correction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsai and Bell, 2015</xref>). Power quickly drops for smaller effect sizes; for example, with 50 discordant pairs, the power to detect a 10% methylation difference is 10% and the power to detect a methylation difference of 5% approaches alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsai and Bell, 2015</xref>). We tested for within-pair differences in demographics (e.g. BMI, educational attainment) and smoking characteristics (e.g. amount of cigarettes per day) with paired <italic>t</italic>-tests (continuous data) and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests (ordinal data) in R.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Dose–response relationships</title><p>For significant CpGs from the EWAS of discordant monozygotic twin pairs, we examined dose–response relationships in smoking concordant pairs (both twins were current smokers) by correlating within-pair differences in DNA methylation with within-pair differences in smoking packyears and cigarettes per day. All correlations reported in this paper are Pearson correlations. Secondly, in twin pairs discordant for former smoking (one twin never smoked and the other one is a former smoker), we correlated and plotted within-pair differences in DNA methylation with the time since quitting smoking to assess the relationship between time since quitting smoking and reversal of methylation differences within monozygotic twin pairs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Enrichment analyses</title><p>We used the EWAS Toolkit from the EWAS atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2019</xref>) to perform enrichment analyses of Gene Ontology Terms, Kegg pathways, and previously associated traits among top sites from the EWAS in discordant monozygotic twin pairs (current versus never). With the trait enrichment tool of the EWAS analysis, we tested for enrichment of all traits (680) that were present in the atlas on 26 April 2022. Because the software requires a minimum of 20 input CpGs, we selected the top 20 CpGs from the EWAS in discordant monozygotic pairs for the enrichment analyses using the EWAS toolkit.</p><p>To study overlap of EWAS signal with genetic findings for smoking, we compared our EWAS results against GWAS results from the largest GWAS meta-analysis of smoking phenotypes. This is the meta-analysis of smoking initiation by the GWAS and Sequencing Consortium of Alcohol and Nicotine use (GSCAN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). We obtained leave-one out meta-analysis results with NTR excluded. From the GWAS, we selected all SNPs with a p-value &lt;5.0 × 10<sup>−8</sup> and determined the distance of each Illumina 450k methylation site to each SNP. We then tested whether methylation sites within 1 Mb of genome-wide significant SNPs from the GWAS showed a stronger signal in the within-pair EWAS of smoking discordant monozygotic pairs compared to other genome-wide methylation sites, by regressing the EWAS test statistics on a variable (GWAS locus) indicating if the CpG is located within a 1 Mb window from SNPs associated with smoking initiation (1 = yes, 0 = no):<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mfenced open="|" close="|" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mfenced open="|" close="|" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> represents the absolute <italic>t</italic>-statistic from the paired <italic>t</italic>-test comparing within-pair methylation differences in smoking discordant pairs and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> represents the estimate for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, that is the change in the <italic>t</italic>-test statistic associated with a one-unit change in the variable <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (e.g. being within 1 Mb of SNPs associated with smoking initiation).

To this end, we used an independent whole-blood RNA-sequencing dataset from the Biobank-based Integrative Omics Study (BIOS) consortium that did not include NTR, and tested associations between genome-wide CpGs and transcripts in cis (&lt;250 kb), as described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">the BIOS Consortium et al., 2017</xref>). In short, methylation and expression levels in whole-blood samples (<italic>n</italic> = 2101) were quantified with Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays and with RNA-seq (2 × 50 bp paired-end, Hiseq2000, &gt;15 M read pairs per sample). For each target CpG (epigenome-wide significant differentially methylated positions [DMPs]), we identified transcripts in cis (&lt;250 kb), for which methylation levels were significantly associated with gene expression levels at the experiment-wide threshold applied by this study (False Discovery Rate (FDR) &lt;5.0%), after regressing out methylation Quantitative Trait Locus (mQTL) and expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) effects. We also examined whether significant CpGs from the EWAS of discordant monozygotic twin pairs mapped to genes that were previously reported to be differentially expressed in monozygotic pairs of which one twin never smoked, and the other was a current smoker at the time of blood sampling (based on Affymetrix U219 array data; <italic>n</italic> = 56 pairs; note: the 53 discordant pairs included in the current study of DNA methylation are a subset of the 56 discordant pairs included in the study of gene expression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vink et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Descriptives of the smoking-discordant and concordant monozygotic twin pairs are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. In twin pairs discordant for current smoking status (i.e. one twin a current smoker at the time of blood sampling and the other never initiated regular smoking, <italic>N</italic> = 53 pairs, mean age = 33 years), the smoking twin on average smoked 8.9 cigarettes per day at the time of blood sampling, and had an average smoking history equivalent to 6.8 packyears. The EWAS analysis in pairs discordant for current smoking status identified 13 epigenome-wide significant (p &lt; 1.20 × 10<sup>−7</sup>) DMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Genome-wide test statistics were not inflated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

For example, at top CpG site cg05575921, for 51 out of the 53 pairs, the smoking twin had a lower methylation level than the non-smoking twin. At 11 of the 13 CpGs, the methylation difference in smoking discordant monozygotic twin pairs was smaller (on average 19.0%, range = 2.2–37.5%) compared to the methylation difference reported previously in an EWAS meta-analysis of smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Joehanes et al., 2016</xref>).

Monozygotic pairs concordant for current smoking also show notable within-pair differences at these CpGs that are substantially larger compared to monozygotic pairs concordant for never smoking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

We exploited a strong within-family design, that is, the discordant monozygotic twin design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bell and Spector, 2012</xref>), to identify smoking-reactive loci. By analysing whole-blood genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in 53 monozygotic pairs discordant for current smoking, we found 13 CpGs with a difference in methylation level between the current smoking twin and the twin who never smoked. All 13 CpGs have been previously associated with smoking in unrelated individuals and in line with previous studies that compared unrelated smokers and controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Joehanes et al., 2016</xref>), our data from monozygotic pairs discordant for former smoking also indicate that methylation patterns are to a large extent reversible upon smoking cessation. We further showed that differences in smoking level exposure for monozygotic twins who are both current smokers but differ in the number of cigarettes they smoke are reflected in their DNA methylation profiles.</p><p>The strongest smoking-associated loci typically detected in human blood EWAS are genes involved in detoxification pathways of aromatic hydrocarbons, such as <italic>AHRR</italic> and <italic>CYP1A1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2015</xref>), of which <italic>AHRR</italic> was also present among the top differentially methylated loci in our analysis of discordant twin pairs. Mainstream tobacco smoke is a mixture of thousands of chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rodgman and Perfetti, 2008</xref>). Although the effects of many of the compounds present in cigarette smoke are unknown, several mechanisms have been described through which cigarette smoking may affect global or gene-specific DNA methylation levels. These include DNA damage induced by certain compounds such as arsenic, chromium, formaldehyde, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and nitrosamines that all cause double-stranded breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Smith and Hansch, 2000</xref>) (which causes increased methylation near repaired DNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mortusewicz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cuozzo et al., 2007</xref>), hypoxia induced by carbon monoxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Olson, 1984</xref>) (causing global CpG island demethylation by disrupting methyl donor availability), and modulation of the expression level or activity of DNA-binding proteins, such as transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee and Pausova, 2013</xref>). Nicotine, presumed to be the major addictive compound in cigarette smoke (although other putative addictive compounds have also been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Talhout et al., 2011</xref>]), has gene regulatory effects. Binding of nicotine to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors causes downstream activation of cAMP response element-binding protein, which is a key transcription factor for many genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shen and Yakel, 2009</xref>). In mouse brain, nicotine downregulates the DNA methyl transferase gene <italic>Dnmt</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Satta et al., 2008</xref>). Previous EWAS studies based on blood cotinine levels, as a biomarker for nicotine exposure, and based on a polygenic scores for nicotine metabolism, reported differentially methylated CpGs that largely overlap with CpGs found in EWAS of smoking status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gupta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, E-cigarette-based nicotine exposure of mice has been shown to cause DNA methylation changes in white blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peng et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, effects of smoking on DNA methylation in brain cells have been hypothesized to contribute to addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zillich et al., 2022</xref>), but it is largely unknown to what extent addiction-related DNA methylation dynamics are captured in other tissues such as blood. Nicotinic receptors are especially abundant in the central and peripheral nervous system, but are also present in other tissues. In peripheral blood, nicotinic receptors are present on lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benhammou et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that EWA studies performed on blood cells might capture nicotine-reactive methylation patterns. Interesting in this regard is our finding that among the top differentially methylated CpGs in smoking discordant pairs are multiple CpGs in <italic>CACNA1D and GNG12</italic>, which encode subunits of a calcium voltage-gated channel and G protein, respectively; proteins that interact with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and the related enrichment of Kegg pathway dopaminergic neuron. Methylation levels at these CpGs might be reactive to nicotine exposure. Furthermore, the CpGs in <italic>CACNA1D</italic> are in proximity of a GWAS locus for smoking initiation, suggesting that this might be a locus that is not only reactive to smoking exposure, but may also contribute to smoking behaviour. Although it remains to be established if the epigenetic and genetic variation at this locus are functionally connected (i.e. have the same downstream consequences on gene expression), these results suggest that these CpGs can be interesting candidates for further studies into peripheral biomarkers of smoking addiction. Since we applied a discordant monozygotic twin design, the methylation differences identified at this locus in our study cannot be driven by mQTL effects of the SNPs associated with smoking. The data from monozygotic pairs discordant for former smoking indicate that methylation patterns are to a large extent reversible upon smoking cessation, which is in line with DNA methylation patterns being reactive to smoking. Nevertheless, our findings do not rule out that the possibility that reverse causation (DNA methylation driving smoking behaviour) might also contribute to the (maintenance of) smoking discordance in smoking discordant monozygotic twin pairs. Future analyses combining DNA methylation and genetic data from monozygotic and dizygotic twins may be applied to examine bidirectional causal associations between DNA methylation and smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Minică et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The main strength of our study is the use of the discordant monozygotic twin design to examine the effects of smoking, because it rules out genetic confounding, as well as many other confounding factors. The value of studying smoking effects against an identical genetic background is clear if one considers that one of the most strongly associated genetic variants for nicotine dependence is located in the DNA methyltransferase gene <italic>DNMT3B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hancock et al., 2018</xref>). This strongly implies a role for DNA methylation in nicotine addiction, but it also suggests that horizontal genetic pleiotropy might contribute to associations between DNA methylation and smoking in ordinary case–control EWASs, where differences in DNA methylation between unrelated smokers and non-smokers may reflect differences in genotype. Our analysis had adequate power to detect large effects (i.e., the top hits identified in typical smoking EWAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsai and Bell, 2015</xref>). These reflect only a small proportion, however, of all smoking-associated sites. In our analysis of 53 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for current versus never smoking, we detected 13 CpGs at genome-wide significance, which represent 0.5% of the total number of CpGs (2623) detected in the smoking meta-analysis of unrelated individuals (2433 current verus 6956 never smokers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Joehanes et al., 2016</xref>). The within-pair difference in smoking discordant monozygotic pairs was smaller compared to the effect size reported previously based on the comparison of unrelated smokers and non-smokers. Larger sample sizes are required to achieve adequate power to detect smaller effects. While the pattern of within-pair differences in current/never, current/former and former/never discordant monozygotic twin pairs was clearly in line with reversal of methylation patterns following smoking cessation, we did not find a strong correlation between within-pair differences in DNA methylation and time since quitting smoking in former smoking discordant pairs. If most reversal takes place gradually in the first view years after smoking cessation, it might require larger sample sizes of twin pairs discordant for recently quitting smoking to detect such a correlation. Larger samples sizes may be achieved by combining data from multiple twin cohorts in a meta-analysis.</p><p>Common limitations that apply to many EWA studies including ours are that we only analysed DNA methylation data from blood and that the technique used to measure DNA methylation only covers a small subset of all CpG sites in the genome. Another limitation is that information on smoking was obtained through self-report. We previously described smoking misclassification in this cohort based on blood levels of cotinine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van Dongen et al., 2018</xref>), a biomarker for nicotine exposure, that has been measured in a subset of the cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bot et al., 2013</xref>), which indicated a low misclassification rate. Plasma cotinine levels were available for 591 individuals classified as never smokers by self-report. Five of these individuals (0.8%) had cotinine levels ≥15 ng/ml, which is indicative of smoking, and thus indicates a misclassification of smoking status. In the current paper, we further showed that the correlation between cotinine levels in concordant current smoking pairs was similar to the correlation between self-reported number of cigarettes per day.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we studied reactiveness of DNA methylation in blood cells to smoking and reversibility of methylation patterns upon quitting smoking in monozygotic twins. Analyses in special groups such as monozygotic twins are valuable to validate results from large population-based EWAS meta-analyses, or to train more accurate methylation scores for environmental exposures that are not confounded by genetic effects. Our results illustrate the potential to utilize DNA methylation profiles of monozygotic twins as a read out of discordant exposures at present and in the past.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Melinda Aldrich as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by W Kimryn Rathmell as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jeff Craig (Reviewer #2); Jaakko Kaprio (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Request from Reviewing Editor:</p><p>One of the references cited by the authors (Allione et al., Plos One 2015) cites two papers (Andreoli et al. and Marcon et al) that utilize a study population collected and phenotyped with support from the tobacco industry, specifically by British American Tobacco. We request the Allione reference be annotated to indicate the study utilized data that was collected with support from the tobacco industry.<italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. There are several typos throughout that need to be corrected (extra words inserted, for example: line 208 says &quot;To the study the overlap…&quot; this should instead read &quot;To study the overlap…&quot;).</p><p>2. The EWAS analysis says that the linear regression analysis corrected for array row. It is unclear to this reviewer why one would correct for array row. Can this be clarified?</p><p>3. It is unclear whether the 5 significant CpGs that were identified using the discordant current-former twin pair design have been previously identified or if these are novel findings.</p><p>4. What type of correlation test was performed? Please add this detail.</p><p>5. Please write out the abbreviation for DMP the first time used in the manuscript.</p><p>6. Clarification regarding the time period that was asked about for smoking behaviors would be helpful. For example, the authors indicate current smokers were asked how many cigarettes per day they smoked, but no time period is provided. Same for former smokers. Also, this reviewer assumes the authors are referring to the average number of cigarettes were smoked per day. If the authors could clarify these points that would be useful for the reader.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Introduction, lines 111-112 &quot;They [identical twins] have been exposed to similar prenatal conditions&quot;: please expand to differentiating between shared and nonshared intrauterine exposures.</p><p>2. Results, lines 228-9 &quot;At four of the 13 CpGs, DNA methylation level in blood was associated with the expression level of nearby genes.&quot; Can you test whether this number would have been achieved by chance?</p><p>3. Results: could you compare average effect sizes with studies of singletons to test whether genetic identity attenuated any effects?</p><p>4. Results line 161 &quot;Genome-wide test statistics were not inflated&quot;: could you please explain how you came to this conclusion using Figure 2C, especially for those without experience os using this metric. Please also note that Figure 2C is too small to read even when viewed on an A4 page.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In the introduction, a recent review could also be cited (Heikkinen A, Bollepalli S, Ollikainen M. The potential of DNA methylation as a biomarker for obesity and smoking. J Intern Med. 2022 Sep;292(3):390-408.. PMID: 35404524).</p><p>2. Line 111, It should be noted that in MZ twins matching on early environment is not perfect, especially the prenatal environment with placentation and chorionicity effects (Martin et al., 1997, PMID: 9398838).</p><p>3. Line 163-164 How consistent was the difference within pairs? On average the smoking twin had lower methylation, but was this the case in all pairs?</p><p>4. Line 170 The average time since cessation was 9 years, but what was the variation (SD) and range. Did the authors define a minimum duration of smoking cessation for the smoker to be considered as a true former smoker. Persons who report very recent quitting are often found to continue some level of smoking (based on biomarkers).</p><p>5. Line 190 -191 The intrapair correlations of amount (CPD) and total exposure (packyears) within twin pairs in which both smoke are consistent with prior literature.

Your revised article has been evaluated by W Kimryn Rathmell (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>– In their rebuttal, the authors mention cigs per day was measured at the present time for current smokers and for former smokers no time period was requested. This leaves it vague as to the time period the former smoker respondents provided, e.g. was it on average over the time smoked or during the last year they smoked? A brief acknowledgment should be included that the time period was not captured when assessing cigs per day for former smokers. Thus, it was left to the respondent to determine the time period, which could lead to variation in reporting by respondents.</p><p>– The authors corrected smoking status using longitudinal survey data but did not indicate that they made these corrections in the revised manuscript, only in the rebuttal. This detail should be included for transparency. Related to this, the authors provide in their response and revised manuscript the cotinine levels for a large subset of the never smoking participants. For most, the cotinine levels were consistent with amounts expected for never smokers, but there were 5 (0.8%) persons that had cotinine levels indicative of a current smoker. Can the authors confirm corrections to smoking status were not made with cotinine? Or if they were corrected, this should be mentioned in the manuscript.</p><p>– Line 574 has a typo: ‘low classification rate’ should read ‘low misclassification rate’.</p><p>– In the initial review, one of the reviewers asked for information about the statistical test for inflation of the GWAS results. The authors indicate in their response that a sentence was added to the manuscript about this inflation factor, but it appears this sentence may have been mistakenly omitted from the manuscript.</p><p>– In the prior review, it was requested the authors remove the phrase &quot;smoking discordant monozygotic twins&quot; and instead refer to pairs. They made the requested revision, but then added it back into one of their revised sentences (line 369). This should be adjusted to address the reviewer's comment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83286.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Request from Reviewing Editor:</p><p>One of the references cited by the authors (Allione et al.

It is unclear to this reviewer why one would correct for array row. Can this be clarified?</p></disp-quote><p>Each Illumina 450k array contains 6 rows and 2 columns to fit 12 samples in total. Array row is a technical confounder with a linear effect on DNA methylation signals. This is connected to the technical procedure of fluorescent staining in which the arrays are placed in vertical orientation in the machine and fluorescent dye is injected at the top, resulting in a signal gradient across samples from the top to the bottom row of the array. Most of this effect (at the global level) is removed with normalization, however, probe-specific effects typically persist. Probe-specific effects of array row can be corrected for efficiently by including array row number as a covariate. It is common practice in Illumina DNA methylation array analysis to correct for array row (see for example the following reference on commonly used analysis strategies for epigenome-wide association studies https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1878-x; we have now cited this paper in our methods section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Clarification regarding the time period that was asked about for smoking behaviors would be helpful.

Also, this reviewer assumes the authors are referring to the average number of cigarettes were smoked per day. If the authors could clarify these points that would be useful for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that this was unclear. During the home visit, blood samples were collected and participants were interviewed. Thus, at blood draw, current smokers were asked how many cigarettes they smoked per day at present (at the moment of blood draw), with the simple question: “how many cigarettes do you smoke per day?” and former smokers were asked how many cigarettes per day they used to smoke (“how many cigarettes did you use to smoke per day?”). We’ve edited the following sentences to clarify this.</p><p>Page 15, line 383: “Current smokers were asked how many years they smoked and how many cigarettes per day they smoked at present, while ex-smokers were asked how many years ago they quit, for how many years they smoked and how many cigarettes per day they smoked.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

We’ve added SD and range of quitting smoking. We did not apply a threshold for minimum duration of reported quitting smoking.

One could argue that the exact amount (or brand) smoked is not only subject to genetic influences but is an individual habit that is also influenced by the unique environment, individual life trajectories of the twins and potentially by differences in nicotine metabolic rate.

Are they considered non-smokers, smokers or excluded?</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed have used the longitudinal surveys to compare (and correct, if necessary) the smoking status at blood draw with smoking status from longitudinal NTR. In case of in consistencies, smoking status has been adjusted. Out of 9628 participants of the NTR biobank 1 project, smoking status at blood draw was consistent with longitudinal surveys for 97.1% of participants. The remaining 2.9% included the following cases: For 0.3% the status at blood draw has been adjusted based on checks against longitudinal surveys (e.g. the person reported to have never smoked at blood draw, while they reported smoking in longitudinal surveys). For 2%, blood status at blood draw was missing, and has been added from survey data. For 0.1%, smoking status was set to missing due to unresolvable inconsistencies (such participants are not included in our study because of missing smoking status). For 0.4%, the status at blood draw was missing and it could also not be retrieved from surveys due to insufficient information(these participants are also not included in our study).

We previously described smoking misclassification among individuals with DNA methylation data and cotinine levels in van Dongen et al. 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41539-018-0020-2): “Plasma cotinine levels were available for 591 individuals classified as never smokers by self-report.

Did smoking assess cigarette use only or all smoked tobacco products such as cigars and pipe use. What about smokeless tobacco/snus, e-cigs (rare at that time I believe) or nicotine replacement therapy as a source of nicotine?</p></disp-quote><p>We focused on cigarette smoking; we did not include questions on other ways to take in nicotine (like e-cigarettes or water pipe) or on cannabis use at the time of blood draw. Note that snus use is not common in the Netherlands (in particular not at the time when blood sampling was carried out) and that E-cigarettes have also increased in popularity only more recently. Furthermore, a survey on E-cigarette use in the Dutch population that was conducted in the time period when our study took place pointed out that individuals who reported the use of E-cigarettes primarily consisted of individuals who also smoked conventional cigarettes (Willemsen et al. De elektronische sigaret. Gebruik, gezondheidsrisico’s, en effectiviteit als stopmethode. Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. 2015;159:A9259.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. Line 406 uses the wording &quot; smoking discordant monozygotic twins&quot;.

We have corrected this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18. Line 432 The Bonferroni correction is overly conservative here as the CpG sites are correlated, so that should be taken into account.</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware that Bonferroni correction is stringent, and have now acknowledged this in the methods section:</p><p>“Statistical significance was assessed following stringent Bonferroni correction for the number of methylation sites tested (α = 0.05/411,169 = 1.2 x 10<sup>-7</sup>).”</p><p>Both Bonferroni correction and FDR are commonly applied in EWA studies. In our experience, Bonferroni correction, although perhaps slightly too stringent, produces the most robust results. For example, we previously reported that the replication rate across cohorts is much higher for Bonferroni-significant CpGs than it is for CpGs that meet FDR 5% (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1878-x).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19.

This leaves it vague as to the time period the former smoker respondents provided, e.g. was it on average over the time smoked or during the last year they smoked? A brief acknowledgment should be included that the time period was not captured when assessing cigs per day for former smokers. Thus, it was left to the respondent to determine the time period, which could lead to variation in reporting by respondents.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we asked participants the simple question “how many cigarettes did you use to smoke”. We have added a sentence on the inherit limitations of this question:</p><p>“Current smokers were asked how many years they smoked and how many cigarettes per day they smoked at present, while ex-smokers were asked how many years ago they quit, for how many years they smoked and how many cigarettes per day they smoked (note that the question on cigarettes per day to former smoker did not specify a particular time period, which may introduce variation in responses).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors corrected smoking status using longitudinal survey data but did not indicate that they made these corrections in the revised manuscript, only in the rebuttal. This detail should be included for transparency.</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that we did not feel that additions were necessary during revision because it was already stated in the first submission of the manuscript:</p><p>Page 9 “Data were checked for consistencies and missing data were completed by linking this information to data from surveys filled out close to the time of biobanking within the longitudinal survey study of the NTR.”</p><p>We had now added additional information that we included in the rebuttal letter to the supplementary information:</p><p>“Out of 9628 participants of the NTR biobank 1 project, smoking status at blood draw was consistent with longitudinal surveys for 97.1% of participants.
