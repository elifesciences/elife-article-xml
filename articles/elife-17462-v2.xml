Regeneration of adult skeletal muscle following injury occurs through the mobilization of satellite cells (SCs), a population of injury-sensitive quiescent muscle stem cells that activate, proliferate, differentiate, and fuse with injured myofibers. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckingham and Rigby, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>). In an adult skeletal muscle, SCs, characterized by expression of the paired box transcription factor Pax7 are mitotically quiescent and reside in a niche between the basal lamina and sarcolemma of associated muscle fibers. In response to muscle damage, SCs are activated and assume a myoblast identity, thereby initiating muscle repair. After massive proliferation, SC-derived myoblasts undergo differentiation and fusion to form myotubes that replace the damaged myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Comai and Tajbakhsh, 2014</xref>), while a subset of activated satellite cells downregulate MyoD, exit the cell cycle to replenish the muscle stem cell pool.</p><p>A large body of studies have shown that a family of four myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) regulating early skeletal muscle development also regulate the postnatal muscle regeneration program. These MRFs include the myogenic basic-helix-loop-helix type transcription factors MyoD and Myf5, which are recruited to skeletal muscle-specific genes regulatory regions, where they determine myogenic fate and initiate the differentiation cascade. Thereafter, MyoD increases the expression of late target genes in cooperation with myogenin and MRF4 through a feed-forward regulatory mechanism that regulates terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Penn et al., 2004</xref>). MRFs also enhance myogenic activity by interacting with other transcription factors, including Mef2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fong and Tapscott, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Molkentin and Olson, 1996</xref>).</p><p>Although the core MRF network that governs skeletal muscle regeneration and differentiation has been identified, the sequence of events within muscle-specific gene regulatory regions during differentiation is not fully understood. It is highly likely, for example, that the myogenic program driven by MRFs requires input from other transcription factors. More specifically, MRFs, including MyoD, may associate with other transcription factors that respond to microenvironmental cues and restrict the binding of MRFs to particular subsets of target enhancers. This would enable MRF complexes to context dependently regulate muscle genes governing the processes of myocyte differentiation and regeneration. Identification of these MRF partners is therefore important to clarify the mechanism by which MRF-containing transcriptional regulatory complexes achieve precise spatiotemporal regulation of their target genes.</p><p>Krüppel-like factors (Klfs) are a subfamily of zinc-finger transcription factors. All Klf proteins contain a DNA-binding domain consisting of three zinc fingers positioned at their carboxyl-terminal end, which enables their specific binding to 'GT-box' or 'CACCC' sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bieker, 2001</xref>). Several Klf members are involved in the control of skeletal muscle differentiation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prosdocimo et al., 2015</xref>). For instance, Klf3 is upregulated during skeletal muscle differentiation and transactivates the muscle creatin kinase (<italic>Mck</italic>) promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Himeda et al., 2010</xref>). Klf2 and Klf4 are also upregulated in differentiating muscle cells and promote muscle cell fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sunadome et al., 2011</xref>). Klf6 promotes and Klf10 inhibits myoblast proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dionyssiou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parakati and DiMario, 2013</xref>). Klf15 critically regulates skeletal muscle nutrient catabolism, contributing to the regulation of exercise capacity and muscle wasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haldar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shimizu et al., 2011</xref>). These studies demonstrate the pivotal involvement of Klfs in muscle biology. However, their role in the global transcriptional program of muscle differentiation remains unclear. Interestingly, Cao et al. previously showed that binding sites for Sp1, which is structurally related to Klfs and binds to similar GC-rich sequences, are highly enriched in MyoD-binding regions, which suggests there may be interaction between these two transcription factors.</p><p>Klf5 is reportedly involved in embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shindo et al., 2002</xref>), control of cellular proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fujiu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oishi et al., 2005</xref>), stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shindo et al., 2002</xref>), and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Klf5</italic> null embryos fail to develop beyond the blastocyst stage <italic>in vivo</italic> or to produce embryonic stem cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating that Klf5 is essential for maintenance of stemness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ema et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shindo et al., 2002</xref>). Klf5 is expressed in many cell types, including gut epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chanchevalap et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun et al., 2001</xref>), vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fujiu et al., 2005</xref>), adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oishi et al., 2005</xref>), neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yanagi et al., 2008</xref>) and leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2003</xref>). In smooth muscle cells, Klf5 regulates the genes involved in early processes of differentiation, including SMemb/NMHC-B and SM22α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Watanabe et al., 1999</xref>). Klf5 is also required for adipocyte differentiation. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, Klf5 is induced at an early stage of differentiation by C/EBPβ and δ, which is followed by expression of PPARγ<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oishi et al., 2005</xref>). We previously reported that Klf5 acts as a regulator of lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oishi et al., 2008</xref>). However, the role of Klf5 in skeletal muscle differentiation has not been characterized. In the present study, therefore, we investigated the role of Klf5 in skeletal muscle differentiation and regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Klf5 is highly expressed in differentiating myoblasts during muscle regeneration</title><p>To test the hypothesis that Klf5 is involved in skeletal muscle regeneration, we first examined tibialis anterior (TA) muscle from C57BL/6J wild-type mice with and without cardiotoxin (CTX)-induced skeletal muscle injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lepper et al., 2009</xref>).

Seven days after CTX-induced muscle injury, we observed ongoing muscle regeneration characterized by the presence of centrally located nuclei in regenerating fibers. At that time, expression of Klf5 remained very low in Pax7-positive, activated SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, middle panel, arrows). However, higher levels of Klf5 were detected in differentiating myocytes, which expressed myogenin 7 days after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lower panel, arrowheads). Klf5 was also detected within the centrally located nuclei of regenerating myofibers. These results indicate that Klf5 is markedly upregulated in differentiating myocytes and regenerating myofibers during the course of muscle regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>To examine Klf5 expression during muscle differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>, SCs were isolated from the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle from wild-type mice and placed in culture. After the first passage, nearly 100% of cells were MyoD positive, confirming the high purity of the muscle cell cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Over 70% of the purified cells were also positive for Pax7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> results, little or no Klf5 was detected in a fraction of the activated SCs expressing Pax7 and MyoD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, upper panel). Approximately 75% of Pax7-positive cells were also weakly positive for Klf5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Klf5 was induced in differentiating myoblasts exhibiting an absence or low Pax7 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). After differentiation for 2 days, Klf5 was strongly expressed in the nuclei of differentiating myotubes and co-localized with myogenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, middle panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, the strong Klf5 expression was transient, and by day 4 of differentiation it was undetectable in the nuclei of larger, fused myotubes that had also lost myogenin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, arrowheads). These <italic>in vitro</italic> observations indicate that Klf5 is induced in differentiating myoblasts during muscle differentiation and then downregulated in mature myotubes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Klf5 is required for muscle regeneration</title><p>The finding of temporal overlap between Klf5 expression and muscle regeneration and differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> prompted us to examine the role of Klf5 in SC-mediated muscle regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic>.

These genes are most likely direct MyoD targets and are highly enriched with myogenesis-related genes. The effect of <italic>Klf5</italic> knockdown on the expression of MyoD-regulated genes became more pronounced as the course of differentiation proceeded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and expression of those MyoD-regulated genes on day 3 was significantly decreased by <italic>Klf5</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>).

Approximately half of the Klf5 peaks had significant MyoD binding peaks in close proximity. An association with Mef2D was also observed in many Klf5 binding regions. Consistent with these findings, genome-wide binding profiles showed that there is significant overlap among the Klf5, MyoD and Mef2D cistromes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Among 4382 Klf5 peaks observed on day 5 post-differentiation, 757 loci (17.2%) were also bound by both MyoD and Mef2D, and another 1467 sites (33.4%) were bound by either MyoD or Mef2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Moreover, Klf5 binding to the MyoD and Mef2D binding peaks increased as differentiation progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, compare day 0 vs. day 2 and 5). Co-immunoprecipitation showed that Klf5 directly associated with MyoD and Mef2 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These results suggest that Klf5, MyoD and Mef2 work together to drive expression of a set of genes involved in myogenic differentiation.</p><p>Only a small fraction of the regions that had Klf5 binding before differentiation (day 0) had significant MyoD binding in close proximity after starting differentiation into myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). This is in contrast to the Klf5-bound regions on day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), which showed strong association with MyoD. The association of Klf5 with loci at which Klf5 was already bound before starting differentiation (day 0) was decreased or unchanged over the course of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). This was in sharp contrast to the association of Klf5 recruited after starting myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Collectively then, a majority of regions that increasingly acquire Klf5 binding during differentiation are also bound by MyoD in proximity to the Klf5 within myotubes. On the other hand, at many observed Klf5 binding regions in myoblasts, binding is decreased during differentiation and not associated with MyoD binding within myotubes. These results suggest that Klf5 has different targets and functions in myoblasts vs. myotubes. Because this study focuses on Klf5’s function during muscle differentiation and regeneration, we will characterize Klf5 binding mainly in myotubes.</p><p>Analysis of Klf5-bound motifs revealed that the top motif among the Klf5 cistrome matches the consensus of Krüppel-like factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). The Myf5 (E-box consensus bound by MRF, including MyoD) and Mef2D motifs were also identified in the de novo motif analysis, suggesting that colocalization of Klf5, MyoD and Mef2 are programmed by cis-regulatory logic. These results demonstrate a significant role for Klf5 in myogenic differentiation, acting in coordination with two other myogenic transcription factors, MyoD and Mef2.</p><p>To assess the functional significance of Klf5 in the regulation of muscle-specific target genes, we performed luciferase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). To eliminate effects of endogenous MyoD and Mef2D expression, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with Klf5, MyoD, Mef2D and <italic>Myog</italic> promoter-luciferase plasmids, which contained the proximal promoter region bound by Klf5, MyoD and Mef2 determined from each ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Moreover, Klf5, MyoD and Mef2D activated the <italic>Myog</italic> reporter additively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).

First, although expression of Klf5 protein remained low in Pax7<sup>+</sup> quiescent and activated SCs, Klf5 was significantly induced in myoblasts differentiating after skeletal muscle injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Second, SC-specific deletion of <italic>Klf5</italic> markedly impaired muscle regeneration after injury due to a failure of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which confirmed the pivotal involvement of Klf5 in muscle regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic>. Third, suppressed differentiation into myotubes was observed in <italic>Klf5</italic>-null C2C12 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), after specific <italic>Klf5</italic> knockdown <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) and SCs from Klf5 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Fourth, inhibition of Klf5 affected transcriptional regulation of muscle-related genes by MRFs, including MyoD and myogenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Collectively, these observations indicate that Klf5 is an essential component of the transcriptional regulatory network governing muscle differentiation and regeneration.</p><p>The molecular mechanism underlying muscle regeneration recapitulates many aspects of the process of muscle development. In particular, many of the transcription factors that control embryonic myogenesis also contribute to adult regenerative myogenesis. When a muscle is injured, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), released from the basal lamina of the injured muscle triggers SC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tatsumi et al., 1998</xref>). The activated SCs migrate and rapidly proliferate to give rise to Pax7<sup>+</sup>Myf5<sup>+</sup> cells, which activate the MRF cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooper et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuang et al., 2007</xref>). Our present results indicate that Klf5 is induced in myoblast-committed, non-dividing Pax7<sup>low</sup>MyoD<sup>+</sup> SCs after they are triggered to differentiate into myocytes. Likewise, <italic>Klf5</italic> mRNA remained low in C2C12 myoblasts and SCs cultured in growth media. <italic>Klf5</italic> is greatly upregulated only after switching to differentiation media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). In differentiating myoblasts Klf5 is required for expression of <italic>Myog</italic> and muscle-specific genes. Given that Klf5 enhances binding of MyoD to its target sites, these findings collectively suggest that Klf5 is an important regulator that links the early specification program driven by MyoD and Myf5 to the late myotube formation and maturation program driven by myogenin and Mrf4.</p><p>To further elucidate the regulatory function of Klf5 in myogenesis, it will be important to determine how Klf5 expression is induced during myocyte differentiation and regeneration. Klf5 is reportedly induced in response to external/endogenous stimuli through various signaling cascades, including p38MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nandan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oishi et al., 2010</xref>), ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawai-Kowase et al., 1999</xref>) and IL-1β/HIF-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mori et al., 2009</xref>). We previously showed that the p38MAPK pathway controls upregulation of Klf5 in response to angiotensin II in smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oishi et al., 2010</xref>). The p38MAPK pathway is activated immediately after the onset of myogenic differentiation and muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2007</xref>), and is essential for myoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gonzalez et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, genome-wide transcriptome analysis of SCs with muscle-specific p38α deletion or C2C12 cells treated with a p38 MAPK inhibitor revealed that p38α is responsible for induction of Klf5 during myoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Segales et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, that study also showed that inhibiting p38 signaling does not affect expression of MyoD. It therefore seems likely that Klf5 is an essential component of the transcriptional machinery activated by p38 MAPK during myogenic differentiation. A previous study showed that Klf2 and Klf4 are induced by ERK5 signaling and contribute to muscle cell fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sunadome et al., 2011</xref>). Microarray analyses in that study indicate that Klf5 expression is not affected by inhibition of ERK5 signaling (GSE25827). This is in agreement with our previous observations that Klf5 expression was unaffected by a MEK inhibitor in smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oishi et al., 2010</xref>). These findings indicate that members of Krüppel-like factor family differentially contribute to different processes during muscle differentiation and maturation. That said, it is possible that the loss of Klf5 is compensated by other Klf members, as we observed modest changes in the expression of other Klfs in Klf5-deficient C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Future studies of possible cooperation and competition among Klf members will be important for elucidating their functional roles in muscle biology. In addition, we found that exogenous Klf5 increased the level of eMyHC in Klf5-deleted C2C12 myotubes, but did not fully recapitulate the normal level of eMyHC expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This insufficient rescue may reflect differences between endogenous and exogenous Klf5, including the levels and timing of Klf5 expression. In the control cells, for example, Klf5 was transiently upregulated early during differentiation, but this temporal regulation of Klf5 was lost in cells in which exogenous Klf5 was stably expressed. Future studies will also need to address the temporal regulation of Klf members during muscle differentiation and regeneration.</p><p>Our ChIP-seq results indicate that deletion of Klf5 impairs recruitment of MyoD. This demonstrates that Klf5 is required for formation of MyoD-containing transcriptional regulatory complexes in at least a subset of the MyoD cistrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Recent studies have identified several transcription factors that interact with MyoD. For instance, Runx1 is induced in response to muscle injury and acts cooperatively with MyoD and c-Jun to regulate muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Umansky et al., 2015</xref>). TEAD4 is another factor reportedly recruited and bound to the locus also occupied by MyoD during the course of myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benhaddou et al., 2012</xref>). Inhibition of Runx1 or TEAD4 suppresses myogenic differentiation and regeneration, suggesting those two transcription factors, together with MyoD, are necessary to drive muscle regeneration. Of interest, we observed the sequence motif bound by Runx to rank 4th and the MCAT motif bound by TEAD4 to rank 6th among the de novo motifs identified in regions bound by Klf5 in myotubes differentiated for 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and data not shown). These data suggest that Klf5 promotes myogenic differentiation by interacting with multiple transcription factors, including MyoD, Mef2, Runx1 and TEAD4. It is likely these transcription factors are differentially regulated in response to different environmental cues and/or endogenous signaling. Accordingly, the interplay between these multiple factors would enable spatiotemporal regulation and fine tuning of muscle-related gene expression. It would be important to further clarify the logic of transcriptional regulation by these multiple transcription factors. It would also be worth noting that there appears to be a complex cross-regulation of the expression of these factors. For instance, in addition to myogenin, Klf5 appears to regulate TEAD4 because there were Klf5 binding peaks in the vicinity of the genes in our ChIP-seq, and <italic>Klf5</italic> knockdown reduced TEAD4 levels (data not shown). In addition, based on a published microarray analysis of effects of an individual Mef2 isoform (GSE63798) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Estrella et al., 2015</xref>) and our results from smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oishi et al., 2010</xref>), it appears Klf5 is regulated by Mef2A. This reciprocal regulation of Klf5 and other myogenic transcription factors support the notion that Klf5 is a component of an intricate transcription factor network that regulates muscle differentiation and regeneration.</p><p>In addition to MyoD and Mef2 identified in the present study, Klf5 has been shown to interact with various other transcription factors and cofactors. For instance we showed that Klf5 interacts with C/EBΒβ and δ to regulate adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oishi et al., 2005</xref>), interacts with PPARδ to regulate lipid metabolic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oishi et al., 2008</xref>), and interacts with C/EBPα to control the response to renal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujiu et al., 2011</xref>). Klf5 also interacts with unliganded RAR/RXR to induce phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fujiu et al., 2005</xref>). By taking advantage of this mechanism, we showed that an RAR agonist can inhibit induction of Klf5 target genes, thereby suppressing smooth muscle cell proliferation and neointima formation. We may therefore be able to manipulate the muscle regeneration program by altering the activity of Klf5 through its interacting partners. In sum, our results provide evidence that during skeletal muscle regeneration and myoblast differentiation, Klf5 regulates the expression of late muscle-specific genes in concert with MyoD and Mef2. This finding suggests that it will be of interest to investigate this pathway further with respect to the control of muscle regeneration. It would also be interesting to know whether Klf5-mediated pathways are involved in such pathological conditions as sarcopenia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Klf5<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takeda et al., 2010</xref>) were crossed with <italic>Pax7<sup>CreERT2/+</sup></italic> mice (Abbreviated <italic>Pax7<sup>CE/+</sup></italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lepper et al., 2009</xref>]) to generate <italic>Pax7<sup>CE/+</sup>;Klf5<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice.

For MyoD ChIP in CRISPR-engineered cells, cells differentiated for 3 days were used. Cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M and incubating for 10 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cell pellet was lysed in ice-cold Cell Lysis Buffer, incubated on ice for 10–20 min and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The pellet was further lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min. The resultant cell lysate was sonicated using an ultrasonicator (output 50, 30-s pulses then 1-min pause × 13 times; UD-100: TOMY Seiko, Tokyo, Japan). The chromatin was then pre-cleared by incubating with Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma- Aldrich) for 2 hr at 4°C with constant rotation. After centrifugation, anti-MyoD or anti-Klf5 antibody was added and rotated overnight at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose 4B fast flow (BD) was then added and incubated for 1 hr at 4°C with constant rotation. Thereafter, the beads were washed 4 times with RIPA buffer, 6 times with LiCl buffer and 3 times with TE buffer, then eluted with 2% SDS solution. After reverse cross-linking at 65°C overnight, the chromatin immunoprecipitate and Input were treated with RNase (37°C, 1 hr) and Proteinase K (42°C, 1 hr).

Peak calling and annotation was performed using HOMER version 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) for MyoD and Klf5, and using MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) for Mef2D. Peaks that overlapped blacklisted regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>) or simple repeat regions were removed. Homer-identified MyoD and Klf5 peaks with scores ≥20 were considered high confidence binding sites and used for further analyses, except for detection of MyoD peaks in the vicinity of Klf5 peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. To make a set of potential MyoD-regulated genes, RefSeq genes that contained MyoD peaks within a region −1500 bp from TSS to +1500 bp from TTS were first chosen. Then genes whose normalized counts were increased ≥2-fold in C2C12 myotubes relative to those in myoblasts were selected. The resultant MyoD target gene set contained 753 RefSeq genes. This gene set was highly enriched in GO terms related to muscle differentiation. All RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data are available in the GEO under the accession number GSE80812. To identify enriched motifs in ChIP-seq peaks, we used Homer’s findMotifsGenome.pl software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample sizes were not based on power calculations.

eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Klf5 regulates muscle differentiation by directly targeting muscle-specific genes in cooperation with MyoD&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mukesh Jain (Reviewer #1); Atsushi Asakura (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study Hayashi and colleagues report the novel finding that KLF5, a zinc-finger transcription factor, regulates myogenesis by controlling muscle specific gene expression in cooperation with MyoD. The experimental work is well executed and the manuscript is clearly written. However a number of points need to be addressed, some of which require additional experimentation.</p><p>1) The authors should show that KLF5 is an active transcription factor for myogenesis when associated with MyoD and MEF2. For this, the authors should examine a reporter assay such as Myogenin-promoter-luciferase which is known to be regulated by MyoD and MEF2. Co-transfection experiments should be done for MyoG-Luc with Klf5, MyoD and MEF2.</p><p>2) The relationships between MyoD occupancy, KLF5 occupancy and gene expression changes are not well defined. For example, it appears that a substantial fraction of MyoD-regulated genes have higher expression with KLF5 reduction. Is MyoD binding increased at these genes, which are essentially ignored in the text? Moreover, the relationship between altered MyoD binding and changes in gene expression with KLF5 reduction are not fully delineated. Is reduced gene expression always associated with reduced MyoD binding?</p><p>The following comments (3-5) are related to this point:</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, why use siRNA instead of the CRISPR lines, which are complete knockouts? The set of genes that are impacted by Klf5 deletion appears small to moderate in size, not &quot;global&quot; as stated in the text. Is there some defining feature of this set and how were the genes with increased expression with KLF5 reduction different than those with decreased expression? The increased expression set should be addressed here and elsewhere.</p><p>4) Given that the authors are using a published MyoD dataset in which a similar motif (Sp1) was defined, some comparison/explanation of the motif analysis would appear to be in order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, the paper from which the published ChIP-seq data is extracted has various timepoints and it is not clear which time point is shown – certainly not a later timepoint, which is confusing, as the main point is that KLF5 goes up and influences MyoD over time.</p><p>5) What is the scale for relative read number in the ChIP-seq shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>? How does the quality (and the identified MyoD binding sites) compare with the published dataset used earlier? How many days into differentiation is this? Why is MyoD binding globally down whereas only a subset of MyoD targets exhibit disrupted regulation in the RNA-seq data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>? What is the overlap between reduced MyoD binding sites in the Klf5 KO cells and the KLF5 ChIP-seq data sets? Could the two MyoD ChIPs (i.e. WT and Klf5 KO) be of different quality rather than reflective of biological differences?</p><p>Additional points:</p><p>6) Overall knockout and knockdown experiments were done with C2C12 cells. Please check that similar results are obtained using Klf5 KO primary myoblasts.</p><p>7) For completeness the authors should verify that MEF2 protein is also unaffected in the setting of Klf5 deletion.</p><p>8) The presence of other KLF family members might partially compensate for the differentiation defect of Klf5 KO cells. Please show data on the expression of other Klf gene family members during myogenic differentiation or at least discuss this further citing existing data. The authors mention KLF2/4 in the context of muscle fusion but there are others that have been linked to skeletal muscle biology and it is important to provide this background.</p><p>9) The murine pictures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) do not really appear to support the conclusions that are stated in the text and in the legend. The change in Klf5 expression does not appear to be very dramatic, nor is the small set of images shown without quantification sufficient to support the notion that Klf5 expression specifically increases with regeneration and concomitant with myogenin expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. More quantitation is necessary. The C2C12 data are much more clear.</p><p>10) In relation to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, It is stated in the text that no effect of tamoxifen is seen until 28 days without injury. It would appear critical to show the effect of losing KLF5 on normal muscle morphology at this time point. There is also no methodology described for how muscle size was quantified in terms of mouse number, sections examined etc., and there are no SDs shown on the graph. Given the heterogeneity in mouse injury from experiment to experiment, &quot;n of 3&quot; is a limited number to conclude that &quot;representative data&quot; are shown. In addition, no data are shown to verify that injury was similar at early time points in a set of control and Klf5 KO mice..</p><p>11) The level of MHC expression by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) seems very low in the normal cells in comparison to the robust immunostaining. It is also surprising that no MHC is seen in the Klf5 KO cells, given the obvious (albeit reduced) MHC in the KO cells with immunostaining. This raises a concern about how representative the depicted blots are of MHC expression, a concern that is furthered by the clear expression of MHC in the KO cells on 3E. In addition, although the rescue of MHC expression by exogenous KLF5 in the CRISPR line is clear, it is also poor and incomplete and this should at least be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17462.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors should show that KLF5 is an active transcription factor for myogenesis when associated with MyoD and MEF2. For this, the authors should examine a reporter assay such as Myogenin-promoter-luciferase which is known to be regulated by MyoD and MEF2. Co-transfection experiments should be done for MyoG-Luc with Klf5, MyoD and MEF2.</italic> </p><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s valuable suggestions. We agree there is a need for functional assays. We have performed reporter assays by transfecting a <italic>Myogenin</italic> promoter-luciferase construct along with Klf5, MyoD and Mef2D expression plasmids, as suggested by the reviewer. This reporter construct is composed of ~3.8 kb of the myogenin 5’-flanking region, which contains the region bound by Klf5, MyoD and Mef2D, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. The reporter assay showed that the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter was activated by Klf5 alone, and addition of MyD and Mef2D further activated the promoter, suggesting activating cooperation among Klf5, MyoD and Mef2D. This result is in agreement with the co-association of the three transcription factors to the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). The observations that <italic>Klf5</italic> knockdown reduced expression of many MyoD-target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and that MyoD association to the target sites was reduced by <italic>Klf5</italic> knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-B</xref>) suggest Klf5 mainly acts as a positive regulator of MyoD-driven gene expression and myogenesis.</p><p><italic>2) The relationships between MyoD occupancy, KLF5 occupancy and gene expression changes are not well defined. For example, it appears that a substantial fraction of MyoD-regulated genes have higher expression with KLF5 reduction. Is MyoD binding increased at these genes, which are essentially ignored in the text? Moreover, the relationship between altered MyoD binding and changes in gene expression with KLF5 reduction are not fully delineated. Is reduced gene expression always associated with reduced MyoD binding?</italic> </p><p>As pointed out, expression of a number of genes was increased in <italic>Klf5</italic> knockdown cells on day 3. Among the 753 MyoD-target genes depicted as red points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, expression of 55 genes was increased by &gt;1.5-fold. As suggested, we analyzed MyoD binding to the MyoD binding sites within +/-1.5 kb of the genes that were upregulated or downregulated by <italic>Klf5</italic> knockdown. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1A</xref>, even in regions near the upregulated MyoD-target genes, MyoD density was decreased in <italic>Klf5</italic> knockout cells.</p><p>The precise mechanism by which expression of the genes upregulated by <italic>Klf5</italic> deletion was increased despite the reduced MyoD binding is not immediately clear. It is possible that other MRFs, such as Myf5, compensate for the reduced association of MyoD, as recently reported (Conerly M., Tapscott S. et al. Dev Cell36: 375, 2016). It is also possible that MyoD binding is dispensable for the activity of the enhancers. Another possibility is that MyoD negatively regulates the activity of enhancers. More importantly, proximity of an enhancer to a gene does not necessarily indicate a functional link between them.</p><p>As suggested, we analyzed MyoD binding to sites near all genes (not limited to the MyoD target genes) whose expression levels were decreased by &gt;1.5 fold in <italic>Klf5</italic> knockdown cells as compared with control cells on day 3. As shown by the red dots in the MA plot of MyoD counts at MyoD sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1B</xref>), binding was reduced at the majority of MyoD peaks near the downregulated genes, though a minor fraction of sites showed increased MyoD binding.</p><p>Because proximity of an enhancer to a gene does not necessarily indicate a functional link between them, it is not trivial to identify enhancers functionally linked to genes. Accordingly, we further analyzed the relationship between Klf5 and MyoD binding regardless the distance to genes. A new heatmap for Klf5, MyoD and Mef2D binding around the center of the top 1000 Klf5 binding peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) show that at the Klf5 peaks in myotubes (day 5) that had significant nearby MyoD peaks, Klf5 binding were increased during differentiation (day 0 to 5), which is evident in histograms of Klf5 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This co-association of MyoD and Klf5 is also shown by the histogram of Klf5 binding around the center of the MyoD peaks, in which Klf5 binding was increased as differentiation progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) In sharp contrast, a smaller fraction of top 1000 Klf5 peaks in myoblasts (day 0) had nearby MyoD peaks, and Klf5 binding was unchanged or decreased during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results suggest there are two subsets of Klf5 binding sites: those with increasing Klf5 binding during differentiation and those with decreasing Klf5 binding. The former is more strongly related to adjacent MyoD binding, while the latter is less associated with MyoD binding. Because of cooperation between Klf5 and MyoD during differentiation, <italic>Klf5</italic> deletion might have a stronger impact on the MyoD binding sites associated with increasing Klf5 binding. Indeed, <italic>Klf5</italic> deletion markedly reduced MyoD binding at the MyoD binding sites with increased Klf5 binding on day 5 as compared with that on day 0 (&gt;4-fold increased Klf5 counts within 400 bp around the center of MyoD binding peak), whereas <italic>Klf5</italic> deletion did not affect MyoD binding at the MyoD sites with decreased Klf5 binding (&gt;4-fold decreased Klf5 counts) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1C</xref>). These results demonstrate that <italic>Klf5</italic> deletion has a strong impact on the sites with increasing association with Klf5 and MyoD, and support the notion that Klf5 and MyoD cooperatively proceed during the muscle differentiation program. Though these analyses support our conclusions, extensive ChIP-seq and chromosome conformation capture analyses will be needed to further clarify relationships between enhancer activity and Klf5/MyoD binding, and enhancer activity and gene transcription. Moreover, the present study focuses on the Klf5’s function in myogenesis and regeneration. Accordingly, while we have added heatmaps of Klf5, MyoD and Mef2D and briefly discussed the increasing co-association of Klf5 and MyoD in differentiation, we decided not to add the analyses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17462.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histograms of MyoD tag densities around MyoD binding peaks proximal to MyoD target genes that were upregulated or downregulated (&gt;1.5-fold) by <italic>Klf5</italic> deletion.

The set of genes that are impacted by Klf5 deletion appears small to moderate in size, not &quot;global&quot; as stated in the text. Is there some defining feature of this set and how were the genes with increased expression with KLF5 reduction different than those with decreased expression? The increased expression set should be addressed here and elsewhere.</italic> </p><p>We chose to use cells transiently transfected with siRNA instead of the CRISPR lines because other transcription factors, including Klf family members, might compensate for the defect in <italic>Klf5</italic> in stable knockout cells, as pointed out in comment (8). We agree that the set of genes affected by <italic>Klf5</italic> deletion appears small to moderate in size. Our intention was to indicate that <italic>Klf5</italic> deletion had a wide impact on expression of genes related to myogenesis, because 1472 genes in the hallmark myogenesis gene set out of 12744 annotated transcripts were reduced &gt;1.5-fold in <italic>Klf5</italic> knockdown cells, and <italic>Klf5</italic> deletion severely affected myogenesis. However, we absolutely agree with the reviewer that the use of “globally” may cause unnecessary misunderstanding. Accordingly, we avoided the use of “globally” and revised the sentences accordingly.</p><p>As suggested we analyzed gene set enrichment in the genes upregulated by <italic>Klf5</italic> knockdown. The results indicate that no gene sets directly related to myogenesis was significantly enriched. This is presented in the revised manuscript and shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) Given that the authors are using a published MyoD dataset in which a similar motif (Sp1) was defined, some comparison/explanation of the motif analysis would appear to be in order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, the paper from which the published ChIP-seq data is extracted has various timepoints and it is not clear which time point is shown – certainly not a later timepoint, which is confusing, as the main point is that KLF5 goes up and influences MyoD over time.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for comments pointing out such important issues. The MyoD ChIP-seq dataset from a previously published paper (Cao et al. Dev Cell2010) used C2C12 cells differentiated into myotubes for 48 h. We chose it to analyze the co-association of MyoD and Klf5 in myotubes, because Klf5 was increasingly recruited to many MyoD-binding regions over the course of C2C12 differentiation (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-C</xref>). This is now more clearly presented in the figure legend.</p><p>In the present study we used Homer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://homer.salk.edu/homer">http://homer.salk.edu/homer</ext-link>) for de novomotif discovery. This program first assembles highly similar sequences as a single motif and then assigns the known motif that is most closely matched with the de novomotif. The rank 4 motif in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> most closely matched the KLF5 motif in Homer’s motif database. As pointed out, Sp and KLF family transcription factors bind to similar GC-rich sites, though their optimal binding sequences differ (Genomics87:474-482, 2006). The earlier paper (Cao et al. Dev Cell. 2010) identified a high affinity Sp1 site with a “CCGCCC” core sequence. Our rank 4 motif is GGG(C/T)G(T/G)GGCC, which may include “CCGCCC”, though the sequence better fits the known KLF binding consensus than the Sp1 motif. To better characterize the association of the Sp1 motif with MyoD binding sites, we analyzed appearance of the known Sp1 motif. The result indicates that the Sp1 motif is present in 4.9% of the MyoD-binding regions (<italic>P</italic>=1e-19). We added this result to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and indicate the use of Homer’s software in the Materials and methods. We have revised the section describing the results of the motif findings to better reflect the algorithm of Homer. We also clearly state that the identified Klf5 binding sequences may contain Sp1 binding sequences.</p><p><italic>5) What is the scale for relative read number in the ChIP-seq shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>? How does the quality (and the identified MyoD binding sites) compare with the published dataset used earlier? How many days into differentiation is this? Why is MyoD binding globally down whereas only a subset of MyoD targets exhibit disrupted regulation in the RNA-seq data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>? What is the overlap between reduced MyoD binding sites in the Klf5 KO cells and the KLF5 ChIP-seq data sets? Could the two MyoD ChIPs (i.e. WT and Klf5 KO) be of different quality rather than reflective of biological differences?</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the insufficient description of methods and experimental conditions. We performed MyoD ChIP-seq in <italic>Klf5</italic>-knockout C2C12 cells generated using the CRISPR-Cas9 method. As a control, we used C2C12 cells transfected with CRISPR-Cas9 endonuclease coupled with paired guide RNAs flanking the GFP sequence (GFP-targeted control). The cells were harvested 3 days after induction of differentiation for ChIP-seq analysis. We have expanded the experimental procedure section to address these issues (subsection “Klf5 is required for myoblast differentiation”, second paragraph).</p><p>Because ChIP-seq of MyoD in <italic>Klf5</italic> knockout and control cell lines in the original manuscript had less than 10 million mapped reads (5,047,433 and 8,016,529 mapped reads, respectively), we repeated the sequencing to increase the sequence depth. Now the numbers of mapped reads are comparable with the previously published data (Cao Y. et al) used to identify MyoD binding regions. Still, the number of MyoD peaks (2,225) that were identified using the CRSPR-GFP-control cells, is smaller than the number of MyoD-binding peaks (12,769) identified using the published data. However, 86% of our MyoD peaks overlapped with the MyoD peaks in the published data.</p><p>Moreover, the heatmap for MyoD binding shows a strong similarity (please see Figure III). Clearly, our ChIP-seq reads are enriched at the MyoD peaks identified by the published MyoD ChIP-seq. However, the peak intensity was generally lower in our MyoD ChIP-seq than that in the published data, which appears to be one reason why our ChIP-seq identified only a subset of MyoD peaks. A number of technical differences are likely to affect the quality of ChIP-seq. For instance, the antibody we used was one commercially available from Santa Cruz and recognized the full length of mouse MyoD. By contrast, Cao et al. used three antibodies developed in their lab that recognized amino acids 160-307, 60-219 and 3-318 of mouse MyoD (Cao Y et al. Dev Cell18: 662, Tapscott, SJ et al. Science242: 405-11, 1988). This difference in antibodies likely contributes to the relatively low peak intensity in our ChIP-seq. That said, the very high overlap (86%) between our MyoD peaks and the MyoD peaks in the published data, and the very similar read distributions in the heatmap, indicate that the two antibody sets largely recognize the same regions.</p><p>Table</p><p><table-wrap id="tblu1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><p>Mapped reads</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>MyoD ChIP-seq (C2C12 cells differentiated into myotube for 48 h, Cao et al.

The observation that the lack of <italic>Klf5</italic> reduces MyoD binding was reproduced in the independent experiment, verifying that impaired MyoD recruitment reflects biological differences, but not a difference in the quality of MyoD ChIPs in control and <italic>Klf5</italic> knockout cells. These results are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>Among 735 MyoD target genes, the expression levels of 246 genes were decreased by &gt;1.5 fold in <italic>Klf5</italic> knockdown cells. Still, as pointed out, expression of many genes was unchanged or increased. The precise reason why MyoD binding was globally decreased while expression of many MyoD target genes was not decreased is not immediately clear. One possible explanation is that other MRFs, such as Myf5, compensate for the functional defect of MyoD, as recently published by Conerly M et al. (Dev Cell36:375, 2016). It is also possible that MyoD is dispensable for enhancer activity. Among the 753 MyoD-target genes depicted as red points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, expression of 55 genes was increased by &gt;1.5-fold, and 246 genes were decreased by &gt;1.5-fold. MyoD binding to regions proximal (+/- 1.5 kb of gene) to those upregulated and downregulated genes was similarly decreased in <italic>Klf5</italic> knockout cells (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2A</xref>). Interestingly, however, Klf5 binding to MyoD sites near MyoD-target genes upregulated by <italic>Klf5</italic> deletion was much lower than to sites near downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2B</xref>). This lesser association of Klf5 with MyoD-containing enhancers is also illustrated by the heatmap for Klf5 and MyoD binding around the center of the MyoD-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2C</xref>). These results suggest that the enhancers near the upregulated MyoD-target genes are likely to be indirectly affected by the loss of <italic>Klf5</italic>, though the precise regulatory mechanisms affecting the enhancer activity are not immediately clear. Given our current findings demonstrating the mechanistic importance of Klf5 on MyoD recruitment, we feel exploring this further is beyond the scope of the present paper, and that these issues should be addressed in our future studies.

We performed qRT-PCR to detect expression of other Klf family members in <italic>Klf5</italic> knockdown and control cell on day 3. Levels of Klf6, Klf13, Klf15, and Klf16 expression were modestly, but significantly increased in Klf5 knockdown cells on day 3.

In line with this, representative images of uninjured muscle sections were added to the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Klf5 was barely expressed in the quiescent satellite cells and in myonuclei in the intact muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, upper panel). We have also added a figure showing levels of Klf5 mRNA expression over the course of muscle regeneration. Klf5 expression was markedly increased along with Myogenic factors such as Pax7, Myod1, Myogenin and Myh3 during muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p><italic>10) In relation to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, It is stated in the text that no effect of tamoxifen is seen until 28 days without injury. It would appear critical to show the effect of losing KLF5 on normal muscle morphology at this time point. There is also no methodology described for how muscle size was quantified in terms of mouse number, sections examined etc., and there are no SDs shown on the graph. Given the heterogeneity in mouse injury from experiment to experiment, &quot;n of 3&quot; is a limited number to conclude that &quot;representative data&quot; are shown. In addition, no data are shown to verify that injury was similar at early time points in a set of control and Klf5 KO mice.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the insufficient description of the experimental methodology. Quantification of myofibers in immunostained tissue sections was performed as below: To analyze the distribution of fiber diameters, at least three individual sections from each of four <italic>Pax7<sup>CE/+</sup>;Klf5<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>and four or five (for day7 and 28, respectively) <italic>Pax7<sub>+/+</sub>;Klf5<sub>flox/flox</sub></italic>(control) mice were examined. Immunofluorescent images of laminin were acquired, after which the area surrounded by laminin signal in each cross-section was quantified using Olympus cellSense Digital Imaging software. In each mouse, the diameters of 1000 (for CTX day 7) or 500 (for CTX day 28) regenerating fibers that had centrally located myonuclei were analyzed. This is now stated in the experimental procedure.</p><p>As pointed out, we observed certain histological differences among the mice in the same experimental group. However, the difference between wild-type and <italic>Klf5</italic> KO mice was clearly more pronounced than differences within the group. Muscle phenotypes after CTX-mediated injury, particularly the distribution of muscle diameters was similar among each group at each time point (day 7 and day 28). To better illustrate this, we show myofiber diameter in each mouse in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3</xref>. The graphs clearly show that in all three <italic>Klf5</italic> KO mice, the histogram of muscle diameters was shifted toward smaller diameters.

It is also surprising that no MHC is seen in the Klf5 KO cells, given the obvious (albeit reduced) MHC in the KO cells with immunostaining. This raises a concern about how representative the depicted blots are of MHC expression, a concern that is furthered by the clear expression of MHC in the KO cells on 3E. In addition, although the rescue of MHC expression by exogenous KLF5 in the CRISPR line is clear, it is also poor and incomplete and this should at least be discussed.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this important issue. We checked the specificity of the antibody for MHC and repeated the Western blot. New Western blot data with longer exposure is now provided in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. It indicates that MHC protein is expressed but at a lower level in <italic>Klf5</italic> knockout C2C12 cells than in GFP-targeted control cells, which is in line with the result of the immunostaining.</p><p>As pointed out, exogenous KLF5 expression did not fully recapitulate MHC expression in the control cells. This insufficient rescue may be due to the differences between endogenous and exogenous Klf5, including expression levels and timing of Klf5 expression. In the control cells, for instance, Klf5 is transiently upregulated early during differentiation. However, this temporal regulation of Klf5 is lost in cell expressing exogenous Klf5. Although the precise mechanisms are not immediately clear, we added these possible mechanisms to the Discussion, as suggested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
