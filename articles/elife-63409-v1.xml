The COVID-19 CoV Genetics tool (COVID-19 CG) can quickly provide information on which virus mutations are present in an area during a specific period. It does this by processing data on mutations found in viral genetic material collected worldwide from hundreds of thousands of people with COVID-19, which are hosted in an existing online database. The COVID-19 CG tool presents customizable, interactive visualizations of the data.</p><p>Thousands of scientists, public health agencies, and COVID-19 vaccine and treatment developers in over 100 countries are already using the COVID-19 CG tool to find the most common mutations in their area and use it for research.

Numerous countries have mobilized to sequence thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes upon the occurrence of local outbreaks, collectively and consistently contributing more than 20,000 genomes per month (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). It is important to note that, despite the slow accumulation of potentially functional (nonsynonymous) mutations, there has been a steady increase in the number of variants with more than six nonsynonymous mutations compared to the WIV04 reference, an early genome of SARS-CoV-2 that was sampled in Wuhan in December 2019 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To evaluate the outcomes of anti-COVID-19 measures and detect keystone events of virus evolution, it is important to track changes in SARS-CoV-2 mutation and population dynamics in a location and date-specific manner. Indeed, several countries and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have recognized how critical it is to collect SARS-CoV-2 genomic data to support contact tracing efforts and to inform public health decisions – these are paramount to the re-opening of countries and inter-regional travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Collins, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gudbjartsson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Oude Munnink et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Virological, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rockett et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, the quantity and complexity of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data (and metadata) make it challenging and costly for the majority of scientists to stay abreast of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in a way that is meaningful to their specific research goals. Currently, each group or organization has to independently expend labor, computing costs, and, most importantly, time to curate and analyze the genomic data from GISAID before they can generate specific hypotheses about SARS-CoV-2 lineages and mutations in their population(s) of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To address this challenge, we built COVID-19 CoV Genetics (COVID-19 CG, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covidcg.org/">covidcg.org</ext-link>), a performant, interactive, and fully scalable web application that tracks SARS-CoV-2 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), lineages, and clades without sub-sampling.

For instance, as of December 2020, an S477N mutation in the receptor binding domain (RBD) has become dominant in Australia (69% of Australian SARS-CoV-2 genotypes, all time) although it constitutes less than 6% of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes globally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). SNV frequency in a given region can also shift over time, for example, an RBD N439K mutation not found in Ireland prior to July was present in 42% of the genomes collected mid-July through September, peaking in August and gradually fading after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Another rare RBD S477N mutation, which was found in only 1% of the Australian SARS-CoV-2 sequences before June, has constituted 84% of the sequenced June through December genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This geographical and temporal variation is important to incorporate into the design and testing of therapeutic antibodies (such as those under development as therapeutics by Regeneron that specifically target the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD), as well as mRNA or recombinant protein-based vaccines. This will help to assure developers of the efficacy of their therapeutics and vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 variants that are present in the intended location of implementation.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mutational frequencies in the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) across geographical location and time.</title><p>Screen captures from the Compare AA SNVs tab on December 29, 2020, are shown.

It will be crucial to watch for rare escape variants that could resist drug- or immune-based interventions to eventually become the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the community. This need was particularly emphasized by a Regeneron study that demonstrated that single amino acid variants could evolve rapidly in the SARS-CoV-2 spike to ablate binding to antibodies that had been previously selected for their ability to neutralize all known RBD variants; some of these RBD amino acid variations are already present at low frequency among human SARS-CoV-2 genomes globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baum et al., 2020</xref>). The authors, Baum et al., suggested that these rare escape variants could be selected under the pressure of single antibody treatment, and, therefore, advocated for the application of cocktails of antibodies that bind to different epitopes to minimize SARS-CoV-2 mutational escape. A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Greaney et al., 2021</xref> generated high-resolution ‘escape maps’ delineating RBD mutations that could potentially result in virus escape from neutralization by 10 different human antibodies. Based on lessons learnt from the rise of multidrug resistant bacteria and cancer cells, it will be of the utmost importance to continue tracking SARS-CoV-2 evolution even when multiple vaccines and therapeutics are implemented in a given human population.</p><p><italic>Diagnostics developers </italic>can evaluate their probe, primer, or point-of-care diagnostic according to user-defined regional and temporal SARS-CoV-2 genomic variation.

Users can also input custom coordinates or sequences to evaluate their own target sequences and design new diagnostics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Case study of SNVs that could impact the sensitivity of diagnostic primers</title><p>A recent preprint alerted us to the finding that a common G29140T SNV, found in 22.3% of the study’s samples from Madera County, California, was adversely affecting SARS-CoV-2 detection by the NIID_2019-nCoV_N_F2 diagnostic primer used at their sequencing center; the single SNV caused a ~ 30-fold drop in the quantity of amplicon produced by the NIID_2019-nCov_N_F2/R2 primer pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vanaerschot et al., 2020</xref>). We used COVID-19 CG to detect other SNVs that could impact the use of this primer pair, discovering that there are SARS-CoV-2 variants in several countries with a different C29144T mutation at the very 3’ end of the same NIID_2019-nCoV_N_F2 primer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The authors of the preprint, Vanaerschot et al. noted that SNVs could impact assay accuracy if diagnostic primers and probes are also being used to quantify viral loads in patients. We found that at least 10 other primer pairs could potentially be at risk in different geographical regions due to SNVs that appear proximal to the 3’ ends of primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–K</xref>): China-CDC-N-F and R; NIH, Thailand, WH-NIC N-F; US CDC 2019-nCoV-N1-R; US CDC 2019-nCoV-N2-F; ARTIC-V3_nCoV-2019_11_RIGHT; ARTIC-V3_nCoV-2019_13_LEFT; ARTIC-V3_nCoV-2019_34_LEFT; ARTIC-V3_nCoV-2019_39_LEFT (note that the ARTIC primers are used for nanopore sequencing; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tyson et al., 2020</xref>); WHO N_Sarbarco_R1; and Institut Pasteur, Paris 12759Rv.

We reiterate Vanaerschot et al.’s exhortation that SARS-CoV-2 detection strategies should ideally target multiple viral genes and check for concordant Ct values. In addition, scientists have cautioned against lab-specific errors that exist among the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes, often co-localizing with commonly used primer binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Turakhia et al., 2020</xref>).

Globally, the S477N mutation was first detected in a single sample of lineage B.1.1.25 that was collected on March 19, 2020, in Victoria, Australia, and became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the region between June and September (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In particular, the set of SNVs that co-occur with the S477N mutation in Australia (all time, as well as prior to May 2020 before the most recent outbreak) are different from the set of co-occurring SNVs in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) — suggesting that the S477N mutation occurred separately in the Australian and the UK lineages. However, COVID-19 CG only reflects data contributed to GISAID. Variants of interest could be present in other countries, but not yet known to the public because the sequencing centers in those countries have not collected or deposited their data in GISAID. Furthermore, in instances where only a singular, sporadic variant is detected (no sustained transmission), there is also the possibility of sequencing error resulting in incorrect lineage assignment. Due to these caveats, the genetic data must be used in combination with other types of data, such as from contact tracing efforts, before it is possible to draw conclusions about the international transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants. In the case of the S477N variant that is now dominating in Australia, the sequencing data alone indicate that the local transmission of this variant in Australia since March 2020 or earlier cannot be ruled out.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Frequency of the spike S477N mutation in Australia over time.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Image downloaded from the Compare SNVs tab of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covidcg.org/">covidcg.org</ext-link> on December 29, 2020: SARS-CoV-2 variants bearing the spike S477N mutation (also known as the G22992A SNV; depicted in purple), the majority of which lie in the B.1.1.25 lineage, had become the most prevalent form of SARS-CoV-2 in Australia in June through September 2020.

There are also websites aimed at helping users to check COVID-19 diagnostic primers and probes, for example, the SARS-CoV-2 target regions browser from the European Commission and the Status of SARS-CoV-2 detection systems (RT-PCR) browser from the University of Turin. GISAID also monitors and reports RBD mutations and assigns clades and lineages as well as genome quality. The current GISAID reports describe the geographical distribution of new mutations, total occurrence by country, mutations in commonly used diagnostics, and 3D structural maps of mutations in the four largest clades (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org/hcov19-mutation-dashboard/">gisaid.org/spike</ext-link>). GISAID additionally provides CoVsurver (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/covsurver-mutations-app/">gisaid.org/covsurver</ext-link>) for users to screen for potential phenotypic changes based on curated literature annotations; BLAST searches and large-scale phylogenetic trees and alignments; and a new functionality for tracking emerging variants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org/hcov19-variants/">gisaid.org/variants</ext-link>).</p><p>COVID-19 CG provides additional complementary functionalities to those that are available on the GISAID platform, as well as these other diverse COVID-19 public browsers. COVID-19 CG (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covidcg.org">https://covidcg.org</ext-link>) was built to help scientists and professionals worldwide, with varying levels of bioinformatics expertise, in their real-time analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genetic data. Mainly, COVID-19 CG enables users to track in real time, without sub-sampling, lineages, clades, and SNVs (nucleotide or amino acid) across the SARS-CoV-2 genome (or any genomic region of choice) while rapidly filtering on a user-friendly interface by geographical regions, date range, and other criteria of interest to the user. In this work, we explored several case studies that serve to highlight what users can quickly achieve using COVID-19 CG. As more detailed metadata is generated by COVID-19 studies and initiatives, we will update the application to enable filtering according to patient traits such as host species (e.g., human or mink), gender, age, ethnicity, and medical condition (e.g., symptoms, hospitalization). In addition, over the next year, as more mutations accumulate across the tens of millions of COVID cases worldwide, we plan to implement a server-client model for COVID-19 CG, where genomic data is filtered and processed on the server before being sent to the client for visualization. This change should significantly reduce the computational burden of COVID-19 CG on user’s computers, and allow our application to scale to a much larger number of genomes. Our team and colleagues continue to actively use the COVID-19 CG site to quickly generate hypotheses about COVID-19 before performing a deep analysis using the data on GISAID. We anticipate that novel questions will arise over the next year and intentionally designed COVID-19 CG (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covidcg.org">https://covidcg.org</ext-link>) to be modular in order to continually integrate different types of COVID-19 data and build in new features. Some of these functionalities exist on other platforms, and we recommend that scientists try each browser to find the one that best meets their needs.</p><p>SARS-CoV-2 public browsers such as COVID-19 CG and others we have highlighted here help scientists around the world to parse through large quantities of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data and metadata for the purposes of informing vaccine, therapeutics, and policy development. We advocate for decision makers around the world to sustain or accelerate their sequencing of virus genomes in their geographical area. Collecting virus genomic data is particularly relevant to regions that are experiencing increases in COVID-19 cases. If only sparse genomic data are sampled, we risk the late detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants that exhibit enhanced transmissibility, virulence or resistance against therapeutics or vaccination programs in these pandemic hotspots. Furthermore, the widespread implementation of vaccines and antibody therapies could stimulate the emergence and selection of new escape variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baum et al., 2020</xref>). To compound these risks, SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to minks (and in some cases back into humans) has already been detected at farms across at least 10 countries and one wild mink in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">OIE - World Organisation for Animal Health, 2020</xref>). This process of species crossing, if left unchecked, can risk the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into wild animal populations and the emergence of diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p><p>Coordinated sequencing and contact tracing efforts (e.g., in the United Kingdom, Singapore, the Netherlands, Italy, California, and Australia) emphasize the urgency of establishing open access platforms to evaluate trends in virus introduction into each country or region in real time. Local policymakers, public health researchers, and scientists can use global SARS-CoV-2 genetic data, in complementation with contact tracing data, to better understand which lineages were imported into their region (from which potential international locations), whether these were introduced multiple times, and if particular lineages are dying out or persisting. Labs in numerous countries are already making incredible efforts to sequence the SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in their local populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). When each country actively contributes to the database of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, this protects against sampling biases that can impact the ability to perform phylogenetic analysis and interpret global SARS-CoV-2 data. Toward this goal that affects all of humanity, we advocate for the increased sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from patients (and infected animals) around the world, and for these data to be shared in as timely a manner as possible.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Global statistics of SARS-CoV-2 genome data contribution to GISAID.</title><p>Interactive and more comprehensive versions of the figure panels are displayed on the Global Sequencing Coverage tab of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covidcg.org/">covidcg.org</ext-link>.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Miles Davenport as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Devermen and colleagues describe COVID-19 CG, a resource for information on SARS-CoV-2 data. They present several use cases demonstrating the utility of this resource. Given the nature of the pandemic, integration of datasets in easy to find and analyzable formats are of significant importance. While many other tools provide similar functionalities, covidcg is clearly useful to researchers and likely easier to use and more intuitive in specific use cases. Indeed, we note that one of us has made use of it for the specific purpose of tracking mutations by geographic location.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We had the following suggestions that we think you should find easy to address in a revised version:</p><p>The current interface / setup seems designed for the situation when there are relatively few mutation (e.g., you get a list of all mutations in a region and click on mutation of interest). This seems like it will become increasingly unwieldy as more and more mutations reach appreciable frequencies as the virus evolves. What is the plan to deal with this? Some mention of this point might be helpful in the Discussion.</p><p>The Abstract should have a link to the website: https://covidcg.org. This will make the resource easier to find and allow users to interact with it while reading the paper.</p><p>The authors should note many of the existing sequence resources available including: the UCSC SARS-CoV-2 browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/covid19.html) , the Wash U Genome browser (https://virusgateway.wustl.edu/), Nextstrain (https://nextstrain.org/) as well as the COG-UK efforts (https://www.cogconsortium.uk/, including CoV-GLUE and Pangolin which is cited, but only in the Materials and methods). These other tools are not competitors but rather complementary and researchers should be encouraged to use the tool that is easiest for them to use and makes the most sense for a specific analysis.

Currently, SNV data and metadata for all 300K+ SARS-CoV-2 genomes​ are sent directly to the browser and processed on the front-end, but we understand that this strategy is not sustainable in the long-term. Therefore, we plan to implement a server-client model for COVID-19 CG, where genomic data is filtered and processed on the server before being sent to the client for visualization. This change should significantly reduce the computational burden of COVID-19 CG on user’s computers, and allow our application to scale to a much larger number of genomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Abstract should have a link to the website: https://covidcg.org.

For this reason, we have maintained a page of links to other COVID browsers on the “Related Projects” part of the COVID-19 CG page (https://covidcg.org/?tab=related_projects#). We have now reworded that sentence in our manuscript as “are complementary to other existing public browsers (see Discussion)” and expanded our discussion of other browsers in response to the next related point. The four suggested citations have been included in this expanded Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to the above point, overall this is a useful resource, but the authors should be clear that many other resources are available and that the scientific community should use the best tools for a particular task to combat this pandemic.

We have now highlighted eight of these other resources, on top of the GISAID website, in the first paragraph of our Discussion. A full review that carefully and objectively weighs the strengths and uses of each of the available resources would also be valuable, but is beyond the scope of this article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With regard to the mutations that might disrupt primer binding sites the authors should compare them to problematic/masked sites that are almost certainly due to sequencing/assembly error (e.g. within ARCTIC primers) as they do not obey expected evolutionary patterns.

This problem is not straightforward to solve because it deals with lab-specific mutations, and the impact on the analyses on CG is not very clear. As the authors, Turakhia et al. noted, “genuine recurrent mutations that may contain important information about properties of viral evolution are sometimes hard to distinguish from recurrent systematic errors”. They identify numerous lab-associated variants and “recommend their removal prior to phylogenetic tree construction and many subsequent analyses”. Concerningly, this disproportionately affects “variants intersecting or immediately surrounding commonly used primer binding sites”. After much consideration, we believe that this issue should be addressed at the database level or that the specific labs for which this is a problem should be notified and advised on how to amend their data. We had considered masking these sites in the CG browser, but realized that it would throw out data from thousands of genomes that are not impacted by these lab-specific errors. We have added a brief discussion of this issue to the manuscript (in the diagnostics case study section) and have added a new warning to alert users to this issue on covidcg.org.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should, in addition to their recommendation that scientists check mutation rates at primer binding sites, also reiterate Vanaerschot et al.'s suggestion to interrogate multiple target genes and compare Ct values.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a line at the end of the “Case study of SNVs that could impact the sensitivity of diagnostic primers” subsection: “We reiterate Vanaerschot et al.’s exhortation that SARS-CoV-2 detection strategies should ideally target multiple viral genes and check for concordant Ct values.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Case study of SNVs in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike”: Although Baum et al. identified mutations by deep sequencing both in and out of the RBD, they only validated that mutations in the RBD affected binding by Regeneron antibodies. The others are likely hitchhikers, and should not be referred to as possible escape mutants in the absence of direct functional testing</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point and have edited that line to make it clearer and avoid that misunderstanding: “some of these RBD amino acid variations are already present at low frequency among human isolates globally”. Without direct functional testing, we agree that it is difficult to know if a particular mutation is a hitchhiker or artefact of passaging in cells or truly contributing to escape from antibody neutralization.</p></body></sub-article></article>
