We have used the teleost <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic>, which consists of surface-dwelling (surface fish) and cave-dwelling (cavefish) morphs, as a model to study adaptation to hypoxia in caves. Surface fish colonized subterranean waters in the Sierra de El Abra region of Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mitchell et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gross, 2012</xref>) during the late Pleistocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fumey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herman et al., 2018</xref>), and their cavefish descendants evolved numerous traits for adaptation to perpetual darkness. Cavefish adaptations include more taste buds and cranial neuromasts, increased olfactory capacity, and fat deposits, which could facilitate feeding and survival during times of low food input, and decreased metabolic rates and loss of eyes, which may be important in energy conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yamamoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Varatharasan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yoshizawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hüppop, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Xiong et al., 2018</xref>). Hypoxia may be a deterrent to the survival of colonizing teleosts in the Sierra de El Abra, where oxygen reductions of 50% or more have been measured in cave waters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boggs and Gross, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rohner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ornelas-García et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Astyanax</italic> cavefish thrive under these conditions, but little is known about how they have adapted to hypo-oxygenated waters.</p><p>Oxygen is bound to hemoglobin and transported through the body by red blood cells. Increased erythrocyte production is a well-documented strategy for coping with hypoxia at high altitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haase, 2013</xref>), but the role of red blood cells in adaptation to hypoxic caves is unknown. Hematopoiesis, the process in which erythrocytes and other blood cells develop during embryogenesis, occurs in two waves in vertebrates: the primitive and definitive waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davidson and Zon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paik and Zon, 2010</xref>). In the zebrafish <italic>Danio rerio</italic> and other teleost embryos, the first or primitive wave occurs in the anterior and posterior lateral mesoderm beginning during the tailbud stage. The anterior lateral mesoderm (ALM) undergoes myelopoiesis to form macrophages, and some of these later differentiate into neutrophils and microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herbomel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herbomel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le Guyader et al., 2008</xref>), whereas the posterior lateral mesoderm (PLM) undergoes erythropoiesis to form primitive erythrocytes. Subsequently, the PLM converges into the intermediate cell mass, where the precursors of endothelial cells lining the first blood vessels, primitive erythrocytes, and myeloid cells will ultimately differentiate. The second or definitive wave of hematopoiesis begins later in development when hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are formed in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM), which seed the caudal hematopoietic tissue and form the posterior blood islands, where definitive erythrocytes begin to differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paik and Zon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gore et al., 2018</xref>). Eventually, definitive hematopoiesis moves to the thymus and head kidneys in adults. The primitive and definitive waves of hematopoiesis are potential targets for adaptive changes induced by hypoxia.</p><p>Hematopoiesis is directed by a series of transcription factors producing different types of blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davidson and Zon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carroll and North, 2014</xref>). The <italic>growth factor independence 1</italic> (<italic>gfi1aa</italic>) gene, which encodes a transcriptional repressor of many different genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Möröy et al., 2015</xref>), is important for primitive hematopoiesis at several developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wei et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooney et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moore et al., 2018</xref>). In zebrafish, <italic>gfi1aa</italic> expression occurs throughout the period of embryonic segmentation, first in the PLM, then in the intermediate cell mass, and finally in the AGM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wei et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooney et al., 2013</xref>), where it directs the development of hemogenic endothelia into hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which ultimately differentiate into red blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moore et al., 2018</xref>). The <italic>gfi1aa</italic> gene is also expressed in the ALM, albeit weakly and only for a short time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wei et al., 2008</xref>). Its expression at different stages of hematopoiesis makes <italic>gfi1aa</italic> an excellent marker for investigating differences between surface fish and cavefish hematopoiesis. The <italic>LIM domain only 2</italic> gene encodes another transcription factor essential for determination of hematopoietic domains early in primitive hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patterson et al., 2007</xref>) and is also an excellent marker for differences during the initial stages of hematopoiesis.</p><p>Oxygen is required in aerobic organisms to produce energy, and insufficient oxygen leads to the activation of an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Majmundar et al., 2010</xref>). The responses to oxygen deprivation are coordinated by activation of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF1, HIF2, and HIF3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Semenza and Wang, 1992</xref>), a family of transcription factors controlling a large number of downstream target genes involved in promoting different responses to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pelster and Egg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rashid et al., 2017</xref>). Increased expression of the α subunit of HIF1 and the HIF regulated genes are indicators of hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mandic et al., 2021</xref>). Notable responses include the improvement of oxygen supply through increasing red blood cell production and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haase, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kulkarni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2020</xref>), metabolic homeostasis balancing ATP production with oxygen consumption, management of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) via glycolysis, modulating anaerobic respiration and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Singh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wheaton and Chandel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stincone et al., 2015</xref>), and conservation of energy by growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kamei, 2020</xref>). <italic>Astyanax</italic> cavefish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hüppop, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aspiras et al., 2015</xref>) and other cave-adapted animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bishop et al., 2004</xref>) have evolved reduced metabolic rates to conserve energy in the cave environment. However, the strategies used to conserve energy in hypoxic cave environments are poorly understood.</p><p>The present investigation shows that cavefish embryos develop significantly more erythrocytes than surface fish. The results also revealed that cavefish larvae have constitutively high expression of some of the HIF1 pathway genes and show no effects of oxygen depletion on growth, traits that could promote larval survival in hypoxic environments. These studies reveal that changes in development of the circulatory system may underlie adaptation of cavefish to hypo-oxygenated environments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cavefish have more erythrocytes than surface fish</title><p>To test the hypothesis that cavefish develop more red blood cells as a response to environmental hypoxia, we compared erythrocytes between surface fish and cavefish embryos in several different ways. First, we conducted direct observations of blood cell numbers after circulation begins in the Duct of Cuvier (DC) at 36 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). At this time, the circulatory system is still partially open, and blood cells can be imaged or stained and quantified as they flow across the yolk (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D and F</xref>). The number of circulating blood cells was quantified in sequential video frames using Image-J analysis software, and the results showed that cavefish have more blood cells than surface fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D and F</xref>). Second, the number of erythrocytes was quantified in the DC by staining with o-dianisidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iuchi and Yamamoto, 1983</xref>), and the results revealed that cavefish have more erythrocytes than surface fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and G</xref>). Third, expression of the <italic>hbb2</italic> and <italic>hbbe2 ß-hemoglobin</italic> genes was followed during surface fish and cavefish development by qPCR and in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B and D–F</xref>). The qPCR results revealed significantly higher levels of <italic>hbb2</italic> mRNA at 24 hpf and 60 hpf and <italic>hbbe2</italic> mRNA at 60 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). In situ hybridization also showed more extensive <italic>hbb2</italic> staining in cavefish compared to surface fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>), which was particularly evident in the yolk mass at 36 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Fourth, the expression of <italic>gfi1aa</italic>, which encodes a transcription factor essential for hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooney et al., 2013</xref>), was compared by qPCR and in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and G</xref>). The results indicated that <italic>gfi1aa</italic> mRNA levels were significantly increased in cavefish compared to surface fish at 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and G</xref>), prior to detection of the highest levels of hemoglobin transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

To address this question, we compared the effects of hemolytic anemia in surface fish and cavefish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Hemolysis of red blood cells was induced by treatment with phenylhydrazine (PHZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Houston et al., 1988</xref>) beginning at 14 hpf (13–17 somite stage), and <italic>hbb2</italic> staining, red blood cell number, and post-anal tail length (used as a proxy for normal growth and development) were compared in surface fish and cavefish after 14 hr of PHZ exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). We found that <italic>hbb2</italic> staining and red blood cells were reduced at increasing PHZ concentrations in both surface fish and cavefish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). However, at the same PHZ concentration both erythrocyte phenotypes were more strongly affected in surface fish than in cavefish, consistent with more red blood cells in the latter. The results also showed that growth decreased in concert with hemoglobin transcript and erythrocyte reduction in surface fish, and concordant with more red blood cells, no effects on growth were seen in PHZ-treated cavefish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The PHZ-treated embryos developed axial defects, most notably edemas, twisted notochords, and shortened and ventrally bent tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), which were more prevalent at lower PHZ concentrations in surface fish than cavefish embryos (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

This conclusion is based on direct counts of blood cells, including erythrocytes, increased expression of multiple erythropoietic marker genes, and hyper-expression of the <italic>gfi1aa</italic> gene, a crucial regulator of hematopoiesis. In addition, we report that the increase in erythrocytes may be caused by expansion of embryonic hematopoietic domains in cavefish compared to surface fish. Finally, we provide evidence that cavefish have evolved a permanent response to hypoxia involving the constitutive overexpression of the some of the <italic>hif1</italic> genes, which persists under normoxic laboratory conditions.</p><p>Hematopoiesis occurs in the primitive and definitive waves in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davidson and Zon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paik and Zon, 2010</xref>). Increased <italic>hbb2, hbbe2,</italic> and <italic>gfi1aa</italic> expression was observed during embryogenesis and after larval hatching in cavefish. In zebrafish, transfusion experiments indicate that blood cells circulating during the first four days of development are primitive erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weinstein et al., 1996</xref>). Accordingly, our findings suggest that <italic>Astyanax</italic> larval blood cells are primitive erythrocytes derived from the first wave of hematopoiesis. Nevertheless, we also found stronger expression of erythropoietic marker genes in the AGM and caudal hematopoietic tissue, which are involved in definitive hematopoiesis, implying that the second wave may also be expanded in cavefish. Further investigation will be required to determine whether erythrocytes are also increased in adults, although this possibility seems likely because adult cavefish have increased levels of hemoglobin transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sears et al., 2020</xref>) and more erythrocytes in their head kidneys compared to surface fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peuß et al., 2020</xref>). We conclude that cavefish have evolved a permanent enhancement in red blood cells as a potential adaptation for survival in hypoxic cave waters.</p><p>The results showed that surface fish and cavefish primitive erythrocytes are derived from two different hematopoietic domains, one located anteriorly in the ALM and the other posteriorly in the PLM. Importantly, both the anterior and posterior embryonic domains show expanded marker gene expression in cavefish compared to surface fish. It is noteworthy that expansion of the posterior hematopoietic domain can also be induced in zebrafish by overexpressing LMO2 together with its partner transcription factor SCL/TAL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gering et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that teleosts have the capacity to modulate blood cell numbers by changing the size of primitive erythropoietic domains during development. The existence of erythrocyte forming capacity in the ALM of surface fish, albeit smaller than in cavefish, suggests that the expansion of primitive erythropoiesis may pre-adapt <italic>Astyanax</italic> for colonizing hypoxic cave environments.</p><p>The expansion of erythropoiesis into the ALM during primitive hematopoiesis in <italic>Astyanax</italic> contrasts strikingly to zebrafish, medaka, and other teleosts that have been investigated, in which primitive erythropoiesis is confined to the PLM, and the ALM is devoted only to myelopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Detrich et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Govoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moriyama et al., 2010</xref>). Expression of the macrophage marker <italic>lcp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herbomel et al., 2001</xref>) indicated that myelopoietic precursors had already differentiated into macrophages as erythrocyte progenitors were being formed in the ALM during early <italic>Astyanax</italic> development. Cell-tracing studies have shown that blood precursor cells can produce either erythrocytes or macrophages, but not both cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Warga et al., 2009</xref>), indicating an opposing relationship between the erythroid and myeloid cell populations. However, this relationship can be reversed by knockdown of the myeloid-controlling transcription factor PU.1, which induces blood precursors of the ALM to form erythrocytes instead of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rhodes et al., 2005</xref>). Apparently, teleosts are potentially able to undergo erythropoiesis in the ALM and PLM, but in most species this capacity is normally confined to the PLM. In <italic>Astyanax,</italic> the balanced relationship between myeloid and erythroid cell specification appears to have tilted toward the production of erythrocytes. However, the development of erythrocytes in the ALM may not be at the expense of fewer myeloid cells because there is also an overall expansion of the ALM (and PLM), which may promote the specification of more blood precursor cells. In future studies, it will be interesting to determine how the expansion of erythropoietic potential is controlled in cavefish.</p><p>Specification of cells in the primitive blood lineage can be traced to their positions during gastrulation in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kimmel et al., 1990</xref>): ALM macrophages are originally derived from progenitors on the dorsal side of the embryo, and PLM erythrocytes originate from the ventral side of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davidson and Zon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Warga et al., 2009</xref>). Erythrocyte progenitors corresponding to the ALM and PLM are also likely to be positioned on the dorsal or ventral sides respectively in gastrulating <italic>Astyanax</italic> embryos. Therefore, increased erythropoiesis in the ALM suggests that a relative ventralization of hematopoietic development has evolved in cavefish compared to surface fish. This possibility is supported by expanded erythroid development induced by overexpression of the ventralizing factors <italic>bmp2b</italic> and <italic>bmp7</italic> in zebrafish gastrulae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lengerke et al., 2008</xref>) and is in line with evidence implicating the importance of maternal factors in dorsal-ventral axis determination of cavefish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ren et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Torres-Paz et al., 2019</xref>). Maternal control of primitive erythropoiesis may promote maximal oxygen distribution at the early stages of development in hypoxic environments. This finding extends our understanding of evolutionary differences in early hematopoiesis to events beginning during oogenesis.</p><p>In the present investigation, we have examined primitive hematopoiesis and red blood cells in the Pachón cavefish population. About 30 different <italic>Astyanax</italic> cavefish populations have been described in northeastern Mexico, and some of these cavefish are thought to have been derived independently from surface fish ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gross, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herman et al., 2018</xref>). It is conceivable that diverse cavefish lineages inhabit cave pools with different levels of oxygenation. Therefore, in the future it would be interesting to determine the status of erythrocytes in additional cavefish populations. It will also be important to determine if other aquatic cave animals modify their oxygen delivery systems to cope with hypoxia.</p><p>Teleosts show considerable diversity in utilizing hemoglobin and red blood cells for oxygen transport during development: some species begin hemoglobin synthesis during embryogenesis, whereas others postpone hemoglobin and erythrocyte production until much later in larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wells, 2009</xref>). Our studies on the induction of hemolytic anemia with PHZ confirm the functional significance of red blood cells produced during early <italic>Astyanax</italic> development. At the same PHZ concentrations, surface fish, but not cavefish with residual red blood cells, show negative effects on growth, and hypoxia treatment inhibited growth in surface fish but not in cavefish. These results suggest that red blood cells are necessary for oxygen transport at early stages of <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> development and that increased erythrocytes may be advantageous in cavefish. This is contrary to zebrafish, where PHZ induced anemia showed that red blood cells are not required during the first few weeks of development under normoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pelster and Burggren, 1996</xref>), although under severe hypoxia zebrafish embryos also use red blood cells to increase the supply of oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rombough and Drader, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Teleosts have evolved different strategies to cope with environments depleted in oxygen, including changes in gill morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sollid et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhillon et al., 2013</xref>), behavioral avoidance of hypoxic waters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Congleton, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mandic et al., 2009</xref>), and altered metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Torres et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Astyanax</italic> surface fish larvae appear to deal with hypoxia by conserving energy and reducing growth. It is likely that growth is regulated similarly to zebrafish via upregulation of <italic>igfbp1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kajimura et al., 2005</xref>). The upregulation of <italic>igfbp1</italic> under hypoxia is regulated by HIF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kajimura et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Astyanax</italic> cavefish, which are presumably unable to avoid hypoxic waters in their natural environment, show increased expression of some of the <italic>hif1</italic> genes in either hypoxic or normoxic conditions. The constitutive increase in <italic>hif1</italic>-related gene expression may have conferred growth resistance to hypoxia, even under conditions in which <italic>igfbp1</italic> is upregulated, and may be responsible for increased red blood cell number.</p><p>The increased expression of the metabolic gene <italic>hk1</italic> in cavefish compared to surface fish indicates an increase in glycolysis, consistent with the observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krishnan et al., 2020</xref>. The increase in glycolysis does not seem to affect the TCA cycle since <italic>ldha</italic> and <italic>pdk1</italic> are not differentially expressed between cavefish and surface fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Medley et al., 2020</xref>). Wild captured cavefish also have higher expression of the genes encoding enzymes involved in glutathione metabolism compared to wild caught surface fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krishnan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Medley et al., 2020</xref>). Glutathione is an important player in the mitigation of ROS, and the Pentose Phosphate Pathway produces a large portion of the NADPH used in the production of glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stincone et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the constitutive expression of <italic>hif1</italic>-genes in cavefish could play a role in ROS mitigation via glutathione during hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Birnie-Gauvin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the present investigation has revealed two potential adaptations that may have permitted <italic>Astyanax</italic> cavefish to cope with hypoxic cave waters. First, cavefish have enhanced erythrocyte development, and as a maternal effect this phenotype may have increased the capacity of cavefish to carry and distribute essential oxygen to tissues and organs early in development.

At 30 hpf larvae were exposed to hypoxia (1 mg/L oxygen) for 18 hr or to normoxia (outside of the chamber). Larvae were placed individually in wells of a 24-well plate (CytoOne, USA scientific, Ocala, FL, USA) containing 2 ml clean fish system-water. Twenty-four larvae were used per treatment for surface fish and 48 larvae for cavefish from two separate clutches of eggs per morph.

Image-J was used to measure post-anal tail length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and growth determined as the differential between the two time points. To measure eye size, eye diameter was measured after the 18 hr. hypoxia or normoxia treatment with ImageJ.

For comparison of gene expression in cavefish to surface fish over time, ΔΔCt was calculated by subtracting the average ΔCt of surface fish at 10 hpf from each ΔCt for each gene. For comparison of gene expression under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, the ΔCt of surface fish under normoxic conditions was subtracted from the ΔCt for each gene. For graphical representation, the fold change was calculated as 2<sup>-(ΔΔCt)</sup>, where values &gt; 1 show an increase and values &lt; 1 a decrease. Variation was expressed as the range of fold change 2<sup>- (ΔΔCt+stdevΔΔCt)</sup> for the upper value or 2<sup>- (ΔΔCt-stdevΔΔCt)</sup> for the lowest value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistics were done using JMP pro 14 (SAS Institute Inc).

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cavefish adapt to hypoxia by constitutive overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor genes and increased erythrocyte development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Misty Riddle (Reviewer #2); Rachel Brewster (Reviewer #4).</p><p>You will see that our referees find your work intriguing, but have raised a number of important concerns, and in the light of these issues, we cannot offer to publish your paper in <italic>eLife</italic>, at least as it stands. If, however, you feel that you can address the points raised by our referees and make a compelling response to all of the issues raised, then we would be willing to consider a revised version of your paper for possible publication. Given the concerns raised by the referees, we would be looking for additional experimental data along the lines requested to strengthen the evidence in support of the key claims.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) More data is needed to show that CF do better than SF in a low oxygen environment, especially the growth experiments need larger numbers as the results are highly variable.</p><p>2) The use of a hypoxia chamber or a comparable set up is needed to alleviate concerns about the reproducibility of the hypoxic values between trials.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 1: Why wasn't o-dianisidine staining used for the quantification? Figure 1B is not discussed in the main text. I think adding this quantification would strengthen the paper.</p><p>Figure 2B: I am not really convinced that HBB2 is expanded in the PBI by the image. There does appear to be staining in the anterior part of the fish however. The expansion in the anterior portion should be mentioned rather than expansion in the PBI.</p><p>Line 227. Line 358-361: The authors claim that &quot;cavefish are less sensitive to hemolytic anemia&quot;. I don't agree with this interpretation of the data. I would interpret the results as cavefish being less sensitive to developing hemolytic anemia with increasing concentrations of PHZ because they have more blood cells. To compare the effect of reducing blood cells, the authors could compare SF treated with 1 mg/L PHZ to CF treated with 4 mg/L; based on Figure 3A, these treatment groups have about equivalent blood cells. You may conclude from the data that cavefish are more sensitive to a reduction in red blood cells; cavefish treated with 2 mg/L PHZ look equivalent to untreated SF in terms of hbb2 staining, but they have notochord defects and reduction in length. The authors should re-evaluate this experiment and add text to the results considering these points.</p><p>Figure 4B: The data should be reported as total number as in figure 1F instead of as a % of untreated. This would help the reader interpret the results of the experiment. The authors should then compare the phenotypes of SF and CF when they have equivalent number of red blood cells. For example, in figure 1D is tail length of CF treated with 4 mg/L significantly different from SF treated with 1 or 2 mg/L? These treatments look like they result in a similar level of red blood cells.</p><p>Figure 5B. &quot;the results showed that axial growth was significantly reduced in cavefish in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions relative to surface fish under normoxic conditions.&quot; The result shows there is only a difference in the normoxic condition. The authors do not report the statistics comparing SF-normoxic to CF-hypoxic.</p><p>Line 361: &quot;Hypoxia treatment inhibited axial growth in SF…&quot;. The results are not significant. Authors should increase the number of biological replicates and/or length of exposure.</p><p>Line 500: The authors say that 40-50% normoxic was lethal. Did they compare lethality in SF and CF embryos? I think it would be of interest to include lethality as a measurement in the study. Are there concentrations that CF can survive while SF die? This may be a more relevant measurement than growth considering whether the increase in red blood cells is adaptive.</p><p>More data is needed to show that CF do better than SF in a low oxygen environment and that if you decrease HIF expression and/or erythrocyte number this advantage is eliminated. Experimentally increasing HIF expression and/or erythrocyte number in SF and showing that this gives them an advantage in low oxygen water would provide additional strong evidence that the trait is adaptive.</p><p>The authors should add text to the discussion that the study only focused on one of the cavefish populations and that examining the other populations would be an interesting future direction. The authors should add &quot;Astyanax mexicanus&quot; to the title. There are many different species of cavefish and this may not be a general feature for how cavefish adapt to hypoxia.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The use of other assays (e.g metabolic rate under hypoxia) to test the functional relevance of increased erythrocyte production and enhanced transcription of hif1 would strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>2) In other teleosts, it is well established that elongation of the embryo is driven by convergent extension movements in the axial mesoderm. It would therefore be worthwhile examining whether this process occurs differently in cavefish relative to surface fish under hypoxia.</p><p>3) Hif protein levels under hypoxic conditions should be measured.</p><p>4) The use of a hypoxia chamber to control oxygen levels is recommended.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69109.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Figure 1: Why wasn't o-dianisidine staining used for the quantification?

We agree and have added quantification of o-dianisidine stained cells in revised Figure 1G.

In the revised manuscript, we have now emphasized the expansion of <italic>hbb2</italic> expression in the ALM and PLM rather than the PBI. The comment also prompted us to rewrite these results for clarification. There are two major conclusions of our experiments: One is that hematopoietic/erythropoietic domains are present in both the anterior and posterior regions of <italic>Astyanax</italic> embryos, which is not the case in zebrafish and other teleost embryos, where they are present only posteriorly, and another is that both the anterior and posterior hematopoietic/erythropoietic domains (ALM and PLM) are expanded in cavefish compared to surface fish based on expression of the <italic>hhb2</italic>, <italic>gfi1aa,</italic> and <italic>lmo2</italic> genes. The section of the revised manuscript was rewritten to emphasize on these two conclusions. Please see Lines 140-166. We also revised Figure 2 (now Figure 3) to highlight the two major conclusions of this section of the manuscript</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 227. Line 358-361: The authors claim that &quot;cavefish are less sensitive to hemolytic anemia&quot;. I don't agree with this interpretation of the data. I would interpret the results as cavefish being less sensitive to developing hemolytic anemia with increasing concentrations of PHZ because they have more blood cells.

The authors should re-evaluate this experiment and add text to the results considering these points.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, but point out that the major purpose of this section of the manuscript was to determine whether erythrocytes have a role in early <italic>Astyanax</italic> development. We thought that this section was necessary because older literature from the zebrafish community suggested that erythrocytes are produced during early embryogenesis but are not required for oxygen transport until much later in larval development. Thus, it was necessary investigate whether red blood cells are required for early development in <italic>Astyanax</italic>. We believe that our PHZ results, which are now fortified by additional experiments, answer this question in the affirmative. In particular, the experiments in revised Figure 5D show that larval growth is suppressed in the absence of red blood cells. We feel that these results strongly support the conclusion that erythrocytes are functional and required during early <italic>Astyanax</italic> development.</p><p>Because of other concerns listed in the Reviewer’s comment immediately above, and also taking into account the recommendation to report red blood cell phenotypes by number suggested in the comment immediately below, we have repeated all of the experiments in question. The results are shown in revised Figure 5C, which compares larval tail length and red blood cell number at increasing PHZ concentration over a 28 hr time span. The findings are as follows. First, red blood cell numbers are decreased in concert with increasing PHZ concentration in both surface fish and cavefish. Second, the loss of red blood cells is more abrupt and severe in surface fish than in cavefish. Third, increasing PHZ concentrations reduce tail length in surface fish but not in cavefish, which have more erythrocytes. We interpret these results to mean that cavefish are less sensitive to hemolytic anemia because they have more blood cells, matching the conclusion of this reviewer.</p><p>We could not compare PHZ-treated surface fish and cavefish with the same number of red blood cells because we could not find a PHZ concentration with closely matching erythrocyte numbers in SF and CF that would allow this comparison to be made (Please also see the comments immediately below and Figure 5C).</p><p>Lastly, we have re-written the section of the Results describing these data. Please see Lines 183-207.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4B: The data should be reported as total number as in figure 1F instead of as a % of untreated.

These treatments look like they result in a similar level of red blood cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. In revised Figure 5C the data is shown as the total number of red blood cells. However, as pointed out above, we could not compare PHZ- treated surface fish and cavefish at equivalent red blood cell numbers because there was no PHZ concentration where approximately equivalent numbers could be found.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5B. &quot;the results showed that axial growth was significantly reduced in cavefish in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions relative to surface fish under normoxic conditions.&quot; The result shows there is only a difference in the normoxic condition.

In revised Figure 6, we show significant differences in axial growth between cavefish and surface fish exposed to hypooxygenation in a hypoxia chamber.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 500: The authors say that 40-50% normoxic was lethal. Did they compare lethality in SF and CF embryos? I think it would be of interest to include lethality as a measurement in the study. Are there concentrations that CF can survive while SF die? This may be a more relevant measurement than growth considering whether the increase in red blood cells is adaptive.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We agree and during the interval between submissions we have performed many experiments to compare survival of surface and cavefish under hypoxic (in a hypoxia chamber) and normoxic conditions. Unfortunately, none of these experiments produced interpretable data. During the course of these experiments it became clear that successful survival studies will require much more extensive preliminary work to develop appropriate conditions using many different oxygenation levels, which was not possible during the interval allowed for revising this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More data is needed to show that CF do better than SF in a low oxygen environment and that if you decrease HIF expression and/or erythrocyte number this advantage is eliminated. Experimentally increasing HIF expression and/or erythrocyte number in SF and showing that this gives them an advantage in low oxygen water would provide additional strong evidence that the trait is adaptive.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this advice. We have now performed new experiments to address these concerns using a hypoxia chamber. The results show that growth (and erythrocyte number) in cavefish is significantly less sensitive to oxygen reduction than in surface fish (revised Figure 6). Also, to further address these concerns, we have now performed an experiment in which erythrocytes were completely eliminated and this significantly reduced axial growth (revised Figure 5D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should add text to the discussion that the study only focused on one of the cavefish populations and that examining the other populations would be an interesting future direction. The authors should add &quot;Astyanax mexicanus&quot; to the title. There are many different species of cavefish and this may not be a general feature for how cavefish adapt to hypoxia.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that examining other cavefish populations would be interesting and have now added the suggested material to the Discussion. Please see Lines 314-321.</p><p>The expansion of the title information in the Summary, which would appear just below the title in a published manuscript, clearly states that the work was done in the cavefish <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic>. Therefore, in the interest of keeping an already long title in check, we have not added the genus and species name to the manuscript title.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The use of other assays (e.g metabolic rate under hypoxia) to test the functional relevance of increased erythrocyte production and enhanced transcription of hif1 would strengthen the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We agree that confirmatory information might be obtained by different assays under hypoxia conditions. However, we point out that the two assays we have conducted in the revised manuscript, tail and eye growth, using the hypoxia chamber permit the conclusion that cavefish have greater tolerance to hypoxia than surface fish, and that this phenotype is likely to be a consequence of more erythrocyte development. In the time allotted for revision, we have repeated all of the hypoxia experiments with these two criteria as assays. We agree that, with additional time, adding more assays might provide further confirmatory evidence, but would not strengthen our present conclusions beyond the present evidence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In other teleosts, it is well established that elongation of the embryo is driven by convergent extension movements in the axial mesoderm. It would therefore be worthwhile examining whether this process occurs differently in cavefish relative to surface fish under hypoxia.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be interesting to see if hypoxia affects notochord morphogenesis. However, convergent extension movements forming the notochord occur during and shortly after gastrulation in zebrafish and <italic>Astyanax</italic>. The experiments on hypoxia in our manuscript began at the 13-14 somite stage, considerably later than convergent extension in the developing chordamesoderm. Thus, we believe that the suggested experiments, although interesting, would have little direct significance for our current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Hif protein levels under hypoxic conditions should be measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be an excellent topic for future research. However, at present we do not have the tools (antibodies, etc) in the <italic>Astyanax</italic> system to specifically detect, distinguish and quantify the four Hif proteins. Our manuscript is focused on <italic>hif1</italic> transcripts, which can be detected using established qPCR procedures, and our conclusions do not go beyond the transcriptional level. We also point out that HIF system activation has been previously documented in a variety of fish species based entirely on (indirect) studies of <italic>hif</italic> expression levels. The article by Mandic et al. (2021) in our reference list reviews these studies. We believe that this approach is also appropriate for our study, particularly since our only claim is that <italic>hif</italic> transcription is overexpressed by hypoxia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The use of a hypoxia chamber to control oxygen levels is recommended.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you again for this excellent suggestion. During the interim between submissions, we purchased a hypoxia chamber and using it repeated all of our hypoxia experiments, as we have described above. The results are shown in revised Figures 6 and 7. Our basic conclusions are still the same, but this approach has permitted us to make stronger conclusions about the differential effects of hypoxia on surface fish and cavefish in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
