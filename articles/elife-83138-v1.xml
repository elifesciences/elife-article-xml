The iPSCs exhibit a preference for lineage differentiation to the donor cell type indicating the existence of memory of origin. Although the intrinsic effect of the donor cell type on differentiation of iPSCs is well recognized, whether disease-specific factors of donor cells influence the differentiation capacity of iPSC remains unknown. Using viral based reprogramming, we demonstrated the generation of iPSCs from chondrocytes isolated from healthy (AC-iPSCs) and osteoarthritis cartilage (OA-iPSCs). These reprogrammed cells acquired markers of pluripotency and differentiated into uncommitted mesenchymal-like progenitors. Interestingly, AC-iPSCs exhibited enhanced chondrogenic potential as compared OA-iPSCs and showed increased expression of chondrogenic genes. Pan-transcriptome analysis showed that chondrocytes derived from AC-iPSCs were enriched in molecular pathways related to energy metabolism and epigenetic regulation, together with distinct expression signature that distinguishes them from OA-iPSCs. Our molecular tracing data demonstrated that dysregulation of epigenetic and metabolic factors seen in OA chondrocytes relative to healthy chondrocytes persisted following iPSC reprogramming and differentiation toward mesenchymal progenitors. Our results suggest that the epigenetic and metabolic memory of disease may predispose OA-iPSCs for their reduced chondrogenic differentiation and thus regulation at epigenetic and metabolic level may be an effective strategy for controlling the chondrogenic potential of iPSCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chondrocytes</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019592</institution-id><institution>Veterans Administration Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CaReAP Award I01-BX004878</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drissi</surname><given-names>Hicham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016220</institution-id><institution>Georgia Clinical and Translational Science Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>REM Pilot Project 00080502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mortensen</surname><given-names>Luke J</given-names></name><name><surname>Drissi</surname><given-names>Hicham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004829</institution-id><institution>Connecticut Innovations</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Stem Cell Fund Seed Grants #13-SCA-UCHC-11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guzzo</surname><given-names>Rosa M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004829</institution-id><institution>Connecticut Innovations</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Stem Cell Fund Seed Grants #0SCA36</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guzzo</surname><given-names>Rosa M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The iPSCs derived from OA cartilage showed memory of disease which affect its chondrogenic potential and regulation at epigenetic and metabolic level may be used to control the regenerative potential of these iPSCs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is an inflammatory joint disease in which catabolic cascade of events results in cartilage destruction leading to severe joint pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lotz and Kraus, 2010</xref>). While non-surgical procedures such as NSAID (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and steroid injections are helpful, the majority of OA cases ultimately undergo joint replacement therapy. The induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were recently proposed as a promising source to repair cartilage damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lach et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lietman, 2016</xref>). While iPSCs are seriously considered as potential cell sources for regenerative medicine, accumulating evidence suggests that iPSCs from different cell sources have distinct molecular and functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bar-Nur et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lister et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rim et al., 2018</xref>). It has been reported that iPSCs derived from various somatic cell types exhibited a preference for differentiation into their original cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bar-Nur et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marinkovic et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the effects of the cellular origin of iPSCs on their lineage-specific differentiation capacity is an important consideration for cell replacement therapies, drug screening, or disease modeling.</p><p>Several studies have determined that iPSCs retain a memory of their cellular origin due to residual DNA methylation and histone modification patterns at lineage-specific genes. Thus, this residual ‘epigenetic memory’ has been shown to bias their subsequent differentiation into their parental/donor cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Choompoo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Although it is known that cellular origin of iPSCs influences their differentiation capacity, the contribution of disease-specific factors on the capacity of iPSC for chondrogenic differentiation remains unknown. Examining potential differences between cells that reside in healthy vs. OA environments, would provide unique insight into the chondrogenic potential of these cells, and their utility in disease modeling. Since OA articular chondrocytes exhibit different features from healthy articular chondrocytes, we posit that the iPSCs derived from these cell states represent the feature of their physiological origin. Thus, the memory of the cells is not only specific to the tissue of origin but also to the physiological status which further influences the differentiation capacity and ultimately the efficiency of tissue regeneration.</p><p>In the present study, we aimed to determine whether iPSCs derived from healthy and diseased (OA) cartilage possess differential chondrogenic potential, and whether OA disease status significantly limits their differentiation capacity. To this end, we derived iPSCs from healthy (AC-iPSCs) and OA chondrocytes (OA-iPSCs) and compared their differentiation capacity into chondroprogenitors and chondrocytes. Our results showed that iPSCs derived from healthy chondrocytes (AC-iPSCs) exhibited an enhanced potential for chondrocyte differentiation as compared to OA-iPSCs. Our data further demonstrate that although reprogramming of OA chondrocytes induced pluripotency, the OA-iPSCs retained the changes in epigenetic and metabolic factors associated with pathological conditions of diseased chondrocytes. Retention of this cellular memory may influence their chondrogenic commitment, and thus regenerative capacity for the cartilage repair. Our findings indicate that regulating the epigenetic modifiers and energy metabolism may be an effective strategy for enhancing the chondrogenic potential of iPSCs derived from chondrocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of iPSCs generated from healthy and OA articular chondrocytes</title><p>We previously reported the generation of iPSCs from healthy articular chondrocytes (AC-iPSCs) and performed molecular, cytochemical, and cytogenic analyses to determine the pluripotency of generated iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guzzo et al., 2014</xref>).

Although reprogramming of somatic cells to iPSCs involves extensive modification of the epigenetic landscape, the reprogrammed cells can retain an epigenetic memory of the cell type of origin, thus affecting lineage differentiation propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Poetsch et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to donor cell type, key questions over the influence of the health status of the parental somatic cells used for reprogramming remain unresolved. Thus, the present study was designed to determine whether the health status of donor human articular chondrocytes influences the regenerative potential of the derived iPSCs. Using iPSCs generated from healthy and OA chondrocytes, we report that reprogramming efficiency to pluripotency was largely equivalent between the two sources. However, OA-iPSCs showed a significantly reduced capacity for chondrogenic differentiation as compared to AC-iPSCs, indicating that the pathogenic condition of the donor chondrocytes negatively affected the chondrogenic differentiation potential of OA-iPSCs. Our data suggest that reprogramming does not reset the health status of OA articular chondrocytes, but rather supports the existence of a memory of disease in iPSCs derived from OA cartilage.</p><p>A plethora of studies over the last 15 years have determined that cells from almost any tissue can be used to generate human iPSCs, which can then be differentiated to a variety of specialized cells. However, human iPSCs generated from disparate cell types have not displayed equivalent capacities for differentiation to specialized cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Seminal studies using iPSCs derived from myeloid cells, hematopoietic cells, and insulin-producing beta cells revealed a biased lineage differentiation attributed to residual DNA methylation signatures that influence cell fate commitment. For example, when compared to isogenic non-beta cell-derived iPSCs, beta cell-derived iPSCs maintained an open chromatin structure at key beta cell genes, leading to an increased capacity to efficiently differentiate into insulin-producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bar-Nur et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, iPSCs appear to have an epigenetic memory for the tissue of origin. We have previously generated iPSCs from multiple cell types including human skin fibroblasts, umbilical cord blood, and normal healthy chondrocytes using the same reprogramming strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guzzo et al., 2014</xref>). Using multiple chondrogenic differentiation assays, our earlier findings demonstrated that iPSC derived from chondrocytes showed enhanced matrix formation and chondrogenic gene expression, suggesting that the tissue of origin also impacted the chondrogenic potential of human iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guzzo et al., 2014</xref>) Similarly, a previous report also demonstrated the differential chondrogenic capabilities of iPSCs derived from dermal fibroblasts, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, cord blood mononuclear cells, and OA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rim et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although it is now well documented that the tissue of origin can affect the differentiation potential of iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), it is not known whether the health status of same tissue affects the regenerative potential of its derived iPSCs. A combination of genetic and non-genetic factors, including advanced age, mechanical trauma and inappropriate joint loading, and inflammation contribute to the development of OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldring and Otero, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loeser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martel-Pelletier et al., 2016</xref>). It is well established that human OA articular chondrocytes exhibit phenotypic, functional, and metabolic changes, as well as altered epigenetic patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Izda et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we speculated that a retained epigenetic memory of iPSCs is not only specific to the tissue of origin but also to the diseased status. Using pluripotency as a reliable tool, our novel data demonstrated significant differences in the chondrogenic capability of AC- vs. OA-iPSCs. Our data indicate that OA cartilage-derived iPSCs retained functional and molecular characteristics of OA pathogenesis. Although pellet culture used here is a very common method of chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs, it possessed technical limitations of heterogeneity during staining of the chondrogenic-specific matrix in the histological analysis of these macroscopic pellets. Moreover, intensity of safranin-O staining of proteoglycan matrix is uneven from periphery to center which poses another challenge for quantification of matrix deposition in the culture of AC- vs. OA-iMSCs. Additionally, GWAS studies have revealed multiple SNPs in genes involved in OA pathogenesis. We have not yet investigated whether the generated iPSC lines harbor OA-associated sequence variants. Chondrogenic pellets generated using OA-iPSCs showed relatively smaller size and reduced chondrogenic gene expression as compared to that from healthy iPSCs (AC-iPSCs). One of the potential limitations of in vitro differentiation of iMSCs was that the derived chondrocytes express the markers of hypertrophy such as <italic>COL10A1</italic>. Although <italic>COL10A1</italic> expression was observed only with BMP2 stimulation, we did not observe any hypertrophic marker expression when TGFβ3 was used as chondrogenic factor in differentiation medium. Despite these limitations, our comprehensive functional, and transcriptomic analyses support the notion that OA-specific iPSC lines may be useful in vitro tools for studying the underlying molecular, metabolic, and epigenetic mechanisms involved in OA.</p><p>Expression of the trio of SOX genes (<italic>SOX9</italic>, <italic>SOX5</italic>, and <italic>SOX6</italic>) was significantly lower in OA-iPSC-derived chondrogenic pellets. The expression of chondrogenic genes under control of SOX9, such as <italic>COL2A1</italic> and <italic>ACAN</italic> was also lower than that AC-iPSC-derived pellets. Since expression of <italic>COL2A1</italic> and <italic>ACAN</italic> is usually lower in OA cartilage, the finding of reduced chondrogenic genes in OA-iPSCs during chondrogenesis suggests the imprints of disease pathogenesis in OA-iPSCs. Similarly, other cartilage matrix genes such as <italic>COMP</italic>, <italic>MATN4</italic>, <italic>PRG4</italic>, and <italic>COL11A2</italic> were lower in OA-iPSC-derived chondrocytes. Interestingly, expression of these genes was also reported to be decreased in OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sofat, 2009</xref>) further suggesting the recapitulation of memory of disease in OA-iPSCs as compared to AC-iPSCs. Additionally, exposure of AC-iMSCs to inflammatory stimulus such as IL1β or TNF-α showed expression of inflammatory cytokine and chemokines such as <italic>CCL2</italic>, <italic>CCL3</italic>, <italic>CXCL3</italic>, and <italic>NOS2</italic>. However, extent of gene expression upon inflammatory stimulation was significantly higher in OA-iMSCs as compared to AC-iMSCs indicating that OA-iPSCs retain memory of disease from the tissue of origin derived from OA cartilage. Based on these findings, human stem cell models of OA using iPSCs may provide the unique opportunity to model OA disease changes, to uncover mechanisms of disease development, and to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.</p><p>We next identified how a memory of cartilage pathology in OA is transmitted from the original somatic cells to iMSCs and finally to the chondrocytes. A nonbiased, high-throughput RNA-sequencing approach was used to define the pan-transcriptome changes during iPSC stage-specific differentiation. Our global transcriptome data showed skewed expression of epigenetic regulators, and metabolism-associated molecular pathways in AC- vs. OA-iMSCs, suggesting a transcriptional memory of disease mechanisms in OA-iPSCs. Recent studies showed cellular metabolism as a key driver of cell fate changes which has intrinsic links with epigenetic modifications of chromatin during development, disease progression, and cellular reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Our data suggest that AC- and OA-iMSCs differ in the expression of a plethora of metabolic genes which finally influence the cells metabolism and thus chondrogenic differentiation. While cell metabolism is closely linked to chondrogenic differentiation, in-depth metabolomic studies are needed to determine how metabolic heterogeneity of AC- and OA-iPSCs impact chondrogenic differentiation and regenerative potential of cartilage tissue. While recent discovery, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2016</xref> demonstrated the interaction between energy metabolite and epigenetic modifiers, a detailed future investigation warrants to determine how cellular metabolism wired the epigenetic modification and influence the cellular transitions associated with cartilage development.</p><p>Although an apparent memory of disease can impact the chondrogenic capabilities of OA-iPSCs, we did not detect differences in stemness genes between AC and OA lines. These data indicate that transcriptome-level differences were notable only upon initial differentiation toward uncommitted mesenchymal progenitors (iMSC stage). We do not know whether the functional and molecular alteration in OA-iMSCs represent a transient or stable phenomenon. Functional studies, coupled with comprehensive analyses of epigenetic landscapes will be necessary to address whether the observed memory of disease (epigenetic and metabolic) is a stable imprint of the original cellular phenotypes, or could be erased by serial reprogramming. Moreover, does preservation of an epigenetic memory of cartilage disease in iPSCs occur at the DNA methylation level, and if so, what are the OA-associated loci? Further, it is not clear whether memory of disease is a phenomenon observed only at early passages after pluripotency induction or can be attenuated by continuous passaging.</p><p>In the present study, we addressed for the first time that differential chondrogenic potential of AC- and OA-iPSCs could be attributed to differences in transcriptome-level changes in the epigenetic modifiers and energy metabolic genes. The expression profile of several chromatin modifiers belonging to the family of histone readers, writers, and erasers such as <italic>FBL</italic>, <italic>PRMT1</italic>, <italic>UBE2E1</italic>, <italic>VRK1</italic>, <italic>PCGF1</italic>, <italic>USP12</italic>, <italic>HMGN</italic>3, <italic>HDAC3</italic>, <italic>HDAC8</italic>, <italic>BRDT</italic>, <italic>ARID2</italic>, and <italic>HMGN3</italic> were significantly different between AC- and OA-iMSCs. Among various epigenetic regulators expressed in AC- vs. OA-iMSCs, the upstream transcription factor analysis identified several candidate factors such as FOXM1, IRF3, FOXP1, and MYBL2. These potential regulators may play a role in response to iMSCs in pathologic or hostile environment under inflammatory stimulus. Since upregulation of FOXM1 is associated with increased response of chondrocytes to inflammation, we anticipate that inhibition of FOXM1 will reduce the pro-inflammatory response and retained regenerative capacity of iMSCs. It is likely that the epigenetic modifications arising in OA chondrocytes occur at multiple levels – DNA methylation, histone modifications, as well as miRNA, and are interconnected. Based on the literature, we speculate that differential DNA methylation at the promoters and regulatory sites of genes that are dysregulated in the parental OA chondrocytes are heritable, and therefore retained in the OA-iPSCs and their derivatives. Our follow-up studies will thoroughly examine DNA promoter methylation status, as well as chromatin organization (loss/gain of active vs. repressive marks) to identify potential regulatory sites that could be targeted to resist pathologic change and retain regenerative capacity. We believe that the generation of OA-iPSCs and the functional and transcriptomic characterization of these novel lines present an important step toward establishing an experimental in vitro model to study disease mechanisms.</p><p>In addition, several metabolic genes such as <italic>AOX1</italic>, <italic>OGDHL</italic>, <italic>GATM</italic>, <italic>KMT2D</italic>, <italic>ALDH2</italic>, <italic>GOT1</italic>, <italic>SLC3A2</italic>, and <italic>ECHS1</italic> also showed differential expression pattern between AC- and OA-iMSCs. Several studies previously showed that metabolic genes and metabolites are involved in the regulation of histone acetylation and chromatin modification indicating that importance of chromatin and metabolites in physiological function of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schvartzman et al., 2018</xref>). Future studies using genome editing approaches coupled with metabolomics and chromatin mapping approaches will be required to determine the biological roles of these identified chromatin modifiers and metabolic regulators in chondrogenic differentiation of iMSCs. Further correlation of chondrogenic differentiation potential of iMSCs derived from chondrocytes from multiple donors, and with varying grades of OA severity will further help establish the concept of epigenetic memory of disease and determine the influence epigenetic and metabolic imprints on cartilage repair and regenerative medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Twenty-four hours after pellet formation, the culture media was replaced with chondrogenic media consisting of DMEM-high glucose media (Gibco), 1% ITS (Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium) premix, 40 µg/ml <sc>L</sc>-proline, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1× nonessential amino acids, 1× Glutamax, 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, and 0.1 µM dexamethasone, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, and human recombinant BMP-2 (100 ng/ml, Peprotech) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guzzo and Drissi, 2015</xref>). Chondrogenic media and growth factor were changed every other day until the end of 21 days of chondrogenic differentiation. Cell pellets were harvested at 0, 7, 14, and 21 days of differentiation and analyzed for gene expression using SYBRGreen qPCR assay.</p><p>Chondrogenic differentiation was also performed using adherent micromass method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guzzo and Drissi, 2015</xref>). The micromass of AC- and OA-iMSCs was prepared by culturing the cells in high density (25 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per 10 μl drop) in 6-well culture plates. Immediately after seeding the micromasses, MSC growth medium was carefully added dropwise from the edges of the plate to prevent dehydration of micromass. These micromasses were incubated for 4–6 hr at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and then supplemented with 2 ml of MSC growth medium and cultured for 24 hr. Then MSC growth media was replaced with chondrogenic media and differentiation was continued for 21 days. Micromass culture was harvested at different days of chondrogenic differentiation and processed for either RNA isolation or fixed with formalin for Alcian blue staining. Formalin-fixed micromass cultures were stained with 1% Alcian blue in acetic acid, pH 2.5 and proteoglycans levels were measured by imaging the blue colonies using automated microscope (BioTek Lionheart LX).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Osteogenic and adiopogenic differentiation of iMSCs</title><p>To establish the multilineage potential of the iMSCs, we next assessed the ability of AC- and OA-iMSCs to differentiate into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages in vitro.

Pellets from both AC- and OA-iMSCs were isolated at 0, 7, 14, and 21 days of chondrogenic differentiation and total RNA was isolated using miRNeasy Kits. On-Column DNase digestion was performed to remove genomic DNA contamination. RNA quality was checked using Nanodrop and the RNA integrity was determined by Agilent 2200 Bioanalyzer, and the RNA integrity number values were &gt;7 for all samples. Libraries were prepared from 250 ng RNA using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) using the Poly A enrichment method. Sequencing was carried out using the NovaSeq PE 150 system (Novogene UC Davis Sequencing Center, Novogene Corporation Inc). Raw data were exported in FASTQ (fq) format and quality control was performed for error rate and GC content distribution, and data filtering was performed to remove low-quality reads or reads with adaptors. The clean reads were mapped to human reference genome (GRCh38) and differential gene expression (DEG) analysis was performed using DESeq2 method and pairwise gene expression levels were calculated using RPKM (read per kilobase of transcript sequence per millions base pairs sequenced) value.

Do epigenetically unmodified AC-iPSCs acquire an OA-iPSC-like epigenetic and metabolic marks and diminished regenerative capacity when exposed to inflammatory/pathologic conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional analysis addressing this question. When exposed to either IL1β, or TNF-α, AC-iPSCs derived iMSCs (AC-iMSCs) showed increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (<italic>CCL3, CXCL3, and PTGS2)</italic> as compared to vehicle-treated controls. Interestingly, inflammatory stimulation resulted in significantly higher levels of induction for markers of inflammation in OA-iMSCs as compared to AC-iMSCs. These new data further support our premise that OA-iPSCs retain a memory of disease from the tissue of origin derived from OA cartilage (Supplementary Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on your findings, can you elaborate on potential epigenetic modifications that can be introduced in AC-iPSCs to resist pathologic change and retain their regenerative capacity in a hostile environment</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the generation of OA-iPSCs and the functional and transcriptomic characterization of these novel lines present an important step towards establishing an experimental in vitro model to study disease mechanisms. Further evaluation of the epigenetic landscapes between OA-iPSCs and AC-iPSCs may reveal specific changes in the methylome or histone modifications that can be targeted to correct the skewing of OA-iMSCs to provide an equal chondrogenic or immunomodulatory potentials to that of healthy cartilage derived iMSCs. Among various epigenetic marks expressed in AC- vs OA-iMSCs, the upstream transcription factor analysis identified several candidate regulators such as FOXM1, IRF3, FOXP1 and MYBL2 (Supplementary Figure 4). We envision a multitude of follow-up studies aimed at thoroughly examining DNA promoter methylation status, as well as chromatin organization (loss/gain of active versus repressive marks) to identify potential regulatory sites that could be targeted to resist pathologic change and retain regenerative capacity. Our future investigations may also focus on modifying specific metabolic pathways that can normalize chromatin landscapes between these two cell types. We raise these points in the discussion acknowledging that the epigenetic modifications that occur in OA chondrocytes are likely involving a multitude of events such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, as well as miRNA, and which may be inter-connected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We also report the replicate number for each representative image. A minimum of 3 biological samples were used in each experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please elaborate on potential limitations encountered in this research, including inherent in vitro differentiation or technical limitations</p></disp-quote><p>We derived iMSC-like populations to circumvent heterogeneous differentiation outcomes from naïve iPSCs. Relative to other published approaches, we have established a simple, yet highly efficient protocol for iMSC differentiation to the chondrogenic lineage. However, we acknowledge that the challenges associated with generating a homogenous population of non-hypertrophic chondrocytes from iPSCs persist. It is notable that <italic>COL10A1</italic> expression was observed only with BMP2 stimulation in chondrogenic differentiation media and was not observed when TGFβ3 was used to induce chondrogenic differentiation in our cultures. Other groups have reported a highly stringent approach for human iPSCdifferentiation into chondrocytes with an articular-like phenotype, with low COL10A1 matrix deposition using a complex cocktail of growth factors (WNT, activin-A/Nodal, TGF-b, FGF, PDGF, BMP2). In next steps, we may be applying these strategies to evaluate differential propensity of AC-iPSCs vs OA-iPSC for differentiation to an articular-like chondrocyte phenotype.</p><p>While both AC- and OA-iMSCs have developmental plasticity, their chondrogenic differentiation pattern and differentiation efficiency was different from each other’s which pose technical limitation during neck-to-neck comparison. Although pellet culture used here is a very common method of chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs, it possessed technical limitations of heterogeneity during staining of the chondrogenic-specific matrix in the histological analysis of these macroscopic pellets. Moreover, intensity of safranin-O staining of proteoglycan matrix is uneven from periphery to center which poses another challenge for quantification of matrix deposition in the culture of AC- vs OA-iMSCs. Additionally, GWAS studies have revealed multiple SNPs in genes involved in OA pathogenesis. We have not yet investigated whether the generated iPSC lines harbor OA-associated sequence variants.</p><p>Despite these limitations, our comprehensive functional, and transcriptomic analyses support the notion that OA-specific iPSC lines may be useful in vitro tools for studying the underlying molecular, metabolic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in OA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Several comments to be addressed in this manuscript, or future manuscripts, include.</p><p>- It would be interesting to examine Prg4 expression in both healthy and OA iPSC cultures, if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the Reviewer’s suggestion, we analyzed the expression of the hallmark marker of articular chondrocytes, PRG4 (lubricin) in healthy versus OA-iMSCs over a time course of chondrogenic differentiation (days 7, 14, 21). Interestingly, our quantitative PCR analyses revealed significantly higher levels of PRG4 transcripts in AC-iMSCs as compared to OA-iMSCs at all time points analyzed. This new finding is consistent with the elevated expressions of gene markers of immature chondrocytes (<italic>SOX9, COL2A1</italic>, <italic>ACAN),</italic> suggesting that iPSC derived from healthy chondrocytes have a significantly higher chondrogenic potential as compared to OA-iPSC. These data also suggest increased differentiation of chondrocytes with articular-like chondrocyte phenotype in AC-iMSCs as compared to OAiMSCs. These new data appear in Figure 3C of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It would also be interesting to examine cell-surface markers for three subsets of skeletal stem and progenitor populations (integrin α V (CD51)+Thy-1 (CD90)−); mouse skeletal stem cells (mSSCs) (CD105−CD200+), pre-bone, cartilage and stromal progenitors (pre-BCSPs) (CD105−CD200−), and bone, cartilage and stromal progenitors (BCSPs) (CD105+).

Identification of skeletal stem and progenitor populations require an in-depth characterization of these iPSC lines including multiple assays such as flow characterization by FACS analysis, colony formation assays and expansion assay in local microenvironment etc. Further, studies from mice have indicated that the SSC phenotype does not stably persist in cell culture, therefore, we believe that in order to appropriately define differences in the progenitor/stem cell pools we need to perform in depth in vitro and in vivo lineage tracing assessments to identify the percent population of these SSCs in AC vs OA-iMSCs which we will thoroughly examine in our follow-up study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It may be of future interest to measure some of the important epigenetic and metabolic marks in the OA patient-derived and healthy donor-derived iPSC lines as well as to know if the iPS cells also have the same characteristic of mesenchymal stem cells from OA patients.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that a comprehensive analysis to identify changes in epigenetic marks, as well as the metabolic marks between OA- versus healthy cartilage derived iPSCs will be informative towards establishing a memory of disease status. Comparative analysis of genome-wide chromatin accessibility (ATACseq), DNA methylation, and untargeted metabolomics between OA-iPSCs and healthy donor derived iPSCs will identify epigenetic and metabolic changes that contribute to reduced chondrogenic differentiation potential in OA-iPSCs, and will be pursued in follow-up studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The findings from this research significantly contribute towards the field of regenerative medicine and cartilage biology.

Our quantitative PCR analyses revealed that transcripts levels of osteogenic genes such <italic>RUNX2, OSX, COL1A1</italic> was higher at 7 days in comparison to undifferentiated iMSCs levels (day 0). The transcript level of these genes was further increased to day 14 and day 21 of osteogenic differentiation. Interestingly, the expression of these osteogenic genes in AC-iMSCs was not statistically significant when compared to OA-iMSCs at all time points analyzed. This new finding is consistent with the Alizarin red staining showing that AC- and OA-iMSCs exhibit similarities in osteogenic differentiation. These data were shown in Supplementary Figure 1C of revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
