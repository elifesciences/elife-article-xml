We found, however, that replacement of <italic>DBP1</italic> with a common selection cassette in budding yeast led to reduced expression and function for the adjacent gene, <italic>MRP51</italic>, despite all <italic>MRP51</italic> coding and regulatory sequences remaining intact. Cassette-induced repression of MRP51 drove all mutant phenotypes detected in cells deleted for <italic>DBP1</italic>. This behavior resembled the ‘neighboring gene effect’ (NGE), a phenomenon of unknown mechanism whereby cassette insertion at one locus reduces the expression of a neighboring gene. Here, we leveraged strong off-target mutant phenotypes resulting from cassette replacement of <italic>DBP1</italic> to provide mechanistic insight into the NGE. We found that the inherent bidirectionality of promoters, including those in expression cassettes, drives a divergent transcript that represses <italic>MRP51</italic> through combined transcriptional interference and translational repression mediated by production of a long undecoded transcript isoform (LUTI). Divergent transcript production driving this off-target effect is general to yeast expression cassettes and occurs ubiquitously with insertion. Despite this, off-target effects are often naturally prevented by local sequence features, such as those that terminate divergent transcripts between the site of cassette insertion and the neighboring gene. Thus, cassette-induced off-target effects can be eliminated by the insertion of transcription terminator sequences into the cassette, flanking the promoter. Because the driving features of this off-target effect are broadly conserved, our study suggests it should be considered in the design and interpretation of experiments using integrated expression cassettes in other eukaryotic systems, including human cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genome editing</kwd><kwd>neighboring gene effect</kwd><kwd>bidirectional transcription</kwd><kwd>alternative transcripts</kwd><kwd>transcriptional interference</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM134886</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brar</surname><given-names>Gloria Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM128802</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jovanovic</surname><given-names>Marko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Powers</surname><given-names>Emily Nicole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bidirectional promoter activity, which is inherent to the promoters of selection cassettes used for genome editing, causes divergent transcription that can disrupt expression of genes neighboring cassette insertion sites, causing potent off-target effects.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genome engineering to create targeted gene deletions, mutations, reporter constructs, and epitope-tagged proteins is a key strategy for the mechanistic dissection of almost any biological process. Budding yeast was the first eukaryotic organism in which this became highly facile, thanks to the development of a one-step PCR-based editing strategy, frequently used with a shared toolkit of selection cassettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Longtine et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wach et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wach et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baudin et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lorenz et al., 1995</xref>). These tools became common, routinely used by thousands of labs as well as to enable large global endeavors, such as creation of the yeast deletion collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giaever et al., 2002</xref>). Because of the high fidelity, ease of use, and rapid nature of this selection-mediated strategy, it has remained commonplace despite the development of methods allowing non-selection-marked mutations that include CRISPR/Cas9-based editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Güldener et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gray et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>While selection-mediated editing strategies have been used to advance countless discoveries, their utility relies on the assumption that insertion of a selection cassette at one locus will not disrupt the expression of neighboring genes. However, analyses of mutant phenotypes detected in global studies of the collection of strains in which each non-essential yeast ORF is replaced with a kanMX cassette revealed effects that appeared to result from neighboring gene mis-regulation, termed ‘the neighboring gene effect’ (NGE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Shitrit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atias et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Egorov et al., 2021</xref>). This is caused by overlap of the deleted ORF with a regulatory region for the neighboring gene in a subset of cases, as just one of several problems that resulted from the large-scale nature of the effort required to create the deletion collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Shitrit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hughes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Teng et al., 2013</xref>). However, most cases of the NGE remain unexplained, and this lack of mechanistic understanding makes it unclear how prevalent this effect is in traditional small-scale laboratory studies, and how to prevent it.</p><p>It is now understood that genomic loci can have complex and linked transcriptional outputs, even in yeast. For example, activity from one transcription start site (TSS) can interfere with the output of nearby TSSs in an adjacent sense or antisense configuration, and that most, if not all, promoters are bidirectionally active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Teodorovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Neil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Preker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Core et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Seila et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jin et al., 2017</xref>). Transcription interference is seen in diverse organisms, including yeast and human cells, and can occur between TSSs driving coding or non-coding RNAs and controlling both transcript isoform identity and transcript levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hirschman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martens et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van Werven et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hongay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hausler and Somerville, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhya and Gottesman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Proudfoot, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boussadia et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emerman and Temin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Corbin and Maniatis, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Struhl, 1985</xref>). It has also been shown that more than one TSS is often present at a single locus, even in the simple budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pelechano et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Transcription interference between TSSs within the same genomic locus is an important feature of a naturally occurring type of regulation dependent on <underline>l</underline>ong <underline>u</underline>ndecoded <underline>t</underline>ranscript <underline>i</underline>soforms (LUTIs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). For genes regulated by this strategy, 5′ extended LUTIs are transcribed in place of canonical mRNAs to temporally downregulate protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Van Dalfsen et al., 2018</xref>). Here, use of an upstream alternate TSS represses transcription from the canonical TSS in cis via transcriptional interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chia et al., 2017</xref>). In concert, translation of the main ORF-encoded protein products from LUTIs are repressed by translation of competitive AUG-initiated upstream ORFs (uORFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wethmar, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbosa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hinnebusch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Law et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>). Natural LUTI-based regulation has been shown to modulate gene expression for many genes during meiosis and the unfolded protein response in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Van Dalfsen et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, features of LUTI-based regulation are highly conserved across eukaryotes, and evidence suggests the presence of this regulation in more complex species, such as humans and algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hollerer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sehgal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moseley et al., 2002</xref>). Here, we show that insertion of expression cassettes commonly used edit the genomes of yeast cells, can induce the repression of neighboring genes though synthetic and constitutive LUTI-based repression.</p><p>In particular, we report that selection-cassette replacement of the ORF for <italic>DBP1</italic> causes mis-regulation of the adjacent gene, <italic>MRP51</italic>, despite no changes to the <italic>MRP51</italic> coding or regulatory regions, as a result of synthetic LUTI-based repression. All phenotypes we observed in cells with a cassette-mediated deletion of the <italic>DBP1</italic> ORF were caused by mis-regulation of <italic>MRP51</italic>, rather than loss of <italic>DBP1</italic>, consistent with an NGE. We leveraged the strong off-target effects observed with cassette-mediated replacement of <italic>DBP1</italic> to interrogate the mechanism driving this phenomenon. We find that cassette-mediated off-target effects were general to all expression cassettes that we inserted at the <italic>DBP1</italic> locus and are driven by the bidirectional cassette promoter activity now understood to be inherent to eukaryotic promoters.</p><p>These data point to an undesirable feature of expression cassette insertion that is currently being overlooked in the design of genome-editing approaches. While we find that stable cassette-driven divergent transcripts were detected in ~30% of cassette-inserted loci, all cassette-inserted loci have detectable divergent transcripts in cells lacking nuclear exosome-mediated RNA decay. Thus, our data suggest that divergent transcription results ubiquitously from expression cassette insertion, but features—including transcription termination sequences adjacent to cassette insertion—can naturally mitigate off-target neighboring gene mis-regulation. Because it is difficult to predict from sequence information alone whether a locus will be sensitive to neighboring gene mis-regulation, we designed improved expression cassettes containing an additional terminator sequence flanking the promoter, which prevents neighboring gene disruption. Use of such cassettes should improve the specificity of engineered mutant strains for future studies. More broadly, our study uncovers a mechanism by which genome engineering can drive neighboring gene mis-expression, and that warrants consideration in the design of future studies in yeast, as well as other eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Insertion of a resistance cassette at the <italic>DBP1</italic> locus causes aberrant transcription and reduced protein production from <italic>MRP51,</italic> a neighboring gene</title><p>We had previously observed upregulation of the Dbp1 RNA helicase in meiotic yeast cells, coincident with downregulation of its paralog, Ded1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brar et al., 2012</xref>). Ded1 is important for translation initiation, and has been well studied under conditions of mitotic exponential growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de la Cruz et al., 1997</xref>). In contrast, the role of Dbp1 has remained less clear, partially a result of its absent or low expression under commonly studied laboratory conditions. Based on the identity of Dbp1 as an RNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jamieson and Beggs, 1991</xref>), we predicted that Dbp1 could have a role in regulating gene expression during meiosis. To test this, we deleted <italic>DBP1</italic> by replacing the ORF (from start to stop codon) with a standard cassette-encoding Geneticin (G418) resistance, amplified from the pFA6a-kanMX6 plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Longtine et al., 1998</xref>), in the SK1 budding yeast strain background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Padmore et al., 1991</xref>). We then compared gene expression profiles of wild-type and <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells during meiosis, using ribosome profiling and mRNA-sequencing (mRNA-seq). To our surprise, <italic>MRP51</italic>, the gene located directly adjacent to <italic>DBP1</italic>, exhibited a profound decrease in translation in the <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> strain relative to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Translation of <italic>MRP51</italic> was 8.4-fold lower in <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells despite a 1.8-fold increase in <italic>MRP51</italic> mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). These changes reflected a 15-fold decrease in <italic>MRP51</italic> translation efficiency (TE) in the <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells compared to the wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; TE: ribosome footprint RPKM/mRNA RPKM) and led to a reduction in Mrp51 protein level compared to wild-type, as assessed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Because of the close genomic proximity of these genes, we hypothesized that this change in TE could be due to cis- effects from the <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> insertion rather than reflecting regulation of <italic>MRP51</italic> by Dbp1 protein. Upon closer examination of the mRNA transcripts produced at this locus, we found that replacing the <italic>DBP1</italic> ORF with the kanMX6 resistance cassette led to production of a 5′ extended <italic>MRP51</italic> mRNA compared to that in wild-type cells. The extended transcript contained 3 AUG-initiated uORFs not present on the wild-type transcript, which were translated at the expense of the <italic>MRP51</italic> ORF in <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Insertion of a resistance cassette at the <italic>DBP1</italic> locus causes aberrant transcription and reduced protein production from the neighboring <italic>MRP51</italic> gene.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Translation (ribosome profiling, footprint) and (<bold>B</bold>) mRNA abundance (mRNA-seq) reads per kilobase million mapped reads (RPKM) for every ORF expressed in wild-type and <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells is plotted.

Here, the primary difference was that repression of <italic>MRP51</italic> expression appeared to occur constitutively as result of kanMX6 insertion at the neighboring <italic>DBP1</italic> ORF, rather than resulting from temporally regulated toggling between two TSSs.</p><p>We were surprised to observe this dramatic off-target mis-regulation because of the widespread and long-term use of cassette-mediated gene deletion and the detailed quality control measures that were used in construction of our strains to prevent off-target effects caused by background mutations or improper cassette insertion. To confirm aberrant <italic>MRP51</italic> regulation was not an artifact of our strain, experimental conditions, or selection cassette, we analyzed a published ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq dataset comparing wild-type and <italic>dbp1Δ</italic> cells of the S288C budding yeast background. These <italic>dbp1Δ</italic> cells were generated by replacement of the <italic>DBP1</italic> ORF with a cassette-encoding resistance to Hygromycin (<italic>dbp1Δ::hphMX4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sen et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with our data, insertion of hphMX4 to replace the <italic>DBP1</italic> ORF caused mis-regulation of the adjacent gene <italic>MRP51</italic>. Despite levels of the Mrp51-encoding transcript remaining similar to wild-type in <italic>dbp1Δ::hphMX4</italic> cells, translation of <italic>MRP51</italic> was decreased 4.4-fold in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). The 3.7-fold decrease in TE of <italic>MRP51</italic> in <italic>dbp1Δ::hphMX4</italic> cells in this study led to the interpretation that the canonical <italic>MRP51</italic> transcript is highly dependent on Dbp1 for its translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sen et al., 2019</xref>). A closer look at the transcripts produced from this locus, however, revealed the presence of a 5′-extended <italic>MRP51</italic> LUTI in the <italic>dbp1Δ::hphMX4</italic> cells, like the one we had observed. This 5′ extended <italic>MRP51</italic> transcript contained competitive AUG-initiated uORFs that were translated in place of the <italic>MRP51</italic> ORF, as in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Polysome analysis of <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells during meiosis demonstrated that overall translation rates were diminished relative to wild-type cells, as determined by lower polysome peaks in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; right, fractions 5 and 6).

Polysome traces also indicated differences in the accumulation of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) species roughly the size of the cytoplasmic large 60S subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; LSU, fraction 3) and a decrease in cytoplasmic small 40S subunit signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; SSU, fraction 2). We performed label-free mass spectrometry on fractionated wild-type and <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> polysomes and used hierarchical clustering of the data to assess global differences in polysome composition. We found that a prominent cluster of proteins enriched in fraction 3 of polysomes from <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells compared to wild-type was highly enriched for the mitochondrial large ribosome subunit (mt-LSU). This cluster contained 34 of the 42 proteinaceous mt-LSU components quantified in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; left). Further analysis of fraction 3 revealed that every mitochondrial 54S protein quantified was enriched in <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells compared to the wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These data suggest the accumulated RNP observed in <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells is the mt-LSU. A previous study from our laboratory observed that when individual cytoplasmic SSU proteins are lost, free cytoplasmic 60S LSUs accumulate, presumably a result of their inability to find an SSU to complex with and form fully assembled 80S species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>). The build-up of free mt-LSU in <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells, which express lower amounts of mitochondrial small subunit (mt-SSU) component Mrp51 is reminiscent of that effect. Furthermore, we identified a small cluster of cytoplasmically translated mitochondrial proteins that were decreased in <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> high polysome fractions compared to wild-type, hinting at effects of broader mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These data suggested the cassette-mediated mis-regulation of <italic>MRP51</italic> in <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells may have been responsible for the mutant phenotypes we observed, rather than loss of Dbp1 protein.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cassette-driven mis-regulation of <italic>MRP51</italic> causes off-target mutant phenotypes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Label-free mass spectrometry of fractionated polysomes from wild-type and <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells during meiosis (4 hr in sporulation media).

Based on the apparent mitochondrial defects observed in the mass spectrometry data, we hypothesized that <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells would grow poorly in conditions in which elevated mitochondrial function is required. Consistently, <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells exhibited severe growth defects in media containing only non-fermentable carbon sources, such as glycerol or acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Additionally, growth defects were evident in <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells grown in rich media (YEP dextrose or sucrose) during post-diauxic growth stages, after saturated cultures have exhausted fermentable carbon source availability and begin to utilize ethanol through respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To determine whether these phenotypes were due to cassette-induced <italic>MRP51</italic> mis-regulation or loss of Dbp1 protein, we tested whether they could be rescued by exogenous expression of either Dbp1 or Mrp51. All <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> growth defects observed in conditions requiring elevated mitochondrial function remained similar with and without exogenous Dbp1 expression. In contrast, exogenous expression of Mrp51 rescued all previously observed respiratory growth defects of the <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> strain, confirming these phenotypes resulted from disrupted expression of Mrp51, rather than lack of Dbp1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).</p><p>We next assessed whether other observed phenotypes in <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells were due to off-target mis-regulation of <italic>MRP51</italic> or loss of Dbp1 protein. The sporulation defect observed in <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells was not rescued by exogenous Dbp1 but was fully rescued by exogenous Mrp51 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Based on these results, we propose that this defect results from the dependency of meiotic cells on respiratory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jambhekar and Amon, 2008</xref>). Finally, polysome profiles of <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells exogenously expressing Mrp51 looked similar to wild-type polysomes while polysomes from <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells with or without exogenous expression of Dbp1 were indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In light of these data, we conclude that the reduced bulk cytoplasmic translation phenotypes observed in <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells reflected a cellular response to mitochondrial dysfunction due to off-target Mrp51 mis-regulation rather than loss of Dbp1 protein. Mitochondrial dysfunction and translation rates have both previously been shown to impact the TOR pathway and thus influence global translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jazwinski, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Raught et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Topf et al., 2019</xref>), consistent with our findings.</p><p>To ensure that the inability of Dbp1 to rescue phenotypes in <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells was not due to a lack of exogenous expression, we compared Dbp1 levels from the endogenous and exogenous loci. Western blot analysis revealed that the level of Dbp1 expressed from the exogenous integration was highly similar to that of the endogenous locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). We conclude that resistance cassette insertion at the <italic>DBP1</italic> locus is sufficient to cause widespread off-target phenotypes by mis-regulation of Mrp51. These data raised concerns, given the widespread use of expression cassette insertion in genome editing and were consistent with the phenomena of the NGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Shitrit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atias et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Egorov et al., 2021</xref>), identified by analysis of deletion collection mutant phenotypes. While these results were disappointing for our study of the function of Dbp1 helicase, they highlighted this locus as a useful context to dissect the mechanism behind, and ideally to fix, these poorly understood cassette-related side effects.</p><p>To assess whether cassette-driven off-target effects were common to a specific feature of the kanMX6 and hphMX4 cassettes, we replaced the <italic>DBP1</italic> ORF in wild-type cells with two additional cassettes, including one (natMX6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) that shared the <italic>pTEF</italic> and <italic>tTEF</italic> regulatory regions with kanMX6 and hphMX4 and one (<italic>TRP1</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) that did not and is relatively lowly expressed. Insertion of either additional cassette led to a growth defect in non-fermentable carbon source compared to wild-type cells that was similar to that seen with kanMX6 insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). As all reported cases of NGE have represented gene replacements with the commonly used kanMX modules, it was previously unclear whether this effect simply represented a problematic feature of kanMX. Our data indicate that the aberrant-transcript-driven mis-regulation of <italic>MRP51</italic> is a general consequence of expression cassette insertion rather than a specific result of any sparticular cassette feature .</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Transcription-terminator-flanked cassettes prevent adjacent gene mis-regulation</title><p>We reasoned that if the expression cassette inserted at the <italic>DBP1</italic> locus drove transcription that altered neighboring gene expression, ‘insulation’ of neighboring genomic regions from transcriptional activity of the cassette should prevent these off-target effects. Toward this end, we placed strong transcription terminator sequences flanking both ends of the resistance cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Song et al., 2016</xref>). This included placing a portion of the <italic>DEG1</italic> terminator 5′ to the <italic>TEF</italic> promoter, and either the same <italic>DEG1</italic> terminator or the <italic>CYC1</italic> terminator sequence 3′ to the <italic>TEF</italic> terminator within the kanMX6 cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Finally, 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′RACE) confirmed that the <italic>MRP51</italic> transcript produced in the <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6-ins</italic> strains was the same as that seen in wild-type cells, as opposed to the synthetic <italic>MRP51</italic> LUTI in the initial cassette-inserted strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).

Because bidirectional transcription has been shown to occur from most, if not all, promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Neil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wei et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Teodorovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Preker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Core et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Seila et al., 2008</xref>), and the observed aberrant transcript originated from the promoter-proximal end of the cassette, we hypothesized that bidirectional promoter activity from the <italic>TEF</italic> promoter was the most likely cause of <italic>MRP51</italic> LUTI-based repression. Consistent with this model, both <italic>S. cerevisiae pTEF1</italic> and <italic>pTRP1</italic> display bidirectional activity at their endogenous loci, as determined by tiling array analysis and nascent transcript sequencing (NETseq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>).

Considering these data, and the knowledge that shared homology between cassettes can reduce the efficiency of targeted insertions when used sequentially, we constructed two more ‘insulated’ cassettes containing only a single additional terminator (<italic>tDEG1</italic> or <italic>tCYC1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Song et al., 2016</xref>) flanking each promoter and sharing no regulatory sequences with each other.

All analyzed mutants contained a single ORF replaced with either the kanMX6 or natMX6 resistance cassettes and samples were collected during mitotic exponential growth. mRNA-seq data revealed stable divergent transcripts stemming from cassette-mediated gene replacements at 5 of these 19 loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–E</xref>). For all five of these examples, the aberrant transcript was driven from the 5′ end of the resistance cassette, like in <italic>dbp1Δ::kanMX6</italic> cells (Figure 1E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–E</xref>), and consistent with a model whereby bidirectional transcription from the cassette promoter drives aberrant neighboring transcripts. However, unlike the strong mis-regulation of <italic>MRP51</italic> seen with <italic>DBP1</italic> ORF replacement, these divergent transcription events had no obvious effect on the translation of adjacent genes, and a lack of apparent uORF translation in the extended 5′ mRNA regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). For four of these new cases in which aberrant transcription resulted from a cassette-based deletion, the adjacent gene was positioned in the same orientation as the aberrant TSS thus it would be possible for synthetic LUTI-based repression to occur as was observed for <italic>MRP51</italic>. Although, we also note that for three of these four cases, expression of the adjacent ORF was low, even in wild-type cells, and thus mis-regulation of these genes may be difficult to detect under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). For the last case, in which <italic>UPF1</italic> was replaced with the natMX6 cassette, an abundant cassette-induced divergent transcript was observed.

It subsequently became clear that an alternative transcription termination mechanism, the ‘NNS’ pathway—named for complex subunits Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1—leads to termination of most divergent transcripts and their rapid degradation by the Rrp6/exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gudipati et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Porrua and Libri, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wyers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schulz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Steinmetz et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>To test if Rrp6/exosome-mediated degradation was masking divergent transcripts produced from cassette insertion, we analyzed published global mRNA data from strain backgrounds with cassette insertions in an <italic>rrp6∆</italic> strain background.

Production of this divergent transcript drives both transcription interference and uORF-based translation repression for <italic>MRP51</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>). Because most, if not all, eukaryotic promoters are thought to be bidirectional, these data suggest that any inserted expression cassette containing a promoter could drive neighboring off-target effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Teodorovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Neil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Preker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Core et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Seila et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>How commonly does expression cassette insertion cause confounding mutant phenotypes? Confidence in the specificity of yeast genome-editing cassettes has motivated their widespread use, and many landmark studies defining the functions of conserved proteins have been performed using this approach. It is routine for multiple loci to be disrupted within the same strain to enable analysis of genetic interactions, and global yeast deletion, hypomorphic, and epitope tag collections were created by use of the kanMX insertion cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giaever et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Winzeler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Giaever and Nislow, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chu and Davis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Huh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Breslow et al., 2008</xref>). Despite the first reports of NGEs over 10 years ago, the original yeast cassettes remain widely used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Shitrit et al., 2012</xref>). One study that analyzed mutants generated with kanMX modules estimated that replacement at as many as 20% of loci may cause neighboring gene mis-regulation, and ~10% of deletion collection strains have been estimated to demonstrate non-specific phenotypes in genetic interaction data that could be attributed to neighboring gene mis-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Shitrit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atias et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Egorov et al., 2021</xref>). A recent study focused on protein quantification of each yeast deletion collection strain found that one of the most significant factors determining whether a specific protein’s abundance would change following deletion of a gene encoding another protein was whether the genes encoding the protein pair were genomic neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Messner et al., 2022</xref>). It is important to note that all previously reported examples of the NGE, including those noted here, focused only on integrations of kanMX modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Shitrit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atias et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Egorov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Makeeva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Messner et al., 2022</xref>). Our study determined that NGEs are driven by cassettes of disparate sequence. This observation allowed us to determine that the promoter bidirectionality that is inherent to eukaryotic promoters, rather than any feature of a particular cassette sequence, drives neighboring gene disruption. Thus, any expression cassette can cause disruptive NGEs, suggesting a much larger pool of potentially affected mutants than previously considered.</p><p>In fact, we found cassette-driven divergent transcripts to be produced at 100% of expression cassette-inserted loci analyzed, but they were often short and masked by exosome-mediated RNA decay. This suggests that additional features local to cassette insertion can prevent off-target phenotypes. Given that bidirectional promoter activity originating from cassettes drives neighboring gene disruption, there are two non-mutually exclusive explanations for why some loci would produce disruptive divergent transcripts and others would not. First, the different chromatin context at inserted loci may affect the bidirectional promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Struhl, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Porrua and Libri, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marquardt et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, bidirectional activity and divergent transcript production could occur at all loci, with off-target effects being prevented in many cases by local sequence characteristics. Our data do not exclude the possibility that chromatin context is a factor, but do suggest that the role of local sequence features in determining the span of divergent transcription is important. One such feature that may naturally prevent neighboring gene disruption at cassette-inserted loci are NNS termination signals, like those known to terminate and prevent endogenously produced divergent transcripts from interfering with neighboring genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Steinmetz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schulz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Porrua and Libri, 2015</xref>). Both NNS termination signals and canonical coding gene transcription termination sequences were sufficient to prevent to ‘insulate’ bidirectional promoters within selection cassettes inserted at the <italic>DBP1</italic> locus.</p><p>How do divergent transcripts from cassette-inserted loci drive off-target phenotypes? While we focused on the integrated transcription and translation regulation driven by LUTI-based disruption of <italic>MRP51</italic> in this study, mis-regulation of adjacent genes by cassette-driven transcription interference alone may be even more frequent. LUTI-based neighboring gene disruption requires the adjacent gene to be in a ‘head-to-head’ orientation, the presence of repressive uORFs upstream of the coding sequence, and a continuous divergent transcript containing the entire ORF of the repressed gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>). Cassette-driven transcription interference, however, can occur regardless of the presence of repressive uORFs upstream of the neighboring coding sequence, does not require the divergent transcript to be continuous over the neighboring ORF, and can act on genes in either orientation to the inserted cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hirschman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martens et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van Werven et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hongay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hausler and Somerville, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhya and Gottesman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Proudfoot, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boussadia et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emerman and Temin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Corbin and Maniatis, 1989</xref>). For example, in haploid cells, induction into meiosis is blocked by the expression of two separate non-coding RNAs that repress an antisense mRNA (<italic>RME2</italic>/<italic>IME4</italic>) or a downstream sense RNA (<italic>IRT1</italic>/<italic>IME1</italic>) via transcription interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hongay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van Werven et al., 2012</xref>). Transcription interference between loci can be effective over large distances, like the ~1800 nt span over which transcription of the repressive <italic>IRT1</italic> long non-coding RNA represses <italic>IME1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van Werven et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The type of cassette-mediated off-target effect in this study is difficult to detect or predict by sequence alone. No unexpected mutations exist in these cases and even mRNA measurements of neighboring genes are not diagnostic unless all possible transcript isoforms are measured from a given locus. Additionally, our data suggest that at as many as 70% of cassette-inserted loci, divergent transcripts are produced but degraded by the nuclear exosome, meaning that even the lack of an observable stable divergent transcript is not sufficient to conclude wild-type regulation from a cassette-adjacent gene because disruption can occur regardless of the transcript’s stability. Measuring translation or protein levels for adjacent genes should be diagnostic of this undesirable side effect, but ribosome profiling is not a routine experiment that is applied to most mutants, and tagging proteins can alter function and regulation. Additionally, as many genes are expressed in a condition-specific manner, measurement of the adjacent gene’s protein levels compared to wild-type may give false confidence unless the proper conditions are chosen. Consistently, we observed condition-specific manifestation of the cassette-driven divergent transcription at the <italic>DBP1/MRP51</italic> locus. For 3/5 additional potential NGE cases with detectable aberrant transcripts in exosome proficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), adjacent genes were lowly expressed, even in wild-type cells under the conditions surveyed. Considering the number of factors affecting whether cassette adjacent genes are mis-regulated, we argue that it is currently not possible to predict when and where cassette insertion would result in mis-regulation severe enough to mislead studies.</p><p>Despite this complexity, complementation-based rescue experiments—namely single-copy insertion of the deleted gene with its entire endogenous regulatory region at another locus—allowed us to identify the unexpected regulation in the case of <italic>DBP1</italic> disruption, and should be more commonly used to confirm phenotypes. However, for genome-wide experiments, those using cassettes for epitope tagging, or experiments in which genetic interactions between several genes are being investigated, this may not be feasible. Therefore, we created ‘insulated’ resistance cassettes containing transcription terminator sequences flanking the promoter, which prevent off-target effects and possible misinterpretation of mutant phenotypes. Other possible alternatives to avoiding these confounding off-target effects include methods that allow mutants to be isolated without expression cassette insertion. Seamless deletions such as those created with the CRISPR/Cas9 approach avoid cassette insertions, but can still result in changes to the local environment of adjacent genes, potentially resulting in off-target effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Güldener et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gray et al., 2005</xref>). For the case of a markerless CRISPR/Cas9-based deletion of the <italic>DBP1</italic> ORF, we observed translation of a previously untranslated ORF within the mutant transcript containing only the <italic>DBP1</italic> 5′ and 3′ UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). One could imagine that in cases like these, translation of novel ORFs could also cause misleading neomorphic mutant phenotypes, not linked to loss of function of the deleted ORF. These data highlight the point that even well controlled genomic changes can have unintended consequences on the translation of neighboring coding sequences, and emphasize the value of careful analysis of gene expression from loci neighboring those that are manipulated.</p><p>We note that two-step strategies to isolate mutants free of selection cassettes have been described but are often used the context of allowing subsequent re-use of auxotrophic markers and cassettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Güldener et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gray et al., 2005</xref>). One example of this uses the Cre/loxP system to excise resistance cassettes following mutation isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Güldener et al., 1996</xref>). While this strategy can prevent neighboring gene disruption by cassettes, it is slower and more labor intensive than a single step process, and thus may not be commonly utilized to its full potential. For example, in two datasets we analyzed for cassette-driven divergent transcripts in strain backgrounds deficient for exosome-mediated RNA decay, cassette integrated mutants contained flanking loxP sites that were not utilized to excise the cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). Use of a single-step ‘insulated’ cassette for genome editing maintains the efficiency of the originally designed system, while preventing the potentially catastrophic off-target effects that disruption of neighboring gene expression can cause.</p><p>While our study was limited to yeast, all the key factors behind the cassette-induced off-target effects described here are conserved in higher eukaryotes. Because of this, we hypothesize that genome-editing-driven transcriptional interference, including LUTI-based repression, is likely to occur in other organisms. It is now understood that promoters in yeast, mammals, and other eukaryotes are inherently bidirectional, but that evolution of local sequences to can limit transcription interference of adjacent genes by transcription termination of divergent transcripts within a short distance of their initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Teodorovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Neil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Seila et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schulz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnone, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Villa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ha et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ntini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almada et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Core et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). Although NNS-based termination does not prevent production of long stable divergent transcripts from bidirectional promoters in mammals, analogous evolution of early polyadenylation sites appears to have achieved the same result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schulz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ntini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almada et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Porrua and Libri, 2015</xref>). In both cases, the local context of promoters defines the degree to which they produce divergent transcripts with the ability to interfere with neighboring gene expression.</p><p>The bidirectional nature of commonly used expression cassette promoters, including <italic>pTEF</italic> in yeast, and the CMV, eEF1α, and SV40 promoters in mammalian systems, has long been known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Curtin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gidoni et al., 1985</xref>). However, consequences of this for their modular use in expression constructs do not yet seem to be widely considered. Early studies that established ‘minimal’ promoters for modular use in expression cassettes explicitly served to separate the transcript-generating feature of promoter regions from their native sequence context. Because local sequence features outside of these minimal promoter regions can limit the effects of divergent transcription, and insertion of a terminator flanking inserted promoter sequences can serve a similar function, our study suggests this simple fix to prevent cassette-based off-target effects in future studies. Our study also emphasizes the need for proper controls to establish causality of observed phenotypes to the intended mutation, even when using precision genome engineering approaches in yeast and other organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Scintillation was counted for 2 min and the <sup>35</sup>S incorporation rates were derived from counts per minute normalized to cell density between samples and to wild-type measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Design and testing of insulated selection cassettes</title><p>Based on the previous report that the <italic>DEG1</italic> and <italic>CYC1</italic> terminators can be used as insulator sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Song et al., 2016</xref>), we amplified these terminators from wild-type yeast and placed them into the 5′ and 3′ ends of the pFA6a-kanMX6 backbone using gibson assembly. Insulators were placed just inside the standard F1 and R1 primer amplification sites such that they would be useable with any primers designed to the previous system (pFA6a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Longtine et al., 1998</xref>). Insulated plasmids were fully sequenced over cloning junctions and the entire region to be amplified and integrated into yeast during transformation. To test the ability of these insulators to prevent aberrant transcription at the <italic>DBP1</italic> locus, the kanMX6-ins cassettes were amplified and transformed into yeast exactly as had been done for the previous kanMX6 selection cassettes used in this study. When used to replace <italic>DBP1</italic> ORF, Mrp51-3v5 levels and 5′ RACE confirmed the efficacy of the kanMX6-ins cassettes in preventing aberrant LUTI regulation of <italic>MRP51</italic>. We then replaced kan<sup>r</sup> in the insulated plasmids with three additional markers for selection (including <italic>S. pombe HIS5</italic> amplified from pFA6a-HIS3MX6): complements <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> his3, <italic>TRP1</italic> amplified from pFA6a-TRP1, and nat<sup>r</sup> such that they can be used conveniently in combination as was done for the original toolkit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Longtine et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wach et al., 1994</xref>). To clone kanMX6-ins6 primers were used to amplify the entire kanMX6-ins2 except for the 3′ tCYC1 terminator and the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit was used to circularize the plasmid. For natMX6-ins7 a gBlocks Gene Fragment containing the <italic>PGK1</italic> promoter and terminator from <italic>C. glabrata</italic> expressing nat<sup>r</sup> and 5′ flanked by the <italic>S. cerevisiae CYC1</italic> terminator was cloned into the pFA6a backbone. Detailed descriptions of these plasmids and can be found in Key resources table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>5′ RACE</title><p>5′ RACE was performed with total RNA extracted from samples using phenol–chloroform precipitation and the GeneRacer Kit with SuperScript III RT and Topo TA Cloning Kit for Sequencing. For each sample, 4.8 µg of total RNA was used. Random primers were used to reverse transcribe the decapped cDNA library. The 5′ ends of the <italic>MRP51</italic> cDNA were then amplified using the GeneRacer 5′ primer and a reverse gene-specific primer (5′ <named-content content-type="sequence">ACCGTCCAAGCAACTCTGCCAATGTC </named-content>3′) in a reaction with Platinum <italic>Taq</italic> High Fidelity DNA Polymerase. Amplified 5′ ends were then cloned into a Topo TA Cloning vector and clones were miniprepped and sequenced using Sanger sequencing. SnapGene was used to visualize and align the sequenced cDNA ends to the corresponding genomic position.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Materials availability</title><p>All newly created materials are available upon request.

For all of the growth curves shown in Figure 2 and its supplement, we would be better able to assess the growth if the Y axis was a log scale since the cells are presumably growing exponentially. In addition, it's possible that the cell size or clumpiness of the mutants is different compared to wild type in a way that might affect the OD600 reading.</p><p>5. Figure 2 and supplement – The authors present convincing data that the mutant phenotypes observed in their dbp2 knockouts are not complemented by the integration of an exogenous copy of DBP2. However, in some sense, this is negative data, the failure to rescue the mutant phenotype. There are some additional strains whose analysis would be informative. Most obviously, if the dbp1 deletion phenotypes are really caused by reduced expression of MRP51, then integration of a second copy of MRP51 would be very strongly predicted to rescue the dpb1 deletion mutant phenotypes. Second, one would expect that the dpb1 and mrp51 deletions would have similar phenotypes, depending on how much residual Mrp51 remains in the dpb1 deletion.</p><p>6. For the experiment in Figure 2F, were opposite orientations examined for these cassettes?

In the text the authors give their reconfigured cassette a simple and clear name – KANMX-ins. Therefore, for Figure 4 and its supplement, it would be clearer if the &quot;KANMX-ins&quot; name was used for the labels instead of the more complex name that is used.</p><p>The comments above should be addressed by experimental or writing changes. The key experiment that should be included pertains to comment 5 above. That will test whether the integration of an ectopic copy of MRP51 rescues the dpb1 deletion phenotype and whether the dpb1 deletion phenotype mimics that of an mrp51 deletion. Both of these would greatly fortify the conclusion that the dpb1 phenotype is caused by reduced mrp51 expression.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Suggestions for the authors for the presentation of their study.</p><p>General: if possible, please make clear at the level of individual figures and legends that all presented observations are reproducible. Examples would be if growth curves are n=2, potentially show both or show average and range, and state in figure legend instead of methods; for western blot quantification please indicate what the quantification represents – a single representative of experiment done more than once or an average of multiple experiments? If more than one, please add an error or range to the values. If one but representative, please state explicitly.</p><p>1. Line 191. &quot;Together these data indicate that cassette replacement of the DBP1 ORF drives aberrant transcription independent of strain, cassette selection identity, and experimental conditions. Instead, the observed misregulation of MRP51 appears to be a general side-effect of the cassette-insertion.&quot;</p><p>This statement is too strong. In the experiment shown, two marker cassettes that may or may not be related are tested, apparently in the identical orientation. It is not clear if hygMX4 is the standard name for this marker. Is what is meant hphMX4? hphMX4 and kanMX6 will both use TEF promoter and terminator and in the case here, it appears that both markers were used in the same orientation, which as we learn later is likely critical for the mechanism, though not explicitly tested. This means that conclusion that the effect is general for cassette insertion has not been demonstrated, and potentially would not even be expected (based on the understood mechanism).</p><p>2. In Several places &quot;believe&quot; is used. Consider &quot;propose&quot; &quot;argue&quot; &quot;hypothesize&quot; &quot;favor&quot; in place.</p><p>3. line 296 &quot;Insertion of every resistance cassette tested lead to a similar growth defect in a non-fermentable carbon source (Figure 2F), a phenotype which was not dependent on Dbp1 (Figure 2B).&quot;</p><p>In the manuscript, as currently written, the concept of bidirectional transcription directed from the marker promoter is left to mention later. Since the tested markers share attributes, the bidirectional model is an attractive explanation at this position in the manuscript and a straightforward test of the proposed mechanism would be to use the markers in the opposite orientation. This experiment was not done but could be done. It has the added value of directly demonstrating that the effect is not innate to the marker but to the specific context in use.</p><p>4. For figure 2A, an additional panel with a difference map of some kind between the two strains could have value in visually demonstrating that the selected groups of genes are or are not the only major groups affected. There appear to be other clusters also affected and a description of these could add value to the presentation – for example, if it were discussed what is known about cellular phenotypes when mitochondrial translation is perturbed in a manner similar to reduced expression of components and how these data merely recapitulate previous observations or go beyond to describe impacts on the proteome that have not been described.</p><p>5. For figure 2f, the lack of complementation is a negative result because it is not demonstrated that DBP1 at the ectopic locus is transcribed and translated to the same extent as at the native locus. This is a minor concern because of the use of insulated KO cassette later but examination of the described CRISPR allele, or reversed kanMX6 or hphMX4 cassettes, or a CRISPR allele removing the DPB1 promoter and TSS, or introduction of a stop codon early in the ORF would have been a nice addition to this experiment.</p><p>6. Figure 2- fs 1A. The WT sample presumably has an error in the measurement. Even though mutant and WT are normalized there should be a way to propagate the error to the WT to indicate it is 100% +/- SD.</p><p>7. Line 357. &quot;For the last case, in which UPF1 was replaced with the NATMX6 cassette, an abundant aberrant transcript was observed.&quot; While it is noted later, it would be appropriate here to note that upf1∆ itself may alter the stability of cryptic transcripts and this could be the reason for the especially strong transcript seen here.</p><p>8. Line 370 &quot;Seamless deletion of the DBP1 ORF by this strategy led to the production of a transcript containing only the 5' and 3' UTRs of DBP1. Expression of this mutant transcript led to the aberrant translation of a dubious ORF contained within the DBP1 3' UTR, not translated in wild type (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>It is a useful point to make that any genetic alteration may have unintended consequences (and this is a nice additional example) but the wording seems to unnecessarily conflate CRISPR-mediated editing with one specific time of deletion (removal of ORF) instead of the many different ways gene function may be rendered null using CRISPR editing. The statement just above states &quot;effects&quot; on &quot;surrounding genes&quot; plural but is not clear outside of the 3 UTR ORF as MRP51 shows a 1.2X effect- is this latter effect significant? If not, what other genes are affected? It does not seem necessary to use this example as justification for the new generation of selectable markers that are introduced in the next section- their value stands on their own, regardless of the extra effects of particular types of CRISPR editing.</p><p>9. Figure 3. An alternative framing would be that selectable markers employing the TEF1 promoter can drive or induce transcription divergently from the cassette in multiple contexts.</p><p>10. Line 492 &quot;These features included a gene antisense and 5' to the cassette..&quot;</p><p>This could be more accurately described as KO cassettes can have two orientations relative to the knocked out genes and adjacent genes are not technically antisense unless they occupy the same sequence on the other strand. Consider &quot;These features include an upstream gene transcribed divergently from that of the orientation of the selectable marker gene in the cassette&quot;.</p><p>11. One consideration that would greatly improve the value of the new selectable markers created would be a design strategy that diversifies insulator sequences such that cassettes would not share flanking sequences. One issue with the kanMX6/hphMX4/natMX etc cassettes is that they share TEF promoter and terminator. This means that using them in the same strain reduces the efficiency of use by about 10-fold, due to marker exchange instead of integration into the desired target when one cassette is already in use in a strain. Having additional same sequences on each end can exacerbate this. One possibility would be to switch 5' and 3' positions but another would be to deploy at least two additional terminator regions to reduce marker exchange propensity.</p><p>12. Line 608 &quot;c terminally&quot; → &quot;C-terminally&quot; or &quot;carboxy-terminally&quot;.</p><p>13. Line 634 &quot;100 µM&quot; of what?</p><p>14. Line 652 Fischer → Fisher.</p><p>15. Line 751 &quot;We then cloned 3 additional cassettes using varying selection (including Saccharomyce <italic>S. pombe</italic> HIS5: complements S.cerevisiae HIS3, TRP1, and NATr)…&quot;</p><p>Please make clear in methods if these markers were used to replace kan in kanMX6 or if insulators were added to those original cassettes and cite the source of the original cassettes (plasmids) and their official cassette names here for the relevant markers.</p><p>16. Line 756. 5' RACE. The nature of the sequencing here is not described. Numbers of &quot;reads&quot; are described, but is it instead meant numbers of clones with cDNA ends mapping to indicated positions because that is my understanding of how the GeneRacer III TOPO kit is designed to be employed. Additionally, were RACE products attempted to be mapped within the cassette and not found, or was it not examined? Are the new products at MRP51 within or external to the cassette and how close to the junction? It would be useful to know the distance between the cassette TSSs for the resistance marker and the induced divergent transcription to get an idea of if the properties are consistent with divergent transcription as described for single nucleosome-free regions or if instead the TEF one sequence used in these cassettes actually has an additional promoter region attached</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81086.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

Examples would be if growth curves are n=2, potentially show both or show average and range, and state in figure legend instead of methods; for western blot quantification please indicate what the quantification represents – a single representative of experiment done more than once or an average of multiple experiments? If more than one, please add an error or range to the values. If one but representative, please state explicitly.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been done throughout the revised manuscript. For growth curve data we chose to calculate doubling time for each strain so that readers can easily compare mutant growth rates directly and incorporated biological replicate data into these plots. For each growth experiment we now show one representative curve in the main figure and provide doubling time for all biological replicates in the supplemental figure panels listed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 191. &quot;Together these data indicate that cassette replacement of the DBP1 ORF drives aberrant transcription independent of strain, cassette selection identity, and experimental conditions. Instead, the observed misregulation of MRP51 appears to be a general side-effect of the cassette-insertion.&quot;</p><p>This statement is too strong. In the experiment shown, two marker cassettes that may or may not be related are tested, apparently in the identical orientation. It is not clear if hygMX4 is the standard name for this marker. Is what is meant hphMX4? hphMX4 and kanMX6 will both use TEF promoter and terminator and in the case here, it appears that both markers were used in the same orientation, which as we learn later is likely critical for the mechanism, though not explicitly tested. This means that conclusion that the effect is general for cassette insertion has not been demonstrated, and potentially would not even be expected (based on the understood mechanism).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions, we have moved this statement to after the data presented in Figure 2D (previously presented in Figure 2F) and attempted to clarify the language to indicate that the effect is general to multiple cassettes though as the reviewer indicates is specific (not general) to cassette orientation. Additionally, we now have placed diagrams showing cassette makeup at all relevant figures such that redundant or unique sequences between cassettes can be easily determined.</p><p>We added the reviewer-suggested experiment of a flipped cassette inserted at the <italic>DBP1</italic> locus (Figure 3G), which demonstrates as the reviewer predicts, the off-target effect is specific to cassette orientation as predicted by our model. This new experiment helps solidify our proposed mechanism, whereby bidirectional promoter activity stemming from cassette promoters drives mis-regulation of neighboring genes.</p><p>We have also corrected the hygromycin cassette nomenclature and appreciate this note.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Several places &quot;believe&quot; is used.

Since the tested markers share attributes, the bidirectional model is an attractive explanation at this position in the manuscript and a straightforward test of the proposed mechanism would be to use the markers in the opposite orientation. This experiment was not done but could be done. It has the added value of directly demonstrating that the effect is not innate to the marker but to the specific context in use.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and have included this experiment into the revised manuscript (Figure 3G), and as mentioned above believe it helps solidify our model. We have also restructured the manuscript, including swapping Figures 3 and 4, to bring this point up earlier and revised the manuscript title and abstract to emphasize the importance of bidirectional transcription earlier.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. For figure 2A, an additional panel with a difference map of some kind between the two strains could have value in visually demonstrating that the selected groups of genes are or are not the only major groups affected. There appear to be other clusters also affected and a description of these could add value to the presentation – for example, if it were discussed what is known about cellular phenotypes when mitochondrial translation is perturbed in a manner similar to reduced expression of components and how these data merely recapitulate previous observations or go beyond to describe impacts on the proteome that have not been described.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. The two clusters that we highlight are the ones for which the changes made sense as direct effects of the genetic change that we engineered (ie. it was possible to make a model for the changes based on known functions of either Dbp1 or Mrp51) but we agree with the reviewer that other clusters are interesting, as well. For example, there is an interesting cluster midway down the tree that shows high levels in lower fractions in the wild-type cells and is extremely highly enriched for the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex (suggesting that this is not highly assembled in the cells with low Mrp51 levels) and a group of proteins that are up in the <italic>dbp1∆::kanMX6</italic> cells (just above the 54S cluster), which includes proteins that transport proteins into the mitochondria (Tim54, Tom70, Sdh3) and not much else.</p><p>The type of data that we collected is unusual in that it is mass spectrometry of polysome fractions specifically, and thus there is not much comparable data in the literature. We think it may indeed be providing new insight into the cellular response to mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. For figure 2f, the lack of complementation is a negative result because it is not demonstrated that DBP1 at the ectopic locus is transcribed and translated to the same extent as at the native locus. This is a minor concern because of the use of insulated KO cassette later but examination of the described CRISPR allele, or reversed kanMX6 or hphMX4 cassettes, or a CRISPR allele removing the DPB1 promoter and TSS, or introduction of a stop codon early in the ORF would have been a nice addition to this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is a great point. We have confirmed that Dbp1 is expressed to the same extent from the ectopic and endogenous locus using western blots and added these quantifications to the revised manuscript (Figure 2—figure supplement 2D). We have also bolstered these experiments by demonstrating that while ectopic Dbp1 expression does not rescue the <italic>dbp1∆::kanMX6</italic> phenotypes, ectopic expression of Mrp51 does (Figure 2B-C and Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-C). We appreciate these suggestions and believe this data improve the flow of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 2- fs 1A. The WT sample presumably has an error in the measurement. Even though mutant and WT are normalized there should be a way to propagate the error to the WT to indicate it is 100% +/- SD.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, thank you for catching this error, we apologize with the manner by which these results were previously presented and have fixed this plot in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Line 357. &quot;For the last case, in which UPF1 was replaced with the NATMX6 cassette, an abundant aberrant transcript was observed.&quot; While it is noted later, it would be appropriate here to note that upf1∆ itself may alter the stability of cryptic transcripts and this could be the reason for the especially strong transcript seen here.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we find this to be a very interesting point! We initially did mention it earlier in the text, but some found it distracting without additional data and this led to its position in the Discussion rather than the Results.</p><p>In the revision process, we performed further analyses of RNA decay mutants, which revealed a role for <italic>RRP6</italic>-dependent exosome in degrading most cassette-driven divergent transcripts (Figure 5). This degradation likely depends on NNS-dependent termination pathways, which are responsible for terminating many endogenous divergent transcripts. We suggest that the ability of naturally occurring NNS termination sequences to prevent widespread transcription interference from cassette-driven divergent transcription may explain why some loci are susceptible to severe neighboring gene disruption upon cassette insertion and some are not.</p><p>It is interesting that cells lacking <italic>RRP6</italic> show even higher divergent transcript levels when a selection cassette is inserted at the <italic>UPF1</italic> locus than is seen with cassette-replacement of <italic>UPF1</italic> alone (Figure 5D). This may indicate that both NMD and exosome-mediated decay can target divergent cassette-driven transcripts in some cases. Given the lack of control here, however (ie. no case in which a cassette is inserted at the <italic>UPF1</italic> locus, but Upf1 expression is normal), the data for this locus is inconclusive. Moreover, we were unable to find additional data to support a role for NMD in degrading cassette-driven transcripts among published datasets, so discuss a possible role for NMD in the revised manuscript only briefly, when the data for <italic>UPF1</italic> cassette insertion are first introduced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Line 370 &quot;Seamless deletion of the DBP1 ORF by this strategy led to the production of a transcript containing only the 5' and 3' UTRs of DBP1. Expression of this mutant transcript led to the aberrant translation of a dubious ORF contained within the DBP1 3' UTR, not translated in wild type (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>It is a useful point to make that any genetic alteration may have unintended consequences (and this is a nice additional example) but the wording seems to unnecessarily conflate CRISPR-mediated editing with one specific time of deletion (removal of ORF) instead of the many different ways gene function may be rendered null using CRISPR editing. The statement just above states &quot;effects&quot; on &quot;surrounding genes&quot; plural but is not clear outside of the 3 UTR ORF as MRP51 shows a 1.2X effect- is this latter effect significant? If not, what other genes are affected? It does not seem necessary to use this example as justification for the new generation of selectable markers that are introduced in the next section- their value stands on their own, regardless of the extra effects of particular types of CRISPR editing.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to clarify this in the revised manuscript, as we agree this is not needed to justify new cassettes. The major point, which we hope we have improved our presentation of, is that small genomic changes can have unintended consequences on translation of coding sequences produced from neighboring sequences, a topic that is now in the discussion. We realize that the fold-change labels on this figure were unclear in their significance. We had labeled <italic>MRP51</italic> to demonstrate that it is relatively unchanged in the Cas9 unmarked <italic>dbp1∆</italic>, but realize this was unclear without further context.</p><p>Based on the reviewer’s feedback, we realized that there was a better organization of the data that we have implemented in the revised manuscript and that we think address several of the reviewer’s concerns. We moved the data for CRISPR-edited cells to Figure 5—figure supplement 2. We swapped the former Figures 3 and 4 and included new data for the reversed cassette insertion to the new Figure 3. This shows that bidirectional promoter activity from the cassette is driving the off-target effects. Finally, the new Figure 4 and Figure 5 now shows that this cassette-driven off-target effect occurs more broadly but masked by exosome-mediated degradation in many cases. We believe this organization solves several problems, including making the source of this off-target effect clear earlier in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure 3. An alternative framing would be that selectable markers employing the TEF1 promoter can drive or induce transcription divergently from the cassette in multiple contexts.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, good point. With the manuscript reorganization, we believe that it is now more clearly stated that <italic>pTEF-</italic>based cassette insertion can drive divergent transcripts in multiple contexts. In fact, the <italic>rrp6</italic> data that are in Figure 5 now suggest that they always do so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Line 492 &quot;These features included a gene antisense and 5' to the cassette..&quot;</p><p>This could be more accurately described as KO cassettes can have two orientations relative to the knocked out genes and adjacent genes are not technically antisense unless they occupy the same sequence on the other strand. Consider &quot;These features include an upstream gene transcribed divergently from that of the orientation of the selectable marker gene in the cassette&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>It's true that divergent is the correct term to use here and we have fixed this wording to be clearer. We appreciate this comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. One consideration that would greatly improve the value of the new selectable markers created would be a design strategy that diversifies insulator sequences such that cassettes would not share flanking sequences. One issue with the kanMX6/hphMX4/natMX etc cassettes is that they share TEF promoter and terminator. This means that using them in the same strain reduces the efficiency of use by about 10-fold, due to marker exchange instead of integration into the desired target when one cassette is already in use in a strain. Having additional same sequences on each end can exacerbate this. One possibility would be to switch 5' and 3' positions but another would be to deploy at least two additional terminator regions to reduce marker exchange propensity.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and fully agree. We have made two adjustments to reduce sequence overlap and created 2 additional insulated plasmids. First, we reasoned that the 5’ insulator flanking the cassette promoter is necessary to prevent the promoter driven off-target effects while the 3’ flanking insulator is dispensable because it sits adjacent to the cassette terminator. This was confirmed by swapping the orientation of the kanMX6 cassette integrated into the <italic>DBP1</italic> locus which places the <italic>TEF</italic> terminator adjacent to <italic>MRP51</italic> (Figure 3G, Figure 3—figure supplement 2A). Therefore, we removed the 3’ terminator and created a 5’ only <italic>tDEG1</italic> insulated version of the kanMX6-ins1 plasmid (creating kanMX6-ins6, Figure 3H). Next, we cloned another 5’ insulated cassette (kanMX6-ins7, Figure 3H) that only shares the primer amplification sites with kanMX6-ins6. This plasmid contains the <italic>tCYC1</italic> terminator 5’ of the <italic>C. glabrata PGK1</italic> promoter expressing <italic>nat<sup>r</sup>,</italic> and is terminated with the <italic>C. glabrata PGK1</italic> terminator. To confirm the efficacy of these new insulated cassettes we integrated them into the <italic>DBP1</italic> locus exactly as done with the prior cassettes and tested whether the resulting strain exhibited a growth defect in non-fermentable carbon sources. Integration of both kanMX6-ins6 and kanMX6-ins7 did not induce growth defects in the non-fermentable carbon source glycerol when used to replace <italic>DBP1,</italic> signifying their lack of disruption of <italic>MRP51</italic> (Figure 3-supplement 2B). We will deposit these improved insulated plasmids, as well as our original proposed insulated cassettes, at Addgene for easy access.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12.

We have more clearly listed the plasmid that each resistance marker was amplified from and noted in the text that each of these new cassettes all share the same flanking sequence as that in the kanMX6-ins2 plasmid. We have also cloned an additional insulated cassette with non-shared flanking sequences that uses the promoter and terminator from <italic>C. glabrata PGK1</italic> to express the nat<sup>r</sup> gene, to further facilitate multiple gene replacements within the same strain and reduce the likelihood of marker exchange. We also provided diagrams clearly showing cassette makeup to clarify shared or unique sequences between cassettes for these new selection cassettes (please see suggestion 11 for more information).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. Line 756. 5' RACE. The nature of the sequencing here is not described. Numbers of &quot;reads&quot; are described, but is it instead meant numbers of clones with cDNA ends mapping to indicated positions because that is my understanding of how the GeneRacer III TOPO kit is designed to be employed. Additionally, were RACE products attempted to be mapped within the cassette and not found, or was it not examined? Are the new products at MRP51 within or external to the cassette and how close to the junction? It would be useful to know the distance between the cassette TSSs for the resistance marker and the induced divergent transcription to get an idea of if the properties are consistent with divergent transcription as described for single nucleosome-free regions or if instead the TEF one sequence used in these cassettes actually has an additional promoter region attached</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the reviewer is correct, here the number of “reads” listed signifies the number of cDNA clones whose 5’ end of transcript mapped to that position. We have changed the language in the text to more clearly represent this and have added the information requested. None of the 5’ RACE products sequenced mapped to the cassette and all clones analyzed are listed and depicted in this figure, apart from a single clone whose 5’ end of transcript mapped within the <italic>MRP51</italic> ORF and likely represented a fragmented transcript not a true 5’ cDNA end. The finding that these cassette driven transcripts do not contain any cassette sequence is consistent with our previous observations from the mRNA sequencing data in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 where the 5’ extended transcripts for <italic>MRP51</italic> did not include any cassette sequence. Instead, the TSS for the divergent cassette driven transcript is ~530bp away from the TSS of the sense transcript that drives the expression of kan<sup>r</sup>, and ~110bp away from the cassette-genome junction. Interestingly, the distance between the coding and divergent transcript produced from the kanMX6 <italic>TEF</italic> (<italic>A. gossypii)</italic> promoter appears to be highly similar to that observed at the <italic>S. cerevisiae TEF1</italic> locus (Figure 5E; Xu et al., <italic>Nature</italic> 2009).</p><p>Because of this similarity, and the fact that we have sequenced the plasmids and confirmed there are no additional promoters, we believe the divergent transcript originates from the same nucleosome free region as the sense transcript.</p><p>Furthermore, we see the divergent transcript-driven phenotypes resulting from Mrp51 disruption with insertion of the <italic>TRP1</italic> cassette, which shares only the 5’ and 3’ flanking primer amplification sequences (Figure 2D). However, this common primer sequence is still present in the insulated cassettes (and not itself insulated) so it cannot be responsible.</p><p>We should have noted (and do so in the revised manuscript), that <italic>pTEF1</italic> has bidirectional promoter activity along with most promoters, but the resultant transcript from the endogenous locus is subject to rapid exosome-based degradation and thus not visible in WT mRNA-seq data (Xu et al. <italic>Nature</italic> 2009).</p><p>References:</p><p>Almada, A.
