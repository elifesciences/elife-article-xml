We reconstituted Ded1 acceleration of 48S PIC assembly on native mRNAs in a pure system, and recapitulated increased Ded1-dependence of mRNAs that are Ded1-hyperdependent in vivo. Stem-loop (SL) structures in 5'-UTRs of native and synthetic mRNAs increased the Ded1 requirement to overcome their intrinsically low rates of 48S PIC recruitment. Ded1 acceleration of 48S assembly was greater in the presence of eIF4F, and domains mediating one or more Ded1 interactions with eIF4G or helicase eIF4A were required for efficient recruitment of all mRNAs; however, the relative importance of particular Ded1 and eIF4G domains were distinct for each mRNA. Our results account for the Ded1 hyper-dependence of mRNAs with structure-prone 5'-UTRs, and implicate an eIF4E·eIF4G·eIF4A·Ded1 complex in accelerating 48S PIC assembly on native mRNAs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>initiation</kwd><kwd>Ded1</kwd><kwd>eIF4G</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lorsch</surname><given-names>Jon R</given-names></name><name><surname>Hinnebusch</surname><given-names>Alan G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Yeast RNA helicase Ded1 stimulates ribosome recruitment of structure-laden native mRNAs in a reconstituted system by interactions between domains in Ded1 and initiation factor eIF4G that stabilizes a Ded1-eIF4F complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In canonical translation initiation in eukaryotes, a ternary complex (TC), consisting of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup>, and GTP, along with eIF1, eIF1A, eIF5, eIF4B, and eIF3, binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit to form a 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC). The 43S PIC binds to the 5'-end of mRNA and scans the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) to identify the start codon, resulting in the formation of the 48S PIC. eIF4F complex, comprised of eIF4E (a cap binding protein), eIF4G (a scaffolding protein), and eIF4A (a DEAD-box RNA helicase), interacts with the mRNA m<sup>7</sup>G cap and aids in recruitment of the 43S PIC to the 5'-end of the mRNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dever et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>).</p><p>eIF4A promotes 48S PIC formation in vitro and translation in vivo of virtually all mRNAs regardless of their structural complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yourik et al., 2017</xref>). Yeast ribosome profiling studies show that the majority of cellular mRNAs have strong and similar dependence on eIF4A for their proper translation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sen et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, eIF4A is an essential protein, and small decreases in eIF4A cellular concentrations reduce bulk translation in vivo, further emphasizing the critical role of eIF4A in translation of most mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Firczuk et al., 2013</xref>). Yeast eIF4A is a weak helicase when unwinding RNA duplexes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rajagopal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rogers et al., 1999</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that mammalian eIF4A modulates the structure of the 40S subunit to enhance PIC attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sokabe and Fraser, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Ded1 is a yeast DEAD-box RNA helicase that promotes translation in vivo of reporter mRNAs with longer or structured 5'-UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berthelot et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sen et al., 2015</xref>). Like eIF4A, Ded1 is essential for yeast growth and stimulates bulk translation initiation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chuang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Cruz et al., 1997</xref>). However, ribosome profiling of conditional <italic>ded1</italic> mutants revealed that native mRNAs with 5'-UTRs that are longer and more structured than average yeast 5'-UTRs exhibit a greater than average reduction in translational efficiency (TE) relative to all other mRNAs on Ded1 inactivation (Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs); whereas mRNAs with shorter and less structured 5'-UTRs exhibit increased relative TEs in <italic>ded1</italic> cells (Ded1-hypodependent mRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Yeast Ded1 can unwind model RNA duplexes and act as an RNA chaperone or RNA-protein complex remodeler in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bowers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iost et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang and Jankowsky, 2006</xref>). Translation stimulation by Ded1 requires its ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilliker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iost et al., 1999</xref>). Mutations in the Ded1 ATPase domain (Ded1-E307A and Ded1-R489A) impair ATP binding and hydrolysis, and these mutants have dominant-negative effects on translation both in cell extracts and in vivo, evoking stress granule formation in the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilliker et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Ded1 can physically interact individually with purified eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A, or Pab1 (poly(A) binding protein), and can bind simultaneously to eIF4A·eIF4E·eIF4G (eIF4F) or eIF4E·eIF4G, in an RNA-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilliker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Senissar et al., 2014</xref>). Ded1 also interacts with the eIF4F complex in yeast extracts, supporting the physiological relevance of these interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilliker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Senissar et al., 2014</xref>). According to a proposed model, Ded1-eIF4G-mRNA interaction is thought to repress translation by promoting accumulation of mRNPs in stress granules, whereas ATP hydrolysis by Ded1 moves the repressed mRNPs back into the translation cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilliker et al., 2011</xref>). However, the role of Ded1-eIF4F interactions in the stimulatory function of Ded1 in translation initiation remains to be elucidated. Ded1 interacts with eIF4A through its N-terminal domain (Ded1-NTD) and this interaction is required for eIF4A stimulation of Ded1’s RNA-duplex unwinding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). Deletion of the Ded1-NTD confers a cold-sensitive growth phenotype in cells, consistent with a role for eIF4A stimulation of Ded1 function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banroques et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). Yeast eIF4G contains three RNA binding domains, N-terminal RNA1, central RNA2, and C-terminal RNA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berset et al., 2003</xref>); and while none of the three is essential, simultaneous deletion of RNA2 and RNA3 is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Park et al., 2011</xref>). In vitro, eIF4G variants lacking any of the three RNA binding domains exhibit similar affinities for eIF4A, support similar rates of ATP-hydrolysis by the eIF4F complex (albeit with higher K<sub>m</sub> values for ATP), but lack the preference of WT eIF4F for 5'-overhang substrates during unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rajagopal et al., 2012</xref>). The Ded1 C-terminal domain (Ded1-CTD) interacts with the eIF4G-RNA3 domain, and Ded1-eIF4G interaction decreases the rate of RNA unwinding while increasing Ded1 affinity for RNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilliker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Putnam et al., 2015</xref>). A Ded1 variant lacking the CTD conferred reduced reporter mRNA translation compared to WT Ded1 in cell extracts, supporting a stimulatory role for the Ded1-CTD interaction with eIF4G in translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilliker et al., 2011</xref>). Ded1 also interacts with the RNA2 domain of eIF4G and with eIF4E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Senissar et al., 2014</xref>), but the physiological relevance of these interactions is unknown.</p><p>We previously demonstrated functions of eIF4F, eIF4B, and eIF3 in stimulating the rate and extent of mRNA recruitment by 43S PICs in a fully purified yeast initiation system for native <italic>RPL41A</italic> mRNA, containing a short and relatively unstructured 5'-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mitchell et al., 2010</xref>). Although Ded1 is essential in vivo, it was dispensable for recruitment of this mRNA in vitro. Considering that <italic>RPL41A</italic> was judged to be Ded1-hypodependent in vivo by ribosome profiling of <italic>ded1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sen et al., 2015</xref>), we asked whether recruitment of Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs would require Ded1 in the reconstituted system. We investigated whether the presence of defined stem-loop (SL) structures in native or synthetic mRNAs would confer greater Ded1-dependence for rapid recruitment in vitro. Finally, we examined the role of the RNA2 and RNA3 domains of eIF4G and the NTD and CTD of Ded1 that mediate Ded1 interactions with the eIF4F complex in promoting Ded1’s ability to accelerate mRNA recruitment by 43S PICs. Our findings demonstrate that Ded1 accelerates recruitment of native and synthetic mRNAs, overcoming the inhibitory effects of structured leader sequences and conferring relatively greater stimulation for mRNAs hyperdependent on Ded1 in vivo, all in a manner consistent with stimulation of Ded1 function by formation of a Ded1-eIF4F complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ded1 enhances the rate of recruitment of all natural mRNAs tested</title><p>We set out to reconstitute the function of Ded1 in 48S PIC assembly in a yeast translation initiation system comprised of purified components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mitchell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Walker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yourik et al., 2017</xref>).

Formation of 48S complexes was monitored over time using a native gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to resolve free and 48S-bound mRNAs. An ~20 fold excess of unlabeled-capped mRNA was added to reaction aliquots at each time point to quench further recruitment of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled mRNA (‘pulse-quench’). By varying the concentration of Ded1, this assay yields the apparent rate constants (k<sub>app</sub>) for 48S PIC formation at each Ded1 concentration, the maximal rate at saturating Ded1 (k<sub>max</sub>), the Ded1 concentration required for the half-maximal rate of 48S formation (K<sub>1/2</sub>), and the reaction endpoints (percentage of mRNA recruited) at each Ded1 concentration. The addition of ~20 fold excess non-radiolabeled mRNA in the quench was adequate to prevent further recruitment of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled mRNA, and did not dissociate the pre-formed <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 48S complexes on the timescale of the recruitment experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

One explanation could be that Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs have a higher rate-limiting activation energy barrier for 48S PIC assembly in the absence of Ded1 compared to the Ded1-hypodependent mRNAs, consistent with the latter’s relatively higher rates of recruitment without Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, blue bars, <italic>RPL41A</italic> and <italic>HOR7</italic> versus <italic>SFT2, PMA1, OST3,</italic> and <italic>FET3</italic>).

Similarly, even after removal of SLs, the <italic>PMA1-M</italic> and <italic>SFT2-M</italic> mutant mRNAs were still stimulated by Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition to defined, stable SLs in 5'-UTRs, natural mRNAs likely form large ensembles of weaker structures involving interactions of nucleotides within the 5'-UTR or between 5'-UTR nucleotides and nucleotides in the CDS or 3'-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kertesz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yourik et al., 2017</xref>), which might also contribute to Ded1-dependence during PIC attachment or scanning. To test this hypothesis, we examined recruitment of chimeric mRNAs with synthetic 5'-UTRs attached to the CDS and 3'-UTR of native <italic>RPL41A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yourik et al., 2017</xref>). A synthetic mRNA dubbed ‘-<italic>SL</italic>’ (for ‘minus stem-loop’) contained a 67 nt 5'-UTR comprised of CAA repeats that is devoid of stable secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Without Ded1, -<italic>SL</italic> was recruited rapidly at a rate of 1.9 ± 0.2 min<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, blue),~2 fold faster than <italic>RPL41A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, blue) or the <italic>SFT2-M</italic> and <italic>PMA1-M</italic> variants lacking SLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, blue), consistent with the idea that weaker interactions formed by 5'-UTRs of native mRNAs lacking SLs can inhibit recruitment.

The finding that Ded1 significantly stimulates 48S PIC assembly on -<italic>SL</italic>, containing a 5'-UTR incapable of forming stable structures on its own, suggests that Ded1 has a second role in mRNA recruitment, in addition to unwinding stable structures in 5'-UTRs.</p><p>To analyze whether Ded1 can stimulate the PIC attachment step of 48S assembly, we examined the synthetic <italic>CP-8.1</italic> mRNA with a stable SL (predicted <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>G° = −8.1 kcal/mol) inserted in a cap-proximal location 5 nt from the 5'-end of <italic>-SL</italic> mRNA. We also analyzed a third synthetic mRNA, <italic>CD-8.1</italic>, containing the same SL inserted 45 nt downstream from the cap of <italic>-SL</italic>, reasoning that this cap-distal SL might impede scanning without interfering with PIC attachment at the cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). As expected, both synthetic mRNAs with SLs had order-of-magnitude lower rates of recruitment compared to <italic>-SL</italic> in the absence of Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, blue, inset), indicating that SLs in either location strongly inhibited 48S PIC formation. Ded1 increased the maximal rate of <italic>CP-8.1</italic> recruitment by ~5 fold, such that the maximal rate for <italic>CP-8.1</italic> was still ~6 fold below that of <italic>-SL</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>, blue vs. red), and ~2 – 3 fold below that of <italic>RPL41A, HOR7, SFT2, OST3</italic>, and <italic>PMA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, <italic>CP-8.1</italic> exhibited an ~7.6 fold higher <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">D</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> versus <italic>-SL</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). As a result, <italic>CP-8.1</italic> lies between the Ded1-hyperdependent and Ded1-hypodependent mRNAs, and deviates from the line in the plot of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf29"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">D</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> versus fold-increase in k<sub>max</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, green, <italic>CP-8.1</italic>). This deviation is due to the fact that <italic>CP-8.1</italic>, like the Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs, is inefficiently recruited in the absence of Ded1; but unlike the Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs, its recruitment is accelerated by Ded1 only ~5 fold. These results suggest that Ded1 is not very effective at reducing the inhibitory effect of a stable cap-proximal SL on PIC attachment, even at saturating Ded1 concentrations. In contrast, Ded1 conferred an ~17 fold acceleration of recruitment for <italic>CD-8.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and a high Ded1 concentration was required to achieve the half-maximal rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>, green vs. red), similar to the behavior of the native Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Judging by the relative positions of <italic>CD-8.1</italic> and <italic>CP-8.1</italic> on the plot of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, it appears that Ded1 is better at resolving the inhibitory effect of the synthetic SL in a cap-distal versus cap-proximal location in the 5'-UTR. Interestingly, the same conclusion was reached previously from analyzing the relative effects of a cold-sensitive <italic>ded1</italic> mutation on expression of reporter mRNAs containing cap-proximal or cap-distal SLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sen et al., 2015</xref>). The ATPase deficient mutant Ded1<sup>E307A</sup> did not increase the recruitment rates for these mRNAs above the levels seen in the absence of Ded1, even in case of <italic>-SL</italic> mRNA which lacks stable secondary structures in the 5'-UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>Having observed that the strength of a 5'-UTR SL influences the degree of Ded1-dependence, as observed with WT versus mutant derivatives of <italic>SFT2</italic> and <italic>PMA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), we went on to analyze synthetic mRNAs containing cap-distal SLs of predicted stabilities either higher (−10.5 kcal/mol) or lower (−3.7 kcal/mol) than that of <italic>CD-8.1.</italic> Each of these SLs, present in <italic>CD-10.5</italic> and <italic>CD-3.7</italic>, respectively, reduced the recruitment rate in the absence of Ded1 by ~20 fold compared to that of <italic>-SL</italic>, similar to the results for <italic>CD-8.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, blue). This result suggests that eIF4E·eIF4G·eIF4A alone cannot efficiently mitigate the inhibitory effects of cap-distal SLs of even moderate stability, such as that in <italic>CD-3.7</italic>, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yourik et al., 2017</xref>). As expected, Ded1 strongly stimulated the recruitment rate of <italic>CD-3.7</italic>, by ~25 fold, slightly more than the ~15 fold observed for <italic>CD-8.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>); however, Ded1 conferred only a modest ~2 fold acceleration of <italic>CD-10.5</italic> recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). One possibility to explain these last results would be that the cap-distal SL in <italic>CD-10.5</italic> is too stable for efficient unwinding by Ded1, limiting Ded1’s ability to accelerate 48S assembly on this mRNA.</p><p>In summary, our analysis of synthetic mRNAs supports the notion that Ded1 can accelerate mRNA recruitment by enhancing scanning through cap-distal secondary structures, such as the SLs that occur naturally in <italic>SFT2</italic> and <italic>PMA1</italic> mRNAs; although if the structure is too stable, Ded1 has a limited ability to unwind it. Additionally, it appears that Ded1 also partially mitigates the inhibitory effects of cap-proximal secondary structures on PIC attachment at the mRNA 5'-end, although not to the same degree that it overcomes cap-distal structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ded1 stimulation is completely dependent on eIF4E·eIF4G for a subset of mRNAs and all mRNAs require eIF4A in the presence or absence of Ded1</title><p>Ded1 has been shown to interact physically with eIF4F components eIF4E, eIF4G and eIF4A in a manner that influences its ability to unwind model RNA substrates in an unwinding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilliker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Senissar et al., 2014</xref>).

The 5'-cap blocks aberrant mRNA recruitment and imposes a requirement for eIF4E·eIF4G and eIF4A for maximal recruitment rate. 43S PICs can bind to uncapped mRNAs but are unable to either locate or stably associate with their start codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mitchell et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly, only 5'-capped mRNAs were used in all experiments to avoid the formation of these aberrant complexes, especially in the absence of eIF4E·eIF4G or eIF4A.</p><p>As described above, in the presence of eIF4E·eIF4G, all eight mRNAs can be recruited in the absence of Ded1, and Ded1 increased their recruitment rates to different extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–H</xref>, blue vs. orange). <italic>RPL41A</italic>, <italic>HOR7</italic>, and -<italic>SL</italic>, which contain very short (<italic>RPL41A</italic> and <italic>HOR7</italic>) or unstructured (<italic>-SL</italic>) 5'-UTRs, were recruited at relatively low (but measurable) rates in the absence of both eIF4E·eIF4G and Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B,F</xref>, tan bars); and Ded1 conferred no increase in their apparent rates in the absence of eIF4E·eIF4G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B,F</xref>, cf. green vs. tan, orange vs. blue). The complete dependence of Ded1 on eIF4E·eIF4G to accelerate recruitment for these three mRNAs is consistent with the idea that Ded1 acts exclusively in the context of the eIF4G·eIF4E·eIF4A·Ded1 quaternary complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2016</xref>).

Thus, Ded1 can stimulate recruitment of these four mRNAs, at least to some extent, acting outside of the eIF4G·eIF4E·eIF4A·Ded1 complex. However, because the maximal rates were observed in the presence of both eIF4E·eIF4G and Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E,G</xref>, orange bars), Ded1 likely functions within the eIF4G·eIF4E·eIF4A·Ded1 complex as well for these four mRNAs.</p><p>In contrast to eIF4E·eIF4G, omitting eIF4A from the reactions essentially eliminated recruitment of all mRNAs tested, yielding endpoints of &lt;10%; with the exception of <italic>-SL</italic>, which was recruited at the low rate of 0.04 ± 0.01 min<sup>-1</sup> with endpoints of 46 ± 3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, red).

These results indicate that the maximum stimulation of recruitment of the synthetic mRNAs by eIF4E·eIF4G and eIF4A in the absence of Ded1 can be achieved at relatively low concentrations of both factors, but that higher concentrations of eIF4E·eIF4G and eIF4A are required to support the additional stimulation of recruitment conferred by Ded1, which are comparable in magnitude to the concentrations of eIF4E·eIF4G and eIF4A required for maximal Ded1-stimulation of the native mRNAs. In summary, the requirements for eIF4E·eIF4G and eIF4A, as well as the effect of Ded1 on these requirements, differ among different native mRNAs and vary dramatically between native and synthetic mRNAs. These results suggest the existence of different functional modalities of the eIF4F complex (in the absence of Ded1) and of the eIF4E·eIF4G·eIF4A·Ded1 complex (with Ded1) that may be required to overcome the range of RNA structures in different mRNAs that vary in stability, distance from the 5'-cap, or orientation in three-dimensional space to accelerate mRNA attachment and subsequent scanning to the AUG codon.

This stimulation in vitro recapitulates the Ded1-dependence of translation of mRNAs observed in vivo using ribosome profiling, in which mRNAs having longer and more structured 5'-UTRs display hyper-dependence on Ded1 relative to mRNAs with shorter and less structured 5'-UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sen et al., 2015</xref>). We showed that defined SL structures both decrease rates of 48S PIC assembly in the absence of Ded1 and increase the fold-stimulation afforded by Ded1. These results provide direct biochemical evidence supporting the proposition that Ded1 enhances translation initiation in vivo by resolving secondary structures formed by 5'-UTR sequences. Our results also showed that Ded1-accelerated recruitment of several mRNAs depends completely on the presence of eIF4E·eIF4G, and that domains mediating Ded1 interactions with eIF4G or eIF4A enhance Ded1 stimulation of 48S PIC assembly for all mRNAs tested, consistent with the previous work indicating that Ded1 binding to the eIF4G·eIF4E·eIF4A complex enhances its activity in RNA unwinding assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). However, Ded1 can also stimulate recruitment of some mRNAs in the absence of eIF4E·eIF4G, indicating that it can act independently of eIF4F as well.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>DEAD-box proteins Ded1 and eIF4A have complementary but distinct functions in mRNA recruitment</title><p>Inactivation of conditional mutants of either Ded1 or eIF4A in vivo results in strong reduction in bulk polysomes and decreased expression of reporter mRNAs bearing unstructured 5'-UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chuang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Cruz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sen et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that both proteins are important for translation of most mRNAs. These general reductions of translation are masked in ribosome profiling studies because the ribosomal footprint and mRNA read counts must be normalized to the total reads obtained in each sample/strain, such that the TE change for each mRNA is determined relative to the average TE change for all mRNAs examined in each sample/strain. mRNAs judged to hyperdependent or hypodependent on Ded1 in ribosome profiling experiments exhibit larger or smaller than average reductions in relative TE, respectively, but they may all exhibit decreased absolute TEs in <italic>ded1</italic> vs. WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sen et al., 2015</xref>). The ribosome profiling analysis of <italic>ded1</italic> mutants revealed that ~10% of all mRNAs – particularly those with long, structured 5'-UTRs – exhibit greater than average TE reductions in the <italic>ded1</italic> vs. WT cells, and were designated as Ded1-hyperdependent. Consistent with a stimulatory role for Ded1 in translation of most mRNAs, we observed here that Ded1 increases the maximal rate of 48S PIC formation by ~2 – 3 fold on native Ded1-hypodependent mRNAs or mRNAs with 5'-UTRs of low structural complexity (<italic>RPL41A</italic>, <italic>HOR7</italic>, and <italic>SFT2-M</italic>), as well as on a synthetic mRNA with an unstructured 5'-UTR (<italic>-SL</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>). Importantly, Ded1 conferred much greater acceleration of 48S PIC assembly on all four Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>eIF4A also enhances the translation of nearly all mRNAs in vivo, although, unlike Ded1 where sizable sets of mRNAs are hyper- or hypo-dependent on its function, most mRNAs are similarly (strongly) dependent on eIF4A for translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Firczuk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sen et al., 2015</xref>). In line with these in vivo observations, in the reconstituted system eIF4A promotes 48S PIC assembly on all mRNAs tested, increasing the k<sub>max</sub> for the synthetic mRNA with unstructured 5'-UTR (<italic>-SL</italic>) by 60-fold and even accelerating recruitment of completely unstructured model mRNAs by ≥7-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yourik et al., 2017</xref>). However, although Ded1 and eIF4A both facilitate recruitment of most mRNAs, and both are essential in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chuang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Linder and Slonimski, 1989</xref>); their functions are distinct. Ded1 cannot substitute for eIF4A in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), but it promoted recruitment of all mRNAs tested beyond the level achieved by saturating concentrations of eIF4A and eIF4E·eIF4G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>).</p><p>We previously proposed that eIF4A stimulates a step of 48S PIC assembly common to all mRNAs, such as disrupting the ensemble of weak RNA-RNA interactions that impede PIC attachment to the 5'-UTR or subsequent scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yourik et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, eIF4A might also directly promote loading of mRNA onto the PIC, for example by modulating conformational changes in the 40S subunit or by threading the 5'-end into the mRNA binding channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sokabe and Fraser, 2017</xref>). In common with eIF4A, Ded1 may enhance recruitment of all mRNAs by disrupting their global structures created by dynamic ensembles of base-pairing throughout their lengths. Unlike eIF4A, however, Ded1 can efficiently resolve more stable structures, including local stem-loops—achieving an order-of-magnitude acceleration for mRNAs with the most structured 5'-UTRs. If the proposed Ded1 function in promoting 48S PIC formation by disrupting global mRNA structure requires lower Ded1 concentrations than its role in resolving more stable structures within or involving the 5'-UTR, it would be consistent with our findings that mRNAs with SLs require higher Ded1 concentrations to achieve the much greater fold-stimulation of 48S assembly afforded by Ded1 compared to mRNAs lacking SLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Evidence supporting the functional importance of an eIF4G·eIF4E·eIF4A·Ded1 tetrameric complex</title><p>Ded1 alters the K<sub>1/2</sub> of eIF4E·eIF4G and eIF4A for most mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), and these new K<sub>1/2</sub> values may signify the changes in the concentrations of eIF4A and eIF4E·eIF4G required for proper assembly of the eIF4G·eIF4E·eIF4A·Ded1 tetrameric complex on each mRNA. The deleterious effects of eliminating known interactions between Ded1 and eIF4G or eIF4A further suggests the importance of the tetrameric complex formation for robust Ded1 function.

Because all of these domain deletions abrogate known interactions linking Ded1 to eIF4G or eIF4A, a plausible way to account for these findings is to propose that, regardless of the amount of secondary structure in the mRNA 5'-UTR, rapid mRNA recruitment depends on Ded1 functioning within the eIF4E·eIF4G·eIF4A·Ded1 complex; and that eliminating any interaction between Ded1 and eIF4G or eIF4A necessitates a higher concentration of the mutant variant for efficient complex formation. Judging by the magnitude of the increases in K<sub>1/2</sub> conferred by eliminating different domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), it would appear that eIF4G-RNA2 and Ded1-NTD are generally more important than the eIF4G-RNA3/Ded1-CTD duo in promoting assembly or stability of the eIF4E·eIF4G·eIF4A·Ded1 complex. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the domain deletions also impair a different interaction, for instance, with mRNA or another factor such as eIF4B or eIF3 that is crucial for rapid mRNA recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mitchell et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38892.024</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Models for mRNA-specific eIF4F-Ded1 interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap representation of log<sub>2</sub> fold-increases in K<sub>1/2</sub> values of eIF4E·eIF4G-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf126"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>RNA3 or eIF4E·eIF4G-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf127"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>RNA2 versus WT eIF4E·eIF4G; and of Ded1-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf128"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>CTD or Ded1-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf129"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>NTD versus WT Ded1, calculated from data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and 5C</xref> (red bars vs. line/whiskers) or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and 6C</xref> (green bars vs. line/whiskers).

(Although <italic>SFT2-M</italic> lacks the major cap-distal SL in WT <italic>SFT2</italic>, it contains an additional cap-proximal structure in vitro that might underlie its greater dependence on RNA2 versus <italic>-SL, RPL41A,</italic> and <italic>HOR7</italic>.)</p><p>Whereas deletion of the Ded1-NTD had the largest effect of the four eIF4G or Ded1 truncations on K<sub>1/2</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), it had the smallest effects on maximal rates of recruitment, reducing k<sub>max</sub> values between ~1.5 to~2 fold for <italic>SFT2, CD-8.1,</italic> and <italic>CP-8.1</italic>, but having little effect on the other mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). As all three affected mRNAs have stable SLs and the unaffected mRNAs do not, these data might indicate that the Ded1-NTD, presumably by interacting with eIF4A, modestly enhances the ability of the eIF4E·eIF4G·eIF4A·Ded1 complex to unwind stable secondary structures—complementing the function of eIF4G-RNA2 in this reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C(ii-iii)</xref>).</p><p>What is perhaps most striking about the effects of the eIF4G and Ded1 truncations on both the K<sub>1/2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and k<sub>max</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) values is that mRNAs have distinct patterns of responses. The various eIF4G-Ded1 domain interactions affect <italic>CP-8.1</italic> and <italic>CD-8.1</italic> recruitment quite differently even though these mRNAs differ only by the location of the same SL in an unstructured 5'-UTR. This suggests that there is not a single, uniform mechanism through which Ded1 operates on all mRNAs; instead the diversity of structures in mRNAs requires that Ded1 and the eIF4E·eIF4G·eIF4A·Ded1 complex can operate in multiple modes. The structural diversity inherent in mRNAs presents a challenge for the translational machinery because, once the eIF4F complex attaches to the 5'-cap, structural elements could be oriented in a variety of locations in three-dimensional space relative to its functional domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This problem could explain why eIF4G is so large and flexible and has multiple RNA- and factor-binding domains, which might confer sufficient plasticity to interact with mRNA structures presented in a variety of orientations and distances. Likewise, the multiple Ded1 binding domains on eIF4G might allow Ded1 to assume different positions relative to the diverse mRNA structures it encounters on different mRNAs. The mRNA specificity of effects of the truncation mutants of Ded1 and eIF4G on both K<sub>1/2</sub> and k<sub>max</sub> values are consistent with the notion that the eIF4E·eIF4G·eIF4A·Ded1 complex can interact with and modulate the structures of mRNAs in different ways, with the mRNA structure dictating the particular interactions of Ded1 with eIF4G or eIF4A that are most crucial for rapid recruitment.</p><p>It is likely that the rate-limiting step(s) for 48S PIC formation will also vary depending on the unique structural features of the mRNA. For some mRNAs, PIC attachment to the 5'-UTR might be rate-limiting because of structures proximal to the 5'-end or because the 5'-end is occluded within the global structure of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> (i)). For other mRNAs, PIC attachment might be relatively fast, but scanning to the start codon could be impeded by stable structures that require Ded1 in the context of the eIF4E·eIF4G·eIF4A·Ded1 complex to resolve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> (ii)). Since the <italic>RPL41A</italic> and <italic>HOR7</italic> mRNAs have short and less-structured 5'-UTRs, it is plausible that PIC attachment could be rate-limiting on these two mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> (i)), whereas scanning of the 5'-UTR could be rate-limiting on the two cap-distal SL-containing mRNAs, <italic>SFT2</italic> and <italic>CD-8.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> (ii)).</p><p>Recruitment of some mRNAs was accelerated by Ded1 in the absence of eIF4E·eIF4G, including <italic>SFT2, SFT2-M, OST3,</italic> and <italic>CD-8.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E,G</xref>) indicating that Ded1 is also capable of stimulating one or more aspects of 48S PIC assembly outside of the context of the eIF4E·eIF4G·eIF4A·Ded1 complex on certain mRNAs. The three mRNAs that most clearly exhibit complete dependence on eIF4E·eIF4G for Ded1 stimulation, <italic>-SL, RPL41A</italic>, and <italic>HOR7,</italic> have low degrees of structure in their 5'-UTRs. Hence, an intriguing possibility is that for mRNAs lacking strong local secondary structure in the 5'-UTR, Ded1 is only needed to promote eIF4F binding to the cap or initial attachment of the PIC at the 5'-end, and this process requires direct interaction of Ded1 with eIF4F at the mRNA 5'-end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> (i)). For other mRNAs harboring strong local structures in the 5'-UTR, in addition to acting in a eIF4F-Ded1 tetrameric complex to facilitate PIC attachment, Ded1 might unwind these structures and promote scanning independently of its association with eIF4F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> (ii)). The apparent inability of Ded1 to accelerate recruitment of <italic>CP-8.1</italic> independently of eIF4E·eIF4G might be explained by noting that the SL in this mRNA is cap-proximal, which could require eIF4F-Ded1 interaction for unwinding; however, because no recruitment of this mRNA was observed in the absence of eIF4E·eIF4G or Ded1, it is possible that Ded1 can actually accelerate <italic>CP-8.1</italic> recruitment on its own but the rate is too low to be detected in the absence of eIF4E·eIF4G. Additionally, Ded1 can interact with other factors such as eIF4A, the 40S ribosomal subunit, or the mRNA itself, which might aid in the recruitment of these mRNAs without eIF4E·eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guenther et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The two different models (‘mRNA geometry’ and ‘rate-limiting steps’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>) we are considering to explain the differential effects of the eIF4G and Ded1 domain deletions on different mRNAs are not mutually exclusive. In fact, the proposal that the domains have some specificity for mediating PIC attachment versus scanning probably requires that they localize Ded1 to different parts of the mRNA because the former reaction would occur closer to the 5'-end whereas the latter would occur distal to it. The length and flexibility of eIF4G, coupled with the complex network of interactions possible among eIF4G, eIF4E, eIF4A, Ded1 and mRNA, could have evolved to support the plasticity required to deal with the wide variety of mRNA shapes, sizes and structures that must be loaded onto PICs for translation in eukaryotic cells where transcription and translation are uncoupled.</p><p>mRNAs can form long-range interactions between their 5'-UTRs and coding sequences or 3'-UTRs, but because our reporter mRNAs consisted of only 5'-UTRs and the first 60 nucleotides of their coding sequences, interactions of this kind would not be recapitulated in our system. Therefore, the role of Ded1 in resolving such long-range interactions remains to be elucidated. Additionally, our reporter mRNAs lack 3'-poly(A) tails and the recruitment assay was performed in the absence of the poly(A) binding protein (PABP). PABP can interact with eIF4G, and it would thus be useful in the future to explore how PABP-eIF4G interactions influence Ded1-eIF4G interactions and Ded1 functions in mRNA recruitment and scanning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of mRNAs and charged initiator tRNA</title><p>Plasmids for in vitro run-off mRNA transcription of Ded1-hypodependent and -hyperdependent mRNAs were constructed using Gibson assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>).

For kinetic analysis, 2 µl aliquot were removed at appropriate times, reactions were stopped by addition of 600–1000 nM non-radiolabeled m<sup>7</sup>G-mRNA (same mRNA as the <sup>32</sup>P-m<sup>7</sup>G mRNA), and loaded onto a 4% non-denaturing PAGE gel to separate 48S PICs from the free mRNA. Percentage of mRNA recruited to the 48S PIC was calculated using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Data were fitted with a single exponential rate equation to calculate apparent rate of recruitment using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy). Apparent rates were plotted against the concentration of the titrant and fitted with hyperbolic equation to calculate the maximal rates of recruitment and the concentration of the titrant required to achieve the half-maximal rates (K<sub>1/2</sub>). To measure the maximal endpoints of recruitment, the reactions were incubated for 100–200 min (as judged by the kinetic experiments). Prism 7 (GraphPad) was used for the statistical analyses and bar-graph data representations. Heatmaps were made in RStudio using gplots and RColorBrewer libraries.</p><p>Dissociation experiments were conducted to measure any off-rates (k<sub>off</sub>) to verify that the addition of unlabeled m<sup>7</sup>G-mRNA to stop the reactions did not result in the dissociation of already-formed 48S PICs. PICs were assembled, and reactions were initiated as described above. A 20–30-fold excess of same unlabeled m<sup>7</sup>G-mRNA was added before the reactions were initiated (no mRNA recruitment was observed) or after 2–20 min of incubation (depending on the k<sub>app</sub>). Aliquots were loaded on the gel at indicated times, and percentage mRNA recruited was calculated. The data were fitted with a linear curve.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>ATPase assay</title><p>NADH-coupled ATPase assay was performed as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yourik et al., 2017</xref>). Ded1 (100–500 nM) was added to reactions containing 1X Recon buffer, 2.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mM NADH, 1/250 dilution of the PK/LDH mix (pyruvate kinase (600–1000 units/mL) and lactate dehydrogenase (900–1400 units/mL)), 2 µM uncapped <italic>RPL41A</italic> mRNA, and reactions were initiated by addition of 5 mM ATP·Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Reaction rates (V<sub>0</sub>) were calculated from linear slope of plot of NADH oxidation over time measured as absorbance A<sub>340</sub>. k<sub>cat</sub> was calculated by dividing V<sub>0</sub> by Ded1 concentration. To estimate the K<sub>m</sub> of ATP, ATP was titrated at 0–10 mM concentrations. Rates were plotted against the concentration of the ATP and fitted with Michaelis- Menten equation to calculate the K<sub>m</sub> of ATP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fluorescence anisotropy assay</title><p>Fluorescent anisotropy assay was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Walker et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, ssRNA labeled with fluorescein at the 3?-end was incubated with Ded1 concentration (0–750 nM) in the absence of any nucleotide or in the presence of 5 mM ADP·Mg<sup>2 +</sup>and ADPNP·Mg<sup>2 +</sup>in 1X Recon buffer, and fluorescent anisotropies were measured with excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 nM and 520 nM, respectively. The data were fitted with a hyperbolic equation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Roy Parker and Eckhard Jankowsky for gifts of Ded1 expression plasmids, and Thomas Dever and Nicholas Guydosh for thoughtful comments and suggestions.

The work was expertly done and data support the conclusions. They raise, however, several shared concerns. They also suggested improvements to strengthen the manuscript. Consequently, we include the full text of the reviewers' comments. The major criticisms concern the discrepancies between your earlier publication of ded1 function in vivo and the results of this paper. We think that you can respond adequately to the criticisms of the reviewers by additional experimentation and clarification. We therefore invite you to submit a revised manuscript that successfully addresses these concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>RNA secondary structure in the 5'UTR of mRNA largely determines translation efficiency by impeding the loading of the 43S ribosomal pre-initiation complex (PIC) onto the 5' end of mRNA and subsequent scanning. The yeast DEAD-box RNA helicase Ded1 cooperate with the canonical RNA helicase eIF4A in resolving the 5'UTR secondary structure. However, whether Ded1 and eIF4A perform distinct or overlapping functions remains unknown. This study for the first time provides a detailed biochemical analysis of the role of Ded1 in the promotion of 43S PIC attachment and scanning on the model and native mRNAs. The authors reconstituted Ded1 acceleration of 48S PIC assembly in a yeast translation initiation system containing purified components (40S ribosomal subunits, initiation factors, ATP and <sup>32</sup>P-labeled mRNA). The system faithfully recapitulated increased Ded1 dependence of mRNAs that are Ded1-hyper-dependent in vivo. Other major findings are (1) Ded1 dependence of 48S PIC assembly correlated with the degree of mRNA secondary structure. (2) Ded1 stimulated both PIC attachment and scanning. (3) Ded1 better alleviated the inhibitory effects of the stem-loop structures in a cap-distal than cap-proximal location. (3) For a subset of mRNAs, Ded1 stimulation was completely dependent on eIF4G-eIF4E. In contrast, all mRNAs exhibited the requirement for eIF4A. (4) The interaction between the RNA3 domain of eIF4G and Ded1-CTD facilitated Ded1 function in mRNA recruitment to the PIC. (5) Deletion of the eIF4G RNA2 domain, which interacts with Ded1, or the N-terminal domain of Ded1, which interacts with eIF4A, conferred mRNA-specific defects in 48S PIC assembly. These studies show the functional importance of an eIF4G-eIF4E-eIF4A-Ded1 tetrameric complex in the initiation of translation of structured mRNAs.</p><p>Importantly, a human homolog of Ded1, DDX3, is known to alter the translation of specific mRNAs in tumors and in viral infections. Thus, the new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Ded1 function reported will be appealing to a broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) General. It would be nice to confirm the role of the eIF4G-eIF4E-eIF4A-Ded1 ternary complex in translation initiation in a more physiological setting, such as crude yeast extract. Could they compare the inhibitory effects of eIF4A and Ded1 dominant-negative mutants on the translation of mRNAs with and without prominent secondary structure in this system?</p><p>2) It is not clear whether the ~20-fold excess of unlabeled capped mRNA is sufficient to stop the recruitment of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled mRNA. A control showing inhibition of <sup>32</sup>P-mRNA binding to the 43S PIC by different concentrations of unlabeled mRNA added at the beginning of the incubation should be provided.</p><p>3) The authors conclude that Dedd1 activity is dependent on the eIF4G-eIF4A complex, yet in Figure 3 dedd1 exhibits activity on several mRNAs (<italic>SFT2, OST3-Sl</italic>) in the absence of eIF4G-eIF4E complex. How is this explained?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors use a reconstituted yeast translation system to assess the consequences of Ded1 on 48S PIC assembly using a small collection of hypo- and hyper-dependent mRNAs (identified from previous studies). They report that Ded1 hyper-dependent mRNAs are inherently less capable of PIC formation and more dependent on Ded1 for rapid recruitment in vitro (compared to in vivo Ded1 hypo-dependent mRNAs). The work appears well performed and in general the data support the conclusions drawn.</p><p>Is Ded1 normally saturating in vivo? If you look at the data in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, with the exception of <italic>OST3</italic> mRNA, eIF4A is sufficient to generate the majority of 48S PICs and adding Ded1 minimally improves this. Can the authors provide similar curves for <italic>PMA1, FET3</italic>, and <italic>SFT2-M</italic>? Yet, the authors show in Figure 1C. that RPL41A recruitment is appreciably stimulated by Ded1 in vitro. If Ded1 is not limiting in vivo, then the endpoints for most of the mRNAs would be similar.</p><p>Are the 48S PICs formed in vitro cap-dependent? How about the complexes formed in the presence of Ded1, but in the absence of eIF4E:eIF4G (Figure 3)?</p><p>In Figure S1I – The authors do not show a precursor/product relationship between the minor and major conformers (i.e., how do they know the minor species are &quot;collapsing&quot; down to the major species in the presence of Ded1? Has this experiment been done with eIF4F? Hence, it is difficult to know what these data are actually contributing to the overall story and the authors should consider removing it.</p><p>Subsection “Ded1 stimulation is completely dependent on eIF4G·eIF4E for a subset of mRNAs and all mRNAs require eIF4A in the presence or absence of Ded1”, first paragraph – I would urge the authors not to use only eIF4G to represent the eIF4E-eIF4G heterodimer, this will only cause confusion.</p><p>The authors generate eIF4G-ΔRNA2, eIF4G-ΔRNA3, Ded-ΔATP, and Ded-ΔCTD mutants to show that the effects of Ded1 on 48S PIC formation is eIF4G dependent. Can they validate in their system that the pairs generated abolish or severely affect such interaction. Since some of the observed effects with these mutants appear to indicate that a higher concentration of mutant is required to achieve enhancement of recruitment, why not combine pairs of mutants to see if this bears out? Also, in the Discussion, the authors write, &quot;mRNA recruitment depends on Ded1 functioning within the eIF4E.eIF4G.eIF4A.Ded1 complex; and that eliminating any interaction between Ded1 and eIF4G or eIF4A necessitates a higher concentration of the mutant variant for efficient complex formation.&quot; Can they, at a minimum, show that the Ded1 mutants used in this study interact less efficiently with eIF4G?</p><p>Would any robust RNA helicase substitute for Ded1 in the reconstitution assay?</p><p>The sixth paragraph of the subsection “Ded1 and eIF4G mutants affect the maximal rates for recruitment differently depending on the mRNA” – of the Discussion appears quite speculative and could be condensed/removed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors use in vitro mRNA recruitment assays to further elucidate how yeast Ded1, eIF4A and their interactions with the eIF4G/ eIF4E complex contribute to 48S pre-initiation complex assembly and scanning along the mRNA 5'UTR. The authors build on their previous studies selecting mRNAs considered to be hyper and hypo-dependent on Ded1 for translation to conduct their assays. They demonstrate that Ded1 enhances mRNA recruitment for all the reporter mRNAs with hyper-dependent mRNAs requiring a higher concentration of Ded1 to recruit mRNA. They go on to show that the presences of stem loops in the 5'UTR increase the dependence for Ded1 in 48S assembly. They then demonstrate that eIF4A is essential for 48S PIC assembly in all mRNAs and that Ded1 cannot replace the role eIF4A plays in 48S PIC assembly. In addition, they present evidence that the Ded1 interactions with the eIF4F complex are important in mRNA recruitment for some reporter mRNAs.</p><p>This is a well-written manuscript and was relatively easy to understand. The paper builds on a number of recent observations from various labs (including the authors' labs) concerning the roles of Ded1 and eIF4A in PIC assembly. I'm not sure the paper divulges anything particularly novel mechanistically, but it does confirm a number of observations made in vivo using an in vitro assay that directly assess the key event; 48S complex assembly.</p><p>1) In some aspects the in vitro assay does not necessarily reproduce the situation observed in vivo. First, Ded1 was shown previously by this group to be required for maintaining the translation of roughly 10% of yeast mRNAs (Sen et al., 2015), whereas all mRNAs tested in vitro show some dependence. Second eIF4A is shown here to be required for 48S PIC formation on all mRNAs tested, whereas previously reductions in eIF4A function affected the translation efficiency of very few mRNAs. These differences at least need to be commented upon and some rational explanation provided.</p><p>2) The reporter mRNAs that are used consist of the 5'UTR and the first 60nt of the CDS. However, in the previous paper they suggested that elements within the CDS and 3'UTR might engage in long range interactions to form inhibitory structures that confer dependence on Ded1.

It would be nice to confirm the role of the eIF4G-eIF4E-eIF4A-Ded1 ternary complex in translation initiation in a more physiological setting, such as crude yeast extract. Could they compare the inhibitory effects of eIF4A and Ded1 dominant-negative mutants on the translation of mRNAs with and without prominent secondary structure in this system?</p></disp-quote><p>There are published data available supporting the formation of an eIF4F-Ded1 complex in yeast extracts. Pulldown experiments from yeast cell extracts using antibodies against Ded1 revealed that Ded1 associates with eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A (Senissar et al., 2014). Hilliker et al., 2011) showed that Ded1 associates with eIF4G⋅eIF4E in translation-competent yeast extracts when eIF4G⋅eIF4E was bound to a cap column. Using purified proteins, they also found that the Ded1-CTD domain interacts with the eIF4G-RNA3 domain. Confirming the reviewer’s prediction, they further demonstrated that addition of the ATPase mutant Ded1<sup>E307A</sup> dominantly inhibited translation in the extracts. We agree with the reviewer that this line of experimentation is important and have now emphasized these previous studies in the Introduction (fourth and fifth paragraphs).</p><p>Moreover, in addition to showing that the dominant-negative Ded1<sup>E307A</sup> mutant fails to stimulate recruitment of any of the natural mRNAs (Figure 1—figure supplement 1I), as the reviewer suggested, we have also now shown that Ded1<sup>E307A</sup> is unable to accelerate recruitment of <italic>-SL</italic> mRNA, which has an unstructured 5′-UTR, nor that of <italic>CP-8.1</italic> and <italic>CD-8.1</italic> mRNAs, harboring stable stem-loops in their 5′-UTRs. These data were added in new Figure 2—figure supplement 1G and cited in Results (subsection “Evidence that Ded1 stimulates the PIC attachment and scanning steps of initiation”, end of second paragraph).</p><p>Additionally, we have now examined recruitment of <italic>RPL41A</italic> mRNA with WT Ded1 and Ded1<sup>E307A</sup> present together in reactions, and found that Ded1<sup>E307A</sup> interferes with WT Ded1 function, as the presence of 500 nM mutant enzyme increased the K<sub>1/2</sub> value for WT Ded1 by ~4-fold (253 ± 27 nM with the mutant present vs. 60 ± 7 nM for WT Ded1 alone). We have added these new data in Figure 1—figure supplement 1J and discussed them in Results (subsection “Ded1 enhances the rate of recruitment of all natural mRNAs tested”, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear whether the ~20-fold excess of unlabeled capped mRNA is sufficient to stop the recruitment of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled mRNA. A control showing inhibition of <sup>32</sup>P-mRNA binding to the 43S PIC by different concentrations of unlabeled mRNA added at the beginning of the incubation should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a new figure showing this control (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) and discuss it in Results: “The addition of ~20-fold excess non-radiolabeled mRNA in the quench was adequate to prevent further recruitment of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled mRNA, and did not dissociate the pre-formed <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 48S complexes on the timescale of the recruitment experiments.” In this experiment, different concentrations of unlabeled mRNA were added along with <sup>32</sup>P-capped <italic>RPL41A</italic> mRNA and recruitment was measured over time. Unlabeled capped <italic>RPL41A</italic> was added along with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled capped <italic>RPL41A</italic> mRNA (and ATP) at 10X (red), 20X (blue) or 33X (green) the amounts of labeled mRNA. The 20X addition completely inhibited detectable 48S PIC assembly on <sup>32</sup>P-labeled mRNA, and a higher concentration of unlabeled <italic>RPL41A</italic> (~33X) did not confer further inhibition. The results for “20X – 2 min” (cyan) show that addition of 20X unlabeled <italic>RPL41A</italic> after 2 min of incubation with <sup>32</sup>P-capped <italic>RPL41A</italic> to form 48S PICs containing <sup>32</sup>P-mRNA did not result in loss of signal from the complex on the timescale of the kinetic assays employed in this study indicating that the labeled mRNA was stably bound once assembled into the 48S PIC and that the addition of the chase did not lead to its dissociation. This information has now been added to the figure supplement legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors conclude that Dedd1 activity is dependent on the eIF4G-eIF4A complex, yet in Figure 3 dedd1 exhibits activity on several mRNAs (SFT2, OST3-Sl) in the absence of eIF4G-eIF4E complex. How is this explained?</p></disp-quote><p>Our model that Ded1 acts as a part of a tetrameric complex with eIF4G⋅eIF4E⋅eIF4A (based on the higher K<sub>1/2</sub> values of mutant eIF4G and Ded1 proteins impaired for their mutual interactions) does not preclude the idea that Ded1 can act independently of eIF4E⋅eIF4G on certain mRNAs. In fact, as the reviewer points out, Ded1 stimulates recruitment of four mRNAs (<italic>SFT2, OST3, SFT2-M</italic>, and <italic>CD-8.1</italic>) in the absence of eIF4E⋅eIF4G, indicating it can function to some extent outside of the eIF4G·eIF4E·eIF4A·Ded1 complex on these mRNAs (Figure 3, green bars). Ded1 could interact with other factors such as eIF4A, with the 40S ribosomal subunit, or with the mRNA itself to aid in the recruitment of these mRNAs without eIF4E⋅eIF4G (Gao et al., 2016; Guenther et al., 2018). This may represent an additional function of Ded1, at least on some mRNAs. However, because the maximal recruitment rates occur for all mRNAs in the presence of both eIF4E⋅eIF4G and Ded1 (Figure 3, orange bars), Ded1 likely functions within the eIF4G·eIF4E·eIF4A·Ded1 complex as well for these four mRNAs. We have added a more detailed explanation of these results in the Discussion (subsection “Ded1 and eIF4G mutants affect the maximal rates for recruitment differently depending on the mRNA”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Is Ded1 normally saturating in vivo? If you look at the data in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, with the exception of OST3 mRNA, eIF4A is sufficient to generate the majority of 48S PICs and adding Ded1 minimally improves this. Can the authors provide similar curves for PMA1, FET3, and SFT2-M? Yet, the authors show in Figure 1C. that RPL41A recruitment is appreciably stimulated by Ded1 in vitro. If Ded1 is not limiting in vivo, then the endpoints for most of the mRNAs would be similar.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added endpoint data for <italic>PMA1</italic> and <italic>FET3</italic> to Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><p>The reviewer is correct in noting that the endpoints are close to 90% in the absence of Ded1 for all mRNAs except <italic>OST3</italic> and <italic>PMA1</italic> (see new data added for <italic>PMA1</italic>); although we do not regard the effect of Ded1 in increasing the endpoints of these last two mRNA to be a minimal effect. More importantly, it should be noted that Ded1 confers large, order-of-magnitude increases in maximal rates of recruitment for the various Ded1-hyperdependent native mRNAs (Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1H) and the two synthetic mRNAs with stem-loops (Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1F), as well as ~2-3-fold rate increases for the Ded1-hypodependent and <italic>-SL</italic> mRNAs (Figures 1B and 2C), thus indicating that Ded1 accelerates 48S PIC assembly on all mRNAs in a manner that cannot be achieved with eIF4A alone. We believe that the Ded1 stimulation of rates of mRNA recruitment, and not only the higher endpoints achieved after long periods of incubation with Ded1, will be crucial in setting the overall rates of initiation (and thus protein synthesis) for most mRNAs in vivo. Consistent with this, depletion of Ded1 has global effects on translation initiation rates in vivo (Firczuk et al., 2013) as do mutations that affect the function of the factor (Chuang et al., 1997; Sen et al., 2015). Moreover, even at saturating Ded1, the maximum rates achieved for <italic>OST3, FET3</italic>, and the synthetic mRNAs <italic>CP-8.1</italic> and <italic>CD-8.1,</italic> remain well below those achieved for the other mRNAs examined, indicating that differences in recruitment rate among mRNAs should persist in vivo even if Ded1 is present at saturating levels for all mRNAs in cells, which of course might not be the case. We have edited Figure 3—figure supplement 1 to better highlight the increase in apparent rates that are achieved upon Ded1 addition for all mRNAs, even when Ded1 does not appreciably increase the recruitment endpoint.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the 48S PICs formed in vitro cap-dependent? How about the complexes formed in the presence of Ded1, but in the absence of eIF4E:eIF4G (Figure 3)?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous work from our lab (Mitchell et al., 2010; Yourik et al., 2017) has shown that the presence of 5′-cap blocks aberrant mRNA recruitment and imposes a requirement for eIF4E⋅eIF4G and eIF4A for maximal recruitment rate. The uncapped mRNAs can be recruited to 43S PICs (as observed by a gel-shift assay) without these factors, but the resulting complexes are aberrant and are not positioned at the start codon (as judged by toe-printing), suggesting that they are unable to either locate or stably associate with the start codon (Mitchell et al., 2010). Thus, the 5′-cap blocks recruitment in the absence of eIF4E⋅eIF4G or eIF4A, and the PICs recruited to capped mRNA in the presence of these factors are located at the start codon. In the current study, only 5′-capped mRNAs were used in all experiments, including Figure 3, to avoid the formation of these aberrant complexes, especially in the absence of eIF4E·eIF4G. We have now clarified these issues in the text (subsection “Ded1 stimulation is completely dependent on eIF4E·eIF4G for a subset of mRNAs and all mRNAs require eIF4A in the presence or absence of Ded1”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure S1I – The authors do not show a precursor/product relationship between the minor and major conformers (i.e., how do they know the minor species are &quot;collapsing&quot; down to the major species in the presence of Ded1? Has this experiment been done with eIF4F? Hence, it is difficult to know what these data are actually contributing to the overall story and the authors should consider removing it.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a good point; accordingly, the data and corresponding text have been removed. We agree that these data did not contribute significantly to the conclusions of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Ded1 stimulation is completely dependent on eIF4G·eIF4E for a subset of mRNAs and all mRNAs require eIF4A in the presence or absence of Ded1”, first paragraph – I would urge the authors not to use only eIF4G to represent the eIF4E-eIF4G heterodimer, this will only cause confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed eIF4G to eIF4E·eIF4G throughout, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors generate eIF4G-ΔRNA2, eIF4G-ΔRNA3, Ded-ΔATP, and Ded-ΔCTD mutants to show that the effects of Ded1 on 48S PIC formation is eIF4G dependent. Can they validate in their system that the pairs generated abolish or severely affect such interaction. Since some of the observed effects with these mutants appear to indicate that a higher concentration of mutant is required to achieve enhancement of recruitment, why not combine pairs of mutants to see if this bears out? Also, in the Discussion, the authors write &quot;mRNA recruitment depends on Ded1 functioning within the eIF4E.eIF4G.eIF4A.Ded1 complex; and that eliminating any interaction between Ded1 and eIF4G or eIF4A necessitates a higher concentration of the mutant variant for efficient complex formation.&quot; Can they, at a minimum, show that the Ded1 mutants used in this study interact less efficiently with eIF4G?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous work from several labs (Gao et al., 2016; Hilliker et al., 2011; Senissar et al., 2014) has established physical interactions between the Ded1-CTD and eIF4G-RNA3 domain, Ded1 and the eIF4G-RNA2 domain, Ded1-NTD and eIF4A, as well as between Ded1 and eIF4E in simplified systems consisting of purified Ded1 and eIF4G/eIF4A/eIF4E. Our data support the existence of these interactions and extend the previous work by providing strong evidence that these interactions are functionally important in mRNA recruitment, but to different extents on different mRNAs.</p><p>Based on the astute suggestion of the reviewer, to strengthen our conclusion that the pairwise interaction between the Ded1-CTD and eIF4G-RNA3 enhances Ded1 function, we have now performed mRNA recruitment assays in which the eIF4G-ΔRNA3 and Ded1-ΔCTD mutants are employed together. The prediction would be that if these two domains interact, combining their deletions would produce the same degree of recruitment defect as does either deletion alone because once the interaction is lost by deleting one of the domains, removing the other will have no additional effect. This is, in fact, the result we observe, and we have added the data as Figure 4—figure supplement 1E and the following text in the Results section: “To further verify that RNA3 of eIF4G and Ded1-CTD interact in mRNA recruitment, we combined the eIF4E·eIF4G-ΔRNA3 and Ded1-ΔCTD variants in the same assays (at the saturating concentrations determined for each alone). […] These data strongly suggest that the changes in k<sub>max</sub> values conferred by eliminating either eIF4G-RNA3 or Ded1-CTD arise from loss of interaction between these two domains, because once the interaction is disrupted by removing one domain no further defect results from also removing the other.”</p><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting this incisive experiment.</p><p>Unfortunately, because of problems with aggregation of the eIF4G-ΔRNA2 and Ded1-ΔNTD mutant proteins at the high concentrations required for saturation, we were unable to perform an analogous experiment to provide similar support for the interactions involving their deleted domains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would any robust RNA helicase substitute for Ded1 in the reconstitution assay?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not tested unrelated DEAD box RNA helicases in the mRNA recruitment assay. However, our data and those of other labs indicate that Ded1 plays a highly specific role in the process in conjunction with eIF4F. As noted above, Ded1 interacts with eIF4G, eIF4E, and eIF4A through its N- and C-terminal domains (Gao et al., 2016; Hilliker et al., 2011; Senissar et al., 2014), which are variable in sequence among different DEAD box proteins (Fairman-Williams et al., 2010). Our results indicate that efficient Ded1 function is dependent on the interactions of its NTD and CTD with eIF4G and eIF4A in an mRNA-specific manner (Figures 7A and 7B). It seems unlikely that these specific interactions would occur with other RNA helicases that contain unrelated N- and C-terminal domains. However, it is possible that the eIF4E⋅eIF4G-independent function of Ded1 observed for certain mRNAs (Figure 3C-E, G) might also be supported by another RNA helicase. It will be interesting to test this in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The sixth paragraph of the subsection “Ded1 and eIF4G mutants affect the maximal rates for recruitment differently depending on the mRNA” of the Discussion appears quite speculative and could be condensed/removed.</p></disp-quote><p>This proposal in the Discussion has been simplified and revised to: “Since the <italic>RPL41A</italic> and <italic>HOR7</italic> mRNAs have short and less-structured 5′-UTRs, it is plausible that PIC attachment could be rate-limiting on these two mRNAs (Figure 7D (i)), whereas scanning of the 5′-UTR could be rate-limiting on the two cap-distal SL containing mRNAs, <italic>SFT2</italic> and <italic>CD-8.1</italic> (Figure 7D (ii)).”</p><p>Correspondingly, Figure 7D has also been simplified to make clear the speculative nature of this proposal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p></disp-quote><p><italic>[…] This is a well-written manuscript and was relatively easy to understand.

Additionally, Ded1 acts both alone and in association with eIF4F to resolve local and global mRNA structures that impede PIC attachment or scanning to the start codon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) In some aspects the in vitro assay does not necessarily reproduce the situation observed in vivo. First, Ded1 was shown previously by this group to be required for maintaining the translation of roughly 10% of yeast mRNAs (Sen et al., 2015), whereas all mRNAs tested in vitro show some dependence. Second eIF4A is shown here to be required for 48S PIC formation on all mRNAs tested, whereas previously reductions in eIF4A function affected the translation efficiency of very few mRNAs. These differences at least need to be commented upon and some rational explanation provided.</p></disp-quote><p>The ribosome profiling experiments in our previous study were designed to identify relative translational changes between WT and mutant Ded1 or eIF4A strains. These experiments invariably yield different ribosomal footprint and total mRNA read counts due to different sequencing depths for different samples and the read counts must be normalized between samples to account for these differences. This normalization masks the global translational reductions in Ded1 and eIF4A mutants revealed by polysome profile analysis (Supplementary Figure 1, Sen et al., 2015)). Therefore, only relative translational efficiency (TE) changes, not absolute translational changes, were reported in our previous study; and the 10% of mRNAs mentioned above that were identified in a <italic>ded1</italic> mutant represents the group of mRNAs exhibiting greater than average TE reductions (by a factor of ≥2 with strong statistical support) – dubbed the Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs. Those mRNAs exhibiting no change or even increased relative TE in <italic>ded1</italic> cells most likely exhibit reductions in absolute TEs in the mutant vs. WT cells, which are simply smaller in magnitude than the average TE change, and thus display an increase in relative TE in the mutant. Despite a comparable, strong reduction in bulk protein synthesis in the eIF4A mutant, &lt;1% of mRNAs exhibit a significant ≥ 2-fold decrease in relative TE, indicating that the majority of mRNAs are impaired by very similar amounts in the eIF4A mutant. Thus, our current findings that representatives of the Ded1-hypodependent group of mRNAs are stimulated by Ded1 in vitro, only to a smaller extent compared to Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs, and our finding that all mRNAs require eIF4A for recruitment in vitro, are both fully consistent with the conclusions of our previous profiling study. We have now included this interpretation of ribosome profiling data, and also explained the lack of any discrepancy between in vivo results from ribosome profiling and our current in vitro findings, in the Discussion under the heading “DEAD-box proteins Ded1 and eIF4A have complementary but distinct functions in mRNA recruitment”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reporter mRNAs that are used consist of the 5'UTR and the first 60nt of the CDS. However, in the previous paper they suggested that elements within the CDS and 3'UTR might engage in long range interactions to form inhibitory structures that confer dependence on Ded1. In addition, the role of Pab1 in 48S PIC recruitment would not be observed using the in vitro system described, yet as Pab1 also interacts with eIF4G, this could impact on the level of dependence on Ded1 in vivo for a particular mRNA. Again these limitations of the in vitro system should be discussed and the caveats they raise explored in the context of other literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that long-range mRNA interactions could also play a role in Ded1-dependence. We also agree that PABP could influence Ded1 dependence, and Ded1’s interaction with eIF4G. However, even with reporter mRNAs comprised mostly of 5′-UTRs sequences and without PABP in our assay, we found good agreement between in vivo results obtained previously with similar reporter constructs assayed in <italic>ded1</italic> vs. WT cells (Sen et al., 2015) and our in vitro data regarding their degree of Ded1 dependence. Nevertheless, we accept the reviewer’s point and have added the following statements to the Discussion “mRNAs can form long-range interactions between their 5′-UTRs and coding sequences or 3′-UTRs, but because our reporter mRNAs consisted of only 5′-UTRs and the first 60 nucleotides of their coding sequences, interactions of this kind would not be recapitulated in our system. […] PABP can interact with eIF4G, and it would thus be useful in the future to explore how PABP-eIF4G interactions influence Ded1-eIF4G interactions and Ded1 functions in PIC recruitment and scanning.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) When the stem loop in the 5'UTRs of SFT2 and PMA1 mRNA is eliminated, these mRNAs now exhibit similar k<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>1/2</sub> values to that of the hypo-dependent mRNAs with short 5'UTR (RPL41A and HOR7) and the reporter with an unstructured 5'UTR (-SL).

Moreover, in response to a suggestion by reviewer # 2, we have provided additional evidence that the eIF4G-ΔRNA3 and Ded1-ΔCTD truncations impair Ded1 function by abrogating the interaction between these two domains, as we showed that removing both domains simultaneously produces no more severe diminution of Ded1 function than does either truncation on its own, as described in new Figure 4—figure supplement 1E and new text in Results (subsection “Interaction between the RNA3 domain of eIF4G and Ded1-CTD stimulates mRNA recruitment”, fourth paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
