regulates cargo sorting processes. Here, we established that SNX32, an SNX-BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) sub-family member associates with SNX4 via its BAR domain and the residues A226, Q259, E256, R366 of SNX32, and Y258, S448 of SNX4 that lie at the interface of these two SNX proteins mediate this association. SNX32, via its PX domain, interacts with the transferrin receptor (TfR) and Cation-Independent Mannose-6-Phosphate Receptor (CIMPR), and the conserved F131 in its PX domain is important in stabilizing these interactions. Silencing of SNX32 leads to a defect in intracellular trafficking of TfR and CIMPR. Further, using SILAC-based differential proteomics of the wild-type and the mutant SNX32, impaired in cargo binding, we identified Basigin (BSG), an immunoglobulin superfamily member, as a potential interactor of SNX32 in SHSY5Y cells. We then demonstrated that SNX32 binds to BSG through its PX domain and facilitates its trafficking to the cell surface. In neuroglial cell lines, silencing of SNX32 leads to defects in neuronal differentiation. Moreover, abrogation in lactate transport in the SNX32-depleted cells led us to propose that SNX32 may contribute to maintaining the neuroglial coordination via its role in BSG trafficking and the associated monocarboxylate transporter activity. Taken together, our study showed that SNX32 mediates the trafficking of specific cargo molecules along distinct pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sorting nexin</kwd><kwd>basigin</kwd><kwd>monocarboxylate transporter</kwd><kwd>Neuro2a</kwd><kwd>HeLa</kwd><kwd>receptor recycling</kwd><kwd>transferrin receptor</kwd><kwd>CIMPR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRG/2019/004580</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Datta</surname><given-names>Sunando</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBT-JRF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sugatha</surname><given-names>Jini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007780</institution-id><institution>Indian Institute of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Apr2019/709/BS/iiserb/Sunando Datta</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Datta</surname><given-names>Sunando</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The adaptive SNX32 regulates cargo sorting in neuronal and non-neuronal cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Approximately 25% of the human genome encodes for integral membrane proteins (around 5500 proteins). Efficient intracellular transport of these proteins and associated proteins and lipids (together termed ‘cargoes’) is essential for organelle biogenesis, maintenance, and quality control. This is an extensive field that encompasses the secretory, endosomal, lysosomal, and autophagic pathways, all fundamental features of eukaryotic cells. Efficient integration of these pathways is essential for cellular organization and function, with errors leading to numerous diseases, including those associated with aging and neurodegeneration.</p><p>The endosomal network is composed of a series of distinct compartments that function to efficiently sort and transport cargo proteins between two distinct fates: either sorting for degradation in the lysosome or retrieval from this fate for recycling and transport to an array of organelles that include the cell surface, and the biosynthetic and autophagic pathway. The sorting nexin family is a conserved group of proteins with diverse roles in regulating the function of the endosomal network. Other than the PX-driven lipid specificity, much of the functional diversity displayed by the family could be apprehended by its ability to indulge in protein dimerization and oligomerizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simonetti et al., 2019</xref>). It is interesting to note that individual SNX-BAR proteins incapable of remodeling membrane in vitro (SNX5, SNX6, SNX7, SNX30, SNX32, etc.) are observed to undergo heterodimeric interactions with SNX-BAR proteins possessing an intrinsic membrane remodeling capacity (SNX1, SNX2, SNX4, SNX8, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Weering et al., 2012</xref>). Protein–protein interactions thus add layers of intricate regulations, increasing the complexity of the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Weering et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Conserved throughout eukaryotes, defects in the function of these proteins are linked with various pathologies, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2017</xref>), where they are associated with trafficking and processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simonetti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Weering et al., 2010</xref>), Down’s syndrome (DS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vieira et al., 2021</xref>), cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>), schizophrenia, hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2023</xref>), thyroid disorders, and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vieira et al., 2021</xref>). The pathological implications of sorting nexin is an emerging area of extensive investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vieira et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Sorting nexin 32 (SNX32), also known as SNX6b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simonetti et al., 2017</xref>), on account of sequence similarity to its paralogue sorting nexin-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Weering et al., 2010</xref>), is an underexplored member of the sorting nexin-containing BAR domain (SNX-BAR) sub-family of sorting nexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Weering et al., 2010</xref>). SNX32 is a component of the recently identified endosomal SNX-BAR sorting complex for promoting exit 1 (ESCPE-1), a heterodimer of SNX1/SNX2 associated with SNX5/SNX6/SNX32. ESCPE-1 regulates the sequence-dependent sorting of transmembrane cargo by recognizing and binding to a specific bipartite motif present within their cytosolic tail, an interaction mediated by the SNX5, SNX6, and SNX32 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simonetti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simonetti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kvainickas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wassmer et al., 2007</xref>). The previous reports suggest that the ESCPE-1 complex identifies a bipartite signal sequence (Ф × Ω × Ф where Ф is hydrophobic and Ω is amino acid with aromatic side chains) present in the cytosolic tail of the prototypical cargoes and assists in its retrieval and recycling to TGN as well as to the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simonetti et al., 2019</xref>). Even though it is referred that similar to its homologs SNX5/SNX6, SNX32 contributes to the trafficking of the CIMPR, it is yet to be demonstrated experimentally. Moreover, SNX32 is absent in non-higher metazoans, and in humans, its expression is higher in the brain compared to other tissues (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/SNX32">http://www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/SNX32</ext-link>). This prompted us to investigate the role of sorting nexin in neuronal differentiation. In spite of heavy reliance on endocytic trafficking for functional fluidity in neurons, the underlying interlaced network of sorting leading to recycling or degradation remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lasiecka and Winckler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horton and Ehlers, 2003</xref>). In this study, we have investigated the interaction of SNX32 within the SNX family, its lipid affinity, and its role in the intracellular trafficking of CIMPR, transferrin receptor, and Basigin. We begin to define the function of SNX32 in intracellular trafficking in neuronal cell lines, revealing an important contribution to the process of neurite outgrowth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SNX32 undergoes BAR domain-assisted interaction with SNX1 and SNX4</title><p>The characteristic ability of the SNX-BAR family of proteins to undergo oligomerization directed us to examine the ability of SNX32 to participate in such interactions within the family. We utilized a GFP nanobody-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fridy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kubala et al., 2010</xref>) immunoprecipitation (GBP-IP) assay where GST-GBP immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads was incubated with extracts from HEK293T cells overexpressing GFP/GFP-SNX1/GFP-SNX4/GFP-SNX8/GFP-SNX32 and HA-SNX32. The eluates were resolved through SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting. Immunoblotting using an anti-HA antibody showed that GFP-SNX1 (0.98), GFP-SNX4 (0.92), GFP-SNX8 (0.62), and SNX32 (0.85) efficiently precipitated HA-SNX32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), which is also in agreement with the report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sierecki et al., 2014</xref>. To identify the limiting region on SNX32 that contributes to these interactions, we generated two deletion constructs, an SNX32ΔN, spanning the BAR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sierecki et al., 2014</xref>) (167–404), and SNX32ΔC, spanning the PX domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandra et al., 2019</xref>) (1–166) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

To assess whether the two SNXs are involved in direct interaction, we attempted to purify individual interacting partners from bacterial expression systems. Though His-SNX32ΔC was purifiable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), SNX32FL, SNX32ΔN, as well as the GST-SNX1/His-SNX32ΔN complex were unavailing due to the insolubility of the expressed proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SNX32 undergoes BAR domain-mediated association with SNX4.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GBP co-immunoprecipitation of GFP/HA-tagged SNX-proteins transiently transfected in HEK293T cells showing GFP-SNX/GFP-SNX4/GFP-SNX8 or GFP-SNX32 efficiently precipitating HASNX32 (representative immunoblot out of three biological replicates, values represent the ratio of HA to GFP band intensity).

In order to identify the critical residues in maintaining the association between these SNXs, we predicted the structure of BAR domain heterodimers using the Alphafold2-Multimer (ColabFold) program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mirdita et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Generated models showed a high overall predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) score, suggesting the high accuracy of the models. A few stretches (residues at the kinks between two helices) and several terminal residues have low pLDDT scores. However, most of the dimeric interface regions have a pLDDT score of more than 85. To assess the accuracy of our predictions, we modeled the homodimer of the SNX1-BAR domain for which the X-ray crystal structure (PDB ID: 4FZS) as well the cryo-EM structures (PDB ID: 7D6D and 7D6E) were already available. A comparison of the predicted model with the experimentally known SNX1-BAR homodimer revealed that the predicted model is highly consistent with the cryo-EM structure, thus resembling the membrane-bound SNX1 homodimer.</p><p>The predicted heterodimeric models of SNX32-BAR with SNX1-BAR and SNX4-BAR adopt a banana-shaped structure, a characteristic of conventional BAR domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–L</xref>). In the case of the SNX1-SNX32 BAR heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>), the buried surface area (BSA) of SNX1-BAR and SNX32-BAR is 2572 Å<sup>2</sup> and 2519 Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Similarly, the BSA of SNX4-BAR and SNX32-BAR in the SNX4-SNX32 BAR heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>) is 2514 Å<sup>2</sup> and 2505 Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively. High BSA represents the formation of strong heterodimers. On a closer look at the interphase of the SNX4-SNX32 complex, there are seven salt bridges and nine hydrogen bonds, whereas, in the case of the SNX1-SNX32 complex, there are four salt bridges and six hydrogen bonds. The overlay of SNX1-SNX32 and SNX4-SNX32 revealed that the curvature attained in either case is comparable. The comparison of SNX1-SNX32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>) with SNX32-SNX32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J–L</xref>) revealed that Y242, R366, and K400 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H and K</xref>) of SNX32 participate in stabilizing both homodimeric and the heterodimeric interface, whereas D223, L399, and E402 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H and I</xref>) uniquely mediate the interactions at the heterodimeric interface.

Of note, F370 is involved in mediating a pi–pi interaction with F264 of SNX32 and W265 of SNX4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and F</xref>).

This prompted us to understand the lipid-binding specificity of each domain in cellulo.</p><p>We utilized phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinases-inhibitors phenyl arsine oxide (PAO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shin et al., 2020</xref>), a PI4 kinase inhibitor, or Wortmannin, a PI3 kinase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Powis et al., 1994</xref>), to acutely deplete the intracellular PI(4)P or PI(3)P, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Niu et al., 2013</xref>). To confirm the specificity of PAO treatment, its effect on GFP-PH<sup>OSBP</sup>, a family of tethering proteins that bind specifically to PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mesmin et al., 2013</xref>), was assessed. Similarly for confirming the specificity of Wortmannin treatment, its effect on EEA1, an FYVE domain-containing protein that specifically binds to PI(3)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stenmark et al., 2002</xref>), was examined. To negate any off-target effect RFP-PH<sup>PLCδ</sup>, a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcia et al., 1995</xref>) motif was used as a negative control. The cells un-transfected or overexpressing GFP-PH<sup>OSBP</sup>, RFP-PH<sup>PLCδ</sup>, GFP-SNX32, HA-SNX32ΔC, HA-SNX32ΔN were treated with PAO (15 μM)/ Wortmannin (200 nM) in uptake medium for 15 min at 37°C and proceeded for immunofluorescence. Consistent with the previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Niu et al., 2013</xref>), PAO treatment caused redistribution of GFP-PH<sup>OSBP</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), whereas Wortmannin treatment caused the redistribution of endogenous EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>) with less or no effect on the distribution of other PIns binding markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Niu et al., 2013</xref>), indicating the depletions were specific on either case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I and J</xref>).

The effect of PAO on HA-SNX32ΔC was further confirmed using a membrane fractionation experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seaman et al., 2009</xref>). HeLa cells overexpressing GFP-PH<sup>OSBP</sup> or HA-SNX32ΔC were incubated with PAO for 15 min at 37°C followed by snap-freezing to fracture the membrane and release the cellular contents.

It was previously reported that Cation-Independent Mannose-6-Phosphate Receptor (CIMPR) interacts with SNX32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simonetti et al., 2019</xref>) and the interaction follows the canonical sequence-dependent recognition similar to CIMPR and SNX5/SNX6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simonetti et al., 2017</xref>).

Our results from confocal microscopy showed that SNX32 and SNX1 colocalize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>) and co-transports CIMPR (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Further, we observed that the SNX1 knockdown (KD)/SNX6KD/SNX32KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) resulted in the steady-state redistribution of CIMPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref>), which was also seen to be correspondingly more with EEA1-positive early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Moreover, the double KD of SNX1 and SNX32 did not show any significant difference in the redistribution of CIMPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J and I</xref>). On the contrary, the downregulation of SNX6 along with SNX32 showed a significant increase in the redistributed CIMPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K and I</xref>). Moreover, the effect of SNX32KD in redistribution of CIMPR was reaffirmed using shRNA-mediated SNX32 downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–F</xref>). We did not find any significant reduction in the total level of CIMPR upon suppression of SNX6/SNX32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G and H</xref>). To further confirm whether the steady-state redistribution of CIMPR upon SNX32KD resulted from a defect in the kinetics of transport, we performed an antibody uptake assay utilizing CD8-CIMPR reporter endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seaman, 2004</xref>). In control cells, after incubating the cells with an anti-CD8 antibody to label the cell surface CD8-CIMPR, the kinetics of transport revealed that the CD8-CI-MPR had reached Golgi after an incubation period of 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I and J</xref>).

Previously, it has been reported that SNX4 suppression alters the levels of transferrin receptor (TfR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Traer et al., 2007</xref>) by diverting it from the recycling route to the lysosomal degradative pathway. Though SNX32 is largely colocalized with SNX4 on EEA1-positive early endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we also observed a small but significant SNX32 population on the transferrin receptor-positive recycling compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Our results from confocal microscopy on paraformaldehyde (PFA)-fixed cells and live-cell video microscopy revealed that SNX32 and SNX4 colocalize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>) and co-transport with transferrin (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). We then assessed the recycling of transferrin in HeLa cells depleted for SNX32 using siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or shRNA clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We observed no significant difference in the integral intensity of transferrin in the initial timepoints (0–10 min) of the chase period. However, in the course of a 60 min chase, the scrambled cells (SCR) followed a trend of diminishing integral fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), whereas SNX32KD cells retained the intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We characterized the nature of the endosomes in which transferrin was present and found that it was retained in the early endosomes positive for EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). Moreover, the receptor’s distribution along with the transferrin revealed both being present in the EEA1-positive vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>). In agreement with this, the shRNA-mediated SNX32 downregulated (shSNX32) conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) also showed similar effects.

HeLa cells treated with SCR, siRab11 (RAB11KD), and/or siSNX32 (SNX32KD) cells were serum-starved for 2 hr, incubated with 10 µg/ml of transferrin (Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated) for 30 min pulse and chased using 100 µg/ml of holotransferrin for a maximum of 30 min at 37°C. As reported earlier, the colocalization of transferrin with EEA1 was significantly higher in Rab11KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Further, the depletion of both proteins led to a significant increase in the localization of transferrin with EEA1 compared to either SNX32KD or Rab11KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Moreover, we observed that the overexpression of GFP-SNX32 in Rab11KD cells did not show any significant difference in the transferrin colocalization with EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>).

Moreover, the conserved phenylalanine within the stretch was found crucial for maintaining the interaction between SNX5 and CIMPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simonetti et al., 2019</xref>) without influencing the dimerization with its heterodimerization partner, SNX1/SNX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simonetti et al., 2019</xref>). We superimposed the already available crystal structure of IncE-bound SNX32 PX domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandra et al., 2019</xref>) on CIMPR-bound SNX5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simonetti et al., 2019</xref>) structure. The analysis of the superimposed structure revealed that the conserved phenylalanine (F131 for SNX32) engages in a stacking interaction with a phenylalanine (Phe) residue of IncE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Of note, the Inc proteins of the pathogen are known to mimic the interactions of native host proteins with the sorting machinery to establish a successful infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paul et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the F131 of SNX32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) is predicted to directly associate with cargo proteins containing the ESCPE-1 bipartite sorting motif. To delineate the importance of the residue, we performed a GBP-IP using lysate from HeLa cells overexpressing GFP-SNX32 WT/GFP-SNX32 F131D. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, the SNX32 F131D mutant failed to precipitate CIMPR, whereas it was successful in precipitating endogenous SNX1, thereby validating the role of the Phe in binding with CIMPR.

In order to investigate the role of SNX32 in the directional flow, we set out to identify the cargo repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simonetti et al., 2017</xref>) of the SNX. We applied a quantitative SILAC-based proteomics approach to define the interactome in neuronal cells. We first lentivirally transduced SHSY5Y, a human neuroblastoma cell line to stably express GFP-tagged SNX32. In agreement with the previous report in RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simonetti et al., 2017</xref>), in SHSY5Y cells, GFP-SNX32 largely colocalized with EEA1 harbouring endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>).

So, we further established an SHSY5Y cell line stably expressing GFP-SNX32 F131D. We observed that GFP-SNX32 F131D also retained the ability to associate with endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We then performed differential SILAC-based proteomics by comparing the interactomes of wild-type SNX32 and SNX32 F131D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The comparative proteomics highlighted several cargoes that bind to SNX32 through a mechanism that requires the critical F131 residues within the hydrophobic groove of the SNX32 PX domain. Based on the abundance ratio: (SNX32 F131D)/(SNX32 WT), we found several transmembrane proteins interacting with SNX32, including the well-established cargo CIMPR. Among these, BSG was one of the strongest quantified interactors in addition to CIMPR. BSG showed enrichment in SNX32 interactome but a drastic reduction in F131D interactome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). BSG is a transmembrane receptor belonging to the superfamily of immunoglobulins. BSG, also known as EMMPRIN, CD147, or human leukocyte activation-associated M6 antigen, is involved in a myriad of cellular processes, including tissue remodeling, visual sensory system development in mice, regulation of neuronal development, and the cell surface concentration of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Muramatsu, 2016</xref>). To validate the interaction of SNX32 with BSG, we first utilized an mCherry nanobody-based immunoprecipitation (mCBP-IP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fridy et al., 2014</xref>) assay. GST-tagged mCBP immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads was incubated with U87MG cell extracts overexpressing mCherry/mCherry-SNX6/mCherry-SNX32. Immunoblotting using an anti-BSG antibody showed that endogenous BSG was efficiently precipitated by mCherry-SNX32 but not mCherry-SNX6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L and M</xref>). As previously demonstrated, the PX domain of SNX32 precipitates CIMPR and TfR. To identify whether a similar mechanism is relevant in the case of interaction with BSG, we performed an affinity chromatography-based pulldown assay, which showed that the PX domain of SNX32 contributes to the interaction with BSG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N and O</xref>). We also carried out GBP-IP of full-length GFP- SNX32 WT and GFP-SNX32 F131D. While the endogenous BSG protein could be co-immunoprecipitated with the GFP-SNX32 wild-type, the interaction was lost for the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7P and Q</xref>). Together, these data establish BSG as a selective interacting partner for canonical binding to the PX domain of the ESCPE-1 component SNX32.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>SNX32 phenocopies BSG in neurite outgrowth assay</title><p>Previously, it was reported that BSG plays a crucial role in complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shrestha et al., 2021</xref>) and space-filling dendrite growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alizzi et al., 2020</xref>) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. As we observed a similar phenotype in SNX32-suppressed conditions, we next set forth to see whether the case is similar under BSG downregulation in neurite induction of Neuro2a cells. shRNA clones were used to downregulate SNX32 (SNX32KD) or BSG (BSGKD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) and the cells were differentiated to form neurites by replacing the standard growth media (MEM with 10% FBS) with the differentiation media (MEM with 1% FBS containing 10 μmol/l retinoic acid). We observed that in BSG-deficient cells the number of cells with elongated neurites was less, which is in accordance with the previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lagenaur et al., 1992</xref>). Further, we noted that the number of cells with elongated neurites in the case of SNX32KD was comparable to that of BSGKD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>), suggesting that the gene silencing of SNX32 phenocopies the depletion of BSG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lagenaur et al., 1992</xref>). Although most cells showed sprouting in either SNX32 or BSG-suppressed conditions, the length of these sprouts was limited (less than the diameter of the cell body). As evident from the DIC time-lapse live-cell video imaging, sprouting was visible in ≥80% of the cells within the initial few hours in all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–G</xref>).

The constant shuttling of metabolic fuels such as ketone bodies, pyruvate, and lactate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergersen, 2007</xref>) plays a major role in contributing to this coordination. Monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCTs) play a critical role in neuroglial coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jha and Morrison, 2020</xref>) by facilitating the transport of monocarboxylates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gallagher et al., 2007</xref>). It has been reported that BSG acts as a cochaperone for MCTs and facilitates their surface localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirk et al., 2000</xref>). Accordingly, BSG knockdown causes the accumulation of MCTs in the endolysosomal compartment, leading to reduced lactate concentration in the culture supernatant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Walters et al., 2013</xref>). Lactate is the most common substrate for MCT transport in the brain, where it is transported from its site of synthesis to the site of consumption between the glia and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergersen, 2015</xref>).

Similar interdependence was also observed for SNX6 and SNX27, where their heterodimerization with SNX1/2 or SNX1, respectively, was shown to be important for membrane recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yong et al., 2021</xref>). Though the contribution of heteromeric interactions in membrane localization of SNX32 is in place, the role of PIns affinity of the PX domain cannot be disregarded. The results from our cellular localization study on SNX32-PX in the presence or absence of Wortmannin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1L</xref>) indicated that SNX32’s PX domain might also contribute to its localization on endosomes. Likewise, its affinity toward PI4P, as evident from its localization in PAO-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), corroborates well with SNX32’s association with Golgi/recycling compartments. Although this was further supported by the results from the PIP strip-based studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>) using His-SNX32ΔC, the PLiMAP investigations did not show any detectable binding of His-SNX32ΔC to PI(3)P or PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). However, the apparent contradiction of the above observations could be explained by SNX32’s low PIns binding affinities. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that as reported earlier for SNX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stenmark et al., 2002</xref>)/SNX4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seaman et al., 2009</xref>), both the PX domain as well as the BAR domain contribute to the membrane recruitment of SNX32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Traer et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, the cooperative binding of the heterodimeric partners could also be crucial in the membrane remodeling as well as cargo recognition stages of cargo sorting. Earlier reports have shown that SNX32, similar to its closest homologs SNX5 and SNX6, was unable to induce in vitro membrane tubulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Weering et al., 2012</xref>; our results indicate that it may not be due to the SNX’s insufficiency in membrane association. Based on our results, we hypothesize that SNX32 engages in a heteromeric interaction with a partner, efficient in inducing membrane tubules such as SNX4, while it itself contributes to cargo recognition through its PX domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N–O</xref>). Besides, it is noted in heterodimeric associations of SNX1/SNX5 and SNX1/SNX6, while SNX5, SNX6 lead cargo recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simonetti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simonetti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kvainickas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Niu et al., 2013</xref>), SNX1, SNX2 are known to contribute to membrane remodeling establishing the mutual cooperativity of the individual SNX proteins during cargo sorting. Also, it has been reported in the case of SNX3-retromer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lucas et al., 2016</xref>), SNX27-SNX1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yong et al., 2021</xref>) that the interaction among the individual members of the above complexes enhances their affinity to the cargo. Thus, it could be possible that the cargo recognition, membrane recruitment, as well as membrane remodeling by SNX32 could be facilitated by the cooperative mode of interactions.</p><p>In this context, the role of motor proteins in driving the cargo containing vesicles from the source compartment to the destination is of particular interest. For instance, in the case of SNX1/5 and SNX1/6 complex, the interaction of SNX5/SNX6 with p150glued, an activator of motor protein Dynein, is necessary for the tubular sorting carrier formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wassmer et al., 2009</xref>). Further, the affinity difference between the interaction with the motor and the PIns in the destination membrane commission the cargo dislodging, as delineated in the case of SNX1/SNX6 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Niu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong et al., 2009</xref>). Since SNX32 belongs to the SNX5/SNX6 cluster, the possibility of SNX32 carrying out the cargo sorting in a similar course is highly probable. In addition, the investigation of CIMPR/TfR trafficking was focused on understanding the contribution of SNX32 in retrograde/recycling trafficking route (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). We showed that the role of SNX32 in TfR fits well into the already existing model of the transferrin trafficking route which includes SNX4 and Rab11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–G</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Graphical abstract showing SNX32’s multifaceted role in trafficking and neuroglial coordination.</title><p>SNX32 through its BAR domain associate with SNX4, co-traffic TfR from early endosome to recycling endosomes. Similarly, SNX32 interacts with SNX1, co-traffic CIMPR from early endosome to TGN. Further, the proposed role of SNX32 contributing to the endosome to surface trafficking of BSG. BSG being the co-chaperone of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 20, 26, 54 helps in the surface localization of MCTs. In conclusion, the derailing of SNX32-mediated BSG trafficking reduces the surface population of BSG as well as MCTs, disrupting the neuroglial coordination and manifests as neurite differentiation defect in cellulo.

Thus, it provides a means to transport cargo from early endosomes to plasma membrane via recycling endosomes/TGN in anterograde/retrograde fashion, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Further, we were able to demonstrate that F131 of SNX32 is a crucial amino acid in mediating the interaction with the cargoes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7P–Q</xref>). Though the mechanistic insight into the sorting events is still enigmatic for the individual cargo molecules, it is likely that the drill would be similar to that observed for β2-adrenergic receptor or Wntless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Varandas et al., 2016</xref>) where the sorting is ultimately limited/decided by the relative concentration of the cargoes in membrane subdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simonetti et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The relatively higher expression of SNX32 in brain tissue and its absence in non-higher metazoans suggests the specific necessity of the protein in the context of neuronal differentiation. Further, it is interesting to note that the interactome of SNX32 encompasses proteins such as PGRMC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bali et al., 2013</xref>), ROBO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagri et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fouquet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kidd et al., 1998</xref>), SV2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Janz et al., 1999</xref>), and BSG, which are known to be vital in neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simonetti et al., 2017</xref>). This study begins to delineate a role for SNX32 in regulating neuronal differentiation through its cargo protein, BSG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). BSG contributes to a plethora of physiological functions, including sensory and nervous system functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Muramatsu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Igakura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Philp et al., 2003</xref>). BSG’s interaction with integrin is necessary for cytoskeletal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Curtin et al., 2005</xref>), which is crucial during neurite outgrowth. Our data suggest that SNX32 regulates the surface localization of BSG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D–G</xref>) via its role in plasma membrane recycling of the latter from endosomes, explaining the observed phenocopying of SNX32 and BSG. Further, it has been shown that BSG acts as a chaperone for the MCTs, which plays a crucial role in lactate shuttling and thereby contributes to energy metabolism in neurons. Since lactate accounts for a significant share of energy sources in neurons, the reduced lactate shuttle consequently contributes to defects in neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jha and Morrison, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rossi et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, SNX32, via its role in cell surface transport of BSG, may also regulate MCTs and consequently contribute to energy metabolism in developing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–L</xref>). Moreover, the enrichment of kinesin-1 heavy chain (KiF5b) in the differential proteomics data of SNX32 suggests that this motor protein may be a potential interactor of SNX32 in neuronal cells. Being a plus-end-directed motor, KiF5 plays an essential role in cargo transport during neurite extension, and accordingly, inhibition of KiF5 abrogates axon specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsuzaki et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, it is tempting to speculate that the association with KiF5 may enable SNX32 to contribute to the long-range trafficking of proteins like BSG to the surface.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and antibodies</title><p>pEGFP C1 SNX32 FL, pEGFP C1 SNX1, pEGFP C1 SNX4, mCherry C1 SNX1 were a kind gift from Prof. Peter J Cullen. pGEX6P1 GFP Nanobody (#61838, Addgene) was purchased from Addgene and subcloned to pGEX6P1 for improved induction, pGEX6P1mCherry nanobody (#70696, Addgene) was purchased from Addgene. pLVX TRE 3G and pLVX EF1α Tet3G were part of Tet-On 3G Inducible Expression Systems (631363, Takara Bio Inc). pCMV6-Entry Myc DDK CD147 (BSG) (#: RC203894 Origene). pLVX TRE3G pHluorin BSG (subcloned from #RC203894), pLVX-TRE3G GFP-SNX32#4r were synthesized by commercial cloning service provider GenScript USA Inc pmCherry-Rab 11 was a kind gift from Prof. Marino Zerial. pIRES neo2 CD8 CIMPR was a kind gift from Prof. Matthew NJ Seaman. pmCherry C2-PH <sup>PLCδ</sup> was a kind gift from Prof. Pietro De Camilli. pEGFP C1 PH<sup>OSBP</sup> was a kind gift from Prof. Tamas Balla. pLVX TRE3G GFP-SNX32FL, pcDNA3 HA N(I)-SNX32 FL, pmCherry C2-SNX32 FL, pcDNA3 HA N(I)-SNX 32 ΔN, pcDNA3 HA N(I)-SNX32 ΔC, His-SNX32FL, His-SNX32ΔN, His-SNX32ΔC, GST-SNX32FL, GST-SNX32ΔC were subcloned from pEGFP C1-SNX32FL, RFP C1-SNX4 was subcloned from pEGFP C1-SNX4. pcDNA3 HA N(I)-SNX32#4r, pcDNA3 HA N(I)- SNX32#4rΔN, pEGFP-SNX4Y258E, pEGFP-SNX4S448R, pcDNA3 HA N(I)-SNX32 R220E, pcDNA3 HA N(I)-SNX32A226E, pcDNA3 HA N(I)-SNX32E256R, pcDNA3 HA N(I)-SNX32 Q259R, pcDNA3 HA N(I)-SNX32 R366E were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis.</p><p>Antibodies used in this study are anti-GFP (11814460001, Roche; WB,1:3000), anti-HA(C29F4, Cell Signaling Technology, WB, 1:1000, IF, 1:500), anti-His (MA1-21315, Invitrogen; WB, 1:10,000), anti-EEA1 antibody was a kind gift from Prof. Marino Zerial, anti-HA (sc7392, Santa Cruz, WB/IF, 1:500), anti-TGN46 (AHP1586, AbD Serotec, IF, 1:200), anti-transferrin receptor (13-6800, Invitrogen; WB, 1:1000, IF, 1:200), transferrin 488 (T13342, Invitrogen, IF, 5µg/ml), transferrin 568 (T23365, Invitrogen, IF, 5µg/ml), transferrin 647 (T23366 Invitrogen, live imaging, 10 µg/ml), anti-SNX1 (611482, BD Biosciences, IF, 1:500) anti-Vinculin (V9131, Sigma-Aldrich, WB, 1:1000), anti-CIMPR (ab2733, Abcam, IF, 1:500), anti-CD8 (153-020, Ancell, IF, 1:500, live imaging, 1:300), anti-CIMPR (ab124767, Abcam, WB, 1:50,000), anti-mCherry (M11217, Invitrogen; WB, 1:1000, IF, 1:500), anti-CD147(345600, Invitrogen; WB/IF, 2 µg/ml), c-Myc (9E10-sc40, Santa Cruz, IF, 1:500), and anti-ARF6 antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Vimlesh Kumar.</p><p>HeLa cells were a kind gift from Prof. Marino Zerial, Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, and also procured from ATCC (ATCC no.: CCL-2TM, lot number: 70046455).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Felix Campelo as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #2, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Agata Witkowska (Reviewer #1); Alex J B Kreutzberger (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We all agree that this paper has the potential to become an important paper. However, in its present state, the manuscript is very difficult to follow. The authors should make an effort to rewrite and organize the paper in a manner that helps readers understand and appreciate the data The individual reviews make some suggestions, but the authors should make a substantial effort in improving/rewriting the manuscript, so it flows clearly and the readers are not lost in details.</p><p>Regarding the experiments, some simple experiments/clarifications will be required to strengthen the proposal (see individual reports for details):</p><p>2) Explain/quantify better what you mean by &quot;colocalization&quot; in the fluorescence microscopy images.</p><p>3) Add missing information in the methods section.</p><p>4) Provide further evidence of PI3P vs PI4P binding (Reviewers #1 and #2 suggest some experiments along these lines).</p><p>5) Discuss if SNX32's main role is largely to direct trafficking steps from early endosomes to recycling endosomes, back to the plasma membrane? And is this a general mechanism for all recycled receptors or specific for TfR, CIMPR, and BSG trafficking? Also, discuss the possibility of cooperative binding with other proteins on endosomes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported with experiments; however, some points need additional clarification. I have suggestions and comments that I believe should be addressed before publication.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1. Authors state that expression of SNX32 in HeLa cells is comparable to U87MG and Neuro2a although graph in Figure S2A shows reduced by half expression in Neuro2a. This should be clarified in the text. Also, statistical analysis is missing in this graph.</p><p>2. In the method description for the colocalization analysis authors state that &gt;35% overlap is considered as colocalization, although in Figure 2B Rab11 or TGN46 are hardly colocalized with SNX32 (less than 20%). However, authors state in the description of the confocal experiment that colocalization was visible (line 187). Authors should rephrase this part to indicate that these results come rather from live-cell microscopy or super-resolution microscopy experiments.</p><p>3. Super-resolution microscopy videos (Videos 2,3) seem hard to interpret as colocalization. Here (including Figure 2FG), some additional quantifications would be beneficial. Additionally, since there is quite a substantial difference in colocalization visible by confocal and super-resolution imaging in case of Golgi marker and Rab11, it requires a negative control with another organelle marker that does not show colocalization. Moreover, it is hard for the reader to refer it to the appropriate section in the methods section (&quot;SIM sample preparation&quot;), as the two are not linked by any key word (either &quot;super-resolution&quot; or SIM).</p><p>4. Details of all qRT-PCR should be added to the methods sections. Primers used should be listed in the final version of the manuscript.</p><p>5. Authors predict heterodimeric BAR structures of SNX32 with SNX1 and SNX4 with AlphaFold2-Multimer; however, details of these analyses are missing from the methods section. Input sequences (or at least residue-ranges) should be stated as well as details of how the obtained models were analyzed that ultimately led to identification of key residues.</p><p>6. The PIP-strip experiment (Figure 2H) does not show specificity for PI(3)P or PI(4)P, however authors make a point that it is PI(3)P and PI(4)P that PX of SNX32 binds to and directs to endosomes. This statement in the abstract is not fully justified by experiments. Even though, treatment with PI-inhibitors, shows re-localization from endosomes to the cytoplasm, it needs to be considered that specific subcellular localization could be mediated by interactions with other endosomal partners as well as cooperativity in membrane binding by PX and BAR domains (as suggested by different results with either deltaC or deltaN version of the protein and with very minor effect on the full length). Here, additional experiments looking at least at SNX1 and SNX4 localization upon inhibitor treatment are required as well as more extensive discussion of the results.</p><p>7. Authors show that SNX6 and SNX32 have overlapping roles in TfR trafficking; however, do not provide such analysis for CIMPR (for example in Figure S3L).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This article presents a large number of interesting observations. However, as I see it, the current manuscript will be very difficult to read and appreciate for most readers. The main reason, to my point of view, is that the paper is very long and it is very difficult to keep in focus when reading it.

We now showed using the assay, referred to as proximity-based labelling of membrane-associated proteins (PLiMAP) <sup>3, 4</sup>, as an additional evidence of lipid affinity of SNX32ΔC protein. The assay is based on UV activation of a fluorescent lipid reporter, which in turn crosslinks with proteins bound to membranes and renders them fluorescent. PLiMAP assays were carried out as described previously<sup>3, 4</sup>, with a few modifications. Proteins and liposomes were mixed at a final concentration of 2 and 200 µM, respectively in a total volume of 30 µl of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) with 150 mM NaCl buffer. The reaction mix was transferred to a 96-well plate and incubated for 30 min at 25 ºC in the dark. The plate was then exposed to 365 nm UV light (UVP crosslinker CL<sup>-</sup>1000L) and an energy setting of 200 mJ.cm-2 for 1 min. The plate was placed at a distance of 3 cm from the lamp. Sample buffer was then added to the reaction mixture, aliquoted out into an eppendorf, boiled at 99 ºC, and resolved using SDS-PAGE.

Alternatively, SNX32 may have much weaker binding affinities compared to the controls used here. The information is included in the text from line No.: 220-224; Figure 3—figure supplement 2 B.

And is this a general mechanism for all recycled receptors or specific for TfR, CIMPR, and BSG trafficking? Also, discuss the possibility of cooperative binding with other proteins on endosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>Our results shows that the role of SNX32 is not just constrained to the trafficking from early endosome to recycling endosome, but also to the retrograde trafficking pathway as well (Line 557-570). In our study the SNX32 is involved in the transferrin recycling to the plasma membrane whereas in the case of CIMPR the SNX contributes to its trafficking from early endosome to the Golgi. However, our data could only suggest that the surface population of BSG is reduced upon the depletion of the SNX. Further investigations will be required to dissect that the detailed intracellular itinerary of BSG which is guided by SNX32. Moreover, the cooperative binding of the heterodimeric partners could also be crucial in the cargo recognition stage. It is noted in heterodimeric associations of SNX1/SNX5 and SNX1/SNX6, while SNX5, SNX6 lead cargo recognition<sup>8</sup>, SNX1/SNX2 are known to contribute to membrane remodelling establishing the mutual cooperativity of the individual SNX proteins during cargo sorting. Also, it has been reported in case of SNX3-retromer<sup>7</sup>, SNX27-SNX1/2<sup>8</sup> the interaction of the complex improves the affinity with which the complex binds with the cargo. Thus, it could be hypothesised that the cooperative interactions of the heterodimeric complex facilitate the cargo recognition, membrane recruitment as well as membrane remodelling.

Our intention by showing the Figure 2—figure supplement 1 A, was to explain that the expression of SNX32 in HeLa cells was comparable with that in human brain-derived cells such as U87MG (Line No. 164-167), based on which we went ahead to do various biochemical and imaging-based investigations in HeLa cells. We also did the analysis and the plot (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 A) is now revised to incorporate the significance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In the method description for the colocalization analysis authors state that &gt;35% overlap is considered as colocalization, although in Figure 2B Rab11 or TGN46 are hardly colocalized with SNX32 (less than 20%). However, authors state in the description of the confocal experiment that colocalization was visible (line 187). Authors should rephrase this part to indicate that these results come rather from live-cell microscopy or super-resolution microscopy experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers rightly pointed out the confusion created due to the presentation of the data, in the following section for a better understanding we have elaborated the detailed methodology of the colocalisation calculations used throughout the current study.</p><p>The colocalisation of SNX32 and Rab11 was indeed calculated with the confocal images using the automated image analysis software, Motion Tracking<sup>1, 2</sup> (http://motiontracking.mpi-cbg.de), has an optimised algorithm for detecting the inhomogeneous background of fluorescent cytoplasm.

Super-resolution microscopy videos (Supplementary Videos 2,3) seem hard to interpret as colocalization. Here (including Figure 2FG), some additional quantifications would be beneficial.

Moreover, it is hard for the reader to refer it to the appropriate section in the methods section (&quot;SIM sample preparation&quot;), as the two are not linked by any key word (either &quot;super-resolution&quot; or SIM).</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewers for rightly pointing out that the speed of the super resolution microscopy images was making them hard to interpret. The super resolution videos (video 2, video 3) are now slowed down so as to help the reader appreciate the observation of mCherry-SNX32 associated with GFP-Golph3 marked Golgi scaffold. Similarly in case of mCherry-Rab11 and GFP-SNX32 the punctate are not completely overlapping.

Top-ranked models with the best prediction quality (higher overall pLDDT score) were selected for further analysis. The obtained models were analysed for intermolecular polar interactions (hydrogen bonds and salt bridges) to determine potential key residues participating in the dimer formation.

The PIP-strip experiment (Figure 2H) does not show specificity for PI(3)P or PI(4)P, however authors make a point that it is PI(3)P and PI(4)P that PX of SNX32 binds to and directs to endosomes. This statement in the abstract is not fully justified by experiments. Even though, treatment with PI-inhibitors, shows re-localization from endosomes to the cytoplasm, it needs to be considered that specific subcellular localization could be mediated by interactions with other endosomal partners as well as cooperativity in membrane binding by PX and BAR domains (as suggested by different results with either deltaC or deltaN version of the protein and with very minor effect on the full length). Here, additional experiments looking at least at SNX1 and SNX4 localization upon inhibitor treatment are required as well as more extensive discussion of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly agree with the reviewer’s suggestion that the specific subcellular localisation could be mediated by interactions with other endosomal partners as well as cooperativity in membrane binding by PX and BAR domains. Indeed our recent experiments using PLiMAP<sup>3, 4</sup>/ liposome pelleting assay does not show a binding with PI(3)P, PI(4)P and therefore strengthens the hypothesis that the subcellular localisation of SNX32 requires other interacting proteins. And accordingly, the cooperativity in membrane binding of PX and BAR domain is a possibility. Accordingly, the Discussion section is now revised “Line number:518-529”.</p><p>As per the suggestion the effect of Wortmannin in the localisation of SNX1 and SNX4 was investigated and it was observed that the effect of Wortmannin was much pronounced in the localisation of GFP-SNX1 and GFP-SNX4 compared to SNX32, it is now incorporated in the results (Line 209-210) and the effect of inhibitors on localisation of SNX32 is further discussed “In HeLa cells, the results from the colocalisation studies on SNX32 in the absence or presence of SNX1/SNX4 (Figure 3 A, Figure 4 A, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 D-F) or the PI3K inhibitor-wortmannin (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1 K-M) indicate that the BAR domain-mediated interaction of the SNX with SNX1/SNX4 may contribute to its recruitment to EEA1, harbouring early endosomes. Similar interdependence was also observed for SNX6 and SNX27, where their hetero-dimerisation with SNX1/2 or SNX1, respectively, was shown to be important for membrane recruitment <sup>12, 13</sup>. Though the contribution of heteromeric interactions in membrane localisation of SNX32 is in place, the role of PIns affinity of the PX domain cannot be disregarded. The results from our cellular localisation study on SNX32-PX in the presence or absence of Wortmannin (Figure 2—figure supplement 1L), indicated that SNX32’s PX domain might also contribute to its localisation on endosomes. Likewise, its affinity towards PI4P, as evident from its localisation in PAO-treated cells (Figure 2K), corroborates well with SNX32’s association with Golgi/recycling compartments. Although this was further supported by the results from the PIP strip-based studies (Figure 3—figure supplement 2 A) using His-SNX32ΔC, the PLiMAP investigations did not show any detectable binding of His-SNX32ΔC to PI(3)P or PI(4)P(Figure S3 B). However, the apparent contradiction of the above observations could be explained by SNX32’s low PIns binding affinities. Based on these observations we hypothesise that as reported earlier for SNX1<sup>29</sup>/SNX4<sup>31</sup>, both the PX domain as well as a the BAR domain contribute to the membrane recruitment of SNX32<sup>14, 15</sup> (Line 506-529).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Authors show that SNX6 and SNX32 have overlapping roles in TfR trafficking; however, do not provide such analysis for CIMPR (for example in Figure S3L).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the reviewers found the overlapping role of SNX6 and SNX32 interesting and further suggested to investigate the same in CIMPR trafficking. As per the suggestion we have extended analysis for CIMPR, and added all the results in the revised manuscript (line No. 224-254). We have incorporated the results of our double knockdown of SNX32, SNX6 as well as SNX32, SNX1 in the steady state distribution of CIMPR. We observed that the SNX1 knockdown (KD)/ SNX6KD/ SNX32KD (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 A) resulted in the steady-state redistribution of CIMPR (Figure 3 E- H), which was also seen to be correspondingly more with EEA1 positive early endosomes (Figure 3 I). Moreover, the double KD of SNX1 and SNX32 did not show any significant difference in the redistribution of CIMPR (Figure 3 I-J). On the contrary the downregulation of SNX6 along with SNX32 showed a significant increase in the redistributed CIMPR (Figure 3 I-K) (Line No.225-255).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This article presents a large number of interesting observations.

The test was highly repetitive and in every section of the manuscript I often was lost to what major points the authors were trying to make. It also feels like, there are two major stories here 1. Being the interaction partners of SNX32 and SNX32 roles in TfR and CIMPR trafficking and 2. The role of SNX32 in BSG trafficking and the role of this in neuronal differentiation. These two points could easily be two separate papers or major streamlining of this manuscript is needed to make it easier to understand the major points.</p><p>Is SNX32 role largely to direct trafficking steps from early endosomes to recycling endosomes, back to the plasma membrane? And is this a general mechanism for all recycled receptors or specific for TfR, CIMPR, and BSG trafficking?</p></disp-quote><p>Our results shows that the role of SNX32 is not just constrained to the trafficking from early endosome to recycling endosome, but also to the retrograde trafficking pathway as well (Line 557-570). In our study the SNX32 is involved in the transferrin recycling to the plasma membrane whereas in the case of CIMPR the SNX contributes to its trafficking from early endosome to the Golgi. However, our data could only suggest that the surface population of BSG is reduced upon the depletion of the SNX. Further investigations will be required to dissect that the detailed intracellular itinerary of BSG which is guided by SNX32. Moreover, the cooperative binding of the heterodimeric partners could also be crucial in the cargo recognition stage. Besides, it is noted in heterodimeric associations of SNX1/SNX5 and SNX1/SNX6, while SNX5, SNX6 lead cargo recognition<sup>8, 20, 22, 26</sup>, SNX1, SNX2 are known to contribute to membrane remodelling establishing the mutual cooperativity of the individual SNX proteins during cargo sorting. Also, it has been reported in the case of SNX3-retromer<sup>27</sup>, SNX27-SNX1/2 <sup>13</sup> that the interaction among the individual members of the above complexes enhances their affinity to the cargo. Thus, it could be possible that the cargo recognition, membrane recruitment as well as membrane remodelling by SNX32 could be facilitated by the cooperative mode of interactions. 530-544.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I appreciate that the authors made a major effort to address comments that were raised in the review process. I do have, however, some remaining issues, listed below.</p><p>1. I do believe that manuscript could still benefit from reorganizing many of the figures, for example by putting consecutive panels next to each other (especially the main text Figures 3-5).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, accordingly the figure 3-5 is now reorganized by keeping the consecutive panels next to each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 3 it is quite confusing to compare panels E-F with panels L and Q (upper line) as they show similar things, namely the redistribution of CIMPR upon KD of SNX32. Perhaps authors should consider shifting some of these results to the supplementary data. It is also a bit confusing that some panels are labeled with αCIMPR and αEEA1 and others not (was antibody staining used only in some?), as well as that color assigned to CIMPR microscopy images is changed (especially in E-K).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for rightly pointing out the confusion created by side-by-side representation of multiple panels showing similar results. We have now moved some of the supporting results to supplementary files as detailed below and the manuscript text is edited accordingly.</p><p>Figure 3:</p><p>Figure 3L-M (shRNA related results on CIMPR trafficking) are now moved to Figure3—figure supplement 1 C-F.</p><p>Figure 3 N-O (CD8-CIMPR related results on CD8 uptake assay) are now moved to Figure3—figure supplement 1 I-K</p><p>Figure 4:</p><p>Figure 4 J-K (shRNA related data on transferrin uptake) is now moved to Figure 4 —figure supplement 1 A-B</p><p>We apologise for creating confusion in the labelling and pseudo colour assigned to CIMPR and EEA1 which is now corrected in Figure 3, its supplement, and also cross verified in all other panels.</p><p>In addition, we have also corrected the label on Figure 7—figure supplement 1 which was by mistake labelled as ‘C-E’ in the figure panels and ‘A-C’ in the legends as well as in the previous version of the manuscript.
