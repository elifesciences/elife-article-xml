Breathing fulfils two essential functions: provision of oxygen to support metabolism; and removal of the metabolic by-product, CO<sub>2</sub>. Rapid and regulated removal of CO<sub>2</sub> is essential because its over-accumulation in blood will result in death from the consequent drop in pH. Understanding of the complexity of the brain microcircuit regulating CO<sub>2</sub> and pH remains incomplete. Whilst the primacy of the ventral medulla surface (VMS) in central chemoreception was described almost 60 years ago, this region contains multiple chemosensory nuclei that are candidates to mediate adaptive control of breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nattie and Li, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richerson, 1995</xref>). This has led to the idea that central chemosensitivity is mediated by a network of chemosensory nuclei distributed throughout the brainstem and extending as far as the limbic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huckstepp and Dale, 2011b</xref>). Furthermore, there are multiple phenotypes of neurons within single chemosensory nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huckstepp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iceman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iceman and Harris, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johansen et al., 2015</xref>), and even within previously well-defined subpopulations of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stornetta et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Recently, brain imaging techniques have been developed to allow recording of activity of defined cell populations in awake, freely moving animals even in deep brain structures such as the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ziv and Ghosh, 2015</xref>). These methods require: the expression of genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators such as GCaMP6 in the relevant neurons; the implantation of gradient refractive index (GRIN) lenses at the correct stereotaxic position; and a head-mounted mini-epifluorescence microscope to enable image acquisition during the free behaviour of the mouse. We have now adapted these methods to enable recording of defined neuronal populations in the rostral medulla oblongata of mice to analyze the chemosensory control of breathing.</p><p>In this paper, we study the activity of neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mulkey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nattie and Li, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>) and the rostral medullary raphe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bradley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ray et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richerson, 1995</xref>). Evidence strongly favours their involvement in the central chemosensory response, but thorough understanding as to how these nuclei contribute to central chemosensitivity has been hampered by the inability to record the activity of their constituent cells in awake freely behaving adult rodents. Instead, neuronal recordings have been made from young (&lt;14 d) or adult rodents under anaesthesia. Both of these methods have significant drawbacks -the chemosensory control of breathing matures postnatally; and anaesthesia is known to depress the activity of respiratory neurons and reconfigure the circuit.</p><p>We also assess the contribution of the lateral parafacial region (pF<sub>L</sub>) to an often-overlooked aspect of the hypercapnic ventilatory response, active expiration. During resting eupneic breathing, there is little active expiration instead the expiratory step involves elastic rebound of the respiratory muscles to push air out of the lungs. However, when the intensity of breathing is increased for example during exercise or hypercapnia, active expiration (recruitment of abdominal muscles to push air out of the lungs) occurs. Mounting evidence suggests the pF<sub>L</sub> may contain the expiratory oscillator and that neurons in this nucleus are recruited to evoke active expiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huckstepp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, the key step of recording activity of these neurons in awake behaving animals and linking it to active expiration has not been achieved.</p><p>Our data show the pF<sub>L</sub> did not undergo sustained activation during hypercapnia, but instead contributed to acute transient high amplitude expiratory events. We found that neurons in the RTN and Raphe exhibited a range of responses to hypercapnia. Many RTN neurons exhibited fast adapting responses. This response type was less common in the Raphe, and many Raphe neurons exhibited a slower graded response. Our data are consistent with a tiered chemosensory network, with the RTN and Raphe responsible for detecting different aspects of the hypercapnic stimulus. These novel findings illuminate the fundamental functional components of chemosensory nuclei and show that neuronal responses to hypercapnia are considerably more complex than anticipated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optical characteristics of the recording system</title><p>The GRIN lens has a diameter of 600 Âµm with a focal plane ~300 Âµm below the lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jennings et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Resendez et al., 2016</xref>). However, the focal plane varies depending upon the distance between the camera and GRIN lens, which can be altered via a manual turret adjustment to optimise the focus on fluorescent cells. To document the range of focal plane depth in our system, we imaged fluorescent beads entrapped in agarose under two conditions: the turret at its lowest (i.e. camera is against the end of the GRIN lens, and the focal plane is at its closest to the lens) and its maximum setting (i.e. the camera is as far from the end of the GRIN lens as it can be, and the focal plane is at its deepest relative to the lens) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The focal depth (in which the beads were sharply focussed) was 100 Âµm at any single setting and the full focal plane ranged from 150 to 450 Âµm below the end of the lens as the turret moved from its lowest to highest setting. The turret setting is given in all figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria for cells in the study</title><p>Following assessment for inclusion/exclusion criteria, data from 18 mice comprising recordings from 194 cells were included for analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Firstly, we transduced RTN neurons of three mice with AAV-syn-GFP and performed imaging during a hypercapnic challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâD</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1âvideo 1</xref>). This allowed measurement of comparable levels of fluorescence to GCaMP6 to determine whether movement by itself, in the absence of any Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter activity, could generate confounding fluorescent signals. Analysis of changes in fluorescence showed only small amplitude (often negative-going) fluctuations. In no case did we observe large increases in fluorescence of the type we routinely observed when GCaMP6 was expressed (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that movement per se cannot give fluorescence signals that resemble Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals.</p><p>Secondly, we analyzed the movement of the mouse simultaneously with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) via two methods. The first was to analyze the headmount movements in the video recordings of the mouse in the plethysmography chamber using <italic>AnyMaze</italic> tracking software and convert these movements into a colour coded sonogram. The brighter colours in the sonogram indicate headmount movement. The second method analyzed the large excursions on the whole body plethysmography (WBP) trace. These arise artefactually from movement. Comparison of the sonogram based on the WBP trace (WBP Sonogram) and that based on head movement (Mov Sonogram) showed that the two measures correlated well and that large excursions of the WBP trace often coincided with head movement (compare sonograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). When we examined the GCaMP6 fluorescence in conjunction with the sonograms of head and body movement, we observed that: (i) large movements of the head/body did not evoke noticeable changes in GCaMP6 fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ea</xref>,b); (ii) GCaMP6 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals characterized by a fast rise and exponential decay occurred in the absence of any movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ec</xref>,f); and (iii) similar shaped Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals occurred during movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ed</xref>,e). Together this suggests that movement of the head or body of the animal does not prevent the recording of genuine changes in GCaMP6 fluorescence related to changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>Thirdly, we used the same paradigm of stimulation for all experiments as can be seen from the records in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplements 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>. This enabled averaging of the responses aligned either to the onset of hypercapnia, or features of the WBP trace. This averaging brought out consistent features of the presumed Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that were temporally related to either the onset of hypercapnia or alterations of breathing. While for the most part we could not record from the same neurons in different recording sessions from the same mouse, we did observe consistent patterns of neuronal firing between recording sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>). As movement that could give rise to artefact would not be expected to be similar from recording session to recording session, or from mouse to mouse, the consistency of the patterns of the signals between mice and recording sessions strongly suggests a true biological rather than artefactual origin of the recorded signals.</p><p>In some cases, it was possible to identify the same neuron from recording sessions on different days in the same mouse. This was only the case in a minority of sessions perhaps because the brainstem is extracranial and more mobile and thus it is harder to reproduce the same exact focal plane between different recording sessions. When we were able to identify the same neurons their activity patterns were remarkably similar between separate recording sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6</xref>). This gives further confidence that the observed patterns are a reflection of biological properties.</p><p>Finally, we made recordings from anaesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In this case movement artefacts cannot be a potential confounding factor. To elicit neural activity, we induced electrographic seizures via intraperitoneal kainic acid injection in mice in the absence of any behavioural seizure movements such as partial (including forelimb or hindlimb) or whole body continuous clonic seizures (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1âvideo 2</xref>). After ~70 min this resulted in perturbations of the WBP trace and correlated Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in the RTN neurons, presumably denoting the invasion of seizures into this nucleus. Detailed examination revealed that the fluorescence changes were of two types: (i) transients with a fast rise and exponential fall; and (ii) slower sustained changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This is an important observation as it shows that we expect to see two types of genuine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in recordings from freely-moving mice: fast transients with an exponential decay phase, that may sum together and slower more gradual rises.</p><p>Movements of the visual field, evident during most recordings, were corrected for via the Inscopix motion correction software to allow ROI-based measurement of fluorescence to remain in register with the cells during the recording. Where movement artefacts persisted following motion correction, in some cases it was possible to draw additional ROIs over a high contrast area devoid of fluorescent cells, such as the border of a blood vessel. This allowed for a null signal to be subtracted from the GCaMP signal (Figure 7E) thus providing the neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients free of movement artefact. If there was too much uncompensated motion artefact, so that we could not clearly analyze Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, we excluded these recordings from quantitative analysis (details given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). GCaMP6 signals were only accepted for categorization if the following criteria were met: (1) the features of the cell (e.g. soma, large processes) could be clearly seen; (2) they occurred in the absence of movement of the mouse or were unaffected by mouse movement; (3) fluorescence changed relative to the background; (4) the focal plane had remained constant as shown by other nonfluorescent landmarks (e.g. blood vessels). Applying these criteria left 144/194 cells eligible for study.

The localization of successful and accurate transduction was confirmed posthoc by using choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) staining to define the facial nucleus and the location of the transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), with ~7% (9/132) of transduced neurons in the focal plane of the microscope co-labelled with ChAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Therefore, our viral transduction and lens placement allowed us to record from the RTN.

There was a wide variety of neuronal responses to the hypercapnic challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). While we observed 4/98 neurons exhibited a graded response to hypercapnia (E<sub>G</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2âvideo 1</xref>), a much greater number (27/98) were of the adapting subtype (E<sub>A</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2âvideo 2</xref>). This adapting response may also be physiologically meaningful, as it matched the time course of changes in V<sub>E</sub> calculated from the WBP records (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In three mice the averaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> trace of the E<sub>A</sub> neurons in each mouse matched the changes in V<sub>T</sub> for the same mouse and a plot of V<sub>T</sub> versus F/F<sub>0</sub> for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal gave a positive correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This correspondence between features of the responses in these neurons and the adaptive ventilatory response, supports the hypothesis that these are a physiologically important class of chemosensitive neurons. An alternative explanation that the rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sequestration greatly increased during hypercapnia such that Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels fell even although firing rates increased can be excluded by examining the dynamics of individual Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. The rise time of these transients reflects the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, and the exponentially falling decay phase the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion or sequestration. Comparison of these transients before, during and after the hypercapnic stimulus shows that these transients do not change in shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>A further 5/98 neurons were inhibited during hypercapnia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>, blue traces and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3âvideo 1</xref>). These neurons displayed spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity during normocapnia, but were abruptly silenced during hypercapnia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Under resting conditions, eupneic breathing, with the exception of during REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews and Pagliardini, 2015</xref>), does not involve active expiration, so the neurons of the pF<sub>L</sub> are largely silent. A hypercapnic stimulus causes an increase in respiratory frequency, tidal volume and also the onset of active expiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore transduced neurons of the pF<sub>L</sub> in 3 mice with the synapsin-GCaMP6f construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7AâD</xref>) and observed their responses during a hypercapnic stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>).

The summation and temporal variation of the signal will depend on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering/extrusion systems within the cell, the density and activation properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable channels, and whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> may additionally be released from intracellular stores. Therefore, this Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal cannot tell us the precise firing rates or dynamics of the neuronal activity, and so is an imprecise proxy of neuronal activity. Despite this imperfection, Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of neurons is a widely used to assess their electrical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dana et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). We verified that the rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and extrusion or sequestration do not change with the hypercapnic stimulus by examining individual Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients before, during and after hypercapnia to show that their rise times and decay rates remain unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). This gives further confidence that the pattern of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity reflects the pattern of neuronal firing.</p><p>We used GCaMP6s for recording from the RTN and Raphe as this is the most sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor and we did not expect to need to resolve rapidly changing Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. For the pF<sub>L</sub> we used faster responding, but less sensitive, GCaMP6f to attempt to document cycle by cycle changes in fluorescence, but these were not resolved in the current experiments.</p><p>We made our recordings at a single wavelength as this was the capability of the minimicroscopes available at the time of the study. Dual channel versions are now available and these would assist with the treatment and exclusion of movement artefacts e.g. through use of ratiometric imaging at two wavelengths. Nevertheless, our extensive controls for movement artefacts, and data analysis, show that we have resolved real Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that reflect different patterns of neuronal firing that are reproducible between across the imaged neuronal population in different recording sessions from a single mouse and recordings between multiple mice. These signals are characterised by the well-documented pattern for true Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals of a fast onset and a slower exponentially-falling offset.</p><p>While we can be confident of the location of the GRIN lens and the volume of tissue in which labelled neurons could have contributed to the observed signals from posthoc analysis, it is important to note that we cannot identify the actual neurons that were recorded in each session. Related to this, we were unable, for the most part, to make consecutive recordings from the same neurons from session to session. We used a genetic targeting strategy that would give broad coverage of all neuronal types within the nuclei. This presents an overview of the different activity patterns that occur during responses to hypercapnia, however it does not allow identification of the responses of specific neuronal subtypes. Now that we have a library of all activity patterns in these regions, more precise genetic targeting of neurons is required to relate phenotype to firing pattern. Given that no single unique genetic marker has yet been identified to mark chemosensory neurons, such an approach would have to utilize intersectional genetics to achieve the necessary level of precision.</p><p>Our observations document the different types of neuronal responses to hypercapnia in awake mice. However, we cannot be sure whether these responses were a direct consequence of the chemosensory stimulus, i.e. a direct action of CO<sub>2</sub> or pH on the recorded neurons, or an indirect secondary outcome shaped by the synaptic networks present within the medulla. Additionally, recordings from the same neurons in response to repeated periods of hypercapnia would give further assurance that the activity patterns observed are reproducible responses to hypercapnia at a single cell as opposed to population level.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Chemosensory activity in the rostral medulla of adult mice</title><p>For many years the RTN was considered to be a homogeneous population of chemosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guyenet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nattie and Li, 1994</xref>). However, recent neuroanatomical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stornetta et al., 2009</xref>) and pharmacological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huckstepp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2016</xref>) evidence suggests the region may be more heterogenous than first thought and that functional subdivisions of the RTN may exist in adult rodents. In accordance with this, we found 7 functional subpopulations of neurons. There were two classes of neurons that were excited by CO<sub>2</sub> and indicated an aspect of the hypercapnic stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>): E<sub>A</sub> (the start and end of hypercapnia), and E<sub>G</sub> (the presence and magnitude of the hypercapnic stimulus). In addition, there were neurons that were inhibited by hypercapnia (I). Inhibition of RTN neuronal firing by hypercapnia has been previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cleary et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nattie et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ott et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We found the majority of neurons (from five different mice) in our recordings from the RTN were of the E<sub>A</sub> subtype that is they responded to the initial increase in inspired CO<sub>2</sub> but did not maintain their activation. In some of these neurons there could be a further small increase in activity at the transition of inspired CO<sub>2</sub> from 3 to 6%. This suggests that in these neurons some aspect of the sensory response adapts or fatigues, or they are subject to delayed CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent feedback inhibition that depresses their activity. It is notable that in many of these neurons, activity increased following removal of the hypercapnic stimulus. This activation during transitions at the beginning and end of a stimulus is reminiscent of a multitude of rapidly adapting sensory neurons (e.g. rapidly adapting pulmonary receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Widdicombe, 1954</xref>, Pacinian and Meissner corpuscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vallbo and Johansson, 1984</xref>). This could be due to rapid removal of sensory adaptation followed reactivation and rebound activity as the arterial CO<sub>2</sub> levels moves back to resting levels.</p><p>While adapting responses to hypercapnia have not been recognised before, the Phox2b+neurons of the RTN have been subdivided into types 1 and 2 on the basis of their pH sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lazarenko et al., 2009</xref>). Examination of the response characteristics of the example type 1 neuron illustrated in this paper shows that it displayed an adapting response to acidification, taking 30â40 s to decline from peak firing to a steady state baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lazarenko et al., 2009</xref>). By contrast the example type 2 neuron shows a sustained graded response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lazarenko et al., 2009</xref>), similar to that reported for a Phox2B+neuron in an earlier publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stornetta et al., 2006</xref>). A similar subdivision has been made for acutely isolated Phox2b+neurons. In vitro, type 1 neurons also appear to display an adapting response to acidification suggesting that it may be an intrinsic property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). We tentatively suggest that the adapting neurons (E<sub>A</sub>) may therefore correspond to type 1 Phox2b+neurons, however this would require further direct experimental evidence to substantiate this point.</p><p>We found only 4 neurons (from 3 different mice) that exhibited a graded response to CO<sub>2</sub> (E<sub>G</sub>). Although these neurons were in the minority, their graded responses to hypercapnia were very similar in time course to those previously described for Phox2b+ RTN neurons in the anaesthetised adult rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stornetta et al., 2006</xref>) and they might correspond to the type 2 Phox2b+ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lazarenko et al., 2009</xref>). The comparative rarity of the E<sub>G</sub> neurons was not due to weak responses to hypercapnia which were very robust in the awake mice (note the raw whole body plethysmography [WBP] traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Nor was it due to a technical issue that prevented us from seeing neural activity, as (1) the lens placement was sufficient to image the most superficial aspect of the RTN where the Phox2b+ neurons lie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mulkey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stornetta et al., 2009</xref>), and (2) induction of a seizure in anesthetised mice gave clear Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in the RTN neurons when seizures occurred and altered respiratory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). The possibility that the serotype of the AAV (AAV-9) did not transduce the chemosensory neurons of the RTN seems remote, as others have demonstrated its efficacy for these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">HÃ©rent et al., 2021</xref>). Although we recorded from 98 RTN neurons in 9 mice, we cannot completely exclude that some unknown aspect of the recording set up may have prevented us from seeing all types of neurons and might have led to comparative under-representation of the E<sub>G</sub> subtype in our dataset.</p><p>The respiratory network, and with it the hypercapnic ventilatory response, changes with development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huckstepp and Dale, 2011b</xref>). Chemosensory responses become less dependent on Phox2B+ neurons of the RTN by 3 months of age when those neurons are genetically ablated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>). Acute chemical lesions of the RTN that remove almost all NMB+ neurons, greatly perturbed central chemosensory responses at adult stages, however this was not seen with smaller lesions that preserved a little under half of the NMB+ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Souza et al., 2018</xref>). A lesioning strategy, be it chemical or genetic, cannot discriminate between a direct chemosensory function and a relay function of this nucleus. The majority of evidence for the responses of RTN neurons, and in particular the Phox2B+ neurons, to hypercapnic stimuli comes from neonatal or young juvenile animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mulkey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>). Here we are investigating chemosensory mechanism in the adult after the system has fully matured. It is possible that the nature of the chemosensory responses change, and the E<sub>A</sub> neuronal phenotype emerges at adult stages. It is notable that even in the cells classified as E<sub>G</sub> there is a transient enhancement of activity immediately following the imposition of hypercapnia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>) suggesting that detection of change in PCO<sub>2</sub> is an important role for RTN neurons.</p><p>A second possibility is that much of prior evidence for RTN chemosensory responses depends heavily on recordings from anaesthetized animals and that anaesthesia alters the dynamics of neuronal responses to CO<sub>2</sub>. When we compared RTN responses in awake and anaesthetized animals we found that deep urethane anaesthesia dramatically changed neuronal firing patterns before and during hypercapnia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). While the choice of anaesthetic agent and depth of anaesthesia is likely to alter the degree to which RTN neurons retain their natural activity, our recordings suggest that studies of chemosensory responses in anaesthetised preparations should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>These possibilities are not mutually exclusive and it is likely that they may all contribute to the relatively low proportion of neurons of the E<sub>G</sub> subtype in our dataset. Unexpectedly, whilst we recorded from sniff activated neurons, we did not find any neurons with sigh related activity, which may be due to their sparsity in number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, more recordings may be necessary to uncover further functional subpopulations within the RTN region.</p><p>Several lines of evidence have suggested the importance of medullary Raphe serotonergic neurons in mediating respiratory chemosensitivity: the proximity of raphe neuron processes to blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bradley et al., 2002</xref>); the correspondence of the location of CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent ATP release at the medullary surface and the raphe neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bradley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gourine et al., 2005</xref>); suppression of the medullary raphe by isofluorane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johansen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ray et al., 2011</xref>) which matches the reduction in the overall hypercapnic ventilatory response; and most compellingly the observation that inhibition of their activity via inhibitory DREADD receptors removes ~40% of the total adaptive ventilatory response in awake mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ray et al., 2011</xref>). There were two classes of neuron excited by CO<sub>2</sub> and these marked the presence and magnitude of the hypercapnic stimulus (E<sub>G</sub>) and the start of the hypercapnic episode (E<sub>A</sub>), supports the hypothesis that the Raphe acts as a primary chemosensory nucleus.</p><p>Of the 2 known serotonergic subtypes in the Raphe, NK1R-negative serotonergic neurons project to areas responsible for CO<sub>2</sub> integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brust et al., 2014</xref>), whereas NK1R-positive serotonergic neurons project to motor nuclei responsible for airway patency and co-ordination, and diaphragmatic movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hennessy et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly both subtypes project to the preBÃ¶tC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brust et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hennessy et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, both serotonergic and GABAergic raphe neurons project to the pF<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Silva et al., 2020</xref>), with serotonergic neurons also innervating areas that influence expiration, namely the C1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malheiros-Lima et al., 2020</xref>), and NTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Silva et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, Raphe neurons are well placed to have far-reaching effects on breathing.</p><p>While both the RTN and Raphe have a high proportion of neurons that can be activated by CO<sub>2</sub>, there are interesting differences in the nature of the responses that we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The majority of RTN neurons that we observed were of the E<sub>A</sub> subtype, thus they will encode a change in inspired CO<sub>2</sub> rather than the presence of the entire stimulus. Even the E<sub>G</sub> neurons responded to a change in inspired CO<sub>2</sub> with a transient change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in addition to the graded response. By contrast the situations was reversed in the Raphe: we observed a greater number of Raphe neurons were of the E<sub>G</sub> subtype than the E<sub>A</sub> subtype. This may suggest a complementarity between the RTN and Raphe, such that the more superficially located RTN rapidly encodes changes in PCO<sub>2</sub>, with the deeper sitting Raphe providing a more sustained and graded response to encode the magnitude. It is noteworthy that plethysmographic changes in breathing are well-known to partially adapt to step changes in inspired CO<sub>2</sub> (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and J</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bravo et al., 2016</xref>) suggesting that the E<sub>A</sub> subtype is physiologically important. The rapid response to a sudden change in inspired CO<sub>2</sub> could plausibly be regarded as a trigger to quick behavioural adaptation that could remove the animal from the source of hypercapnia, or trigger a rapid adjustment in breathing that is sufficient to restore normocapnia.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary diagram of findings in the paper showing contribution of the RTN, Raphe and pF<sub>L</sub> neurons to respiratory chemosensitivity and active expiration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Block diagram showing the types of activity pattern observed in neurons of the RTN, pF<sub>L</sub> and Raphe. Proposed potential interconnections to the preBÃ¶tzinger and BÃ¶tzinger complexes are speculative and based on regional interactions reported in the literature. (<bold>B</bold>) Hypothesis for generating CO<sub>2</sub> dependent inhibition of serotonergic neurons. CO<sub>2</sub> is proposed to activate GABAergic neurons that inhibit tonically active serotonergic neurons which are not directly CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive. If these were to activate a separate population of non-CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive GABAergic neurons, these could normally silence the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive neurons until an episode of hypercapnia. This mechanism could explain an indirect inhibitory action of CO<sub>2</sub> on both serotonergic and GABAergic neurons. (<bold>C</bold>) Averages of the different types of neuronal activity seen in the RTN, Raphe and pF<sub>L</sub> during hypercapnia aligned to an average of the WBP trace.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-70671-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>CO<sub>2</sub>-inhibited neurons in the RTN and Raphe have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iceman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nattie et al., 1993</xref>). Our recordings give further evidence for these subtypes in both nuclei. In the Raphe, CO<sub>2</sub> inhibited neurons were thought to be exclusively GABAergic. Our finding that serotonergic Raphe neurons can be inhibited by CO<sub>2</sub> is unexpected. The mechanism of CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent inhibition is unclear. One possibility is that a CO<sub>2</sub> activated K<sup>+</sup> channel is present in these cells. An inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channel that is activated by CO<sub>2</sub> has been described in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huckstepp and Dale, 2011a</xref>), indicating that this mechanism of intrinsic sensitivity is possible. However, a likelier alternative hypothesis is that the inhibitory action of CO<sub>2</sub> on the serotonergic and GABAergic neurons is indirect and depends upon synaptic connectivity -for example via CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent activation of local GABAergic interneurons that are present in the medullary Raphe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p><p>While the emphasis of chemosensory mechanisms has been on the CO<sub>2</sub>/pH-dependent activation of excitatory neurons, CO<sub>2</sub>/pH-dependent inhibition of neurons could also be a powerful contributor to the hypercapnic ventilatory reflex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). While we have not demonstrated synaptic connections from any of the classes of neurons we describe, if CO<sub>2</sub>-inhibited neurons were to tonically excite neurons that normally inhibit the preBÃ¶tzinger complex, a process of disinhibition during hypercapnia could result in greater excitation of preBÃ¶tzinger complex neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). RTN and Raphe neurons are known to project to the BÃ¶tzinger complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morinaga et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosin et al., 2006</xref>), which contains inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ezure and Manabe, 1988</xref>), whilst RTN neurons are also known to project to inhibitory cells of the preBÃ¶tC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), which regulate the synchronisation of excitatory bursting and the emergence of the inspiratory rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashhad and Feldman, 2020</xref>). The CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent disinhibition of the inhibitory interneurons in the preBÃ¶tC could contribute to the emergence of more powerful inspiratory bursts and hence an increase in tidal volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Non-chemosensory mechanisms in the RTN</title><p>The RTN showed several forms of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity that did not respond to hypercapnia. In support of previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nattie et al., 1993</xref>), we saw a small population of tonically firing neurons that were unaffected by elevating inspired CO<sub>2</sub>. These neurons might provide tonic drive to the respiratory network that drives tidal volume, which is known to originate at least in part from the RTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>). However, in 67/98 of the RTN neurons, we observed some tonic activity during room air breathing. Therefore, about 2/3 of the RTN neurons we imaged could plausibly contribute to tonic drive at rest. In addition to providing drive to basal breathing, tonic activity in neurons may also provide a level of baseline excitation that permits for the system to be more easily manipulated, allowing other respiratory features to be expressed. For example there is an absolute requirement for network wide activity to enable expiratory motor output to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huckstepp et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, it is well documented that as respiratory network excitation decreases during sleep, sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> diminishes leading to lower minute ventilation, a higher resting PaCO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Douglas et al., 1982a</xref>), and reduced hypercapnic ventilatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Douglas et al., 1982b</xref>). Thus, tonic activity in the RTN may be vital to allow a greater sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> during wakefullness.</p><p>We also found non-coding neurons in the RTN. These neurons could be subdivided into those that displayed Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity not related to the level of CO<sub>2</sub>, nor any abstractable feature on the respiratory recording (NC), and those that had Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity that matched variations in respiratory output (NC-RR). This latter population were largely silent when V<sub>T</sub> was at its greatest but displayed activity when the respiratory frequency was high and the faster ventilatory cycle meant that V<sub>T</sub> was smaller. The NC-RR neurons might therefore provide excitation to increase respiratory frequency. The NC sub-population could represent a novel neuronal type in the RTN, or could be a known non-CO<sub>2</sub> coding subpopulation that are likely to have other functions such as those that express high levels neuromedin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Sniffing is a mechanism that allows for olfactory sampling of the air to discern location of smell and to test for irritants before air is taken into the lung. Sniffing is obligatory for odour perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mainland and Sobel, 2005</xref>), and thus activates the piriform cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sobel et al., 1998a</xref>). However, sniffing also causes neuronal activity in the absence of odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sobel et al., 1998a</xref>). It activates the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vanderwolf, 2001</xref>), and the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sobel et al., 1998b</xref>), respectively, likely to prime odour-related memory recall, and co-ordination of movement toward or away from specific odours. Whilst the activation of these brain regions during sniffing has been well documented, the pattern generating microcircuit for sniffing has only recently been identified. Sniffing requires the activation of two sets of muscles (i) the nasal muscles to open the airway and decrease resistance, allowing more rapid movement of air through the nose, and (ii) the respiratory (inspiratory and expiratory) muscles, to draw air in and out of the nasal cavity. The RTN is located adjacent to, and innervates, the facial motor nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeschÃªnes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurnikova et al., 2018</xref>). These RTN projections to the facial are directly involved in sniffing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeschÃªnes et al., 2016</xref>) and control of nasal direction during the odour response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurnikova et al., 2018</xref>). In conjunction the RTN provides significant drive to the preBÃ¶tC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosin et al., 2006</xref>), and the pF<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zoccal et al., 2018</xref>), both of which are integral parts of the sniffing microcircuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeschÃªnes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moore et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, it is not surprising that the sniff pathway originates in, or passes through, the RTN.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Active expiration</title><p>The pF<sub>L</sub> is thought to be a subsidiary conditional oscillator for expiration that is normally suppressed at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huckstepp et al., 2016</xref>). That all pF<sub>L</sub> neurons showed the same discharge pattern, supports the hypothesis that the pF<sub>L</sub> is comprised of a single homogenous group of neurons acting with a single purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huckstepp et al., 2018</xref>). Even though the nucleus appears to integrate information from many nuclei -RTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zoccal et al., 2018</xref>), C1, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malheiros-Lima et al., 2020</xref>), NTS, rostral pedunculopontine tegmental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Silva et al., 2019</xref>) and the preBÃ¶tC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huckstepp et al., 2016</xref>) -the pF<sub>L</sub> appears to be a simple on-off switch, rather than forming complex outputs as we describe in the RTN.</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that pF<sub>L</sub> neurons were only transiently active during large expiratory efforts, (such as sniffing, sighing, or other forms of brief deep breathing), in contrast to the sustained active expiration previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">LeirÃ£o et al., 2018</xref>). This may be due to our use of brief periods of graded CO<sub>2</sub> in conscious animals, rather than sustained CO<sub>2</sub> (~1 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">LeirÃ£o et al., 2018</xref>) or use of the vagotomised anaesthetised preparation in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, in the un-anaesthetised, vagi intact, in situ preparation of young adult rats, pF<sub>L</sub> neurons only displayed a small number of action potentials (~10) during the latter portion of expiratory phase 2 (approximately the final 20% of the expiratory period) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MagalhÃ£es et al., 2021</xref>). In our recordings the expiratory period was ~100ms at the highest level of CO<sub>2</sub>, allowing for 20ms of pF<sub>L</sub> neuronal discharge during times of active expiration. Thus Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in pF<sub>L</sub> neurons were likely too small to elicit a recordable change in GCaMP fluorescence, except when expiratory efforts were notably large in terms of both duration and amplitude. Furthermore, in contrast to our expectation that pF<sub>L</sub> neurons would be phasically active between inspiratory bursts, pF<sub>L</sub> neurons exhibited elevated intracellular calcium beginning before, and spanning, the expiratory period.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Endoscopic imaging of the activity of the brainstem neurons involved in the control of breathing provides a new way to investigate the neural circuitry for the chemosensory control of breathing in awake adult mice, and to understand how breathing is coordinated with complex non-ventilatory behaviours. Some components, such as expiratory activity of the pF<sub>L</sub> or sniff activity in the RTN, are easy to interpret, whilst others are more complicated. The responses to CO<sub>2</sub> were more heterogeneous in both hSyn+ RTN and hSyn+ and serotonergic Raphe neurons than would be expected from the prior literature. Notably, our dataset of RTN chemosensitive neurons contained a preponderance of the E<sub>A</sub> subtype. The E<sub>A</sub> neuronal responses are potentially well suited to detect small increases of inspired CO<sub>2</sub> outside the normal range that can occur during normal behavioural conditions. In contrast, the Raphe neurons tended to be active during the entire CO<sub>2</sub> stimulus and conceivably these neurons could take over from RTN neurons during more sustained episodes of hypercapnia. These data provide an intriguing possibility that the chemosensory network is arranged in a hierarchy with each layer conveying a unique range of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

The cycling conditions were as follows: 50 Â°C for 2 min, 95 Â°C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 Â°C for 15 s and 60 Â°C for 60 s. Calculations were done using the SDS 2.4 software (Applied Biosystems).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Virus handling</title><p>Raphe and RTN neurons - AAV-9: pGP-AAV-syn-GCaMP6s-WPRE.4.641 at a titre of 1x10<sup>13</sup> GCÂ·ml<sup>â1</sup> (Addgene, Watertown, MA, USA); Raphe: AAV-DJ: pAAV-SERT-GCaMP6s at a titre of 1.8x10<sup>13</sup>GCÂ·ml<sup>â1</sup> (University hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). pF<sub>L</sub> - AAV-9: pGP-AAV-syn-GCaMP6f-WPRE.24.693 at a titre of 1x10<sup>13</sup> GCÂ·ml<sup>â1</sup> (Addgene, Watertown, MA, USA).</p><p>Viruses were aliquoted and stored at â80 Â°C. On the day of injection, viruses were removed and held at 4 Â°C, loaded into graduated glass pipettes (Drummond Scientific Company, Broomall, PA, USA), and placed into an electrode holder for pressure injection. The AAV-syn-GCaMP6s and AAV-syn-GCaMP6f vectors use the synapsin promoter, and therefore transduced neurons showing higher tropism for the AAV 2/9 subtype, and to a much lesser extent neurons that show low tropism for AAV 2/9 within the injection site, e.g. facial motoneurons, they do not transduce non-neuronal cells.

Adequate anaesthesia was maintained with 0.5â2% Isofluorane in pure oxygen (1 LÂ·min<sup>â1</sup>) throughout the surgery. Mice received a presurgical subcutaneous injection of atropine (120 ÂµgÂ·kg<sup>â1</sup>; Westward Pharmaceutical Co., Eatontown, NJ, USA) and meloxicam (2 mgÂ·kg<sup>â1</sup>; Norbrook Inc, Lenexa, KS, USA). Mice were placed in a prone position into a digital stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA) on a heating pad (TCAT 2-LV: Physitemp, Clifton, NJ, USA) and body temperature was maintained at a minimum of 33Â°C via a thermocouple. The head was levelled at bregma, and 2 mm caudal to bregma, and graduated glass pipettes containing the virus were placed stereotaxically into either the RTN, rostral medullary raphe or pF<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). The RTN was defined as the area ventral to the caudal half of the facial nucleus, bound medially and laterally by the edges of the facial nucleus (coordinates with a 9â° injection arm angle: â1.0 mm lateral and â5.6 mm caudal from Bregma, and â5.5 mm ventral from the surface of the cerebellum; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The Raphe was defined as the medial, TPH containing regions level with the caudal face of the facial nucleus: the Raphe Magnus (RMg) was directly above the pyramidal tracts (Py), and the Raphe Pallidus (RPa) was bound laterally by the Py (coordinates with a 9â° injection arm angle: 0 mm lateral and â5.8 mm caudal from Bregma, and â5.2 mm ventral from the surface of the cerebellum; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The pF<sub>L</sub> was defined as the neurons bound laterally by the spinothalmic tract and medially by the lateral edge of the facial motor nucleus (coordinates with a 9â° injection arm angle: â1.8 mm lateral and â5.55 mm caudal from Bregma, and â4.7 mm ventral from the surface of the cerebellum; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The virus solution was pressure injected (&lt;300 nL) unilaterally. Pipettes were left in place for 3â5 min to prevent back flow of the virus solution up the pipette track. Postoperatively, mice received intraperitoneal (IP) injections of buprenorphine (100 ÂµgÂ·kg<sup>â1</sup>; Reckitt Benckiser, Slough, UK). Mice were allowed 2 weeks for recovery and viral expression, with food and water ad libitum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>GRIN lens implantation</title><p>Mice expressing GCaMP6 were anesthetized with isofluorane, given pre-surgical drugs, placed into a stereotax, and the head was levelled as described above. To widen the lens path whilst producing the least amount of deformation of tissue, a graduated approach was taken; firstly a glass pipette was inserted down the GRIN lens path to a depth 200 Âµm above where the lens would terminated and left in place for 3 min; this procedure was then repeated with a blunted hypodermic needle. The GRIN lens (600 Âµm diameter, 7.3 mm length; Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was then slowly inserted at a rate of 100 ÂµmÂ·min<sup>â1</sup> to a depth ~1300 Âµm above the target site, then lowered at a rate of 50 ÂµmÂ·min<sup>â1</sup> to a depth ~300 Âµm above the RTN, Raphe or pF<sub>L</sub> (coordinates with a 9â° injection arm angle: RTN â 1.1 mm lateral and â5.75 mm caudal from Bregma, and â5.3 mm ventral from the surface of the cerebellum; Raphe â 0 mm lateral and â5.95 mm caudal from Bregma, and â5.1 mm ventral from the surface of the cerebellum; pF<sub>L</sub> â 1.7 mm lateral and â5.7 mm caudal from Bregma, and â4.6 mm ventral from the surface of the cerebellum). The lens was then secured in place with SuperBond (Prestige Dental, Bradford, UK). Postoperatively, mice received buprenorphine, and were allowed 2 weeks for recovery, with food and water ad libitum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Baseplate installation</title><p>Mice expressing GCaMP6 and implanted with GRIN lens were anesthetized with isofluorane, given pre-surgical drugs, and placed into a stereotax as described above. To hold the miniaturized microscope during recordings, a baseplate was positioned over the lens and adjusted until the cells under the GRIN lens were in focus. The baseplate was then secured with superbond, and coated in black dental cement (Vertex Dental, Soesterberg, the Netherlands) to stop interference of the recording from ambient light. Mice were allowed 1 week for recovery, with food and water ad libitum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in freely moving mice</title><p>All mice were trained with dummy camera and habituated to plethysmography chamber at least twice before imaging. The miniature microscope with integrated 475 nm LED (Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was secured to the baseplate. GCaMP6 fluorescence was visualised through the GRIN lens, using nVista 2 HD acquisition software (Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Calcium fluorescence was optimised for each experiment so that the histogram range was ~150â600, with average recording parameters set at 10â20 frames/sec with the LED power set to 10â20 mW of light and a digital gain of 1.0â4.0. A TTL pulse was used to synchronize the calcium signalling to the plethysmography trace. All images were processed using Inscopix data processing software (Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA, USA). GCaMP6 movies were ran through: preprocessing algorithm (with temporal downsampling), crop, spatial filter algorithm (0.005â0.5 Hz), motion correction and cell identification through manual regions of interest (ROIs) operation to generate the identified cell sets. Cell sets were imported into <italic>Spike2</italic> software for processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Plethysmography</title><p>Mice were placed into a custom-made 0.5 L plethysmography chamber, with an airflow rate of 1 lÂ·min<sup>â1</sup>. The plethysmography chamber was heated to 31 Â°C (thermoneutral for C57/BL6 mice). CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were sampled via a Hitech Intruments (Luton, UK) GIR250 Dual Sensor Gas analyzer or ML206 gas analyzer (ADinstruments, Sydney, Australia) connected to the inflow immediately before entering the chamber. The analyser had a delay of ~15â20 sec to read-out the digital output of gas mixture. Pressure transducer signals and CO<sub>2</sub> measurements were amplified and filtered using the NeuroLog system (Digitimer, Welwyn Garden City, UK) connected to a 1401 interface and acquired on a computer using <italic>Spike2</italic> software (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). Video data was recorded with <italic>Spike2</italic> software and was synchronised with the breathing trace. Airflow measurements were used to calculate: tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>: signal trough at the end of expiration subtracted from the peak signal during inspiration, converted to mL following calibration and normalized to body weight), and respiratory frequency (<italic>f</italic>R: breaths per minute). Minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>) was calculated as V<sub>T</sub> x <italic>f</italic>R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Hypercapnia in freely behaving mice</title><p>Instrumented mice were allowed ~30 mins to acclimate to the plethysmograph. The LED was activated through a TTL pulse synchronised with the <italic>Spike2</italic> recording and 1 or 3 min of baseline recordings were taken (gas mixture: 0% CO<sub>2</sub>Â 21% O<sub>2</sub>Â 79%Â N<sub>2</sub>). The mice were then exposed to 3 min epochs of hypercapnic gas mixture at different concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>: RTN and Raphe transduced mice were exposed to 3% followed by 6% CO<sub>2</sub>, and pF<sub>L</sub> transduced mice were exposed to 6% followed by 9% CO<sub>2</sub>. All gas mixtures contained 21% O<sub>2</sub> balanced N<sub>2</sub>. Following exposure to the hypercapnic gas mixtures, CO<sub>2</sub> levels were reduced back to 0% and calcium signals were recorded for a further 3â4 minutes recovery period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Hypercapnia and seizure induction in urethane anaesthetised mice</title><p>Instrumented mice were anaesthetised with an IP injection of 1.2â1.5 gÂ·kg<sup>-</sup>1 urethane (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and placed into the plethysmograph. For recording responses of RTN neurons to hypercapnia, the LED was activated and 1 or 3 minute of baseline recording was taken. The mice were then exposed to 2 or 3 minute epochs of hypercapnic gas mixture 3%, 6% and 9% CO<sub>2</sub> (in 21% O<sub>2</sub> balanced N<sub>2</sub>) sequentially, as experiments into the chemosensitivity of RTN neurons in mice often use 6% CO<sub>2</sub> in freely behaving experiments but 9% CO<sub>2</sub> in anaesthetised animals. Following exposure to the hypercapnic gas mixtures, CO<sub>2</sub> levels were reduced back to 0% and calcium signals were recorded for a further 3 minute recovery period.</p><p>For neurons recorded in the RTN, after completion of hypercapnic responses and a period of rest, baseline Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity was recorded for 5 min. The mice were then injected with a dose of kainic acid (8 mgÂ·kg<sup>â1</sup> IP) sufficient to induce an electrographic seizures in the absence of any movement from behavioural seizures. Following injection of kainic acid, calcium activity was recorded every alternate 5 min to avoid the fluorophore bleaching and concurrently record the calcium activity for a long enough to evidence the effect of induction of seizure on the activity of RTN neurons (at least for 90 min post kainic acid injection).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Preparation of fixed brain slices</title><p>Mice were humanely killed by pentobarbital overdose (&gt;100 mgÂ·kg<sup>â1</sup>) and transcardially perfused with paraformaldehyde solution (4% PFA; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA).

The authors importantly demonstrate chemosensory responses of neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus-RTN, Raphe magnus and pallidus nuclei, and lateral parafacial region- pFL, and they describe regional heterogeneity of cellular responses to hypercapnia in these regions with important functional implications. Analyzing chemosensory properties of these medullary regions has been the focus of numerous studies, but the problem of analyzing regional multicellular chemosensory responses in the awake freely behaving rodent has not been previously addressed, so this paper represents an advance for the field. The authors present a novel catalog of neuronal responses, and they illustrate the feasibility of this imaging approach, paving the way for further development/application of this approach, while indicating its limitations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70671.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Jeffrey C</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01s5ya894</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Jeffrey C</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01s5ya894</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/492041">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/492041v3">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jeffrey C Smith as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should discuss more the technical limitations of their imaging approach. A major concern is whether the targeted regional neuronal and glial populations have been adequately sampled to reasonably understand the spatial and functional heterogeneity of the hypercapnic responses. There are important optical limitations as well as potential limitations associated with efficacy of cellular labeling with the vector constructs used. These are major caveats that need to be more thoroughly discussed in the context of technical limitations. The authors state for example that the GRIN lens placement was within the RTN (Discussion p. 10, para. 2) or terminated under the caudal pole of the facial nucleus (p. 6, para. 1) but the anatomical reconstructions consistently show the end of the lens in facial motor nucleus and in Methods (p. 17, para. 1), so as the authors discuss the coverage of the RTN populations may not be sufficient. The authors state that generally the lens was positioned ~300 Âµm above the regions to be imaged. Please provide information on the depth of field of the GRIN lens used and the typical field of view (including providing length scale bars on the cellular fluorescence images presented in the main text). Additional information on the viral transduction efficacy with the GCaMP constructs used is also essential.</p><p>2) Cell identification is another technical issue that needs to be addressed. It is critically important that the authors provide more convincing additional experimental data on the molecular identity of RTN neurons imaged to help with the interpretation of the results on this component. This should be done by employing an experimental strategy that allows for cell-type specific expression of GCaMP in RTN neurons (e.g., by using a Phox2b promoter), and/or by providing convincing additional quantification verifying that a high percentage of the GCaMP-expressing neurons imaged in the RTN region also express NMB and VGLUT2. For astrocytes and serotonin neurons, an attempt was made to restrict GCaMP expression to the targeted cell groups by using viruses including GFAP (gfaABC1D) or SERT promoters, but a non-specific neuronal promoter (synapsin) was used to drive GCaMP expression in RTN neurons or the pFL, with the obvious problem that the recordings were made from unidentified cells. Granted there is no specific marker for the pFL, but this approach is not justified for the RTN neurons. The molecular phenotype of CO2-sensitive RTN neurons has been well-established, and viral vectors using a Phox2b promoter have been employed for many years to preferentially target those RTN neurons. There are not a lot of RTN neurons (maybe 700-800 in mice) and there are many other neurons in the same region that likely were transduced with GCaMP and may account for the measured responses to CO2.</p><p>3) Information about specificity of the antibodies used should be provided, which is particularly important for the immunostaining for NMB and VGLUT2 used to suggest that some of the GCaMP-expressing parafacial cells were bona fide RTN neurons. There are no controls provided for the specificity of the antibody staining, and no references attesting to the quality of the antibodies, which should be standard practice (see Rhodes and Trimmer, J Neuroscience 2006; Saper, JCN, 2005; Saper and Sawchenko, ibid, 2003). Even if the staining were validated as specific for the relevant antigens, demonstrating that some of the GCaMP-expressing neurons were VGLUT2- and NMB-positive RTN neurons does not guarantee that the recorded cells were also RTN chemosensory neurons. This important caveat needs to be amplified in the text with appropriate disclaimers.</p><p>4) The authors need to explain more their interpretations of the measured GCaMP signals. For various neurons there may be a nonlinear relationship between theses signals and neuronal firing. For glia it is not clear that &quot;activation&quot; by hypercapnia would always cause a change in intracellular calcium, and yet signaling pathways could still be engaged that influence neighboring neurons. In addition, the authors need to explain why GCaMP6s was used for calcium activity imaging of RTN and Raphe neurons, whereas GCaMP6f was used for imaging astrocytes and pFL neurons. For comparisons of calcium dynamics between regions it is important that the same sensor is utilized which was done for the RTN region and Raphe neurons, but interpretation of what is being encoded by a particular sensor needs to take into account the sensor signaling kinetics. GCaMP6s kinetics produce long (many seconds) calcium signal decays after signal onset, which can for example contribute to features such as adaptation of the calcium dynamics imaged and would not accurately reflect neuronal activity profiles per se.</p><p>5) The authors should discuss more how they adequately ruled out movement artifacts affecting the calcium signals. The authors provide some evidence that the measured Ca transients are independent of movement, but the GFP signal measured in different mice is not the best and adequate control for movement artifacts in other GCaMP-expressing mice. Inscopix miniscopes are capable of dual color imaging to detect a co-expressed fluorescent marker in the same cell, which would be a better control.</p><p>6) The calcium signals are interpreted by the authors to reflect a variety of cellular response patterns, but there is no indication of how the authors verified consistency of these patterns, and this important issue needs to be addressed. Did the authors apply the CO2 challenges in repeated or alternately ordered fashion (0-3-6, 0-6-3) to more convincingly verify a consistent response in each individual cell? This is important information to include. This approach would also aid in dissociating common CO2-associated response patterns from any more randomly associated movement artifacts, for example by the use of peristimulus averaging to tease out signal from noise.</p><p>7) The authors suggest that tonic RTN neurons &quot;provide tonic drive to the respiratory network.&quot; However, it is possible that these neurons are not respiratory. Just because they are in/near the RTN does not mean they are chemoreceptors. Please discuss more carefully.</p><p>8) There was little effect of CO2 on calcium signals in RTN astrocytes. The authors need to discuss if they imaged the astrocytes near the ventral medullary surface that have been most associated with CO2 activation and control of breathing. The authors also should indicate if they have independent histochemical evidence that the gfaABC1D promoter indeed restricted GCaMP expression to glial cells. Also, it is important to explain how they can conclude, based on the strength of the calcium signal, whether or not the astrocytes could play a functional role â at what threshold would they decide the signal is big enough, and on what would they base that decision. Is there any evidence that glial calcium levels need to rise in order for glia to influence neighboring neurons? Please discuss these issues.</p><p>9) The authors argue (page 6, 2nd paragraph) that the adapting responses of RTN neurons to hypercapnia match adaptation of VE in the WBP trace. This issue should be addressed in more detail. The data for this are very unconvincing. Instead there is a gradually increasing level of respiratory activity after switching to 3% and 6% CO2. In Figure 2H the WBP Av ReSm shows a similar result, with gradually increasing amplitude as CO2 level increases. The authors should expand the &quot;WBP Av ReSm&quot; trace in the vertical direction to more clearly show the increase in amplitude with time, and a horizontal line should be drawn at the baseline level to allow the reader to visualize the change in amplitude more clearly. When this is done, there is a clear ramp up of VE after changing to 3% CO2, and an even steeper increase with 6% CO2. This is opposite of the clear adaptation of calcium level in the &quot;Average Waveform&quot; trace in Figure 2H.</p><p>10) The imaging results for pFL neurons suggest that these cells did not exhibit sustained expiratory-related oscillatory activity in response to hypercapnia that would be predicted based on the concept of a conditional expiratory oscillator in the pFL. The nature of the transient expiratory events described and whether they are in anyway related to the hypercapnic challenge in unclear from the results presented in Figure 8. This issue should be addressed more thoroughly in the manuscript.</p><p>11) The authors conclude (page 15) that: &quot;Raphe neurons tended to be active during the entire CO2 stimulus and conceivably these neurons are likely to take over from RTN neurons under pathophysiological levels of CO2.&quot; The logic of how the authors come to this conclusion should be explained. The data are more supportive of the opposite conclusion. 42% of raphe neurons respond with a graded or sustained increase in firing in response to a rise in CO2 of as little as 3%, whereas most RTN neurons rapidly adapt (in only 1-2 minutes) to 3% CO2 and don't increase to 6% CO2 (a level that strongly stimulates breathing). The data are more consistent with the conclusion that at low levels of CO2, RTN neurons would have little or no effect, while raphe neurons would be expected to provide continuous activation of the respiratory network across the whole CO2 range studied. But there are potentially major problems with identifying the relevant RTN chemosensory neurons as indicated above that are thought to generate graded and sustained responses to CO2. This issue should be discussed more thoughtfully, particularly in the context of new experimental data that may be obtained regarding the molecular phenotypic identity of the RTN neurons analyzed.</p><p>12) There should be an explicit discussion of the role of synaptic connectivity, and the authors should discuss the relationship of their results with data from more reduced preparations (about which there is little discussion). Synaptic inputs were intact and all responses that were measured were due to a combination of intrinsic responses, synaptic input and glial modulation. Some of the text seems to imply that the responses are all intrinsic, but this issue should be clarified.</p><p>13) There are numerous reporting details that should be included. How many mice were used for cell counts and from how many sections? Did cells with particular response patterns (or sniffs) come from different mice or the same mouse? How were they distributed among the mice used? Which results were from synapsin and SERT mice?</p><p>14) In the text (p. 4) description of Figure 1, please correct the references to panels D-F. The actual figure panels do not correspond to the text descriptions. Similarly, in the figure legend, correctly match the references to panels D-G. Please also check the y-axis labeling in panel D.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors have worked out the essential technical approaches required for deep brain fluorescence imaging of targeted regions in the medulla of freely behaving mice. The authors are attempting to draw functional conclusions with this imaging approach about chemosensory responses of neurons and glia in multiple important medullary regions that have been the focus of numerous studies. Understanding the details of how these types of cells respond in any of these regions in vivo, particularly in awake behaving animals, requires extensive work with this imaging approach for any region studied, beyond what the authors have presented. The observations presented here are nonetheless important for the field and provocative, but the major concern with this approach is whether the targeted regional neuronal and glial populations have been adequately sampled to reasonably understand the spatial and functional heterogeneity of the hypercapnic responses. There are important optical limitations as well as potential limitations associated with efficacy of cellular labeling with the vector constructs used. These are major caveats that need to be more thoroughly discussed in the context of technical limitations.

The authors need to explain why GCaMP6s was used for calcium activity imaging of RTN and Raphe neurons, whereas GCaMP6f was used for imaging astrocytes and pFL neurons. For comparisons of calcium dynamics between regions it is important that the same sensor is utilized which was done so this is not an issue, but interpretation of what is being encoded by a particular sensor needs to take into account the sensor signaling kinetics.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Catherine Dulac (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>Your revisions have improved the manuscript, but some remaining critical issues need to be rigorously addressed in a more thoroughly revised manuscript, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential Revisions.</p><p>(1) The critical issue of identifying the recorded neurons as RTN neurons according to the current definition of these neurons based on their established molecular properties (particularly see Reviewer #3) remains a major problem. As indicated in the reviews, there are other approaches to address this issue. Despite the new neuromedin B immunostaining results, the authors have not implemented a strategy to establish that any particular GCaMP-imaged cell was an actual RTN neuron. Accordingly, the authors cannot directly relate the measured responses of individual neurons to any specific type of neuron in the region studied. The authors should employ an approach that defines the molecular identity of the neurons imaged. Without additional convincing neuronal labeling/identification information that RTN neurons (as currently defined in the literature) were imaged, the authors need to use different terminology for what they are calling &quot;RTN neurons&quot; (e.g., ventral/ventromedial parafacial neurons) to avoid confusion and misinterpretation by readers. This issue also needs to be thoroughly discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>(2) The authors should include a more thorough discussion of the problem of precisely interpreting what the measured calcium signals are encoding due to uncertain, possibly nonlinear, relationships between the signals recorded from various neurons and their neuronal firing patterns. This discussion should include the rationale for their selection of the GCaMP sensors used. The authors need to have a section at the beginning of the Discussion dealing with these technical aspects/limitations that may affect interpretations of their observations, including further addressing any potentially confounding effects of insufficient correction of signals for movement artifacts- an issue raised again in this review.</p><p>(3) The issue of the consistency of calcium dynamic response patterns for a given neuron with repeated measurements to establish whether a given neuron truly belongs to any particular group as classified. How the authors establish consistency by applying some specific metrics should be more thoroughly addressed. A more rigorous assessment of the response consistency in individual neurons would go a long way to address technical and interpretive problems (including those associated with movement artifacts).</p><p>(4) The authors need to rectify inconsistencies in the data presented and address questions about how they interpret some of their observations, as noted in the reviews.</p><p>(5) The authors should thoroughly address all other issues raised by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This revised paper provides supporting evidence demonstrating the technical application of deep endoscopic fluorescence imaging with head-mounted miniscopes and genetically encoded calcium sensors in awake behaving mice for multicellular calcium activity imaging from key medullary structures involved in respiratory control in freely behaving mice, which is novel and important for the respiratory neurobiology field. The authors address some of the major problems and concerns about characterizing multi-neuronal activity by dynamic calcium imaging within medullary regions (RTN, raphe magnus and pallidus nuclei, pFL) proposed to have important chemosensory functions for the regulation of respiratory responses and homeostatic control of breathing with hypercapnia.</p><p>They have revised the paper in a number of important aspects in response to the original reviews: (1) they have removed the data on astroglial calcium dynamics and now just focus on the neuronal datasets obtained from these regions; (2) they have addressed the technical issues related to the depth of field with the GRIN lens and miniscope system used, which is critical for understanding the adequacy of sampling calcium dynamics in the targeted neuronal populations; (3) they have provided additional information on the neuromedin B identity of the possibly imaged neurons, although there are still concerns about the specificity of the antibody labeling and how the molecular identity has been established for the imaged neurons; and (4) they have discussed more directly how their regional calcium imaging data may be reconciled with available information on electrophysiological behavior and its variability in different experimental approaches, including comparisons with measurements in their awake freely behaving mice vs measurements in anesthetized and in vitro cellular measurements.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This revised manuscript reports the results of GCaMP imaging of neurons from the RTN and raphe of unanesthetized mice using a mini-microscope to determine how hypercapnia affects neuronal calcium levels. The authors have made a number of major changes, including removing the data on glia.</p><p>There is a lot of potential in this approach to determine how neurons in these two regions respond to hypercapnia in vivo. However, as currently presented some errors have been introduced, there are some inconsistencies in the data, and there are new concerns about some artifacts contaminating some of the results. The authors also make some conclusions that are not supported by their data.</p><p>It is important for the authors to specifically state that for the two specific types of neurons of most interest here the authors cannot convert the size of the calcium signals measured to firing rate. The relationship between calcium levels and firing rate is unlikely to be linear and is likely to be different for the two neuron types. One or both neuron types may not increase calcium levels very much in response to an increase in firing rate. The relationship could only be determined by simultaneous imaging and extracellular recordings of spikes. The authors should discuss this issue.</p><p>Movement artifacts influencing the interpretation of results</p><p>There is serious concern that movement has confounded some of the data. The authors provide arguments against the role of movement in altering the results, but many neurons had to be excluded due to movement artifacts (Figure 1A), indicating it is sometimes a problem.</p><p>Line 155 â &quot;[under anesthesia]â¦movement artifacts cannot be a potential confounding factor.&quot;</p><p>This statement is not true. Convulsive seizures involve a large amount of movement. This experiment was done without a paralytic agent, so it does not rule out movement as a cause of the calcium signal recorded in the neurons during seizures.</p><p>Figure 1 Figure Supplement 2 and 3</p><p>For several groups of neurons recorded from the same mice, the pattern of calcium transients is so nearly identical that it does not seem biologically plausible. For example, that is true for neurons from mouse 7 for the RTN EA group. It is also true for the top two traces for Figure 2H (both extracted from mouse 5 in Suppl figure2), and for mouse 6 for the Raphe I group. How can the authors verify that the calcium activity is due to an increase in firing rate in these examples, and not movement or other artifact shared across neurons recorded at the same time? It would be possible for neurons to have similar patterns of activity, but not to be essentially identical.</p><p>There are a number of inconsistencies in the data</p><p>Figure 1 Figure Supplement 2</p><p>The trace labeled &quot;Average EA&quot; (7th trace down from the top in 1st column) does not correspond with the individual traces shown, where there should be a transient increase in calcium upon exposure to CO2 instead of occurring midway through the 3% CO2 exposure.</p><p>Figure 2H â Why does the Average Waveform EA look different than the Average EA in Figure 1 Figure Supplement 2? Shouldn't they be the same?</p><p>There are several observations that are not consistent with the literature.</p><p>In Figure 2H, the VE trace shows adaptation in 3% CO2, but not in 6% CO2. In Figures 2H and 9C of the previous version of this paper, there was no adaptation at either CO2 level. The authors state on line 452 that adaptation to step changes in inspired CO2 is well known to occur in the literature, but they do not give a reference. I don't think that is true, with the existing literature instead showing a sustained increase in CO2 with continuous exposure to hypercapnia. The authors should cite literature if it exists.</p><p>Line 257 â &quot;Only a minority of neurons, 13% (5/38), encoded the magnitude of hypercapnia.&quot;</p><p>The sizes of the responses were much less than expected based on previous literature. This should be mentioned.</p><p>Line 367 &quot;â¦type 1 neurons â¦ display an adapting response to acidification.&quot;</p><p>The data in Lazarenko et al., 2009 is very unconvincing for an adapting response, and therefore the analogy with the EA neurons is as well. Coupled with the fact that ventilation does not adapt in most literature in response to sustained hypercapnia, and other chemoreceptors do not adapt to CO2, I am not convinced that the EA neurons are important for chemoreception. There is also no clear mechanism for why neurons should adapt to 3% CO2 but not 6%.</p><p>Line 569 â &quot;[raphe neurons] are likely to take over from RTN neurons under pathophysiological levels of CO2.&quot;</p><p>That conclusion is not consistent with the observation that nearly half of raphe neurons have a graded or sustained response to CO2 of only 3%. That is not a pathophysiological stimulus.</p><p>It should be pointed out that sampling of both groups of neurons was limited and the authors may have not recorded from all subtypes of neuron.</p><p>The authors left labels off of the axes of a number of figures, e.g. 3B, 4C (fR), 7G.</p><p>Figure 1 Figure Suppl 3 â The EA trace does not look convincingly adapting.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have attempted to address the concerns from the previous reviews.</p><p>1. In dealing with the major issue of identifying the recorded neurons as RTN cells, the authors argue that the use of a PRSX8 promoter-driven viral approach was ineffective. But, this is not the only solution. An alternative is using a Phox2b-Cre mouse and a DIO virus for GCaMP delivery. These reagents are readily available and should be attempted if they want to say anything about RTN neurons.</p><p>2. The authors need to use different terminology for what they are calling RTN. The initial description of RTN neurons in cats was based on their projections to VRG (and a lesser extent, DRG; see Smith et al., 1989). Since then, the RTN cell group has been defined functionally and neurochemically with increasingly greater precision (e.g., Guyenet et al., 2019). In the current study, these authors have not convincingly demonstrated that the actual recorded cells meet any of the established criteria for being called RTN neurons. Therefore, they should follow the more general &quot;parafacial&quot; terminology to describe this region, and refer to these as &quot;unidentified neurons located in the parafacial region.&quot;</p><p>3. There are issues remaining with respect to Nmb antibody validation and immunostaining. It is still the case that no experimental controls for the Nmb immunohistochemistry are provided in this paper.</p><p>Instead, two references are cited. In Yamagata et al. (<italic>eLife</italic> 2021), however, it appears that a different antibody was used (monoclonal antibody from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) â rendering this an irrelevant citation. The Li et al. (Nature, 2014) citation indeed reports on the same polyclonal antibody used here, but they used it to detect Nmb-IR terminals in the preBÃ¶tC (see Ext. Data Figure 2 in Li et al.) and not cell somata in the RTN. The problems of detecting neuropeptides in neuronal cell bodies by antibody staining are well recognized and the images provided are unconvincing. For example, there appears to be staining where one would expect to find few, if any, Nmb-expressing neurons â e.g., see upper right in current Figure 2D, just below the lens lesion. This is not to say that this Ab staining approach is impossible, but at least some validation is required. For example, the authors might combine IHC with FISH to demonstrate that the Nmb antibody specifically recognizes neurons that also express Nmb transcripts and, more importantly, that it does not non-specifically stain cells that do not express Nmb.</p><p>(It should be noted that, even with more appropriate validation, this strategy of post hoc identification will not be able to ensure that any particular GCaMP-imaged cell was an actual RTN neuron â i.e., no attempt is made to relate individual responsive neurons to the cells that were subsequently immunostained.)</p><p>4. The issue of response &quot;patterns&quot; remains. The post hoc grouping of different neurons selected for similar responses to use for averaging (Figure 1, Supp. 2) does not say anything about whether the response in an individual neuron represents its own characteristic &quot;pattern.&quot; It is circular reasoning to select neurons based on a type of response to the stimulus, and then view the averaged data from those pre-selected neurons aligned to the stimulus as evidence for a consistent &quot;pattern.&quot;</p><p>Moreover, the new anecdotal data presented of recordings from the same cell over multiple days (Figure 1, Supp. 5) with no analysis beyond the &quot;eye test&quot; is unconvincing and does not adequately address this issue. What precisely does it mean to say that &quot;activity patterns were remarkably similar between separate recording sessions&quot; when no quantification is provided to assess that professed similarity. Why not simply repeat the stimulus protocol and verify a consistent response pattern?</p><p>5. Aside from issues with the data mentioned above, it is worth pointing out that some of the interpretations presented in the Discussion are questionable and/or fail to adequately consider the existing literature. A few examples are provided below.</p><p>As mentioned in the previous review, the responses recorded (and any associated response properties such as graded, adapting, etc.) could represent either an intrinsic sensory response or a complex amalgam of the presumed intrinsic property with extrinsic inputs to the recorded neuron. Although the authors claim to have clarified this at various points in the text (e.g., one instance is noted on p. 13, when discussing CO2-inhibited raphe neurons), a reader is likely to get the overall sense from the presentation that the responses are mostly presumed to be intrinsic (e.g., with phrasing such as &quot;cells encoded the level of inspired CO2.&quot;) An explicit acknowledgement of this interpretive confound, which is unavoidably inherent to studies that correlate neuronal activity with behavior, should be provided at the outset of the Discussion (preferably in a general standalone section that deals with the various experimental and interpretive limitations.)</p><p>The statements that: &quot;The majority of evidence for the involvement of the RTN, and in particular the Phox2B+ neurons, in CO2 chemoreception comes from neonatal or young juvenile animals&quot; and &quot;much of prior evidence for RTN chemosensory responses depends heavily on recordings from anaesthetized animals&quot; ignores strong evidence from the Guyenet group for RTN involvement in CO2 responses of unanesthetized adult rodents (e.g., Basting et al., 2015).</p><p>Further, the suggestion that a normal developmental feature is that &quot;chemosensory response becomes less dependent on Phox2B+ neurons of the RTN by 3 months of age&quot; is based on a study that examined adaptations following genetic RTN destruction â hardly a normal developing mouse â and it ignores the profound effects of acute RTN neuron ablation in adult rats on chemosensory responses (Souza et al., 2018). A more balanced interpretation of the present results that considers all the relevant literature is advisable.</p><p>As a final example, it would appear to be a stretch to relate E-A and E-G responses in vivo to two types of RTN neurons recorded in vitro, based apparently on a visual inspection (&quot;careful examination&quot;) of a few example cells presented in figures from other papers in which those particular response characteristics were neither identified nor characterized. It does not seem appropriate to build a substantial and speculative part of the discussion on this subjective interpretation from those example cells.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Analyzing the brainstem circuits for respiratory chemosensitivity in freely moving mice&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Catherine Dulac (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The reviewers appreciate that the authors have responded to many of the previous points of major concern raised. The authors' novel catalog and analyses of multicellular neuronal calcium dynamics in the freely behaving mouse during hypercapnia are a valuable contribution to the field, including by illustrating the feasibility and paving the way for further development/application of this imaging approach, while indicating its limitations. However, there are some concerns that should be further addressed.</p><p>1) There is still a serious concern that there is a problem with precisely interpreting what the measured calcium signals are encoding due to uncertain, possibly nonlinear, relationships between calcium imaging from various neurons and their firing rate/pattern. The authors respond to this criticism by saying: &quot;â¦ the dynamics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal are likely to reflect the dynamics of firing. We can be confident that when the firing rate increases, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> will also increase.&quot; While this has been shown for some types of neurons (especially hippocampal and neocortical neurons), the reviewers are not aware that it has been shown for RTN or raphe neurons, and the authors offer no evidence for that. There are many mechanisms by which calcium levels could become dissociated from the firing rate. For example, in some neurons calcium levels may be relatively insensitive to an increase in firing rate due to low calcium current density or a high level of calcium buffering. An increase in firing rate or intracellular acidosis could have a stimulatory effect on calcium extrusion or sequestration. The &quot;adaptation&quot; of calcium levels the authors point out may reflect augmentation of calcium regulation rather than adaptation of firing rate. The response/decay kinetics of GCaMP6s is also a problem in terms of encoding the temporal characteristics of neuronal firing (e.g., Dana et al. Nat Methods 16, 649-657, 2019). A disconnect between calcium levels and firing rate could also explain why some neurons did not have a linear response to a graded increase to CO2 â their firing rate may have increased linearly while calcium levels fell off. The authors say they &quot;have never attempted to convert Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to firing rate,&quot; but they lead the reader to believe that their measurements reflect neuronal firing rate/patterns throughout the paper by describing their measurements of calcium fluorescence as &quot;activity of neurons&quot;, &quot;neuronal firing&quot;, &quot;activity patterns&quot;, or &quot;activity.&quot; Neurons were categorized as Inhibited, Excited, or Tonic. Neurons are described as being &quot;silenced.&quot; All of these terms lead the reader to think that the measurements presented are reliable surrogates of neuronal electrophysiological activity. The authors state that &quot;the use of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a proxy for activity is widely accepted.&quot; That doesn't make it right. The authors need to be more precise in their terminology throughout the text. They are measuring calcium signals, not necessarily firing rate/activity patterns.</p><p>2) The authors' responses have not adequately addressed the major and overarching concerns that: a) the recordings were ultimately from unidentified RTN neurons even if we allow that they were in the region of the RTN; and, b) we cannot know whether the recorded responses were a true characteristic CO2 response of the recorded neurons without repeated measurements in the same neurons (as opposed to some random fluorescence changes that were found represented among the population of recorded cells in different mice). The authors need to emphasize these problems more clearly in the manuscript.</p><p>3) Reviewer #3 still questions the specificity of the NMB immunostaining. While it is appreciated that the authors tried to match their immunolabeling with the Allen Brain Atlas, this is unconvincing and appears to be mostly comparisons of the type of non-specific labeling that is often seen in areas of high cell density (e.g., Figure 2, Figure Suppl. 1, Panel Ei, cortex; Panel Eii, piriform cortex). The most obvious example they provide of &quot;real&quot; strong in situ labeling from the Allen Atlas is in Panel Eii (in the hilus of the dentate gyrus?) â and in this case, the NMB immunostaining they show is not any stronger than the non-specific labeling noted above.</p><p>Other specific issues that should be addressed:</p><p>1) Abstract, lines 26-28. Given the authors' acknowledgements of the potential limitations of their calcium signal measurements in terms of encoding temporal patterns of neuronal activity, the statement that their &quot;analysis revises understanding of chemosensory control in awake adult mouse&quot; should be modified.</p><p>2) Introduction: &quot;brain imaging techniques have been developed to allow recording of activity of defined cell populations in awake, freely-moving animals â¦ require: the expression of genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators such as GCaMP6 in the relevant neurons â¦&quot; This specific requirement was not met for the RTN since there was no &quot;defined cell population&quot; targeted with the GCaMP6. Consider rewording.</p><p>3) Page 5, lines 151-153: &quot;When we were able to identify the same neurons their activity patterns were remarkably similar between separate recording sessions (Figure 1âfigure supplement 6).&quot; This cursory analysis, based on a few neurons, is not very convincing. The need for repeated measurements of the same neuron to be sure about the characteristic dynamic pattern of the calcium signal should be clearly stated in the limitations section in the Discussion.</p><p>4) Line 369: &quot;are reproducible between recording sessions from a single mouse â¦&quot; Change to &quot;are reproducible across the imaged neuronal population between recording sessions from a single mouse&quot; to clarify that these general activity patterns were observed, but not within the same individual neurons.</p><p>5) There seem to be two different definitions applied for the EA subtype of response. For one, they responded to the initial increase in inspired CO2 but did not maintain their activation, and for the other, they respond to 3% CO2 more robustly than 6% CO2. Are these the same?</p><p>6) Lines 447-448: &quot;Chemosensory responses become less dependent on Phox2B+ neurons of the RTN by 3 months of age (Ramanantsoa et al., 2011) â¦ should add &quot;when those neurons are genetically ablated&quot; or some such qualifier.</p><p>7) Line 515: This statement should include a reference to Cleary et al. (PMID: 34013884), in which CO2-inhibited SST-expressing interneurons were recorded in the parafacial (RTN) region. This paper should also be cited with reference to the diversity of neuronal subtypes in that region, many of which may have been sampled in the current GCaMP6 recordings.</p><p>8) Page 15, para. 1 and 2 and Figure 8. The calcium signal measurements presented in this paper and summarized in panel C do not directly provide information on neuronal firing patterns and associated synaptic interactions implied in these diagrams. Given the uncertainty, the authors should emphasize that the regional interactions postulated are based on what is generally proposed in the literature, and it is currently unknown if any specific type of neuron that the authors have classified from the calcium signals and represented in the diagram has the connections indicated. Some readers may find these diagrams excessively speculative.</p><p>9) Line 619: &quot;The neuronal responses to CO2 were more heterogeneous in both the RTN and Raphe than would be expected from the prior literature&quot; should be clarified to state that &quot;The neuronal responses to CO2 were heterogeneous for unidentified neurons in the RTN and for serotonergic neurons in Raphe.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70671.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should discuss more the technical limitations of their imaging approach. A major concern is whether the targeted regional neuronal and glial populations have been adequately sampled to reasonably understand the spatial and functional heterogeneity of the hypercapnic responses. There are important optical limitations as well as potential limitations associated with efficacy of cellular labeling with the vector constructs used. These are major caveats that need to be more thoroughly discussed in the context of technical limitations. The authors state for example that the GRIN lens placement was within the RTN (Discussion p. 10, para. 2) or terminated under the caudal pole of the facial nucleus (p. 6, para. 1) but the anatomical reconstructions consistently show the end of the lens in facial motor nucleus and in Methods (p. 17, para. 1), so as the authors discuss the coverage of the RTN populations may not be sufficient. The authors state that generally the lens was positioned ~300 Âµm above the regions to be imaged. Please provide information on the depth of field of the GRIN lens used and the typical field of view (including providing length scale bars on the cellular fluorescence images presented in the main text). Additional information on the viral transduction efficacy with the GCaMP constructs used is also essential.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising these important issues.</p><p>Optical characteristics of GRIN lens</p><p>We appreciate that the optical characteristics are a key point in the interpretation of our data.</p><p>The GRIN lens has a diameter of 600 Âµm and ample evidence in the literature shows that it has a focal plane that is ~300 Âµm below the lens as described in these references:</p><p>Resendez SL, Jennings JH, Ung RL, Namboodiri VM, Zhou ZC, Otis JM, et al.

Figure-4</p><p>However, given this is such a key point, we have imaged fluorescent beads to document this for the lenses we used in this study (now included as Figure 1 Figure Supplement 1). It is possible to adjust the focal plane of the lens by winding the camera back on its turret from the end of the lens (which moves the focal plane deeper into the tissue). We have therefore documented the focal plane and depth under two conditions -a turret setting of 0 turns (i.e. camera is against the end of the GRIN lens, and the focal plane is at its closest to the lens) and a maximum turret setting of 4 turns (i.e the camera is far from the end of the GRIN lens as it can be, and the focal plane is at its farthest). The imaging of the beads shows that at a turret setting of 0, the focal depth (in which the beads are sharply focussed) extends from 150-250 Âµm below the end of the lens, and for a turret setting of 4 this has been moved from 350-450 Âµm below the end of the lens. We kept a record of the turret settings for every recording and have added this into the data description and this gives the approximate depth of focus for every image. The text on pp 3 has been modified to explain this.</p><p>Even though anatomical reconstructions show the end of the lens in facial motor nucleus, the lens extends on either end of the shown anatomical reconstruction and covers the caudal pole of the facial nucleus, and the focal plane will be ventral to the facial nucleus. In the figure panels where we show lens placement we now include a box which shows the range of focal depths in which we expect to image cells. Our additional analysis suggests that in most cases we were indeed able to image from the ventral surface of the medulla.</p><p>Field of view was same in all the recordings- &quot;width&quot; 1440 and &quot;height&quot; 1080 pixels. We have added scale bars as requested to the GRIN lens images.</p><p>Transduction efficacy</p><p>We have addressed this by giving Venn diagrams for GCaMP expression versus different markers in Figures2, 5 and 9. We show a low percentage of ChAT (9/66), and a high percentage of NMB (40/93) and TPH (57/83) cells transduced by GCaMP.</p><p>Additionally, the numbers of cells that we recorded (i.e. within the imaging field) were as follows:</p><p>9 mice for RTN with hSyn promoter 122 neurons transduced ~14 neurons/mouse</p><p>6 mice for Raphe with hSyn or SERT promoter 41 neurons transduced ~7 neurons/mouse</p><p>3 mice pF<sub>L</sub> with hSyn promoter, 31 neurons transduced ~10 neurons/mouse</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Cell identification is another technical issue that needs to be addressed. It is critically important that the authors provide more convincing additional experimental data on the molecular identity of RTN neurons imaged to help with the interpretation of the results on this component. This should be done by employing an experimental strategy that allows for cell-type specific expression of GCaMP in RTN neurons (e.g., by using a Phox2b promoter), and/or by providing convincing additional quantification verifying that a high percentage of the GCaMP-expressing neurons imaged in the RTN region also express NMB and VGLUT2. For astrocytes and serotonin neurons, an attempt was made to restrict GCaMP expression to the targeted cell groups by using viruses including GFAP (gfaABC1D) or SERT promoters, but a non-specific neuronal promoter (synapsin) was used to drive GCaMP expression in RTN neurons or the pFL, with the obvious problem that the recordings were made from unidentified cells. Granted there is no specific marker for the pFL, but this approach is not justified for the RTN neurons. The molecular phenotype of CO2-sensitive RTN neurons has been well-established, and viral vectors using a Phox2b promoter have been employed for many years to preferentially target those RTN neurons. There are not a lot of RTN neurons (maybe 700-800 in mice) and there are many other neurons in the same region that likely were transduced with GCaMP and may account for the measured responses to CO2.</p></disp-quote><p>The PRSX8 promoter can only be used with lentiviral (LV) vectors. Unlike AAV vectors which are expressed in cells without causing cellular insults, LVs integrate into the cellular genome and can have off target effects. While we have had great success with the AAV approach, our use of LVs and the PRSX8 promoter to drive GCaMP expression in 10 mice on 3 separate occasions has not been successful. This strategy did indeed transduce NMB+ neurons. However, the GCaMP fluorescence was unvarying to any stimulus. We think this an artefact as these cells did not respond to KA injection. Thus, for unknown technical reasons this approach has not worked.</p><p>As the PRSX8 approach did not work we performed further experiments with hSyn-driven transduction and use NMB immuno-labelling to verify correct placement of lens and the presence of these cells in the field of view. These additional recordings replicated our prior findings, provided evidence for some more neurons with graded CO<sub>2</sub> responses, provided evidence for a further subclass of CO<sub>2</sub> non-coding neurons that exhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals related to variability in the breathing traces. These additional experiments have also allowed us to document more thoroughly how anaesthesia alters the responses of these neurons. We now have 98 neurons included. Furthermore, the proportion of NMB+ neurons transduced was approx. 43%.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Information about specificity of the antibodies used should be provided, which is particularly important for the immunostaining for NMB and VGLUT2 used to suggest that some of the GCaMP-expressing parafacial cells were bona fide RTN neurons. There are no controls provided for the specificity of the antibody staining, and no references attesting to the quality of the antibodies, which should be standard practice (see Rhodes and Trimmer, J Neuroscience 2006; Saper, JCN, 2005; Saper and Sawchenko, ibid, 2003). Even if the staining were validated as specific for the relevant antigens, demonstrating that some of the GCaMP-expressing neurons were VGLUT2- and NMB-positive RTN neurons does not guarantee that the recorded cells were also RTN chemosensory neurons. This important caveat needs to be amplified in the text with appropriate disclaimers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this point. The antibodies we used are those that have been used by others and validated. We give the details and references in the Methods:</p><p>Goat anti-choline acetyltransferase (AB144P); Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA- PMIDs- 33013329, 25723967, 25602013</p><p>Rabbit anti-tryptophan hydroxylase (ABN60); Î£-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA- PMIDs- 32332079, 25732261, 28821671</p><p>Rabbit anti-Neuromedin-B (SAB1301059); SigmaAldrich, St Louis, MO, USA- PMID- 26855425, 33393903</p><p>We agree that it is important to add caveats to our ability to identify the actual cells that we recorded from. However, the RTN contains a multitude of cells, and that will include chemosensory and non-chemosensory neurons. We have unbiasedly report on the activity of all neurons in the nucleus. We have been careful to avoid stating that we only record from âchemosensoryâ RTN neurons -clearly some of the recorded neurons are insensitive to the chemosensory stimuli.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors need to explain more their interpretations of the measured GCaMP signals. For various neurons there may be a nonlinear relationship between theses signals and neuronal firing. For glia it is not clear that &quot;activation&quot; by hypercapnia would always cause a change in intracellular calcium, and yet signaling pathways could still be engaged that influence neighboring neurons. In addition, the authors need to explain why GCaMP6s was used for calcium activity imaging of RTN and Raphe neurons, whereas GCaMP6f was used for imaging astrocytes and pFL neurons. For comparisons of calcium dynamics between regions it is important that the same sensor is utilized which was done for the RTN region and Raphe neurons, but interpretation of what is being encoded by a particular sensor needs to take into account the sensor signaling kinetics. GCaMP6s kinetics produce long (many seconds) calcium signal decays after signal onset, which can for example contribute to features such as adaptation of the calcium dynamics imaged and would not accurately reflect neuronal activity profiles per se.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the relationship between intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation and neuronal firing may be nonlinear. Nevertheless, it is well established that neuronal firing does indeed lead to accumulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and has been used as a proxy of neural activity in many imaging studies (and underlies other techniques such as cFos expression to assess neural activation).</p><p>The choice of GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f was predicated on their sensitivity and speed of kinetics (PMID: 23868258). We used GCaMP6f in the pF<sub>L</sub> to attempt to resolve their firing during active expiration, whilst this may be a different fluorophore, we do not make any comparisons between the pF<sub>L</sub> and any other site. However, we used GCaMP6s in both the RTN and the Raphe, so these measurements are directly comparable. GCaMP6s being a slower responding GCaMP is more sensitive to smaller signals and seemed the correct choice for our studies. The inability to resolve individual spikes does not seem to us a shortcoming, as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> will accumulate and likely show the envelope of firing in the neurons. We note that the graded responses that we observe in the RTN neurons are remarkably similar to the chemosensory response of a Phox2b+ neuron documented in Stornetta et al. 2006.</p><p>As the paper is now considerably longer due to the revisions and extra documentation, we have decided to focus only on the neuronal recordings and have taken out the data on glial cells. This has the benefit of allowing us to present the neuronal data much more fully and simplifies the discussion of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should discuss more how they adequately ruled out movement artifacts affecting the calcium signals. The authors provide some evidence that the measured Ca transients are independent of movement, but the GFP signal measured in different mice is not the best and adequate control for movement artifacts in other GCaMP-expressing mice. Inscopix miniscopes are capable of dual color imaging to detect a co-expressed fluorescent marker in the same cell, which would be a better control.</p></disp-quote><p>With respect we think that our treatment of this has been very thorough. Dual wavelength ratiometric imaging is of course desirable but such microscopes were not available at the time we performed this study. With appropriate controls single wavelength imaging has been used to study neural activity successfully in many brain areas and we believe that our work conforms to the best practice published in the field. We have emphasized that we have used a consistent experiment protocol and have used averaging to document consistent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (see point below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The calcium signals are interpreted by the authors to reflect a variety of cellular response patterns, but there is no indication of how the authors verified consistency of these patterns, and this important issue needs to be addressed. Did the authors apply the CO2 challenges in repeated or alternately ordered fashion (0-3-6, 0-6-3) to more convincingly verify a consistent response in each individual cell? This is important information to include. This approach would also aid in dissociating common CO2-associated response patterns from any more randomly associated movement artifacts, for example by the use of peristimulus averaging to tease out signal from noise.</p></disp-quote><p>We of course agree that a consistent paradigm of stimulation is critical to document reliable responses to hypercapnia. With respect, we point out that this is exactly what we did and that we provided all the records of all the recordings in Figure 1 Figure Supplement 2 which documents the systematic nature of our study and the reproducibility of what we observed across neurons and mice. Our paradigm was to go from 0 to 3 to 6 and back to 0% inspired CO<sub>2</sub>. This was chosen to minimise bleaching of the GCaMP and allow repeated imaging sessions of cells on different days. We also point out that we averaged the responses of each type of neuron aligned to hypercapnic stimulus, and for neurons that displayed activity related to breathing we averaged the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals triggered to the relevant features of the WBP trace (a form of peristimulus averaging). We have modified the text on pp4 to make this clearer.</p><p>In addition, we now document in Figure 1 Supplement 3 that, when we can identify the same neurons between recording sessions on different days, their activity patterns are remarkably similar (text on pp 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors suggest that tonic RTN neurons &quot;provide tonic drive to the respiratory network.&quot; However, it is possible that these neurons are not respiratory. Just because they are in/near the RTN does not mean they are chemoreceptors. Please discuss more carefully.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carefully reviewed our wording and modified any ambiguities. However, the RTN is well known to provide tonic drive to the preBotC so this suggestion is hardly contentious. We have also been careful to avoid describing all the RTN neurons are chemosensitive. Like others (e.g. PMIDs 29873079, 31635852, 26968853 and 24107938) we found neurons apparently insensitive to changes in PCO<sub>2Â­</sub>. We have added some additional text to pp 15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) There was little effect of CO2 on calcium signals in RTN astrocytes. The authors need to discuss if they imaged the astrocytes near the ventral medullary surface that have been most associated with CO2 activation and control of breathing. The authors also should indicate if they have independent histochemical evidence that the gfaABC1D promoter indeed restricted GCaMP expression to glial cells. Also, it is important to explain how they can conclude, based on the strength of the calcium signal, whether or not the astrocytes could play a functional role â at what threshold would they decide the signal is big enough, and on what would they base that decision. Is there any evidence that glial calcium levels need to rise in order for glia to influence neighboring neurons? Please discuss these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above we have decided to take out the glial recordings so that this paper focusses more clearly on neuronal responses. We shall publish the glial responses in a different paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors argue (page 6, 2nd paragraph) that the adapting responses of RTN neurons to hypercapnia match adaptation of VE in the WBP trace. This issue should be addressed in more detail. The data for this are very unconvincing. Instead there is a gradually increasing level of respiratory activity after switching to 3% and 6% CO2. In Figure 2H the WBP Av ReSm shows a similar result, with gradually increasing amplitude as CO2 level increases. The authors should expand the &quot;WBP Av ReSm&quot; trace in the vertical direction to more clearly show the increase in amplitude with time, and a horizontal line should be drawn at the baseline level to allow the reader to visualize the change in amplitude more clearly. When this is done, there is a clear ramp up of VE after changing to 3% CO2, and an even steeper increase with 6% CO2. This is opposite of the clear adaptation of calcium level in the &quot;Average Waveform&quot; trace in Figure 2H.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we had not clearly documented this point. To rectify this, we have now provided for three mice, in which this phenomenon was particularly clear, a correlation plot (V<sub>T</sub> vs F/F0) at the beginning of the 3% hypercapnia to show that there is a positive correlation between these two variables i.e. there is an adapting change in V<sub>T</sub> that matches the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. To aid interpretation of this plot we also provide an Excel worksheet that uses simple mathematical functions to model an adapting F/F0 response together with either a gradual increase in V<sub>T</sub> or an adapting change in V<sub>T</sub> plus a gradual increase. This is an interactive spreadsheet so the reader can alter the values of the parameters to explore further. The key point is that if there were no adapting change in V<sub>T</sub>, the correlation plot would have negative slope, whereas with an adapting change in V<sub>T</sub> it gives a positive slope -which is what we observe in the real experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The imaging results for pFL neurons suggest that these cells did not exhibit sustained expiratory-related oscillatory activity in response to hypercapnia that would be predicted based on the concept of a conditional expiratory oscillator in the pFL. The nature of the transient expiratory events described and whether they are in anyway related to the hypercapnic challenge in unclear from the results presented in Figure 8. This issue should be addressed more thoroughly in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have added more discussion of this on pp16. Most studies on this are from anaesthetised and vagotomised rodents, which elongates and enhances expiratory output. Data from pF<sub>L</sub> neurons in unanaesthetised unvagotomised in situ preparation shows pF<sub>L</sub> neurons only discharge in the final 20% of the expiratory period. In freely moving mice this equates to approximately only 20 ms, which may not be enough to give a sufficient signal using GRIN lens technology and the GCaMP6f construct. This technique does however still allow for recording of large expiratory events, which support the role of the pF<sub>L</sub> as an expiratory oscillator. Therefore, this finding is still of great importance. We now discuss this in greater detail on pp16 and 17.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors conclude (page 15) that: &quot;Raphe neurons tended to be active during the entire CO2 stimulus and conceivably these neurons are likely to take over from RTN neurons under pathophysiological levels of CO2.&quot; The logic of how the authors come to this conclusion should be explained. The data are more supportive of the opposite conclusion. 42% of raphe neurons respond with a graded or sustained increase in firing in response to a rise in CO2 of as little as 3%, whereas most RTN neurons rapidly adapt (in only 1-2 minutes) to 3% CO2 and don't increase to 6% CO2 (a level that strongly stimulates breathing). The data are more consistent with the conclusion that at low levels of CO2, RTN neurons would have little or no effect, while raphe neurons would be expected to provide continuous activation of the respiratory network across the whole CO2 range studied. But there are potentially major problems with identifying the relevant RTN chemosensory neurons as indicated above that are thought to generate graded and sustained responses to CO2. This issue should be discussed more thoughtfully, particularly in the context of new experimental data that may be obtained regarding the molecular phenotypic identity of the RTN neurons analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. We have looked closely at the chemosensory responses documented for Phox2b neurons in the published literature. As mentioned above the time course of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (including its recovery back to baseline in return to 0%) of the graded neurons (E<sub>G</sub>) is remarkably similar to the response documented by Stornetta et al. 2006. We note that Phox2b+ chemosensory neurons have been subdivided into type 1 and type 2 categories based on the characteristics of their pH sensitivity. Interestingly type 1 neurons display an adapting response to acidification -this is clearly seen in Figure 6B1 of Lazarenko et al. 2009 doi: 10.1002/cne.22136, where the adaptation is particularly prominent on going from pH 7.3 to pH 7.0, and was also evident (but slower) with lesser acidification. The type 2 neurons (panel C1) show a sustained response. This adapting response in type 1 neurons is also evident in the isolated Phox2b neurons reported in Wang et al. 2013 J Neurosci doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5550-12.2013 e.g. Figure 2A. Although the acid stimulus is only 1 minute long, allowing for the time taken for the stimulus to wash on and wash off (about 30s), the firing appears to adapt.</p><p>We now discuss these points and suggest that the adapting and graded neuronal subtypes we observe could be equivalent to these previously described subtypes. In total we observe that ~20% of the neurons in the RTN exhibit a graded or adapting response, this matches reasonably well with the proportion of GCaMP6 transduced neurons that are also NMB+.</p><p>Our additional experiments have allowed us to document more fully the effect of anaesthesia on the chemoresponsiveness of RTN neurons. The over-riding result is that anaesthesia very effectively silences the vast majority of RTN neurons -both their baseline activity and their response to hypercapnia. We find that the chemosensory phenotype of the neurons that retain activity under anaesthesia changes between the awake and anesthetised state. For example, neurons that exhibit a graded chemosensory response in the anaesthetised state would be classified as ânon-coding respiratory relatedâ in the awake state. Neurons that exhibited a graded response when awake, became non-coding in the anaesthetized state. Adapting neurons in the awake state became non-coding or inhibited neurons in the anaesthetized state. We think there is very compelling evidence that some RTN neurons are intrinsically pH sensitive (e.g. the Wang et al. study on acutely isolated neurons). However, our data would suggest that caution in interpreting the activity patterns of these neurons in the presence of anaesthesia is warranted, especially as the type of anaesthetic agent and depth of anaesthesia are likely to be confounding variables.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) There should be an explicit discussion of the role of synaptic connectivity, and the authors should discuss the relationship of their results with data from more reduced preparations (about which there is little discussion). Synaptic inputs were intact and all responses that were measured were due to a combination of intrinsic responses, synaptic input and glial modulation. Some of the text seems to imply that the responses are all intrinsic, but this issue should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.

The authors are attempting to draw functional conclusions with this imaging approach about chemosensory responses of neurons and glia in multiple important medullary regions that have been the focus of numerous studies. Understanding the details of how these types of cells respond in any of these regions in vivo, particularly in awake behaving animals, requires extensive work with this imaging approach for any region studied, beyond what the authors have presented. The observations presented here are nonetheless important for the field and provocative, but the major concern with this approach is whether the targeted regional neuronal and glial populations have been adequately sampled to reasonably understand the spatial and functional heterogeneity of the hypercapnic responses. There are important optical limitations as well as potential limitations associated with efficacy of cellular labeling with the vector constructs used. These are major caveats that need to be more thoroughly discussed in the context of technical limitations. The authors state that the GRIN lens placement was within the RTN (Discussion p. 10, para. 2) or terminated under the caudal pole of the facial nucleus (p. 6, para. 1) but the anatomical reconstructions consistently show the end of the lens in facial motor nucleus and in Methods (p. 17, para. 1), so as the authors discuss the coverage of the RTN populations may not be sufficient. The authors state that generally the lens was positioned ~300 Âµm above the regions to be imaged. Please provide information on the depth of field of the GRIN lens used and the typical field of view (including providing length scale bars on the cellular fluorescence images presented in the main text). Additional information on the viral transduction efficacy with the GCaMP constructs used would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have covered these important matters in Essential Revisions point 1 above, provided more data and revised the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another technical issue relates to the genetically encoded calcium sensors used for different experiments. The authors need to explain why GCaMP6s was used for calcium activity imaging of RTN and Raphe neurons, whereas GCaMP6f was used for imaging astrocytes and pFL neurons. For comparisons of calcium dynamics between regions it is important that the same sensor is utilized which was done so this is not an issue, but interpretation of what is being encoded by a particular sensor needs to take into account the sensor signaling kinetics. GCaMP6s kinetics produce long (many seconds) calcium signal decays after signal onset, which can for example contribute to features such as adaptation of the calcium dynamics imaged and would not accurately reflect neuronal activity profiles per se.</p></disp-quote><p>We have covered these concerns in our response to Essential Revisions point 2 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The imaging results for pFL neurons are of considerable interest since these cells did not exhibit sustained expiratory-related oscillatory activity in response to hypercapnia that would be predicted based on the concept of a conditional expiratory oscillator in the pFL.

As indicated in the reviews, there are other approaches to address this issue. Despite the new neuromedin B immunostaining results, the authors have not implemented a strategy to establish that any particular GCaMP-imaged cell was an actual RTN neuron. Accordingly, the authors cannot directly relate the measured responses of individual neurons to any specific type of neuron in the region studied. The authors should employ an approach that defines the molecular identity of the neurons imaged. Without additional convincing neuronal labeling/identification information that RTN neurons (as currently defined in the literature) were imaged, the authors need to use different terminology for what they are calling &quot;RTN neurons&quot; (e.g., ventral/ventromedial parafacial neurons) to avoid confusion and misinterpretation by readers. This issue also needs to be thoroughly discussed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>In the interests of transparency, we have revised the text to make it clear that we cannot identify the neurons to a specific subtype within the RTN.</p><p>However, we disagree that we are not using the correct nomenclature. The neurons are in the correct location underneath the caudal portion of the facial nucleus, in an area that contains NMB labelled neurons. The RTN, as implied by its name, is a nucleus, and nuclei consist of multiple neuronal subpopulations. It is inappropriate to define the RTN as a single anatomically defined neuronal subtype, as is being requested. Furthermore, calling this âventral/ventromedial parafacialâ is more likely to confuse readers. We have responded to this point more fully in point 2 of reviewer 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors should include a more thorough discussion of the problem of precisely interpreting what the measured calcium signals are encoding due to uncertain, possibly nonlinear, relationships between the signals recorded from various neurons and their neuronal firing patterns. This discussion should include the rationale for their selection of the GCaMP sensors used. The authors need to have a section at the beginning of the Discussion dealing with these technical aspects/limitations that may affect interpretations of their observations, including further addressing any potentially confounding effects of insufficient correction of signals for movement artifacts- an issue raised again in this review.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a section to the beginning of the Discussion to address these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The issue of the consistency of calcium dynamic response patterns for a given neuron with repeated measurements to establish whether a given neuron truly belongs to any particular group as classified.

Although for the most part we cannot identify the same neuron from day to day, we see very consistent patterns of responses across recording sessions, we now include these data in Figure 1 Figure Supplement 5. We explain the technical difficulties of identifying the <italic>same</italic> neuron between recording sessions on different days (possible in a few cases and presented in Figure 1 Figure Supplement 6), and why the possible issue of GCaMP6 bleaching constrained use to a single recording session per day. Our reasoning has been laid out in the response to Reviewer 2.</p><p>To justify the results of our classification further, we have plotted the change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> response from baseline to 6% CO<sub>2</sub> versus the response to 3% inspired CO<sub>2</sub>. This simple two component analysis would predict that E<sub>A</sub> neurons, as they have a stronger response to 3% than 6%, should fall below the x=y line on the graph. Conversely, E<sub>G</sub> neurons as they have a stronger response to 6% than 3%, should fall above the x=y line. E<sub>NC</sub> neurons as their activity does not change with CO<sub>2</sub> should be clustered around the origin, and I neurons should fall in the negative quadrant of the graph. We include a new figure supplement to demonstrate that this analysis shows our groupings follow the predicted pattern (Figure 1 Figure Supplement 7). Out of the 124 neurons from the RTN and Raphe included in our dataset, this further analysis caused us to reassign only 7 neurons (2 from RTN: 1 from I to NC and 1 from E<sub>G</sub> to NC; and 5 from Raphe: 2 from E<sub>s</sub> to E<sub>G</sub> and 3 from E<sub>s</sub> to E<sub>A</sub>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors need to rectify inconsistencies in the data presented and address questions about how they interpret some of their observations, as noted in the reviews.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected some errors pointed out to us that were inadvertently introduced during revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This revised paper provides supporting evidence demonstrating the technical application of deep endoscopic fluorescence imaging with head-mounted miniscopes and genetically encoded calcium sensors in awake behaving mice for multicellular calcium activity imaging from key medullary structures involved in respiratory control in freely behaving mice, which is novel and important for the respiratory neurobiology field.

However, as currently presented some errors have been introduced, there are some inconsistencies in the data, and there are new concerns about some artifacts contaminating some of the results. The authors also make some conclusions that are not supported by their data.</p><p>It is important for the authors to specifically state that for the two specific types of neurons of most interest here the authors cannot convert the size of the calcium signals measured to firing rate. The relationship between calcium levels and firing rate is unlikely to be linear and is likely to be different for the two neuron types. One or both neuron types may not increase calcium levels very much in response to an increase in firing rate. The relationship could only be determined by simultaneous imaging and extracellular recordings of spikes.

Nevertheless, the dynamics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal are likely to reflect the dynamics of firing.

For example, that is true for neurons from mouse 7 for the RTN EA group. It is also true for the top two traces for Figure 2H (both extracted from mouse 5 in Suppl figure2), and for mouse 6 for the Raphe I group. How can the authors verify that the calcium activity is due to an increase in firing rate in these examples, and not movement or other artifact shared across neurons recorded at the same time? It would be possible for neurons to have similar patterns of activity, but not to be essentially identical.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with this comment. The response types are consistent across mice. For this to be a movement artefact, every mouse would have to move and generate this proposed artefact in the same way. This seems exceedingly unlikely and the simpler hypothesis that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses reflect the biological responses of these neurons to hypercapnia seems far more probable to us. Were movement artefact to be a confounding factor, then all neurons from a single session would show the same profile. However, we show that multiple functional types were recorded from the same session. We have provided movies of all the neuronal types so readers can see the signals for themselves and judge accordingly.</p><p>We agree that the responses are very similar but do not see the problem -hypercapnia is a global stimulus and will thus evoke a global response, likely to be very similar in all responding neurons. In principle, synchrony may be additionally enhanced by synaptic and electrical coupling between neurons.

The authors should cite literature if it exists.</p></disp-quote><p>We seem to be talking at cross purposes. We of course agree that there is a sustained increase in breathing with hypercapnia. However, superimposed on this is a transient adapting response -this is easy to see from the recordings we present in the paper. The vast body of literature that we have examined never shows measurements across the transition from normocapnia to hypercapnia (90 publications appeared in a PubMed search with the keywords: mice, hypercapnia and tidal volume). There is a simple reason for this -over the transition period, ventilation increases to a peak that then falls back somewhat to a stable value (still above that of normocapnia). This is simply an undocumented well-known fact of the field. Clearly there is a sustained ventilatory response to hypercapnia as measured at the end of the episode, but there is also an adapting response evident over the first minute that is superimposed on top of this sustained response. We refer the referee to panel 2H and J that show this adapting response in 4 different mice. Typically, the last minute of a hypercapnic episode is analysed to avoid this adapting period around the transition.</p><p>With regard to the literature, we have only managed to find one paper out of 90 that actually documents the transition and indeed shows an adapting response on top of the sustained response, see figure 1B in PMID: 27018763.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 257 â &quot;Only a minority of neurons, 13% (5/38), encoded the magnitude of hypercapnia.&quot;</p><p>The sizes of the responses were much less than expected based on previous literature.

Given this, we do not understand how this point can be made, and for this reason will not discuss it further. Nevertheless, the available data shows that Phox2b+ chemosensory neurons do not exhibit very high firing rates to a strong stimulus (&lt;12Hz). As these rates are low, we would not expect huge changes in the Ca2+.</p><p>The point that intrigues us is that the proportion of neurons that behave like a âclassical Phox2b+ chemoreceptor neuronâ as expected from the literature is very low.

The Lazarenko et al. paper, being from an earlier era, does not provide access to their original data to settle this point. However, we take it as a matter of good faith that the authors showed representative data in this figure. Taking this as our starting point we have made further measurements from this paper:</p><p>Following a change in pH from 7.4 to 7.0, it takes a type 1 neuron approx. 23 Â± 6s (n=5, mean Â± SD) to reach its peak firing rate. Over the next 27s (from peak) the firing rate reduces to 52% of its peak. Following a change from pH 7.4 to 7.3, a type 1 neuron takes 39s to reach peak firing and then declines to 84% of this peak rate over 38s.</p><p>We additionally include annotated illustrations from the two papers to make our point (B1 shows a Type 1 neuron, and C1 and Type 2 neuron).</p><p>This adapting response in type 1 neurons is also evident in the isolated Phox2b+ neurons reported in Wang et al. 2013 J Neurosci doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5550-12.2013 e.g. Figure 2A. Although the acid stimulus is only 1 minute long, allowing for the time taken for the stimulus to wash on and wash off (about 30s), the firing appears to adapt.</p><p>What is interesting about the values that we have measured from these papers is that they are not dissimilar to the dynamics of the E<sub>A</sub> neurons we describe. This similarity is evident even though they were obtained to a pH change in brain slices from P6-10 mice compared to in vivo recordings from adult mice and a response to CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Coupled with the fact that ventilation does not adapt in most literature in response to sustained hypercapnia, and other chemoreceptors do not adapt to CO2, I am not convinced that the EA neurons are important for chemoreception.</p></disp-quote><p>There is clearly an adapting component to the ventilation response over the initial phase -this is documented in Figure 2H and J. We have now shown it correlates very nicely with the response pattern of the E<sub>A</sub> neurons.

This new analysis also led us to reclassify 3 E<sub>S</sub> neurons as E<sub>A</sub>, hence there are now 4 neurons in this category.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have attempted to address the concerns from the previous reviews.</p><p>1. In dealing with the major issue of identifying the recorded neurons as RTN cells, the authors argue that the use of a PRSX8 promoter-driven viral approach was ineffective. But, this is not the only solution. An alternative is using a Phox2b-Cre mouse and a DIO virus for GCaMP delivery. These reagents are readily available and should be attempted if they want to say anything about RTN neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>This mouse was not available at the time we did the experiments. We disagree that we cannot say anything about RTN neurons. We are clearly recording activity from neurons located within the RTN as evidenced by the landmarks, facial nucleus, pyramids, and SP-5, and the presence of NMB positive neurons within the region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors need to use different terminology for what they are calling RTN. The initial description of RTN neurons in cats was based on their projections to VRG (and a lesser extent, DRG; see Smith et al., 1989). Since then, the RTN cell group has been defined functionally and neurochemically with increasingly greater precision (e.g., Guyenet et al., 2019). In the current study, these authors have not convincingly demonstrated that the actual recorded cells meet any of the established criteria for being called RTN neurons. Therefore, they should follow the more general &quot;parafacial&quot; terminology to describe this region, and refer to these as &quot;unidentified neurons located in the parafacial region.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree on this point. We are quite willing to accept that the precise identity of the neurons has not been established but using the term âparafacialâ is likely to introduce further confusion. The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is a nucleus. The point being made by the reviewer conflates anatomical localisation with function. In common with many other nuclei in the brain, the RTN contains multiple sub-populations of neuron. Nearby nuclei such as the preBotC contain neuronal subpopulations with NK1R+ glutamatergic, Sst glutamatergic, and glycinergic chemical phenotypes. The Raphe contains neurons with serotonergic and GABAergic chemical phenotypes. To look further afield, the VTA contains dopaminergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons.</p><p>As far as we are aware, no-one is seeking to redefine the preBotC along the lines implied by this comment. This line of reasoning would imply that as Sst neurons are output neurons and not rhythm generating neurons, they should no longer be considered preBotC neurons. Sensibly, the field refers to these neurons as a defined subtype within the preBotC. Similarly, no-one is promoting dopaminergic neurons as the âtrueâ VTA. We strongly argue that the naming convention for neurons in the RTN should adhere to the well-established norm in neuroscience: Phox2b+/NMB+ chemosensory neurons are a subpopulation within the RTN, but do not by themselves constitute the RTN.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There are issues remaining with respect to Nmb antibody validation and immunostaining. It is still the case that no experimental controls for the Nmb immunohistochemistry are provided in this paper.</p><p>Instead, two references are cited. In Yamagata et al. (eLife 2021), however, it appears that a different antibody was used (monoclonal antibody from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) â rendering this an irrelevant citation. The Li et al. (Nature, 2014) citation indeed reports on the same polyclonal antibody used here, but they used it to detect Nmb-IR terminals in the preBÃ¶tC (see Ext. Data Figure 2 in Li et al.) and not cell somata in the RTN. The problems of detecting neuropeptides in neuronal cell bodies by antibody staining are well recognized and the images provided are unconvincing. For example, there appears to be staining where one would expect to find few, if any, Nmb-expressing neurons â e.g., see upper right in current Figure 2D, just below the lens lesion. This is not to say that this Ab staining approach is impossible, but at least some validation is required. For example, the authors might combine IHC with FISH to demonstrate that the Nmb antibody specifically recognizes neurons that also express Nmb transcripts and, more importantly, that it does not non-specifically stain cells that do not express Nmb.</p></disp-quote><p>Souza et al. 2018 show NMB+ neurons in the locations mentioned by the reviewer âmidline NMBâ neurons Figure 1 of PMID: 29667182. Staining right next to the lens tract is likely to be artefactual.</p><p>We have removed the Yamagata reference, and now provide further validation of antibody specificity by comparing the NMB immunostaining with the pattern of ISH from the Allen Brain Atlas across several brain areas. This shows lack of staining in areas that do not express NMB (from ISH) and staining in areas where it would be expected from the ISH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(It should be noted that, even with more appropriate validation, this strategy of post hoc identification will not be able to ensure that any particular GCaMP-imaged cell was an actual RTN neuron â i.e., no attempt is made to relate individual responsive neurons to the cells that were subsequently immunostained.)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment to the extent that no recording can be attributed to a particular subtype of RTN neuron. But we have been appropriately cautious in this regard. (1) We do not equate any response of a neuron to a specific subtype, but merely report the different functional subtypes. (2) In the Discussion, we attempt to reconcile our findings with the prior literature -for example, we âtentatively suggestâ that the E<sub>G</sub> subtypes may represent Phox2b+ neurons. It seems to us that this a perfectly acceptable point to make, and it would be odd if we did not put our findings in this wider context. We now state that sub-type specific drivers of GCaMP would be needed before any associations of functional subtypes with neurons of known chemical phenotype can be definitively made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The issue of response &quot;patterns&quot; remains. The post hoc grouping of different neurons selected for similar responses to use for averaging (Figure 1, Supp. 2) does not say anything about whether the response in an individual neuron represents its own characteristic &quot;pattern.&quot; It is circular reasoning to select neurons based on a type of response to the stimulus, and then view the averaged data from those pre-selected neurons aligned to the stimulus as evidence for a consistent &quot;pattern.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We are puzzled by this comment. The reviewers specifically requested peristimulus averaging in their previous review to show that responses were repeatable and reproducible. We have chosen to show across mice that the same types of neuronal response are seen. As we show every recording in the dataset, we leave it up to readers to decide whether these response patterns are reproducible and consistent. The additional 2 component analysis we have performed (plotting the change in activity at 3% vs 6%) we have performed backs up our categorisation (see Figure 1 Figure Supplement 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the new anecdotal data presented of recordings from the same cell over multiple days (Figure 1, Supp. 5) with no analysis beyond the &quot;eye test&quot; is unconvincing and does not adequately address this issue. What precisely does it mean to say that &quot;activity patterns were remarkably similar between separate recording sessions&quot; when no quantification is provided to assess that professed similarity. Why not simply repeat the stimulus protocol and verify a consistent response pattern?</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised Figure 1 Figure Supplement 6 (previously Figure Supplement 5) to bring out the similarity of the activity in the two sessions. We have now added a third panel in which the traces from different days are superimposed. The key issue is not how similar the activity of the cells is in each recording session (one would not expect them to be identical) but whether one would classify the patterns of neuronal activity differently across sessions. These neurons were classified as non-coding (NC) in both sessions.</p><p>Identification of the <italic>same</italic> neurons from recording session to recording session (on different days) was possible only in a few cases. The reasons for why we could not reliably identify the same neurons on different days are not completely clear. Most likely it was not possible to place the camera on the headstage in the exact same turret position. This would cause the focal plane to vary from session to session -this has been explained in the text on pp 5.</p><p>We chose to perform one recording session per day i.e. one complete protocol, rather than giving repeated stimuli. This is because the GCaMP6 significantly bleaches and we wanted to be able to repeat the recording sessions across multiple days. However, every mouse was recorded on more than one day. In our dataset (Figure 1 supplements) we only include recordings from one session (i.e. each mouse is represented only once, to avoid pseudoreplication, and all the neurons from a mouse are from the same session). We now make this explicitly clear. However, we additionally present data to show that the same types of neuronal responses to hypercapnia are present in multiple recording sessions from the same mouse, even although these cannot be attributed to the same neurons (Figure 1 Figure Supplement 5).</p><p>Our additional analysis in Figure 1 Supplement 7 shows that the different neuronal types we identified fall into distinct quantitative groupings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Aside from issues with the data mentioned above, it is worth pointing out that some of the interpretations presented in the Discussion are questionable and/or fail to adequately consider the existing literature. A few examples are provided below.</p><p>As mentioned in the previous review, the responses recorded (and any associated response properties such as graded, adapting, etc.) could represent either an intrinsic sensory response or a complex amalgam of the presumed intrinsic property with extrinsic inputs to the recorded neuron. Although the authors claim to have clarified this at various points in the text (e.g., one instance is noted on p. 13, when discussing CO2-inhibited raphe neurons), a reader is likely to get the overall sense from the presentation that the responses are mostly presumed to be intrinsic (e.g., with phrasing such as &quot;cells encoded the level of inspired CO2.&quot;) An explicit acknowledgement of this interpretive confound, which is unavoidably inherent to studies that correlate neuronal activity with behavior, should be provided at the outset of the Discussion (preferably in a general standalone section that deals with the various experimental and interpretive limitations.)</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that bringing these matters to one place in the discussion would be helpful so have added a section to do this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The statements that: &quot;The majority of evidence for the involvement of the RTN, and in particular the Phox2B+ neurons, in CO2 chemoreception comes from neonatal or young juvenile animals&quot; and &quot;much of prior evidence for RTN chemosensory responses depends heavily on recordings from anaesthetized animals&quot; ignores strong evidence from the Guyenet group for RTN involvement in CO2 responses of unanesthetized adult rodents (e.g., Basting et al., 2015).</p></disp-quote><p>Our phrasing may not have been sufficiently precise. The evidence for the activity of RTN neurons in response to chemosensory stimuli comes mainly from neonatal or young juvenile animals and recordings from anaesthetized animals. The paper quoted does not document recordings of activity of RTN neurons in the absence of anaesthesia. There are of course papers that show the effect of optogenetic stimulation in non-anaesthetized animals or the effects of various lesions. But these tell us nothing about the activity patterns, only that stimulation of RTN neurons is sufficient to give an enhancement of breathing, or that destruction of the RTN alters hypercapnic responses. Without knowing the activity of these neurons in the absence of anaesthesia, the precise significance of optogenetic stimulation or lesions is not known.</p><p>We have modified our wording to avoid any further confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, the suggestion that a normal developmental feature is that &quot;chemosensory response becomes less dependent on Phox2B+ neurons of the RTN by 3 months of age&quot; is based on a study that examined adaptations following genetic RTN destruction â hardly a normal developing mouse â and it ignores the profound effects of acute RTN neuron ablation in adult rats on chemosensory responses (Souza et al., 2018). A more balanced interpretation of the present results that considers all the relevant literature is advisable.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include discussion of chemical lesioning experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As a final example, it would appear to be a stretch to relate E-A and E-G responses in vivo to two types of RTN neurons recorded in vitro, based apparently on a visual inspection (&quot;careful examination&quot;) of a few example cells presented in figures from other papers in which those particular response characteristics were neither identified nor characterized. It does not seem appropriate to build a substantial and speculative part of the discussion on this subjective interpretation from those example cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with this point. We take it on trust that the authors showed representative data and refer the reviewer to our response to reviewer 2. That they never identified or characterized this adapting response, may reflect the priorities that the authors had at the time. The emphasis in the Lazarenko paper was very much on documenting pH sensitivity and the differences in this characteristic between the type 1 and type 2 neurons. It is noteworthy that this same difference (adapting versus graded) was evident when the Phox2B+ neurons were isolated and was published some 4 years after the Lazarenko paper.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) There is still a serious concern that there is a problem with precisely interpreting what the measured calcium signals are encoding due to uncertain, possibly nonlinear, relationships between calcium imaging from various neurons and their firing rate/pattern. The authors respond to this criticism by saying: &quot;â¦ the dynamics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal are likely to reflect the dynamics of firing. We can be confident that when the firing rate increases, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> will also increase.&quot; While this has been shown for some types of neurons (especially hippocampal and neocortical neurons), the reviewers are not aware that it has been shown for RTN or raphe neurons, and the authors offer no evidence for that.</p></disp-quote><p>It seems to us inadvisable to argue that RTN and raphe neurons have very different properties with respect to their Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics from other neurons in many different regions of the brain (e.g. additionally hypothalamus, LDT/PPT). While this is possible in principle, there is no evidence to support this contention. In fact, the reverse is true. We note that the use of <italic>c-fos</italic> expression to identify neurons activated by chemosensory stimuli including those of the RTN has been widely published and accepted by the field (e.g., PMIDs 8173977; 26068853, Figures 1 and 4). As <italic>c-fos</italic> expression depends on activity dependent accumulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, these studies and data strongly support the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics of RTN and Raphe neurons as reflecting their activity patterns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are many mechanisms by which calcium levels could become dissociated from the firing rate. For example, in some neurons calcium levels may be relatively insensitive to an increase in firing rate due to low calcium current density or a high level of calcium buffering. An increase in firing rate or intracellular acidosis could have a stimulatory effect on calcium extrusion or sequestration. The &quot;adaptation&quot; of calcium levels the authors point out may reflect augmentation of calcium regulation rather than adaptation of firing rate.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we do not think that these points have mechanistic support or evidence to back them:</p><p>1. As Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering is finite, a high buffering capacity might slow the onset of the increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> but would not prevent it from occurring.</p><p>2. Low Ca<sup>2+</sup> current densities would mean that the magnitude of the signal might be small, even too small to be resolved. Cells that did not show appreciable Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the baseline were excluded from our dataset as being uninterpretable.</p><p>3. Extrusion/sequestration rates for Ca<sup>2+</sup> are much slower than entry rates. The electrochemical driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is very high, and channels have much faster transport rates than energy dependent transporters/exchangers. This is apparent in neurons throughout the nervous system where Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients have a very fast onset (reflecting kinetics of entry through a variety of Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable channels -not just voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) and a much slower exponentially decaying phase that reflects sequestration/extrusion processes. This pattern is clearly evident in our own recordings, in which the decay time constant of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients is roughly 2s, and the 10-90% rise time of the transients is roughly 0.5s.</p><p>To specifically address the point about acidosis or some other feature of the hypercapnic stimulus changing Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and thus accounting for the adapting pattern, we have taken example recordings E<sub>A</sub> neurons and tonic firing neurons and plotted individual Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients from before, during and after the hypercapnic episodes. The kinetics of these transients are in effect real-time probes of the entry and extrusion/sequestration rates for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the cell. Neither the decay time constant nor the rise time of these signals in either of these cell types differs between these conditions. For the reviewersâ alternative hypothesis (that the apparent adapting pattern of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is due to changes in influx and efflux rates caused by intracellular acidosis rather than reflecting neuronal firing patterns) to have merit, the decay time of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, which reflects buffering/sequestration/extrusion would have to be faster than the rise time of the transients during the hypercapnic period. Since neither change in an appreciable way, and the decay time constant remains much longer than the rise time, we can confidently discount this alternative explanation. We have added text to pp7 and pp10 and created a new Figure 2âfigure supplement 2 to document this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The response/decay kinetics of GCaMP6s is also a problem in terms of encoding the temporal characteristics of neuronal firing (e.g., Dana et al. Nat Methods 16, 649-657, 2019). A disconnect between calcium levels and firing rate could also explain why some neurons did not have a linear response to a graded increase to CO2 â their firing rate may have increased linearly while calcium levels fell off.</p></disp-quote><p>The Dana et al. paper does not support this contention. Dana et al. show that while GCaMP6s cannot accurately resolve <italic>individual</italic> action potentials, it does nevertheless provide a smoothed envelope that reflects the firing dynamics. This is analogous to passing a high frequency electrical signal through a low pass filter. Dana et al. do not provide evidence of a disconnect between Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels as measured by GCaMP6s and firing rates (they show quite the opposite: that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal parallels the firing rates). Other papers agree on the difficulty of resolving single action potentials but also document the ability of GCaMP6 to accurately represent multispike firing dynamics in a variety of neurons and model systems (including zebrafish and <italic>Drosophila</italic>) â PMIDs 23868258, 33683198. As the responses of chemosensory neurons to hypercapnia are multispiking events, our use of GCaMP6 as an indicator of activity in these cells seems entirely appropriate given the current state of genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors say they &quot;have never attempted to convert Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to firing rate,&quot; but they lead the reader to believe that their measurements reflect neuronal firing rate/patterns throughout the paper by describing their measurements of calcium fluorescence as &quot;activity of neurons&quot;, &quot;neuronal firing&quot;, &quot;activity patterns&quot;, or &quot;activity.&quot; Neurons were categorized as Inhibited, Excited, or Tonic. Neurons are described as being &quot;silenced.&quot; All of these terms lead the reader to think that the measurements presented are reliable surrogates of neuronal electrophysiological activity. The authors state that &quot;the use of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a proxy for activity is widely accepted.&quot; That doesn't make it right. The authors need to be more precise in their terminology throughout the text. They are measuring calcium signals, not necessarily firing rate/activity patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reviewed how we have presented the data, which is in line with the great consensus in the field that Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels do reflect a reasonable proxy of firing rates and activity patterns. We note that throughout the Results section we refer to Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity patterns (e.g., pp 5-6). We have extensively discussed the limitations in the Discussion. In the response above we have shown by reference to the literature and further analysis of our own data that these points of the reviewers lack evidential support. We have added some further references in the limitations section on pp10 to support these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors' responses have not adequately addressed the major and overarching concerns that: a) the recordings were ultimately from unidentified RTN neurons even if we allow that they were in the region of the RTN; and, b) we cannot know whether the recorded responses were a true characteristic CO2 response of the recorded neurons without repeated measurements in the same neurons (as opposed to some random fluorescence changes that were found represented among the population of recorded cells in different mice). The authors need to emphasize these problems more clearly in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased that the reviewers now accept that we recorded from neurons in the RTN.</p><p>In response to (b): from a statistical viewpoint, repeated recordings from a single cell would be regarded as pseudoreplication that tells nothing about the activity of a wider sample. We have used genuine replication by recording from separate neurons from separate mice. We have found consistency of activity patterns that is time-linked to the hypercapnic stimulus between recording sessions and between mice. This tells us that these cells exist and that our sample recordings represent the population.</p><p>To turn argument around, let us suppose that we were trying to claim that the observed responses were random and did not reflect any meaningful biological reality. The problem is that we would then have to âexplain awayâ the following observations: the patterns are time locked to the stimulus; they are seen in multiple recording sessions from the same mouse; and they are seen in different mice recorded at different times. We would argue that it would be extremely unlikely that this alternative interpretation would gain significant support from our scientific peers.</p><p>In summary, we believe that we have already devoted considerable time and space to addressing these concerns by adding new data and figures in the two previous revisions. We also note that we have been extremely transparent and have shown all of our data, allowing readers to assess patterns in our data for themselves. Consequently, we are not aware of any further changes that could meaningfully address this point other than an additional sentence which we have added to the limitations section stating the desirability of repeated recordings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Reviewer #3 still questions the specificity of the NMB immunostaining. While it is appreciated that the authors tried to match their immunolabeling with the Allen Brain Atlas, this is unconvincing and appears to be mostly comparisons of the type of non-specific labeling that is often seen in areas of high cell density (e.g., Figure 2, Figure Suppl. 1, Panel Ei, cortex; Panel Eii, piriform cortex). The most obvious example they provide of &quot;real&quot; strong in situ labeling from the Allen Atlas is in Panel Eii (in the hilus of the dentate gyrus?) â and in this case, the NMB immunostaining they show is not any stronger than the non-specific labeling noted above.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously found the Allen Brain Atlas to be quite accurate in its localisation of a number of other markers and have no reason to believe that it does not represent NMB expression accurately. Most relevant for our study is that the neurons stained in the RTN with this antibody have the positions and cell body shapes and punctate staining pattern that have been previously described with use of FISH (PMID 29066557). This suggests that in this area, at least, it is staining the correct cells. As we are not using this antibody to describe a new population of cells but to confirm the location of the lens and that we are indeed imaging from the RTN, in conjunction with other landmarks and ChAT staining we suggest that this level of verification is adequate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other specific issues that should be addressed:</p><p>1) Abstract, lines 26-28.

The calcium signal measurements presented in this paper and summarized in panel C do not directly provide information on neuronal firing patterns and associated synaptic interactions implied in these diagrams. Given the uncertainty, the authors should emphasize that the regional interactions postulated are based on what is generally proposed in the literature, and it is currently unknown if any specific type of neuron that the authors have classified from the calcium signals and represented in the diagram has the connections indicated. Some readers may find these diagrams excessively speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we have not identified synaptic connections from these neurons and that the interconnections are purely literature based we have reworded the legend and text on pp15 to bring this out more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Line 619: &quot;The neuronal responses to CO2 were more heterogeneous in both the RTN and Raphe than would be expected from the prior literature&quot; should be clarified to state that &quot;The neuronal responses to CO2 were heterogeneous for unidentified neurons in the RTN and for serotonergic neurons in Raphe.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Reworded.</p></body></sub-article></article>
