To scale the analysis of synaptic connectivity, fluorescent protein-based techniques have been established, ranging from the labeling of specific pre- or post-synaptic components of chemical or electrical synapses to transsynaptic proximity labeling technology such as GRASP and iBLINC. In this paper, we describe WormPsyQi, a generalizable image analysis pipeline that automatically quantifies synaptically localized fluorescent signals in a high-throughput and robust manner, with reduced human bias. We also present a resource of 30 transgenic strains that label chemical or electrical synapses throughout the nervous system of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, using CLA-1, RAB-3, GRASP (chemical synapses), or innexin (electrical synapse) reporters. We show that WormPsyQi captures synaptic structures in spite of substantial heterogeneity in neurite morphology, fluorescence signal, and imaging parameters. We use these toolkits to quantify multiple obvious and subtle features of synapses – such as number, size, intensity, and spatial distribution of synapses – in datasets spanning various regions of the nervous system, developmental stages, and sexes. Although the pipeline is described in the context of synapses, it may be utilized for other ‘punctate’ signals, such as fluorescently tagged neurotransmitter receptors and cell adhesion molecules, as well as proteins in other subcellular contexts. By overcoming constraints on time, sample size, cell morphology, and phenotypic space, this work represents a powerful resource for further analysis of synapse biology in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic connectivity</kwd><kwd>synaptic development</kwd><kwd>synaptic dimorphisms</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1707401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hobert</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation Simons Southeast Center for Mathematics and Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1764406</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An imaging pipeline together with a collection of transgenic nematode strains provide a strategy to visualize and properly quantify synaptic connectivity in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> brain.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> was the first organism for which a full nervous system connectome was established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">White et al., 1986</xref>). Connectomes now exist for both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cook et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hall and Russell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">White et al., 1986</xref>), the pharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cook et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertson and Thomson, 1976</xref>), for different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brittin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>), and for the dauer diapause stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yim et al., 2023</xref>). However, due to the laboriousness of acquiring and analyzing electron microscopy (EM) images and the resulting small sample sizes, our understanding of many aspects of synaptic connectivity has remained limited. For example, we are only beginning to understand the extent of developmental and inter-individual variability in synaptic connectivity and adjacency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cook et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brittin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>), but we remain much in the dark of how exactly external or internal factors establish, alter, and maintain the synaptic connectome. While progress in CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering and earlier methods continue to increase the array of mutants available to a <italic>C. elegans</italic> geneticist, a lack of synaptic fluorescent reporters and difficulty in scoring them remain a bottleneck for large-scale mutant analyses. This is especially true in the synapse-dense regions of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system, such as the nerve ring.</p><p>It has, therefore, been of paramount interest to establish alternative means to visualize synaptic connectivity that would allow us to score larger sample sizes in living animals. Classically, the study of <italic>C. elegans</italic> synapse biology has been aided by reporters in which various synaptic components are fluorescently labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). For chemical synapses, these include reporters labeling pre- and post-synaptic proteins – such as SNB-1/VAMP, RAB-3, SYD-2/Liprin, CLA-1/Piccolo, and GLR-1/AMPAR – fused with a fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xuan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mahoney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yeh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shen and Bargmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhen and Jin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nonet, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rongo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jorgensen et al., 1995</xref>) and split-fluorophore transsynaptic technology such as GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners (GRASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Feinberg et al., 2008</xref>) and other variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Feng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Feng et al., 2019</xref>), and Biotin Labeling of Intercellular Contacts (iBLINC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Desbois et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the case of electrical synapses, innexins can be endogenously tagged with fluorescent proteins to visualize homo- or heteromeric electrical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hendi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These tools have been somewhat constrained by the relative paucity of cell-specific promoters, but recent single-cell RNA-sequencing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Packer et al., 2019</xref>) have yielded novel cell-specific promoters for driving fluorescent proteins in neurons which previously lacked sparse-expressing genes. Moreover, the relative ease of labeling endogenous genetic loci with a fluorophore using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eroglu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ghanta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ghanta and Mello, 2020</xref>) has led to an increase in reporters with fluorophore-tagged proteins localized at chemical and electrical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lipton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pinan-Lucarré et al., 2014</xref>). With these advances over the years, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> community has built a growing, but still very limited, collection of synaptic reporters. These reporters have been instrumental in studying synapse biology in abundant paradigms including, but not restricted to, synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mizumoto et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kurshan and Shen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jin, 2005</xref>), sexual dimorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pechuk et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Salzberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bayer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bayer and Hobert, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cook et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hart and Hobert, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Weinberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oren-Suissa et al., 2016</xref>), and experience-dependent plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chandra et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bayer and Hobert, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hart and Hobert, 2018</xref>).

By running WormPsyQi on many image datasets of novel and publicly available synaptic reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we show that the pipeline can be generalized to synaptic fluorescent reporters of many types, neurons with diverse morphologies, and images taken by multiple users using different microscopes and imaging parameters.</p><p>The toolkits described in this paper (strains and imaging pipeline) mitigate several ubiquitous problems related to manual counting of puncta in large datasets. These include, but are not limited to, difficulty in scoring synapses in synapse-dense regions such as the somatic and pharyngeal nerve rings, user bias, human error, problems stemming from scoring images with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or in regions with high background autofluorescence, laboriousness of scoring large datasets and puncta features such as size and intensity, and inter-dataset variability. We anticipate that the toolkits presented here will provide a motivation for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> research community to continue to build more synaptic reporters and to engage in an analysis of the vast number of presently unstudied synaptic connections in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generating a semi-automated and robust pipeline for scoring synapses</title><p>A key advantage that fluorescent reporters provide over traditional EM-based approaches is that they allow a high-throughput and quick visualization of synapses. However, an ensuing limitation is the quantification of synapse number and ultrastructure. These include not only obvious features such as the number of synaptic puncta, but also at first indiscernible features such as relative size, fluorescence intensity, and spatial distribution of puncta along a neuron’s processes.</p><p>Manual synaptic puncta quantification in large image datasets can be problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">San-Miguel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Crane et al., 2012</xref>). Firstly, it is tedious and low in throughput; for neurons with high synapse density and complex neurite morphologies in three-dimensional (3D) space, it can take up to several hours to quantify a dataset of typical size. Secondly, manual quantification requires some <italic>a priori</italic> information about the region of interest (ROI), thus discouraging observation outside the ROI that may be of relevance in different genetic conditions or environmental backgrounds. In addition, subtle features may escape manual quantification altogether, possibly hindering their use as a proxy for measuring neuron-specific synapse properties and impeding a comprehensive understanding of pathways that mediate precise synapse distribution. Lastly, manual quantification introduces human error and bias in cases where the fluorescent signal is dim, synapse density is high, the SNR is poor, and neurons have complex morphologies that obstruct manual counting in a 3D image stack. These problems are further compounded by dozens of labs generating various synaptic reporters and using different microscopes and imaging parameters. All these currently prevent datasets from being easily interpreted, reproduced, shared, and reused. These reasons also partially explain why we cannot rely exclusively on existing image analysis software optimized for other types of datasets or other model organisms.</p><p>To address some of these challenges, we have developed a semi-automated computational pipeline, WormPsyQi that scores synaptic puncta in <italic>C. elegans</italic> in a high-throughput manner and with reduced bias. The pipeline is accompanied by a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to seamlessly move through each step and process large volumes of data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which greatly reduces the barrier to use. WormPsyQi consists of five key steps: neurite mask segmentation (optional), synapse segmentation, validation and correction, re-labeling and training (optional), and quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). First, we generate a neurite mask. Many image datasets include channels for both synaptic and cytoplasmic markers, and the latter helps exclude noise or autofluorescence signals from other tissues (e.g. the intestine). For neurite segmentation, we modified a convolutional neural network architecture, U-Net (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Guo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Guo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ronneberger et al., 2015</xref>), to robustly segment the neurite and soma, and create a mask that helps in specifying the ROI in which synapses are later segmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Masking prior to synapse segmentation is critical if the SNR is poor; it also significantly reduces the overall image processing time by constraining synapse segmentation within the neurite mask.</p><p>After masking, a local feature-based pixel classification model segments synaptic pixels inside the neurite mask (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In the absence of a mask, the pipeline will indiscriminately segment all puncta within the image. We provide both pre-trained (or default) models and an option for users to train custom synapse segmentation models. Image datasets from four diverse synaptic reporters were used to train four independent default models optimized to detect (1) small synapses (1–3 pixels radius) with low SNR (e.g. puncta with similar intensity and morphology as autofluorescence noise in surrounding tissue), (2) small synapses with high SNR, (3) medium-sized synapses (3–10 pixels radius), and (4) diffuse (&gt;10 pixels radius) signal (see Methods for more detail). These pre-trained models can reliably cover various types of reporters, cells, and imaging parameters as discussed in later sections. To facilitate the model choice, there is an option for users to test all models on representative images, validate which model works best, and proceed with processing the entire dataset using the optimal model. In addition to this, the GUI enables users to review and edit the synapse segmentation results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), as well as to train a custom model by using user-generated training data (coupled images and manual annotations of these images – for details, see Github documentation). In our experience, a minimum of one fully labeled image stack in the training set is sufficient for the segmentation accuracy to converge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>WormPsyQi robustly segments neurites and quantifies synapses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A flowchart of the WormPsyQi pipeline.

Training models were constructed from subsets of the dataset and their performance was tested on the remaining images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We selected the intersection over union (IoU) between expert labels and WormPsyQi’s prediction compared to inter-expert label similarity to benchmark the segmentation performance. Notably, the IoU between WormPsyQi’s segmentation and the original labeler’s annotation was significantly higher than the inter-expert IoU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, columns 2 and 3), indicating that WormPsyQi allows standardized quantification of synaptic features, which human annotators cannot. Importantly, our results show that the WormPsyQi model trained on one image is as good as the one trained on five, indicating that even without using a pre-trained model, WormPsyQi can save time spent on annotating synaptic images. When comparing the predictions of WormPsyQi (trained with one expert’s labeling) to the labels of other experts, the IoU scores were found to be comparable to the inter-expert IoU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, columns 4 and 5).</p><p>To assess the WormPsyQi vs. human labeler effect size, we next compared the discrepancy between WormPsyQi scoring and scoring by two independent human labelers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Based on our analysis of I5p::GFP::CLA-1 and M4p::GFP::RAB-3, we found that the effect size was reporter-dependent: for I5 CLA-1, where the puncta were discrete and SNR high, inter-labeler discrepancy and WormPsyQi vs. human (labeler 1 or 2) discrepancy were low. Conversely, the discrepancy across all three scoring methods was high for M4p::GFP::RAB-3, which is a synapse-dense strain with less discrete signal; in this case, semi-automated scoring averaged out human-to-human scoring differences, but did not significantly improve the segmentation.</p><p>Lastly, we compared the quantification of additional puncta features such as puncta volume and distribution along the neurite, and overall processing time. To do so, we focused on the ASK GFP::CLA-1 reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We found that the difference between quantification of puncta number, volume and distribution using WormPsyQi vs. two independent human annotators is statistically insignificant, while WormPsyQi substantially reduced quantification time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4E</xref>). This is especially true for quantifying subtle features such as size, volume, and intensity, which may not be immediately obvious features and are much more laborious to quantify manually compared to puncta number, because pixel-wise annotation is necessary. Our analysis, therefore, suggests that the algorithm is competent in recapitulating human labeling (in some cases averaging inter-labeler variability) of not just puncta number but also other features, significantly expedites scoring, and can be used to replace manual scoring. The robustness of puncta quantification is further corroborated by comparing WormPsyQi vs. manual quantification for many strains in ensuing sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>WormPsyQi validates sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity</title><p>To demonstrate that our pipeline can quantify synaptic puncta in a robust manner, we initially set out to validate sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system. Whole-nervous system EM reconstruction in <italic>C. elegans</italic> adult males and hermaphrodites shows that many ‘sex-shared’ neurons – neurons present in both sexes – display sex specific, that is, sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cook et al., 2019</xref>). In previous studies, a small subset of these dimorphic synapses was visualized with GRASP- or iBLINC-based transgenic reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pechuk et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Salzberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cook et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Weinberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bayer and Hobert, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oren-Suissa et al., 2016</xref>). By scaling the analyses, presently extremely laborious with EM, these reporters have been indispensable for not only substantiating EM data, but also for understanding the molecular determinants underlying dimorphic circuits and the pathways mediating plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Goodwin and Hobert, 2021</xref> and references therein). In addition, the ability to visualize a specific synapse across many animals continues to reveal new insights such as the extent of variability in synaptic number and spatial distribution across animals, which was previously unappreciated in the absence of tools and sufficient EM samples to study it.</p><p>To validate these findings using WormPsyQi, we honed in on four synaptic connections between sex-shared neurons: PHB&gt;AVA, PHA&gt;AVG, PHB&gt;AVG, and ADL&gt;AVA. In all cases, previous studies have shown sex-specific differences in these connections after sexual maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cook et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oren-Suissa et al., 2016</xref>). We show here that WormPsyQi reliably validates previous observations: synapses between ADL&gt;AVA, PHB&gt;AVA, and PHA&gt;AVG are sexually dimorphic, such that synapse number in adult males is less compared to hermaphrodites, and PHB&gt;AVG synapses are less in adult hermaphrodites compared to males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref>). An added advantage compared to previous manual puncta quantification was that WormPsyQi expedited the quantification by largely automating the process and, importantly, relied on a single pre-trained segmentation classifier to robustly quantify synaptic number across all four reporters. Together, the performance on these test cases encouraged us to further explore the efficacy of our pipeline in a more systematic manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>An expanded toolkit to visualize synapses in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>Having established that WormPsyQi works on a handful of synaptic reporters, we sought to further explore its efficacy in facilitating unbiased synapse quantification. The aforementioned sexually dimorphic reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) are all GRASP- or iBLINC-based and target only five neuron classes – most making synapses in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> tail – of the total 116 sex-shared classes in hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">White et al., 1986</xref>). We asked if our pipeline could quantify various types of punctate signals across other reporter types and in other regions of the nervous system, particularly the nerve ring, which comprises the bulk of the hermaphroditic <italic>C. elegans</italic> connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brittin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cook et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">White et al., 1986</xref>). Despite this preponderance, the nerve ring has been remarkably under-studied largely due to a lack of tools available to visualize and reliably quantify synapses in the most complex and synapse-dense region of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system. This is generally true for synapses in the somatic or central nervous system (CNS), compared to neuromuscular junctions, which are easier to visualize and have more available reporters.</p><p>To broaden the existing resource of synaptic reporter strains, we generated novel synaptic marker strains. These include cell-specific CLA-1 reporters for eight neuron classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and five new GRASP reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) which label specific synapses between multiple neuron classes. Considering both new and previously existing reporters, we describe synaptic reporters for almost 30 neuron classes in both the central and pharyngeal (=enteric nervous systems) of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Many of the new reporters described here target neurons that make synapses in the nerve ring, including cell-specific reporters for IL1, ASK, ADL, RIB, AIA, BDU, HSN (first published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Leyva-Díaz and Hobert, 2022</xref>), and IL2 (first published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cros and Hobert, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These efforts relied on the presence of cell-specific promoters driving GFP expression. The recent availability of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) data driven by the CeNGEN project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>) opens up opportunities to gain even broader coverage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>WormPsyQi is generalizable across a wide array of synaptic reporters in the CNS</title><p>Previous synapse quantification approaches in <italic>C. elegans</italic> focused on neurons with relatively simple trajectories along the anterior–posterior axis in one plane on the dorso-ventral axis (e.g. <italic>en passant</italic> synapses along the ventral nerve cord). These include semi-automated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">San-Miguel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Crane et al., 2012</xref>) and manual approaches such as counting synaptic puncta by hand or drawing plot profiles (line scans) of fluorescent signals along a neurite using open-source image processing software such as Fiji/ImageJ, often combined with synapse enrichment quantification as assessed by fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kurshan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xuan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dittman and Kaplan, 2006</xref>). These methods are well suited for quantifying synapses along linear neurites, but pose problems in neurons with morphologically complex anatomies in 3D space. We thus wanted our pipeline to be able to easily quantify synapses in other types of neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>In addition, a key observation based on many synaptic reporters imaged by different researchers using diverse microscopes, and across different days, life stages, and sexes, is that images collected from these reporters are perceptibly heterogeneous depending on the type of fluorophore-tagged synaptic protein, choice of promoter driving the fluorophore, and the labeling method used. For instance, cell-specific RAB-3 reporters have a more diffuse synaptic signal compared to the punctate signal in CLA-1 reporters for the same neuron, as shown for the neuron pair ASK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and observed previously in other neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cook et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lipton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xuan et al., 2017</xref>). This is intuitive based on the distinct localization and function of RAB-3, a presynaptic vesicle protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nonet et al., 1997</xref>), and CLA-1/Piccolo, an active zone scaffolding protein that recruits synapse vesicles to release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xuan et al., 2017</xref>). We note that this is not a consequence of tagging RAB-3 on a specific terminal, since both N- and C-terminal RAB-3 fusions manifest more diffuse signals compared to CLA-1. While this may not be a problem for neurons or regions with low synapse density (e.g. ASK RAB-3 and CLA-1 puncta number are similar as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), it poses challenges for synapse-dense cases such as AIB and SAA, where WormPsyQi is unable to reliably segment puncta using any of the four pre-trained models. Lastly, within a reporter type, fluorescent signals appear similar, as demonstrated by the similarity of punctate fluorescent signal between various CLA-1 reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This is useful because it allows the use of a single pre-trained model for multiple use cases.</p><p>In contrast to the relative signal homogeneity in presynaptic fluorophore-tagged reporters of the same kind, signals across reporters that make use of transsynaptic technologies can vary. Fluorescent signals from GRASP and iBLINC reporters appear different from other reporters and is wide-ranging across neurons or synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As previously reported, this is likely due to transsynaptic labeling methods being more sensitive to the choice of promoters used to drive split-fluorophore fragments, amount of injected reporter DNA, extrachromosomal vs. integrated nature of transgenes, and imaging conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oren-Suissa et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, quantifying the signal of such reporter lines has been challenging and requires expert knowledge, which is not always transferable across researchers and labs introducing human bias and error.</p><p>To address these concerns, we used WormPsyQi to quantify puncta in representative datasets for many different presynaptic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and transsynaptic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) reporters for neurons in the CNS. We first trained reporter type-specific synapse classifiers (see Methods) to aid quantification so that an average user does not need to perform the tedious step of labeling and training datasets for common types of reporters available in the community. Next, we systematically ran the image datasets through our pipeline, making use of neurite masking (where available) prior to synapse segmentation and quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Analyzing many reporters further validated that WormPsyQi was able to detect synaptic puncta with minimal human contribution and across a wide range of reporter types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that WormPsyQi quantified fluorescent puncta accurately, we compared its results with manual quantification for a subset of reporters analyzed and found that in most datasets, the difference between WormPsyQi and human annotation was statistically insignificant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In cases where our pipeline could not recapitulate manual scoring, the masking step was either skipped prior to segmentation (PHB CLA-1) or synapse density was too high (IL1 CLA-1). In the case of IL1-expressed CLA-1, training a reporter-specific classifier improved the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Generally, having a cytoplasmic reporter in the background of the synaptic reporter enhanced performance; it was also a crucial step in preventing synapse mis-annotation in regions with high background fluorescence intensity such as the tail, where adjacent intestinal autofluorescence typically masks bona fide synaptic signal. This is demonstrated in the case of PHB&gt;AVA GRASP puncta quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), where WormPsyQi erroneously segments gut autofluorescence puncta as synapses in the absence of a cytoplasmic reporter.</p><p>We also found that CLA-1 reporters were overall a superior marker compared to RAB-3 reporters for the same neuron, as shown for ASK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, C</xref>). In both cases, WormPsyQi could segment puncta, but the signal was much more discrete, and synapses were resolved better in the ASK CLA-1 reporter. In the case of ASK, overall puncta number in L4 animals was similar in both RAB-3 and CLA-1 reporters but the mean puncta area was much greater in the case of RAB-3, corroborating the diffuse signal, which poses quantification challenges for neurons with greater synapse densities, for example AIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We also note that the difference in diffuse vs. discrete signal could not be attributed to the transgenic reporter type (integrant vs. extrachromosomal) since both types of CLA-1 reporters had discrete, smaller puncta compared to RAB-3; owing to variable expressivity in the CLA-1 extrachromosomal reporter, however, fewer puncta could be quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Lastly, in some reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), such as those for RME-specific SNB-1, SAA-specific RAB-3, and AIB-specific RAB-3, WormPsyQi could not effectively segment synapses because the signal was too diffuse and synapse density, in the case of AIB, too high. Again, relying on alternative reporters where possible, such as the CLA-1-based reporter for AIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which is much better resolved and has more distinguishable puncta, is recommended.</p><p>In some cases (e.g. AIB&gt;SAA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), there were discrepancies between WormPsyQi and manual quantification because the signal intensity of puncta was too low to be quantified comprehensively using our pipeline. In cases where these issues cannot be resolved during data acquisition, further improvement may be achieved by using alternative microscopy methods, reporter types, or brighter fluorophores. We also note that in several cases, GRASP quantification differed from EM scoring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the absence of a comparable EM sample size in any paradigm tested, it is impossible to assess whether the difference is statistically significant. We note that differences between light-microscopy-based imaging and EM are anticipated particularly in synapse-dense regions where our fluorescent reporter-based imaging cannot resolve individual synapses as well as EM analysis does.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>WormPsyQi performs robustly in morphologically diverse pharyngeal neurons</title><p>In addition to the somatic or CNS described thus far, <italic>C. elegans</italic> contains a pharyngeal or enteric nervous system (ENS) which resides entirely in the pharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avery and You, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mango, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertson and Thomson, 1976</xref>). Unlike the CNS, the dynamics of synaptic connectivity in the ENS are even less explored. Previous EM reconstructions of the pharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cook et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertson and Thomson, 1976</xref>) serve as excellent starting points but, again, we are confronted with limitations such as a very small sample size and a lack of means to study how synapses in the pharynx are established and altered in larval development, as well as under various perturbations.</p><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> pharynx constitutes 14 neuron classes, and like the ENS in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brehmer, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Furness, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Costa et al., 2000</xref>), there is substantial morphological heterogeneity among these neuron classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertson and Thomson, 1976</xref>). In addition, some neurons show variability in branching and synapses, both within a bilateral pair and across individuals, such as in the case of M3 L/R pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertson and Thomson, 1976</xref>). The diversity and variability in form pose an additional challenge for image processing, particularly in masking neurites using conventional software. We thus asked if WormPsyQi could create neurite masks of diverse pharyngeal reporters, and subsequently score colocalized synaptic puncta. Cell-specific CLA-1::GFP synaptic reporters of several pharyngeal neuron classes were recently developed, namely, for NSM, I1, I2, I5, and MC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cook et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, we describe here two RAB-3::GFP reporters which label presynaptic RAB-3 in neurons M3 and M4 to altogether cover seven neuron classes in the pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We also analyzed a pan-pharyngeal reporter in which presynaptic CLA-1 in all 14 pharyngeal neuron classes is visualized with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vidal et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Our analyses show that WormPsyQi can robustly segment pharyngeal neurites and generally performs well in quantifying synapses, as with the CNS. This is shown by the comparison between manual and WormPsyQi counts for each reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–F</xref>). In reporters for neurons I5, MC, NSM, and I2, we found no significant difference between puncta count measured by the pipeline vs. a human annotator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). In two reporters, there was a discrepancy between WormPsyQi and human quantification. In the case of the M4 RAB-3 reporter, the RAB-3 signal was too diffuse to resolve all puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>); in reporters for neurons with high synapse densities, such as I1-specific CLA-1 reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and pan-pharyngeal CLA-1 reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), some puncta were not detected by the pipeline. In the case of the pan-pharyngeal reporter, WormPsyQi detected most puncta consistently (reflected in varying standard deviation: SD = 4.2 for posterior bulb, SD = 29.2 for total count) in the synapse-sparse posterior bulb compared to overall puncta for all pharyngeal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We expect that the presence of a sparse cytoplasmic marker in the background – which would allow using sparse neurite masking before synapse segmentation in WormPsyQi – or alternative labeling strategies would improve results. Finally, we note that there is a marked discrepancy between puncta count in our reporters compared to EM data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), but due to limited EM sample size, such differences are difficult to interpret.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>WormPsyQi can quantify and scale the study of electrical synapses</title><p>Although connectomics has historically been biased toward chemical synapses, expression studies on the localization of key electrical synapse components – innexins in invertebrates and connexins/pannexins in vertebrates – suggest the presence of complex electrical connectivity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ammer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feigenspan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lee et al., 2003</xref>).

Most studies describing synapse addition use EM-based approaches and rely on a small sample size. An obvious pitfall of this is that resulting low-throughput datasets preclude distinguishing synapse plasticity across life stages from baseline inter-individual variability. While expanding EM analysis to study larger sample sizes would be an ideal solution, simply relying on transgenic reporters and the high-throughput analyses they enable could facilitate studying synaptic plasticity in light of variability.</p><p>In this paper, we used our toolkits to explore how synaptic puncta change in a small subset of neurons by comparing the number of puncta between early larval and adult stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). From our analysis, we found that generally neurons in the CNS progressively add synapses at pre-existing sites throughout larval development up until adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–E</xref>). For synapses studied in detail (ASK&gt;AIA, PHB&gt;AVA, and AIB&gt;SAA visualized with GRASP, and ASK CLA-1), puncta number steadily increases between early larval and L4 or adult stages. In the case of ASK, synapse addition – shown for all presynaptic specializations visualized with GFP::CLA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) and for ASK&gt;AIA synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), AIA being ASK’s major post-synaptic partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">White et al., 1986</xref>) – occurs roughly in scale with the increase in neurite length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) in the nerve ring; specifically, there is a ~twofold increase across all three measures. In a previous study, a comparative analysis of the nerve ring from EM samples spanning multiple larval- and adult-staged <italic>C. elegans</italic> showed that system-wide neurite length increases with the length of the animal and that synapses are added progressively, thereby maintaining overall synapse density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>). Since this was done on a systemic scale, albeit with a small sample size, the study noted that synapse addition was likely a cell-specific feature with some neurons adding or pruning more synapses than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, ‘hub’ neurons added disproportionately more synapses across development. Similarly, a subset of neuron classes that undergo stage-specific plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>) and/or synaptic pruning with the onset of sexual maturation (some examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) remove synapses in a stage- and cell-specific manner.</p><p>Uniform synapse addition has also been noted in sparse EM-based comparative connectomic studies in other systems, such as the nociceptive circuits in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> between first and third instar larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gerhard et al., 2017</xref>), motoneurons in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> across larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Couton et al., 2015</xref>), antennal lobe in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> between late pupa and adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Devaud et al., 2003</xref>), and primary somatosensory and visual cortical regions in mice and rhesus macaque during early postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wildenberg et al., 2023</xref>). Importantly, since our approach is high throughput, it allows us to ascertain synapse addition while accounting for inter-individual variability in synapse number in the reporters studied. This is a key point, which remains hard to address with current EM output, but focusing on a ‘core’ set of synapses present across EM samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cook et al., 2023</xref>) presents an opportunity for statistically powered analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Quantitative analysis of synapses across development in the ENS</title><p>To broaden our analysis of developmental plasticity in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we next focused on neurons in the pharynx, or ENS. The length of the pharynx from the tip of the corpus to the end of the terminal bulb increases twofold (from 60 to 130 μm, roughly) between L1 and adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shibata et al., 2016</xref>). This elongation is modest relative to the overall ~4.5-fold increase (from 250 to 1150 μm, roughly) in the length of the animal across the same developmental window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shibata et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). To investigate how neuronal processes and presynaptic specializations of pharyngeal neurons scale with the elongation of the whole organ, we quantified neurite length (denoted by ‘Length of ROI’) and the number of fluorescently tagged CLA-1 or RAB-3 puncta in the pharyngeal neuron classes MC, M3, I2, M4, and NSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–F</xref>). In this case, puncta were counted both manually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) and using WormPsyQi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Due to high synapse density and lack of or faint expression of a cytoplasmic reporter in most strains analyzed, WormPsyQi undercounted puncta in early larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, trends in developmental plasticity between manual and automated quantification were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We found that in contrast to neurons in the CNS, neurons in the ENS show striking disparity in synapse addition across neuron classes. The number of CLA-1/RAB-3 puncta in neurons MC, I2, and M3 remains constant (neurons MC and I2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A, D</xref>) or increases modestly compared to the elongation of the pharynx (neuron M3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B</xref>) between early larval stages (L1 or L2) and adulthood. This is in spite of the neurite length scaling roughly in line with the length of the pharynx in all three cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–D</xref>). In other words, synapse density in these neurons decreases across development. We note that in some neurons, such as M3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertson and Thomson, 1976</xref>), it is possible that the large variability in synapse number across individuals and within a bilateral pair, at a given stage in development, may complicate comparative analysis between stages. Furthermore, since our analysis does not include quantification of neuronal adjacency across development, we cannot rule out the possibility that physical contact within neighborhoods of pharyngeal neurons, which make synapses with one another is not scaling with the elongation of the pharynx or the whole animal. EM reconstructions, because of their often system-wide nature, may be better suited for this type of analysis since it yields quantification of both the connectome and the adjacencies, or ‘contactome’, between synaptic partners.</p><p>In contrast to neurons that show variable synapse density across developmental stages, we found two neuron classes, M4 and NSM, where CLA-1/RAB-3 puncta are added proportionately with increasing neurite length and overall pharynx elongation across development (‘Total count’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Our CLA-1-based data for NSM also corroborate previous findings of the developmental trajectory of NSM’s synaptic branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Axäng et al., 2008</xref>). Based on previous EM studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cook et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertson and Thomson, 1976</xref>), these puncta largely correspond to neuromuscular junctions, many of which arise post-embryonically and can be considered somewhat separate from the ‘core’ pharyngeal connectome established in the embryo which seems more static. To take a deeper look, we calculated M4 and NSM puncta number separately in the pharyngeal nerve ring and isthmus, and found synapse addition between L1 and adulthood in both regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E, F</xref>). Given the density of puncta in the nerve ring, it is ultimately difficult to discern changes in neuron-to-neuron synapses made by these neurons by relying solely on CLA-1/RAB-3 reporters. Synapse-specific reporters built using GRASP/iBLINC or temporal EM analysis will offer greater resolution needed to fully understand developmental plasticity in these synapse-dense regions. In conclusion, developmental synapse addition appears to differ between the ENS and CNS, as suggested by the lesser increase in synapse number in pharyngeal neurons relative to somatic neurons in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Using WormPsyQi to extract subcellular information of synapse distribution</title><p>Next, we exploited WormPsyQi to extract subcellular information of synapse distribution. To this end, we quantified spatial positions of presynaptic specializations in neurons PHA, AIB, and ASK as a proof of principle (see Methods). We found that the presynaptic reporter data recapitulated expected subcellular distribution patterns in all three neurons analyzed. Previous EM data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cook et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">White et al., 1986</xref>) show that in PHA neurons, presynaptic sites are concentrated – and uniformly distributed – in the axonal region anterior to the branch point with close to no synapse posterior to it; our PHA-specific RAB-3 reporter recapitulates this topological distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Taking advantage of our sizeable dataset, we took the analysis a step further and measured the probability of finding a synapse at a particular location along the axon, thus quantitatively showing the distribution of stereotyped (high probability density) and variable or noisy (low probability density) sites; we found that distribution was indeed more or less uniform in the case of PHA in spite of inter-individual variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We performed a similar analysis on CLA-1-based reporters for neurons AIB and ASK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). AIB’s axons occupy two distinct neighborhoods of the nerve ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moyle et al., 2021</xref>), anterior and posterior, with a majority of presynaptic sites localizing in the anterior region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sengupta et al., 2021</xref>). Both RAB-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sengupta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and CLA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10B</xref>) reporters for AIB qualitatively show this distribution. Quantification of topological synapse distribution within the anterior axon in a representative population revealed that synapse density is sparse in the ventral regions, but increases gradually as the processes travel to the crossover point at the dorsal midline, with highest density proximal to it. We also observed widespread variability in puncta size that could not be correlated with spatial location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Lastly, in the case of ASK neurons, EM data show (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">White et al., 1986</xref>) distinct regions along the axons where synapses localize. Our RAB-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and CLA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10C</xref>) recapitulate this distribution pattern in a representative population. We found that ASK axon regions differed markedly in absence or presence of a synapse as well as stereotyped vs. variable sites as denoted by the distinct peaks in the estimated probability density plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>).</p><p>Having earlier quantified the developmental plasticity of synapse number in ASK neurons between L1 and adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), we next asked how the stereotyped topological distribution and synapse ultrastructure features (such as synapse volume) change across development. The total volume of synapses scaled proportionately with synapse addition between L1 and adult animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>), and peaks in probability density were stereotyped as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>), suggesting that these ultrastructure and spatial quantifications followed the same extent of plasticity as the overall number of synapses did. In addition, we plotted the number of puncta against ultrastructure features including mean volume and mean intensity, and found that mean volume, in the ASK&gt;AIA reporter studied in detail, clustered in an age-dependent manner; conversely, the synapse density vs. mean intensity feature space did not show any age-dependent clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Although this analysis is limited to a few neurons, the observation that synapse distribution – for synapses that are present at birth – remains stereotyped is not unanticipated given that, aside from inter-individual variability, the overall architecture of the brain in terms of cell body positions, neuronal morphologies, and relative arrangement of processes within neighborhoods in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are largely maintained across development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moyle et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brittin et al., 2021</xref>). An exception to this organizational stereotypy is a subset of neurons that undergo drastic changes across one or several of these spatial features between L1 and adulthood, such as birth of new neurons (e.g. VNC neuron classes), migration of cell bodies (e.g. Q blast cell progeny), dendritic growth (e.g. FLP, PVD, and NSM), synapse pruning (e.g. sexually dimorphic neurons PHB, AVA, etc.), and neighborhood change (e.g. DD and VD neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Androwski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Emmons, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Howell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Middelkoop and Korswagen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altun and Hall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oren-Suissa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Smith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Axäng et al., 2008</xref>). Overall, precise quantification of synapse distribution patterns and ultrastructural features on a population level, something that can only be done qualitatively by eye, is a useful way of assigning topological information to reporter-based datasets and can provide valuable readouts under various genetic and environmental perturbations, especially in cases where the synapse number may remain unchanged.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Limitations of the toolkits described</title><p>We have demonstrated that the toolkits described here enable a high throughput, unbiased, in-depth, and robust workflow for studying chemical and electrical synapses in <italic>C. elegans</italic> based on analyzing many reporters. However, we note some important limitations. First, the reporters presented here only mark single components of synapses. For instance, the NLG-1-based GRASP reagents used here specifically visualize NLG-1 localization and hence the interpretation of puncta number and features quantified with WormPsyQi only represent NLG-1 features and dynamics. Hence, this approach may not be ideal for neurons which do not endogenously express NLG-1 at the right time or localize it to synaptic domains, therefore under- or mis-representing the synapse population between two neurons.</p><p>Another limitation of the reporters described is that they contain over-expressed multicopy transgenic arrays, which could lead to trafficking and localization artifacts. While some of these problems are mitigated by injecting transgenes at different concentrations, integrating extrachromosomal arrays, and testing multiple gene promoters to drive expression, these measures may fail and may introduce a selection bias. In the case of transsynaptic technologies, where multiple transgenes need to be co-injected, artifacts tend to be harder to identify and eliminate. Comparisons of multiple reporters expressing an identical transgene often show variability across lines picked from the same injection. This holds true for both presynaptic and transsynaptic reporters, although the latter tend to have more variability across lines. This could partially explain discrepancies between data from transgenic reporters and EM reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). With gene editing becoming more accessible, an increasing collection of reporters with endogenously tagged proteins known to localize in specific neurons and at specific sites along a neurite will add to our knowledge of pre- and post-synaptically localized proteins available to visualize synapses. Reporters with endogenously tagged proteins and single-copy transgenes show more consistent expression and spatial localization. Indeed, the use of diverse types of reporters, when available, will be essential to establish the ground-truth and inform mutant analyses for advancing our understanding of synapse biology.</p><p>Lastly, although we have shown that the image analysis pipeline is robust and versatile, it is constrained by the type of images and reporters being analyzed. In cases where the cytoplasmic marker is suboptimal (e.g. dim cytoplasmic marker in CLA-1 reporters for pharyngeal neurons I2 and NSM, or dim signal on the far end of the coverslip while acquiring images), the resulting neurite mask may be discontinuous, resulting in undercounting of synaptic puncta in downstream steps. In such scenarios, it may be useful to visualize the neurite mask in Fiji prior to synapse quantification. Since this technical constraint is independent of WormPsyQi but can directly affect its performance, we suggest resolving this prior to processing an entire dataset. For instance, one can use a stronger promoter to drive the cytoplasmic fluorophore, perform some preprocessing such as deconvolution, denoising, or contrast enhancement prior to synapse segmentation, or skip the masking step altogether and directly segment synapses. The last scenario is particularly useful in cases where the synapse signal is brighter than the cytoplasmic reporter; for our quantification, we have relied on this for several reporters and denoted them with ‘no mask’ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. We note that the processing time is significantly reduced in the presence of a mask, so if the user decides to skip masking prior to synapse segmentation, we suggest cropping the precise ROI so the quantification can be expedited. Also, where the synapse signal is diffuse (e.g. RAB-3 reporters) or synapse density is too high (e.g. CLA-1/RAB-3 reporters for IL2, NSM, AIB, etc., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), quantification can be inaccurate. Analyzing the ‘overlay’ images saved during image processing can reveal problematic regions of interest and help the user decide whether to proceed with quantification. In general, if the fluorescent signal in an image is visibly discrete, WormPsyQi works well in quantifying many discernible and subtle features that would otherwise be tedious or impossible to achieve.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Strains and maintenance</title><p>Wild-type strains used were <italic>C. elegans</italic> Bristol (strain N2).

In the first layer, a set of predefined 2D and 3D local filters are applied to each pixel to generate a feature vector. The first-layer classifier then estimates the probability that a pixel belongs to a synapse based on this feature vector. In the second layer, the probability estimations of a pixel and its nearby pixels are added to the first layer’s feature vector to create an extended vector. This extended vector is then fed into the second-layer classifier to determine whether the pixel belongs to a synapse. Optionally, the binary neurite mask from the neuron segmentation step is used to filter out the false-positive pixels that are not in the vicinity of synapse-forming regions. Although we primarily used the Random Forest (RF) for the classifiers in this paper, WormPsyQi provides RF, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron as options for training a new model with the GUI. While SVM is effective in many different machine learning applications and generally less prone to overfitting with a small dataset, it is sensitive to noise and its fit time complexity is more than quadratic, making it less ideal for large training datasets. During training, grid search hyperparameter optimization with fivefold cross-validation is used. For prediction, if the target image has a neurite mask segmented in the previous step, only the pixels in the mask are sampled to be predicted by the trained synapse segmentation model; otherwise, all pixels are subject to prediction. The local and probability features are extracted similarly to the training step, and pixels outside of the neurite mask are automatically classified as background.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6-2"><title>Training data</title><p>One or more pairs of a fluorescent microscopy image and its corresponding binary label image are required to train the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

In the first step, all positive pixels and a small portion of negative pixels near the positive ones are selected as a training set. Local features of these pixels are extracted and fed along with the label to train the first-layer classifier. Since only a small portion of negative pixels spatially close to the positive pixels is included in the initial training dataset, the first-layer classifier is particularly prone to type I error after this step. To resolve this issue, more negative pixels are added to the training dataset in the second step, and the classifier is retrained. After the first step, pixels in sampled patches are predicted by the trained classifier and false negative pixels are selected to be added to the training dataset. These target patches are sampled in a similar manner as before but are ten times larger in dimension. The first-layer classifier is then fitted again with this expanded training dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6-4"><title>Training of the second layer</title><p>As the size of a synapse is generally bigger than just a single pixel, a pixel adjacent to the positive foreground is more likely to be foreground than another pixel with the same local features but away from the foreground.

For each pixel in the training dataset, probabilities of the target pixel and the six adjacent pixels (−1 and +1 in either <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, or <italic>z</italic> direction) are calculated by the first-layer classifier and the feature vector is expanded with these six probability values.

To address this, we have now added an additional function in the pipeline to test all pre-trained models on representative input images. Before processing an entire dataset, users can view all segmentation results for images in Fiji to assess which model performed best, judged by the user. The GUI, running guide document, and manuscript have been modified accordingly.</p><p>In addition, we would like to emphasize that the pre-trained models were developed by iterative analyses of many reporters, often with multiple rounds of parameter tuning; the results were validated post hoc to choose the optimal model for each reporter, and we have listed this information in Supplemental Table 1 to inform the choice of the pre-trained model for commonly used reporter types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>On p. 11 (and elsewhere), the differences in the performance of WormPsyQi and human experimenters are called &quot;statistically insignificant&quot;. This statement is not particularly informative (absence of evidence is not evidence of absence). Can the authors provide a more rigorous analysis here - or provide an estimate of the typical effect size of the machine-vs-human difference?</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>To address this, we have included additional analysis in Figure 2 – figure supplement 3. For two reporters - I5 GFP::CLA-1 and M4 GFP::RAB-3 - we compare WormPsyQi vs. labelers and inter-labeler puncta quantification. A high Pearson correlation coefficient (r2) reflects greater correspondence between two independent scoring methods. We chose these two test cases to demonstrate that the machine-vs-human effect size is reporter-dependent. For I5, where the CLA-1 signal is very discrete and S/N ratio is high, the discrepancy between WormPsyQi, labeler 1, and labeler 2 is minimal (r2=0.735); moreover, scoring correspondence depends on the labeler (r2=0.642 and 0.942, respectively). In other words, WormPsyQi mimics some labelers better than others, which is to be expected. For M4, where the RAB-3 signal is diffuse and synapse density is high in the ROI, the inter-labeler discrepancy is high (r2=0.083) and WormPsyQi vs labeler (1 or 2) discrepancy is slightly reduced (r2=0.322 and 0.116, respectively). The problematic regions for the M4 RAB-3 reporter are emphasized in Figure 6 - figure supplement 1A. Overall, the additional analysis suggests that the effect size is contingent on the reporter type and image quality, and importantly for scoring difficult strains WormPsyQi may average out inter-labeler scoring variability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>p. 12: &quot;Again, relying on alternative reporters where possible...&quot; This is an incomplete sentence - are some words missing?</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Edited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. The authors effectively validated the sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity by comparing the synapse puncta numbers of PHB&gt;AVA, PHA&gt;AVG, PHB&gt;AVG, and ADL&gt;AVA. However, these differences appear to be quite robust. It would be beneficial for the authors to test whether WormPsyQi can detect more subtle changes at the synapses, such as 10-20% changes in puncta number and fluorescence intensity.</p></disp-quote><p>While the dimorphic strains were used to first validate WormPsyQi based on the ground truth of very well-characterized reporters, the reviewer reasonably asks whether our pipeline can pick up on more subtle differences. To address this, we have now included an additional figure (Figure 9 – figure supplement 2), where we performed pairwise comparisons between L4 and adult timepoints for the reporter M3 GFP::RAB-3. As reflected in panels A and C, although the difference between puncta number and mean intensity between L4 and adult is marginal (22% increase in puncta number and 13% increase in mean intensity from L4 to adult), WormPsyQi can pick it up as statistically significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. On page 10, the authors mentioned that &quot;cell-specific RAB-3 reporters have a more diffuse synaptic signal compared to the punctate signal in CLA-1 reporters for the same neuron, as shown for the neuron pair ASK (Figure 4 -figure supplement 1B, C)&quot;. It is important to note that in this case, the reporter gene expressing RAB-3 is part of an extrachromosomal array, whereas the reporter gene expressing CLA-1 is integrated into the chromosome. It's possible that the observed difference in pattern may arise from variations in the transgenic strategies employed.</p></disp-quote><p>To emphasize the difference in puncta features inherent to the reporter type, we have now added WormPsyQi segmentation results for ASK CLA-1 extrachromosomal reporter (otEx7455) next to the ASK CLA-1 integrant (otIs789) and ASK RAB-3 reporter (otEx7231) in Figure 4 – figure supplement 1C. Importantly, otEx7455 was integrated to generate otIs789, so they belong to the same transgenic line. Literature shows that RAB-3 and CLA-1 have different localization patterns and corresponding functions at presynaptic specializations, and this is qualitatively and quantitatively shown by the significant difference in puncta area size between RAB-3 and both CLA-1 reporters, i.e., both CLA-1 reporters have smaller, discrete puncta compared to RAB-3 (Figure 4 – figure supplement 1C). Quantitatively, in the case of ASK - where the synapse density is sparse enough that even diffuse RAB-3 puncta can be segmented without confounding adjacent puncta – overall puncta number between otEx7231 and otIs789 are similar. However, RAB-3 signal is diffuse and this poses quantification problems in cases where the synapse density is higher (e.g. AIB, SAA in Figure 4 – figure supplement 1D) and WormPsyQi fails to score puncta in these reporters since the signal is not punctate. As far as integrated vs. extrachromosomal reporters go, the reviewer is right in pointing out that some differences may be stemming from reporter type as our additional analysis between otIs789 and otEx7455 indeed shows fewer puncta in the latter owing to variable expressivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors mentioned that having a cytoplasmic reporter in the background of the synaptic reporter enhanced performance. It would be more informative to provide comparative results with and without cytoplasmic reporters, particularly for scenarios involving dim signals or densely distributed signals.</p></disp-quote><p>The presence of a cytoplasmic marker is critical in two specific scenarios: (1) images where the S/N ratio is poor, and (2) when the image S/N ratio is good, but the ROI is large, which would make the image processing computationally expensive.</p><p>To demonstrate the first scenario, we have included an additional panel in Figure 4 – figure supplement 1(B) to show how WormPsyQi performs on the PHB&gt;AVA GRASP reporter with and without the channel having cytoplasmic marker. The original image was processed as-is in the former case with both the synaptic marker in green and cytoplasmic marker in red; for comparison, only the green channel having synaptic marker was used to simulate a situation where the strain does not have a cytoplasmic marker. As shown in the figure, in the presence of background autofluorescence signal from the gut (which can be easily confounded with GRASP puncta depending on the worm’s orientation), WormPsyQi quantified GRASP puncta much more robustly with the cytoplasmic label; without the cytoplasmic marker, gut puncta are incorrectly segmented as synapses (highlighted with red arrows) while some dim synaptic puncta are not picked up (highlighted with yellow arrows).</p><p>To demonstrate the second scenario, we now highlight the case of ASK CLA-1 in Figure 2 - figure supplement 4E. Additionally, we have emphasized in the manuscript that in cases where the S/N ratio is good and the image is restricted to a small ROI, WormPsyQi will perform well even in the absence of a cytoplasmic marker. This is equally important to note as having a specific cytoplasmic marker in the background may not always be feasible and, in fact, if the cytoplasmic marker is discontinuous or dim relative to puncta signal, using a suboptimal neurite mask for synapse segmentation would result in undercounting synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. On page 12, the author stated &quot;We also note that in several cases, GRASP quantification differed from EM scoring&quot;. However, the EM scoring is primarily based on a single sample, making it challenging to conduct a statistical analysis for the purpose of comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct and is indeed a limitation of EM for this type of analysis. We have now reworded this sentence (page 14) to emphasize the reviewer’s point, and it is also elaborated further in the limitations section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 6F, the discrepancy between WormPsyQi and human quantification in the analysis of RAB-3 is observed. The author stated that &quot;the RAB-3 signal was too diffuse to resolve all puncta&quot;. To better illustrate this discrepancy, it would be beneficial to include images highlighting the puncta that WormPsyQi cannot score, providing direct evidence that diffusing signals are not able to automatically detectable.</p></disp-quote><p>To highlight puncta that were not segmented by WormPsyQi but were successfully scored manually, we have included arrows in Figure 6. In addition, for reporter M4p::GFP::RAB-3, we have included magnified insets in Figure 6 - figure supplement 1A to highlight the region where human annotator scores more puncta than WormPsyQi owing to the high synapse density. In future implementations, additional functionality can be built for separating these merged puncta into instances based on geometrical features such as shape and intensity contour.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 9 S1D, the results from WormPsyQi and the manual are totally different. To address this notable discrepancy, the authors should highlight and illustrate the areas of discrepancy in the images. This visual representation can assist future users in identifying signal types that may not be well-suited for WormPsyQi analysis and inspire the development of new strategies to tackle such challenges.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now addressed in additional figure panels in Figure 4 – figure supplement 1B and Figure 6 - figure supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I found the comparison between manual quantification and WormPsyQi-based quantification to be very informative. In my opinion, quantifying the number of puncta is not the most tedious/difficult quantification even when done manually. Would the authors be able to include manual-WormPsyQi comparison for more time-consuming and potentially more prone to human error/bias quantifications such as puncta size or distribution patterns using a few markers with some inter/intra animal variabilities?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have now included an additional figure supplement to Figure 2 (Figure 2 – figure supplement 4). We focused on the ASK GFP::CLA-1 reporter and had two human annotators manually label the masks of puncta for each worm by scanning Z-stacks and drawing all pixels belonging to each puncta in Fiji, which were then processed by WormPsyQi’s quantification pipeline to score puncta number, volume, and distribution. We also included a comparison of overall image processing time for each annotator and WormPsyQi. For features analyzed, the difference between WormPsyQi and human annotators for ASK CLA-1 is not statistically significant for multiple puncta features. Importantly, WormPsyQi reduces overall processing time by at least an order of magnitude, and while this is already advantageous for counting puncta, it is especially useful for other important puncta features since (a) they may not be easily discernible, and (b) it is extremely laborious to quantify them manually in large datasets when pixel-wise labels are required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors listed minimum human errors and biases as one of the benefits of WormPsyQi. For the markers with discrepancies in quantifications between human and WormPsyQi, have the authors encountered or considered human errors/biases as potential reasons for such discrepancies?</p></disp-quote><p>This is the same point brought up by reviewer 1. We added Figure 2- figure supplement 3 to compare WormPsyQi to different human labelers, and show that because human labels can introduce systematic bias, WormPsyQi reduces such bias by scoring images using the same metric.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors noted that WormPsyQi would be useful for comparing different genotypes/environments. Some mutants have known changes in synapse patterning/number. It would be helpful if the authors could validate WormPsyQi using some of the mutants with known synapse defects. For instance, zig-10 mutant increases the cholinergic synapse density just by a bit (Cherra and Jin, Neuron 2016), and nlr-1 mutant disrupts punctated localization of UNC-9 gap junction in the nerve ring (Meng and Yan, Neuron 2020), which could only be detectable by experts' eyes. It would be interesting to see if WormPsyQi picks up such subtle phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our pipeline would need to be tested in multiple paradigms to test its performance on detecting additional subtle phenotypes. In the context of this paper, we note that the developmental analysis of puncta in Figure 8 was performed to validate the ground truth from previous EM-based analyses (Witvliet et al., 2021), albeit the latter was limited by sample size. We extended this developmental analysis to the pharyngeal reporters, and in some cases the difference across timepoints was marginal (as emphasized by additional Figure 9 - figure supplement 2), but still detected by WormPsyQi. Lastly, our synapse localization analysis in Figure 10 assigns the probability of finding a synapse at a particular location along a neurite, which is not easily discernible by manual scoring.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of the benefits of the automated data analysis program is to be able to notice the differences you do not expect. For example, there are situations where you feel that in certain genotypes there is something different from wild type with their synapses but you can't tell what's different from wild type. In such cases, you may not know what to quantify. I think it would be beneficial if there were more parameters to be included in the default qualifications such as puncta number/size/intensity/distributions in the pipeline, so that the users may find unexpected phenotypes from one of the default quantifications.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if this was not clearer in the manuscript where we first describe the pipeline in detail. To clarify, the output of WormPsyQi is a CSV file which includes several quantitative features, such as mean/max/min fluorescence intensity, puncta volume, and position. While most of our analyses are focused on puncta count, the user can perform downstream statistical analyses on all additional features scored to infer which features are most significantly variable across conditions. To make this clearer, we have elaborated the text when we first describe our pipeline, and along with the new Figure 2 - figure supplement 4, we hope that this point is clearer now.</p><p>In addition, most proof-of-principle analysis we performed was focused on an ROI where we expect the synapses to localize. In practice, the user can input images and perform quantification across the entire image without biasing toward an ROI (this can be done in the GUI synapse corrector window) to also evaluate synaptic changes in regions outside the usual ROI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors stated that WormPsyQi could mitigate the problems stemming from scoring images with low signal-to-noise ratio or in regions with high background autofluorescence, laboriousness of scoring large datasets, and inter-dataset variability. Other than the 'laboriousness of scoring large datasets' it appeared to me that WormPsyQi does not do better than manual quantifications, especially inter-dataset variability, as the authors noted variability among the transgenes as one of the limitations of the toolkits. If two datasets are taken with completely different setups such as two independent arrays taken with two distinct confocal microscopes, would WormPsyQi make these two datasets comparable?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional figure supplements to address the reviewer’s point. A significant advantage WormPsyQi offers over manual scoring is that it provides a standardized method of quantifying synapse features. As shown in Figure 2 – figure supplement 3, human labelers can introduce systematic bias (e.g. some over count puncta, while some undercount). In addition, while puncta number may be relatively easy to quantify, especially in a high-quality dataset, more subtle puncta features such as size, intensity, and distribution are much more laborious to quantify and require a priori knowledge of signal localization (Figure 2 – figure supplement 4, Figure 10). Altogether, our pipeline facilitates multiple measurements while also enabling robust quantification in hard-to-score cases such as the example shown for PHB&gt;AVA reporter (Figure 4 - figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Limitations are not quite specific to this work but those are general limitations to the concatemeric trans genes and fluorescently labeled synaptic proteins. I'd appreciate discussing specific limitations to WormPsyQi related to image acquisitions. For instance, for neurons with 3D structures would WormPsyQi be able to handle z-stacks closer to coverslip and stacks that are deeper side in a similar manner? Would the users need to be aware of such limitations when comparing different genotypes?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer’s comment, we have elaborated the last paragraph in the limitations section to explicitly discuss where the user should exercise caution. The reviewer reasonably points out that the fluorescent signal away from the cover slip is typically dimmer, and neurite masking in this case is indeed compromised if dim to start with. In such cases, we recommend that the user either performs some preprocessing such as deconvolution, denoising, or contrast enhancement to boost the neurite signal, or segment synapses without the neurite mask if the puncta signal is brighter than that of the cytoplasmic marker. We hope that our additional figure supplements will clarify that WormPsyQi’s performance is contingent on reporter type and image quality, thus making it easier for the user to discern where automated quantification falls short and alternative reporters should be explored. In general, if puncta are not discernible to the user due to very poor S/N ratio, for instance, we do not recommend using WormPsyQi to process such datasets; this will be manifest in the results of the new “test all models” feature we added in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some Rab-3 fusion proteins are described as RAB-3::GFP(BFP). Do these represent the C-terminal fusion of the fluorescent proteins? RAB-3 is a small GTPase with a lipid modification site at its C-terminus essential for its localization and function. Is it possible that the diffuse signal of some RAB-3 markers is caused by c-terminal fusion of the fluorescent protein?</p></disp-quote><p>While we do have reporters with N- and C-terminal RAB-3 fusions for different neurons, we do not have both for the same neuron to perform a fair comparison. However, as noted in response to a previous comment by reviewer 2, RAB-3 and CLA-1 have distinct localization patterns at the synapse and this aligns with their distinct functions: while RAB-3 localizes at synaptic vesicles, CLA-1 is an active zone protein required for synaptic vesicle clustering. Accordingly, we have observed diffuse RAB-3 signal in reporters irrespective of where the protein is tagged, and while this is not problematic for ROIs with a low synapse density, it confounds quantification in synapse-dense regions. In contrast, CLA-1 puncta are typically easier to quantify more discretely, which is particularly relevant for features such synapse distribution, size, and intensity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
