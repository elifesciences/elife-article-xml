is unsatisfyingly often referred to as ‘fuzzy’. Gaining clarity on the biogenesis of membraneless cellular compartments is one of the most demanding challenges in biology. Here, we focus on the chromosome passenger complex (CPC), that forms a chromatin body that regulates chromosome segregation in mitosis. Within the three regulatory subunits of the CPC implicated in phase separation – a heterotrimer of INCENP, Survivin, and Borealin – we identify the contact regions formed upon droplet formation using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HXMS). These contact regions correspond to some of the interfaces seen between individual heterotrimers within the crystal lattice they form. A major contribution comes from specific electrostatic interactions that can be broken and reversed through initial and compensatory mutagenesis, respectively. Our findings reveal structural insight for interactions driving liquid-liquid demixing of the CPC. Moreover, we establish HXMS as an approach to define the structural basis for phase separation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phase separation</kwd><kwd>hydrogen/deuterium exchange</kwd><kwd>chromosome</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>chromosome passenger complex</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM130302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>Ben E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM134591</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bryan</surname><given-names>Nikaela W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006920</institution-id><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics Training Grant GM008275</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bryan</surname><given-names>Nikaela W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The utilization of hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry reveals dynamic insights and interactions driving liquid-liquid demixing of the chromosome passenger complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Membraneless intracellular compartmentalization is central to a long and growing list of biochemical transactions at diverse sub-cellular locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banani et al., 2017</xref>). Proteins are by-and-large the drivers of the formation of these compartments, but there is debate about whether their underpinnings are either low-affinity/low-specificity interactions yielding phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brangwynne, 2013</xref>) or multivalent site-specific interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Musacchio, 2022</xref>). By its very nature, ascertaining the former type of interaction is essentially intractable by conventional structural biology methodologies. Moreover, the latter type of interaction is typically beyond current structural approaches, since multivalency involving contacts with highly flexible surfaces confounds traditional methodologies used in structural studies. Approaches that provide mechanistic insight on specific complexes engaged in membraneless compartmentalization are highly limited to date, especially when the molecules undergoing putative phase separation are more complex than a relatively small individual polypeptide. There is some reported success with crosslinking approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kato et al., 2012</xref>) and NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conicella et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conicella et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gibbs et al., 2020</xref>) but deciphering the physical basis of membraneless compartmentalization will ultimately require advancing new technologies and/or new applications of existing ones. The proposed types of bonds that are involved in phase separation are similar to those involved in conventional protein folding and interactions (e.g. hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banani et al., 2017</xref>); however, specifically how the structure and dynamics of a protein or protein complexes are impacted upon engaging in higher-order interactions is almost entirely unknown.</p><p>One proposed cellular compartment is the inner centromere, comprised, in part, of chromatin and the chromosome passenger complex (CPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Trivedi et al., 2019</xref>). The CPC is one of the key regulators of cell division and is comprised of four subunits: the serine/threonine enzymatic core Aurora B kinase, and three regulatory and targeting subunits, the scaffold inner centromere protein (INCENP), Survivin, and Borealin (also known as Dasra-B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ruchaud et al., 2007</xref>). The activity of the CPC is strongly based on its sub-cellular localization during specific stages of cell division. In particular, during prometaphase the CPC is strongly localized to the chromatin spanning the two replicated centromeres, called the inner centromere. At the centromere, the CPC is involved in the process of mitotic error correction, whereby misattachments of centromeres to the microtubule-based mitotic spindle are rectified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lampson and Grishchuk, 2017</xref>). Conventional targeting mechanisms through molecular recognition are required for CPC localization to the inner centromere. Specific chromatin marks at the inner centromere are recognized to direct CPC localization: the Survivin subunit directly binds H3<sup>T3phos</sup> and the adaptor protein, Sgo2, indirectly binds to H2A<sup>T120phos</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kelly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yamagishi et al., 2010</xref>). The three non-catalytic subunits of the CPC (INCENP<sup>1-58</sup>, Borealin, and Survivin) form soluble heterotrimers that have a propensity to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Trivedi et al., 2019</xref>). Deletion of one region of Borealin between amino acids 139–160 (Borealin<sup>Δ139-160</sup>) or disrupting the strong positive charge in this region disrupts phase separation in vitro. These mutations within Borealin also reduce CPC accumulation at the inner centromere and its ability to robustly bundle spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Niedzialkowska et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Trivedi et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, this region of Borealin overlaps with its mapped protein surface that contributes to nucleosome binding of the CPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad et al., 2019</xref>). Besides the requirement for this region of Borealin, nothing mechanistic is known regarding how the CPC phase separates.</p><p>Here, we measure the change in polypeptide backbone dynamics of the INCENP/ Borealin/Survivin heterotrimer (ISB) in either a soluble or liquid-liquid demixed state using hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HXMS). The most prominent changes in backbone dynamics are measured as additional protection from HX, primarily localized to discrete portions of α-helices of the INCENP and Borealin subunits. By combining information learned from peptide mapping provided by the HXMS data, a stepwise candidate mutagenesis approach, high-resolution structural information from the crystal packing behavior of ISB heterotrimers, and biochemical complementation, we identify three separate salt-bridges that drive liquid-liquid demixing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HXMS identifies regions with ISB heterotrimers impacted by phase separation</title><p>The ISB heterotrimer is comprised of the N-terminal 58 amino acids of INCENP, along with both full-length Survivin and Borealin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Together, it forms a three-helix bundle, containing a histone-binding module from the Survivin subunit and a C-terminal extension of Borealin that is reported to be mostly unstructured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jeyaprakash et al., 2007</xref>). Prior ISB phase separation was performed by either the addition of a polymeric crowding agent or by lowering the ionic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Trivedi et al., 2019</xref>). Polymers, like those typically used in phase separation studies (e.g. polyethylene glycol or dextran), are incompatible with the mass spectrometry step in HXMS that we intended to use to study the ISB, since the resulting spectra from polymers obscure those from the peptides under investigation. Thus, we studied the phase separation properties of the ISB over a range of protein concentrations and ionic strengths in the absence of polymeric crowding agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). From this, we focused our initial attention on a condition (25 μM ISB, 75 mM NaCl) that yields robust droplet formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Indeed, for subsequent HXMS experiments (described below), we sought to measure the behavior of an essentially homogenous droplet population since a highly heterogenous mixture of droplet and non-droplet ISB populations would likely yield convoluted mass spectra that would be challenging to properly assign to one of the states. In the condition we identified, 90%±5% of the ISB protein was found within the rapidly sedimenting droplet population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phase separation leads to decreases in hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HX) within the three-helix bundle structure of ISB.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the ISB showing various structural domains within the subunits.

HXMS measures amide proton exchange, and for any generic protein, protection from HX is observed when secondary structures engage amide protons in hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Englander, 2006</xref>). In our prior studies, we have utilized HXMS to readily identify contact points between domains of a multi-domain enzyme during its activation and inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawicki-McKenna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zandarashvili et al., 2020</xref>) as well as when components are added in a stepwise fashion during macromolecular complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Falk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). We reasoned that ISB backbone dynamics would be restricted upon droplet formation, since the generally accepted broadscale basis of phase separation is through intermolecular interactions, albeit transient ones. In the case of ISB, we assumed that inter-heterotrimer interactions were the basis of its subsequent phase separation. HXMS is routinely performed over a time course, and we developed an approach to monitor droplet formation behavior of the samples alongside the HX reactions themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Instead of letting the droplets settle on the slide, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, we monitored them as they exist immediately upon preparing the slides for imaging to provide a rapid readout of droplet formation at each timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Robust droplet formation was observed in HX reaction conditions at all timepoints, including at the earliest one taken (10 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). By the latest timepoint, 3000 s, there was some diminution in the number of droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which may indicate the start of a transition of the droplets to a more solid state (i.e. gel-like). Thus, we concluded that timepoints longer than 3000 s would likely not be informative on how ISB backbone dynamics are impacted by initial droplet formation. This time course of HX proved to be sufficient to observe extensive exchange on all folded portions of the ISB, with the flexible regions lacking secondary structure exchanged much earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). Slower HX was observed for all known and predicted secondary structural elements, except for the C-terminal helix of Borealin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Reciprocally, all predicted loop regions were very fast to exchange (i.e. essentially completely exchanged by 10 s), except for a small region around amino acids 140–150 of Borealin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). This region was originally interpreted to be largely unstructured and contain high amounts of intrinsic disorder; however, our HXMS analysis suggests that some secondary structural elements exist in this region and are central to phase separation. Notably, this region overlaps with a deletion mutant (Borealin<sup>Δ139-160</sup>) that causes a loss of phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Trivedi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To identify regions impacted by droplet formation, we first focused on an intermediate timepoint, 100 s, because visual inspection of HX patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) indicated that there were clear changes at this point within the time course. At the 100 s timepoint, the most prominent differences between the soluble and droplet state were located within the three-helix bundle of the ISB, with long stretches in two subunits (INCENP and Borealin) and a small region at the N-terminal portion of the impacted α-helix in Survivin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The only other region that corresponded to slower HX was within the aforementioned region of Borealin (amino acids 140–150), displaying rates consistent with the presence of secondary structure when the ISB is in its free state, which became further accentuated within the droplet state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). At the 300 s timepoint, a similar pattern is observed for the INCENP and Borealin proteins, with the notable addition of more extensive HX protection upon droplet formation within the three-helix bundle helix from Survivin and deprotection throughout its histone-recognizing BIR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A, B, D</xref>). Taken together, the changes we observe in HX upon droplet formation indicates that discrete regions within structured portions of the ISB have slower backbone dynamics when in the droplet state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Two of three bundled ISB α-helices protected from HX in droplets</title><p>We focused on the three prominent regions of the interacting α-helices of INCENP and Borealin. HX protection within INCENP is strongest at the 100 s timepoint, especially within the C-terminal portion of the α-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Examination of the entire time course shows that during intermediate levels of HX (i.e. between 100 and 1000 s), this region takes about three times as long to undergo the same amount of exchange when the ISB is in the droplet state relative to when it’s in the free protein state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Upon droplet formation, HX protection within Borealin is primarily located in the interacting α-helix and is less pronounced at any given peptide when compared to INCENP peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Nonetheless, similar to INCENP peptides, it still takes about twice as long to achieve the same level of deuteration for this region of Borealin in the droplet state as compared to the free state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In comparison, other regions exist within the ISB complex where multiple partially overlapping peptides show no measurable HX differences between droplet and free protein states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This verifies that there are no properties of droplets, such as vastly different molar concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O (or D<sub>2</sub>O), that impact the general chemical exchange rate between all parts of the ISB. Rather, we conclude the changes observed within the ISB complex, such as those displayed in the two long interacting α-helices of INCENP and Borealin, are due to interactions formed between ISB complexes within the droplet state relative to those in the free state.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Regions of the three-helix bundle structure of INCENP and Borealin become protected from hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HX) upon phase separation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Percent difference in HX upon phase separation at 100 s in the indicated region of INCENP.

Combining the information from the three rounds of mutagenesis, we conclude that residues D27, E36, and E42 of INCENP contribute additively to the disruption of phase separation we observe within I<sub>Mut6</sub>SB.

In the absence of structural information or useful structural models (i.e. of multimeric complexes where current structural predictions fall short), HXMS provides localization information at moderately high resolution (i.e. within small numbers of amino acid residues given the coverage we achieved with the ISB, for instance). We envision that HXMS will be broadly useful to advance our physical understanding of the protein/protein and protein/nucleic acid interactions that drive phase separation and the formation of membraneless compartments within the cell.</p><p>It can be extremely difficult to generate structural information about the weak interactions that drive liquid-liquid demixing, but by combining HXMS with the long-studied relationship between liquid-liquid phase separation and crystal formation, our study shows that this can be done. Our approach might be generalizable for many proteins that have phase separation activities. Of course, packing information is largely thrown out during the presentation in most macromolecular structure-focused studies, but the data are readily available (i.e. archived in the PDB). We anticipate that clues from crystal contacts will help uncover potential sites that participate in other phase separating protein complexes, but they are unlikely to be sufficient. Rather, we envision HXMS as an essential step to localize the key contacts in the liquid-liquid demixed state, then most powerfully combined with structural information, including crystal contacts, when they are available.</p><p>Multivalency has emerged as the key driver of the liquid-liquid demixing of proteins and the interactions between monomeric units, and often involve weak interactions that are separated by intrinsically disordered domains. To date, detailed insight into the specific self-self interactions that are proposed to drive monomeric proteins and protein complexes into phase-separated compartments has been rare, despite an enormous and growing list of candidate compartments at diverse locations in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banani et al., 2017</xref>). Undoubtedly, all sorts of macromolecular interaction types will be utilized within this diverse collection of compartments. Our findings support the notion that structured domains can play major roles as drivers of liquid-liquid demixing. Specifically, we map two structured regions that are separated by an intrinsically disordered region as underlying the liquid-liquid demixing of a subcomplex of the CPC. Our data suggest that salt-bridges between highly ordered regions of one subunit form with an adjacent complex in a liquid-liquid demixed droplet. These salt-bridges can explain the low affinity, salt sensitivity, and transient nature of the liquid demixed state. Our data also provide an important clue about the previously identified region on Borealin that is required for liquid demixing in vitro and proper CPC assembly in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Trivedi et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3A</xref>) suggest this region of Borealin adopts secondary structure that undergoes additional HX protection in the liquid-liquid demixed state. We presume this region, enriched in basic residues, interacts with a negatively charged region that remains to be identified in an adjacent heterotrimer. We note that there is a region of strong negative charge within the intrinsically disordered region between the two regions of HX protection on the Borealin subunit. Our findings integrate into the emerging concept of ‘stickers and spacers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mittag and Pappu, 2022</xref>), where the driving stickers for the CPC are indeed the specific salt-bridges that we identified through a combination of HXMS, analysis of ISB crystal packing, and mutagenesis. The spacers include the regions that lack stable secondary structure (i.e. the substantial portions where HX is essentially complete by the 10 s timepoint; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The stickers are sufficient for higher-order assembly, and the spacers permit particular solvation properties that contribute to the nature of the phase separation properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguzzi and Altmeyer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gomes and Shorter, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mittag and Pappu, 2022</xref>) and downstream consequences to the viscoelastic properties of the inner centromere compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary model highlighting functionality of chromosome passenger complex (CPC) phase separation in cells.</title><p>Stabilized interactions defined by hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HXMS) findings are indicated in solid black lines, while proposed weak interactions via Borealin loop are defined by dashed line.

The reaction requires a combination of specific recruitment of the CPC to histone posttranslational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kelly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yamagishi et al., 2010</xref>), interactions of the Borealin subunit with histones, and interactions between Borealin and the Sgo1 protein, which in turn is recruited by histone phosphorylation in addition to the multivalent interactions between the INCENP, Survivin, and Borealin subunits that are the subject of this work. Although we initially suggested that recruitment relies upon initial recognition of H3<sup>T3phos</sup> directly by Survivin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) – and indirectly by interaction with the Sgo2 adaptor protein that recognizes H2A<sup>T120phos</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yamagishi et al., 2010</xref>) – which then drives liquid demixing, it is also possible that the system is so finely tuned that the CPC can both interact with phosphohistones and also interact with other CPCs by multivalency, generating a chromosome-localized compartment capable of efficiently mediating robust mitotic error correction. Furthermore, a very recent report indicates that CPC phase separation can be modulated by MLL1-mediated methylation of the Borealin subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sha et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>It has long been appreciated that Aurora B, the catalytic subunit of the CPC, is a prime example of a kinase whose activity is dictated by localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carmena et al., 2012</xref>). We focus on the inner centromere, where Aurora B monitors connections of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, and it is also vital later in mitosis for the abscission checkpoint and the regulation of cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barr and Gruneberg, 2007</xref>). Since perturbing the ability of the CPC to phase-separate at the inner centromere leads to defects in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Trivedi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Trivedi and Stukenberg, 2020</xref>), the role of phase separation appears to be tuning levels at the centromere, producing a functional inner centromere compartment, and maintaining a pool of the CPC after chromosome alignment destined for downstream steps in cytokinesis. In the present study, we have defined the impact of phase separation on the structural dynamics of the responsible regions for separation of the CPC, and, further, identified the key structural determinants that drive the inter-heterotrimer interactions. Recapitulating the environment of the inner centromere with purified components will constitute a substantial future challenge for the field, and our work provides a framework with which to understand this critical region of mitotic chromatin and a powerful experimental approach, HXMS, with which to probe the protein components of the inner centromere.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Deuterium on-exchange of phase-separated ISB protein was performed at a similar temperature by diluting purified ISB with a mixture of two on-exchange buffers (Buffer 1: 50 mM Tris pD 7.5, 0 mM NaCl; Buffer 2: 50 mM Tris pD 7.5, 500 mM NaCl) to a final protein concentration of 25 µM ISB, 75 mM NaCl, and a final D<sub>2</sub>O content of 75%. pD values are direct pH meter readings. Samples were prepared and frozen in a similar manner to soluble ISB protein. All samples were produced in quadruplicate so that there would be a spare in addition to a triplicate set to measure, in case of a technical issue in downstream steps. The supplementary table (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) summarizes the HXMS experiments.</p><p>HX samples were individually thawed at 0°C for 2.5 min, then injected (50 µL) and pumped through an immobilized pepsin (Sigma) column at an initial flow rate of 50 µL/min for 2 min followed by 150 µL/min for 2 min. Pepsin was immobilized by coupling to POROS 20 AL support (Applied Biosystems) and packed into column housings of 2 mm × 2 cm (64 µL) (Upchurch). Protease-generated fragments were collected onto a TARGA C8 5 µM Piccolo HPLC column (1.0×5.0 mm<sup>2</sup>, Higgins Analytical) and eluted through an analytical C18 HPLC column (0.3×75 mm<sup>2</sup>, Agilent) by a shaped 12–100% Buffer B gradient over 25 min at 6 µL/min (Buffer A: 0.1% formic acid; Buffer B: 0.1% formic acid, 99.9% acetonitrile). The effluent was electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap XL, Thermo Fisher Scientific). We analyzed MS/MS data collected from non-deuterated samples to identify the likely sequence of the patent peptides using SEQUEST (Bioworks v3.3.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a peptide tolerance of 8 ppm and a fragment tolerance of 0.1 AMU. We discarded peptides that failed to meet a specified quality score (SEQUEST P<sub>pep</sub> score &lt;0.99). The peptide data are included in a supplementary table (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>A MATLAB-based program, ExMS2, was used to prepare the pool of peptides based on SEQUEST output files. HDExaminer software was next used to process and analyze the HXMS data. HDExaminer identifies the peptide envelope centroid values for non-deuterated as well as deuterated peptides and uses the information to calculate the level of peptide deuteration for each peptide at each timepoint. Each individual deuterated peptide is corrected for loss of deuterium label during HXMS data collection by normalizing to the maximal deuteration level of that peptide, which we measure in a ‘full deuterated’ (FD) reference sample. The FD sample was prepared in 75% deuterium to mimic the exchange experiment, but under acidic denaturing conditions (0.88% formic acid), and incubated for over 24 hr to allow each amide proton position along the entire polypeptide to undergo full exchange. 20 µL of this reaction was quenched with 30 µL ice-cold FD quench buffer (1 M guanidine hydrochloride, 8% glycerol, and 0.74% formic acid, for a final pH of 2.4–2.6) and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. HDExaminer performs such correction automatically when provided with the FD file. For each peptide, we compare the extent of deuteration as measured in both the on-exchange and FD samples to the maximal number of exchangeable deuterons (maxD) when corrected with an average back exchange level; the median extent of back exchange in our datasets is 18% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>HXMS plotting</title><p>Peptide plotting was performed in MATLAB, RStudio, and Prism using deuteration levels for each peptide extracted from the HDExaminer outputs. Differences in deuteration levels between two samples were calculated for all peptides for which the identical peptide was found in both conditions, the ND and FD samples. For comparing two different HXMS datasets, we plot the percent difference of each peptide, which is calculated by subtracting the percent deuteration of one sample from that or another, and plotted according to the color legend in stepwise increments (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We include in our figures peptides of identical sequence but different charge states. Although not unique peptides, they do add confidence to our peptide identification as their deuteration levels are in close agreement with each other. Only peptides of high quality and with clear spectra in both HX time courses and ‘FD’ conditions were included in the analysis. Consensus behavior at each residue was calculated as the average of the differences in HX protection of all peptides spanning that residue (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). For the plot of peptide data expressed as the number of deuterons (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D and G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C–E</xref>), the values are expressed as the mean of three independent measurements±s.d.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Turbidity assay</title><p>Following liquid-liquid phase separation, WT and ISB mutant protein were incubated at room temperature for 100 s prior to UV-visible measurements. Control measurements included protein purification buffer, low salt buffer (50 mM Tris, 75 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol), and WT ISB protein at high salt (25 µM WT ISB, 500 mM NaCl). The optical intensity (turbidity) was measured using a NanoDrop 2000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 330 nm.

Then, the entirety of the top phase was removed; the remaining sedimented pellet was resuspended in an equivalent volume of protein purification buffer. 5 µL of both top phase and sedimented pellet, along with a sample of protein after thawing and a sample of protein before sedimentation, were analyzed using SDS-PAGE (4–20% Tris-HCl gradient gel) to determine the saturation concentration. The serial dilution of wild-type ISB, ranging between 0 and 30 µM, was loaded onto a similar SDS-PAGE gel to create a standard curve (with a coefficient of determination R<sup>2</sup>=0.9), which was used to determine the saturation concentration of ISB. The SDS-PAGE gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and subjected to densitometry using GelQuant Express Analysis Software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>optoDroplet assay</title><p>The plasmid expressing Borealin<sub>WT</sub>-mCherry-Cry2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Trivedi et al., 2019</xref>) and a derivative harboring the K→E substitutions at Borealin a.a. 26, 37, and 63 were transfected into HeLa TREx cells that were seeded in 35 mm glass-bottom dishes (Cellvis, D29-20-1.5P). HeLa T-Rex were acquired directly from the manufacturer (Thermo Fisher #R714087), were authenticated by ATCC using STR profiling, and were regularly assessed by the DNA stain uptake method for mycoplasma contamination (and found to be uncontaminated). Lipofectamine 3000 (L3000-008) was used for transfections. Twenty-four hours following transfection, the cells were imaged using a Zeiss Observer-Z1 microscope in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified chamber at 37°C. Cells with similar mCherry expression levels were selected for measurement (phase separation propensity of wild-type and mutant Borealin). To induce phase separation, the cells in the field were exposed to 488 nm light (10 cycles of 100 ms each, with an interval of 30 s between consecutive cycles). The single z-plane mCherry images were acquired immediately after exposure with 488 nm light for 1500 ms during each cycle. The mCherry intensities were measured 270 s after light exposure and quantified in Fiji (ImageJ) software and plotted using the GraphPad Prism software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>HeLa TREx cells were seeded on coverslips in six-well culture plates. The following day, plasmids (pCDNA5 containing Borealin<sup>WT</sup>-mCherry-Cry2 or mCherry-Cry2) were transfected into HeLa TREx cells as in the optoDroplet assay (see above). After 6 hr, RO-3306 (9 μM) was added to medium to synchronize the cells in late G2-phase. Twenty-four hours following the transfection, the cells were either immediately fixed or exposed to white light on a transilluminator for 10 min to induce liquid-liquid phase separation and then fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in PHEM buffer (25 mM HEPES, 60 mM PIPES, 10 MM EGTA, and 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 6.9) with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. Following fixation, the coverslips containing the fixed cells were washed three times with PBS. Subsequently, cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with blocking buffer (3% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS). Next, the cells were incubated with the following primary antibodies: anti-mCherry pAb (PA5-34974, Invitrogen) and mouse anti-AIM1 mAb (cat 611082, BD Transduction laboratories) in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. Then, the excess primary antibodies were washed three times using blocking buffer and subsequently incubated with Alexa Fluor 488- and 568-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher) for 90 min. Finally, cells were washed four times with blocking buffer, and the last wash contained DAPI (0.5 μg/mL) in PBS. Cells were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade and imaged on a Nikon Ti2-E Eclipse Confocal microscope.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry summary table for ISB free protein and ISB droplet protein datasets.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-92709-supp1-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>List of gene block sequences used to produce I<sub>Mut1</sub>SB, I<sub>Mut2</sub>SB, I<sub>Mut3</sub>SB, I<sub>Mut4</sub>SB, I<sub>Mut5</sub>SB, ISB<sub>Mut</sub>, and I<sub>Mut6</sub>SB<sub>Mut</sub> mutant proteins.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-92709-supp2-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-92709-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Source data are provided with this paper.

The work presented in the manuscript convincingly establishes HXMS as a useful tool to characterise molecular interactions driving liquid-liquid demixing.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer kindly stated in the initial review, our paper represents a ‘…highly relevant and significant work, particularly with the rapidly growing list of examples for Phase separation of protein/protein assemblies and their potential biological roles’ and that our experiments ‘solidly and convincing establish HXMS as a useful tool to characterize molecular interactions driving liquid-liquid demixing’ and ‘Considering its applicability to characterize wide-ranging protein assemblies implicated in phase separation, this work will be of interest to a broad readership’. We appreciate that the Reviewer is now satisfied with our revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referee #2:</p><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, the authors have now incorporated the necessary minor changes. The authors have also added interesting in vivo results correlating the presence of salt bridges in the ISB complex to its phase separation propensity inside cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing that we have made the necessary minor changes, for recognizing the interesting nature of our in vivo results, and for the additional comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>'By the latest timepoint, 3000 s, there was some diminution in the number of droplets (Figure 1E), which may indicate the start of a transition of the droplets to a more solid state (i.e., gellike).' The authors suggest that this transition from a liquid to gel-like state is a reasonable conclusion here and extends beyond the scope of this study. It will be an interesting direction to pursue to see the evolution of the material property of these condensates as a function of time to ascertain that this transition happens and if that is somehow relevant to its localization and subsequent function at the centromere.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion for further investigation to follow on the findings we report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It might still be pertinent to just include a comment as to why the condensates formed from the ISB complex diminish in size at 1000s (Figure 1E) and whether any of the parameters such as, circularity, droplet size, droplet intensity, as mentioned by the authors in Response no. 9, affect these measurements, irrespective of sedimentation assays showing similar concentration distributions between the condensed and dispersed phases, as it was clarified by the authors that sedimentation was not performed prior to HXMS measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified the relevant part of the Results section, as follows:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 9, 1st Paragraph in the main manuscript, ISB heterotetramers should be replaced with ISB heterotrimer.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Just a clarification, is the BorealinWT and BorealinMut-mCherry-Cry2 construct transfected into cells, the full length Borealin (280 aa) harboring the respective mutations, or is it the exact same construct used in the in vitro biochemical studies? Should be explicitly mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now added to explicitly mention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The addition of the in vivo cellular data where disruption of salt-bridges reduces phase separation in the cellular environment, is a good addition in the current version of manuscript and I am sure that is going to be a good starting point for future studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the encouragement moving forward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, this paper brings forward a useful technique to probe the conformational landscape of proteins in the condensed droplet phase and compare it with its dispersed phase. This paper serves as an interesting read showing how specific salt-bridge interactions between multiple stoichiometric protein complexes can be the driving force for phase separation and definitely forms the basis for future studies in a more physiologically relevant context</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer once again for the positive assessment of our work.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Your manuscript shows (with the caveats below, which we hope can be addressed) that hydrogen/deuterium-exchange followed by mass spec (HXMS) is a useful tool to understand relevant interactions for liquid-liquid demixing, at least when folded domains are involved.</p><p>Based on the previous reviews and the revisions, the manuscript has been improved but there are two remaining issues that we think need to be addressed:</p><p>(1) The characterization of the mutants using DIC and absorbance at a single time point (Figure 3C/D, 4C/D, etc.) seems insufficient-especially since Figure 1E shows that droplets can become fewer at later timepoints.

The practical aspects of the experiments means that we assay across a time span that goes from short time points (absorbance taken at about 100s after assembling the reaction) to intermediate ones (DIC at ~5 minutes after assembling reaction including the time to get onto the microscope) to sedimentation (where samples are isolated a total of ~12 minutes after initial assembling the reaction including the time for the actual sedimentation). Thus, if the mutants were altogether changed by changes in droplet behavior, it would have to have happened out past 12 minutes (and certainly past where any phase diagram experiment would be performed) and spanning the majority of the timepoints that we used to initially map where the relevant structural features of the ISB<sub>WT</sub> were protected by droplet formation. We thank the editors for suggesting that the present presentation passed over this important aspect, and in response we have highlighted the 3 distinct ways in which the mutants were assessed and how this spans timepoints past when the HX changes were measured.</p><p>Added on pg 9 of the Results section:</p><p>“We emphasize that the key mutants that break (including I<sub>mut6</sub>SB and ISB<sub>mut</sub>) and re-form (I<sub>mut6</sub>SB<sub>mut</sub>) the salt-bridge-mediated droplet formation underwent three different measurements (turbidity [Figures 4 and 5], microscope-based detection [Figures 4 and 5], and sedimentation-based determination of saturation concentration [Figures 5 and Figure 5 —figure supplement 1]). These different types of measurements vary by several minutes due to practical considerations relative to the time from initial reaction assembly. Thus, our conclusions about the phase separation of mutant versions of ISB heterotrimers are based on independent experiments that span the time window covered in our initial HXMS analysis of ISB<sub>WT</sub> (Figures 1 and 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In the optoDroplet assay that you use as in vivo evidence, it is critical to demonstrate that INCENP and Survivin are present in these droplets and/or that the Borealin constructs that have been introduced from a 1:1:1 complex with INCENP and Survivin, without an excess of free Borealin.

See the all-new Figure 6A, Figure 6 —figure supplement 1, and Figure 6 —figure supplement 2. We detected the CPC by assessing the localization of endogenous Aurora B, which is well understood to be directly bound to INCENP, and then through INCENP, indirectly to Survivin and Borealin. With the stronger focus now justified on inducible nuclear foci, we restricted our conclusions to that compartment, thereby re-analyzing the WT vs Mut data, as shown in the revised panel Figure 6C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The fact that it is contested whether the CPC forms functionally relevant biomolecular condensates in vivo does in our opinion not take away from the main message of your manuscript that HXMS could be an additional useful technique to understand liquid-liquid demixing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your work to guide us to extend and improve the manuscript in the manner described, above.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the third round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but minor remaining issues need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>(1) An image screen by eLife staff found a partial overlap between the WT images in Figure 1B and 3C.

We originally left this out because the difference in intensity between WT and mutant Borealin in the fixed-cell IF is not a distinct as in the live cell experiments in Figure 6B. We feel the difference is due to the way the cells are exposed to light. In the Figure 6, we use our microscope to expose cells to a controlled amount of light for the indicated times. In contrast, for IF as in Figure 6 —figure supplement 1A, we need to expose the whole coverslip so we simply put the cells on a light box for 10 minutes. This will expose cells to a tremendous amount of light leading to saturation effects. We have modified the figure legend to explain these differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) For the interpretability of the cellular experiment, it is critical that the levels of WT and mutant Borealin are similar.

In the images that we chose, we also show cells taken with identical imaging conditions and displayed with identical settings (the figure legend now states this as well). To directly address your concern we include a new panel (B) in Figure 6 —figure supplement 1, where we measured the nuclear mCherry intensity before the light exposure of each of the cells used to quantify the foci intensity in Figure 6C. The differences in the initial mCherry staining are not significant (p=0.9) between the WT and MUT constructs, but there is a significant difference in the intensity of foci formed by light.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Typos that could be fixed while revising:</p><p>- Line 97 &quot;mechanisms …is&quot; should be &quot;mechanisms… are&quot;</p><p>- Line 421 &quot;boreain&quot;</p><p>- Line 421: Please spell out full length (FL).</p><p>- Line 439 remove dash before WTISB_R.</p><p>- Line 494: Please spell out ND – presumably non-deuterated.</p><p>- Line 570: &quot;cells were quantified for the time of appearance of mCherry foci in the nucleus.&quot; The intensity of foci is quantified (Figure 6C), but not their time of appearance – so wording should probably be changed.
