Extensive research in the past has revealed that the PSD assembly directly communicates with actin cytoskeleton in the spine to coordinate activity-induced spine volume enlargement as well as long-term stable spine structure maintenance. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the communication between the PSD assembly and spine actin cytoskeleton is poorly understood. In this study, we discover that in vitro reconstituted PSD condensates can promote actin polymerization and F-actin bundling without help of any actin regulatory proteins. The Homer scaffold protein within the PSD condensates and a positively charged actin-binding surface of the Homer EVH1 domain are essential for the PSD condensate-induced actin bundle formation in vitro and for spine growth in neurons. Homer-induced actin bundling can only occur when Homer forms condensate with other PSD scaffold proteins such as Shank and SAPAP. The PSD-induced actin bundle formation is sensitively regulated by CaMKII or by the product of the immediate early gene <italic>Homer1a</italic>. Thus, the communication between PSD and spine cytoskeleton may be modulated by targeting the phase separation of the PSD condensates.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal synapses are highly dynamic in developing and in mature brains. In response to input signals, the physical sizes of a synapse can enlarge, shrink, or even disappear altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berry and Nedivi, 2017</xref>). Such physical changes are directly correlated with strengthening, weakening, or complete loss of signal transmission of the synapse, and thus are of fundamental importance in neuronal circuit formation and brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sutton and Schuman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takeuchi et al., 2014</xref>). Taking excitatory synapses for examples, stimulation of a synapse can induce rapid (in a matter of a few minutes) but transient spine volume enlargements due to selective enrichments of proteins such as actin and its regulatory proteins accompanied by overall increase of actin cytoskeletal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hering and Sheng, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mikhaylova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Okamoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Okamoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sekino et al., 2006</xref>). Such temporary destabilization of actin cytoskeletons is thought to be critical for subsequent overall cytoskeleton reorganization necessary for sustained spine enlargements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hering and Sheng, 2003</xref>). Long-term stabilization of an enlarged spine requires synthesis of new synaptic proteins, stabilization of actin filaments, and enlargement of the postsynaptic density (PSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bramham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sekino et al., 2007</xref>). It is generally perceived that long-term information storage in a synapse not only requires a stable PSD assembly containing certain densities of clustered glutamate receptors but also needs structural support by cross-linked actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basu and Lamprecht, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dillon and Goda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamprecht, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lei et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The PSD of a synapse is extremely dense and formed by hundreds of proteins via phase separation-mediated self-assembly beneath the synaptic plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blomberg et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harris and Weinberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). The PSD and actin cytoskeleton are tightly associated with each other in spines. Biochemically purified PSDs are enriched with actin and actin-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheng and Hoogenraad, 2007</xref>). Filamentous actins (F-actin), both in linear and branched forms, build a cross-linked matrix extending from spine head toward spine cytoplasm and shape the physical structure of spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burette et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cingolani and Goda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">FifkovÃ¡ and Delay, 1982</xref>). Electron microscopy (EM) studies revealed that actin cytoskeleton directly contacts and embraces PSD from the cytoplasmic side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korobova and Svitkina, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">RÃ¡cz and Weinberg, 2013</xref>). Super-resolution imaging studies showed that F-actin is initially nucleated at PSD and then elongates outward to the base of dendritic spine during spine growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chazeau et al., 2014</xref>). Treatment of neurons with F-actin depolymerization drugs such as latrunculin-A disrupts the organization of PSD nanodomains formed by scaffold proteins including PSD-95, SAPAP, Shank and Homer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerr and Blanpied, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuriu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">MacGillavry et al., 2013</xref>). Overexpression of Homer1 in cultured neurons promotes the synaptic enrichment of F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Usui et al., 2003</xref>). Conversely, removal or decrease of PSD scaffold proteins in neurons leads to severe synaptic growth defects, a phenotype that is directly related to dysregulation of actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang and Ehlers, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmeisser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Silverman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">WÃ¶hr et al., 2011</xref>). Autism-related mutations on Shank3 also cause altered expressions of PSD-enriched actin-binding proteins such as cofilin, cortactin, and Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joensuu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although communications between PSD and actin cytoskeleton during spinogenesis have been widely observed and extensively studied, molecular mechanisms underlying such communications are poorly understood. The poor mechanistic understanding of the communication between the PSD and spine actin cytoskeleton is at least in part due to the practical challenges of the system. Both PSD and actin cytoskeleton are large and heterogeneous molecular assemblies formed by phase separation or phase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). There are no suitable methods available for detailed mechanistic studies of two molecular assemblies formed by totally different modes of phase separation/transition. Another practical challenge for detailed mechanistic studies of the communication between the PSD and actin cytoskeleton is the awkward size of synapses, which is typically with a diameter below 0.5 Î¼m and near the limit of optical microscopy resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Palay, 1956</xref>). It is not trivial to study the molecular mechanism governing the large PSD assembly and the surrounding F-actin network within the tiny compartment of a dendritic spine in living neurons.</p><p>Biochemically reconstituted PSDs offer a unique platform for investigating and dissecting the underlying molecular mechanisms governing the interaction between the PSD assembly and actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we unexpectedly found that the PSD condensates devoid of any known actin-binding/regulatory proteins can promote actin polymerization and F-actin bundle formation. Remarkably, the lower layer of the PSD condensates formed by SAPAP, Shank and Homer are necessary and sufficient for inducing F-actin bundle formation, explaining that F-actin nucleates at the cytoplasmic side of PSD and emanates toward spine cytoplasm during synaptic growth. We further discovered that Homer and its EVH1 domain are essential for the PSD condensate-induced F-actin bundling. However, Homer can induce actin bundling only when it forms phase separated condensates with other PSD scaffold proteins. Accordingly, the communication between the PSD and actin cytoskeleton can be modulated by regulating the PSD condensate formation or dispersion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PSD condensate-induced F-actin bundle formation</title><p>Our previous study showed that the PSD condensates formed with multiple postsynaptic scaffold proteins (including PSD-95, SAPAP, Shank and Homer) could robustly induce bundling of F-actin in an in vitro reconstruction assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). Unexpectedly, such PSD condensate-mediated F-actin bundling was independent of actin regulatory proteins, as removal of the Arp2/3 complex from PSD condensates hardly affected F-actin bundling. This finding suggests that PSD condensates may directly induce F-actin bundling.</p><p>We took advantage of the biochemically reconstituted PSD system with defined components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>) to test the above hypothesis. We first assembled PSD condensates composed of six major synaptic proteins (Stg, PSD-95, SynGAP, SAPAP1 [also known as GKAP], Shank3 and Homer3, each at 10 Î¼M; the system is termed as 6Ã PSD), and then mixed the pre-formed PSD condensates with 5 Î¼M G-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescent microscopic imaging showed that rhodamine-labeled G-actin was rapidly enriched into PSD condensates (marked with iFluor-488-labeled PSD-95) upon mixing. Interestingly, dense actin signals continue to grow into fibrous structures after the mixing, but the PSD-95 signal remains as droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This observation is reminiscent of an earlier super-resolution imaging-based finding showing that, in cultured neurons, synaptic actin was first concentrated and nucleated at PSD and F-actin then emanated from PSD toward spine cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chazeau et al., 2014</xref>). It is noted that, in our reconstitution assay, actin was polymerized and bundled in the absence of any known actin regulatory molecules, suggesting that the PSD condensates can directly induce actin bundle formation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Postsynaptic density (PSD) condensate-mediated actin bundling requires Homer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram showing the molecular components of the PSD protein network for the actin bundling assay.

Our earlier study showed that Stg, PSD-95, and SynGAP form the upper layer (i.e., the layer closer to the PSD membrane) of the PSD assembly and GKAP, Shank3, and Homer3 form the lower layer of the PSD with the two layers connected by GKAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). The imaging data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâE</xref> seem to imply that the lower layer of the PSD, instead of the upper layer, directly interacts with and modulates the formation of actin bundles (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Interestingly, it has been shown that actin filaments in dendritic spine do not directly contact with proteins proximal to postsynaptic membranes (e.g., Stg and PSD-95). Instead, actin filaments interface with synaptic proteins such as Shank and Homer that reside at the deeper layer of the PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hotulainen and Hoogenraad, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Westin et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>F-actin bundling requires the phase separation of Homer</title><p>Consistent with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâE</xref>, a Stg, PSD-95, and SynGAP mixture (each at 10 Î¼M) underwent phase separation but could not induce actin bundle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F1</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In contrast, a GKAP, Shank3, and Homer3 mixture (each at 10 Î¼M) strongly induced F-actin bundling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), indicating that the lower layer of PSD proteins interacts with actin. Dropping Homer3 out from the GKAP, Shank3, and Homer3 mixture eliminated the actin bundle inducing capacity of the mixture, although the binary GKAP and Shank3 solution was still capable of undergoing phase separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Thus, Homer3 is an essential element for the low layer PSD condensates to induce actin bundling. We further showed that Homer1 could replace Homer3 for the GKAP, Shank3, and Homer3 mixture to induce actin bundle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), indicating that all members of the Homer family proteins, when together with Shank and GKAP, can induce actin bundle formation. As a control, individual GKAP, Shank3, or Homer1 (each at 10 Î¼M) could not induce actin bundle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). To check whether higher concentrations of total proteins may also facilitate F-actin bundling, we mixed 5 ÂµM actin with 60 ÂµM Homer3 or 60 ÂµM BSA. No F-actin bundling was observed in either condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

Taken together, the above imaging-based assays revealed that the Homer family scaffold proteins, upon forming condensates with other PSD proteins via phase separation, can induce actin bundle formation. The F-actin bundling activity of the Homer-containing PSD condensates is stronger than that of CaMKIIÎ², which is a well-known F-actin-binding/bundling protein in synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Homer uses the EVH1 domain to bundle actin upon phase separation</title><p>We next searched for the molecular mechanisms underlying Homer-dependent actin bundling by the PSD condensates. Homer is a multi-domain scaffold protein in PSD. All three Homer family members (Homer1, -2 and -3) share a similar domain organization, each with an N-terminal EVH1 (Ena/Vasp homology domain 1) domain, an unstructured linker, and a C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The EVH1 domain of Homer binds to the proline-rich motifs (PRMs) of different synaptic targets (e.g., Shank, mGluR, IP<sub>3</sub>R, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peterson and Volkman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shiraishi-Yamaguchi and Furuichi, 2007</xref>), and the C-terminal CC is responsible for forming Homer tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayashi et al., 2009</xref>). To locate the region in Homer responsible for actin bundling, we designed two Homer3 chimeras, each with a comparable phase separation capacity with that of the WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Such design allowed us to uncouple possible direct Homer/actin interaction with the phase separation of the system. For the first chimera, we replaced Homer3 CC with the CC domain of the tetrameric GCN4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">OâShea et al., 1991</xref>) to probe a possible role of the Homer3 CC domain in actin bundling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, middle panel). The second chimera was designed to probe a possible role of the EVH1 domain of Homer3 in actin bundling. We substituted the EVH1 domain with the second SH3 domain from RIM-binding protein (named as rSH3), which is a presynaptic active zone protein. Concomitantly, we replaced the Homer-binding sequence (HBS) of Shank3 with the corresponding rSH3 binding PRM from RIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel). Since rSH3 binds to PRM of RIM with an affinity very similar to that of Homer3 EVH1 to HBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), the mode of the interaction between the Homer3 chimera to the Shank3 mutant should be very similar to that between the WT Homer3 and Shank3. As expected, the designed Homer3 chimeras each formed condensates with Shank3 and GKAP as WT Homer3 did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, only the EVH1-GCN4 chimera of Homer3, when together with Shank3 and GKAP, was capable of strongly inducing actin bundle formation. The rSH3-CC chimera of Homer3 totally lost its capacity in inducing actin bundle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the EVH1 domain of Homer is essential for the PSD condensate-induced F-actin bundling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Homer in postsynaptic density (PSD) condensates uses its EVH1 domain to bundle actin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram showing the domain organizations and detailed interactions among GKAP, Shank3, and Homer3.

We hypothesized that the Arg-containing charged surface of EVH1 might be involved in the Homer-actin interaction. To test this hypothesis, we performed phase separation experiments to assay actin bindings of WT Homer1 or a Homer1 mutant with the three Arg residues replaced with Glu (âHomer1-R3Eâ). Consistent with the structural analysis of the Homer EVH1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)-based binding experiments revealed that the R3E mutation did not alter the binding of Homer1 to Shank3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Additionally, both imaging- and sedimentation-based phase separation assays revealed that Homer1-WT and Homer1-R3E had similar phase separation capability with Shank3 and GKAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>), indicating that the R3E mutation does not impact the phase separation properties of Homer1. Satisfyingly, when mixed with Shank3 and GKAP, Homer1-R3E displayed a dramatically reduced actin bundling activity compared to Homer1-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Similarly, the Homer1-R3E-containing 6Ã PSD condensates were essentially incapable of inducing actin bundle formation, but the Homer1-WT containing 6Ã PSD condensates could robustly induce actin bundle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). In the Homer1-R3E-containing 6Ã PSD condensates, actin was largely diffused in solution but with some degree of enrichments in droplets of the PSD condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The above results revealed that the Arg residue-containing surface of the Homer EVH1 domain is essential for binding to actin and inducing actin bundle formation. The R3E mutation selectively abolishes the actin bundling capacity of Homer1.

We found that Homer1a effectively prevented PSD condensate formation and actin bundling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). We then asked whether pre-formed PSD condensates and resulting bundled actin might be dispersed by addition of Homer1a, an experimental design mimicking Homer1a-induced PSD downscaling in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vazdarjanova et al., 2002</xref>).

The lamellipodia localization of Homer1-mCherry was specific as expressed mCherry tag was not localized in lamellipodia, but mainly diffused in cytosol and enriched in nuclei instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). The lamellipodia localization of Homer1 was significantly impaired by the R3E mutation of Homer1 (âHomer1-R3Eâ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5GâH</xref>). Importantly, the disrupted lamellipodia localization of the R3E mutation could be rescued by inserting the actin-binding EVH1 domain of Enah (i.e., the âHomer-3E+ENâ chimera) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5GâH</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Actin binding is important for the synaptic localization and functions of Homer</title><p>Finally, we studied the physiological relevance of Homer-mediated actin binding in neurons by using Homer1-WT, Homer1-R3E, and Homer1-R3E+EN constructs. We first compared the synaptic targeting of all three Homer constructs exogenously expressed in cultured mice hippocampal neurons. Homers are highly enriched in dendritic spines in neurons according to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sala et al., 2001</xref>). Overexpressed Homer1-WT-mCherry also displayed a strong synaptic localization in cultured hippocampal neurons, as the averaged spine-to-shaft ration of Homer1-WT-mCherry was significantly higher than mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AâC</xref>). In contrast, Homer1-R3E-mCherry mutant showed a remarkably reduced synaptic enrichment compared with Homer1-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AâC</xref>). Notably, such decreased synaptic localization of Homer1-R3E-mCherry protein was fully rescued by Homer1-R3E+EN-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AâC</xref>). In conclusion, we conclude that the actin binding of Homer is essential for the synaptic targeting of Homer.

Overexpression of PSD scaffolds like Shank and Homer proteins is known to induce spine enlargement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sala et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoon et al., 2021</xref>). We then asked whether spine enlargement induced by Homer requires the specific Homer-actin interaction. As expected, overexpression of Homer1-WT-mCherry in cultured mice hippocampal neurons significantly increased the widths of spine heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and D</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of the Homer-R3E mutant did not increase the widths of the spine heads, but instead slightly reduced the spine head size when compared to the mCherry control possibly due to the dominant negative effect of the mutant. Importantly, the Homer1-R3E+EN-mCherry protein, much like Homer1-WT-mCherry, also induced spine head enlargement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and D</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the EVH1-mediated interaction between Homer and actin is critical for Homer-induced spine maturation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The most salient finding of the current study is the direct communication between the PSD condensates and actin cytoskeleton. We found that actin polymerization can nucleate at PSD condensates and subsequently bundled actin can emanate from PSD condensates. The communication between PSD condensates and actin cytoskeleton requires direct binding between Homer and actin as well as Homer to form condensed molecular assembly with other PSD scaffold proteins. The direct communication between the PSD condensates and the actin cytoskeleton may have multiple implications on the structural plasticity of synapses. An enlarged PSD condensate can promote F-actin network formation; in return a more exuberant actin cytoskeleton may provide structural support to stabilize an enlarged PSD and thus support structural stability of a potentiated synapse. Conversely, shrinking of the PSD in a de-potentiated synapse can cause destabilization of the synaptic actin network; in return the weakened actin cytoskeleton further destabilizes the PSD and eventually leads to overall spine shrinkage. Most likely, numerous actin regulatory proteins existing in dendritic spines may either work together with the PSD condensates or in distinct processes in modulating spine actin cytoskeleton network.</p><p>We found that the Homer-containing PSD condensates, instead of Homer alone, can promote actin bundle formation. This discovery implies that the synaptic actin network can be modulated by targeting PSD condensates without directly interfering Homer/actin interaction. Indeed, the Homer1a can effectively disperse the PSD condensates and destabilize already formed bundled actin filaments. Homer1a is the gene product of the alternatively splice isoform of <italic>Homer1c</italic> lacking the C-terminal CC domain. Thus, although the bindings to its targets including actin and Shank is not affected by the alternative splicing, the monomeric Homer1a can sensitively modulate PSD condensate formation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). The expression level of Homer1a is tightly coupled to synaptic activities and increase of Homer1a expression is known to be inversely correlated with the downscaling of synapses as well as PSD sizes in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sala et al., 2003</xref>). Our study in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> showed that Homer1a can rapidly disperse PSD condensates. With a delay, Homer1a-mediated PSD condensate dispersion leads to destabilization of bundled actin, indicating that the bundled actin filaments are indeed stabilized by PSD condensates. Many factors can regulate PSD condensate formation or dispersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the PSD condensates may serve as a hub to connect different synaptic regulatory signals to the spine actin cytoskeletons.</p><p>CaMKIIÎ±-mediated phosphorylation of Homer3, but not the other isoforms of Homer, is another unique mechanism underlying the regulated communication between PSD condensates and actin cytoskeleton. It has been observed that synaptic stimulation induces rapid CaMKIIÎ± activation (within a few minutes) accompanied by transient disassembly of actin filaments in dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basu and Lamprecht, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dillon and Goda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamprecht, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lei et al., 2016</xref>). Our study revealed that CaMKIIÎ± phosphorylates specific Ser residues in the central linker region immediately following the EVH1 domain. Introduction of negative charges near the basic charged EVH1 domain by the phosphorylation disrupts the Homer3/actin binding. The net consequence of CaMKIIÎ± phosphorylation of Homer3 in PSD is detachment of actin filaments from the PSD condensates and subsequent increase of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, a step critical for activity-induced synaptic remodeling and long-term stabilization. CaMKIIÎ± and -Î² are both enriched in synapses and can form hetero-dodecamers. The two isoforms of the kinase share very similar catalytic activities toward their substrates, but CaMKIIÎ² in its active state can also bind to and bundle actin filaments. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced autophosphorylation of CaMKIIÎ² disrupts its actin binding and bundling activity. Thus, under the resting condition, CaMKIIÎ² and Homer3 can both bind to actin filaments. Upon stimulation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx can lead to rapid Homer phosphorylation by CaMKII as both the kinase and Homer3 are anchored on actin filaments.</p><p>In summary, we discovered in this study that the PSD condensates and actin cytoskeleton, two major synaptic molecular assemblies formed via phase separation/transition, directly communicate with each other, forming a mutually reinforcing system capable of modulating synaptic plasticity. The interaction between the PSD condensates and actin cytoskeleton can be modulated by elements such as CaMKII and the immediate early gene product <italic>Homer1a</italic>, both of which are key synaptic plasticity regulators.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Sequences coding various proteins were generated using standard PCR-based methods, each cloned into a vector containing an N-terminal Trx-His<sub>6</sub> or a His<sub>6</sub>-affinity tag followed by an HRV 3C cutting site.

promote actin polymerization and filamentous actin bundling in the absence of other actin regulatory proteins. The authors further show that the EVH1 domain of Homer is responsible for this activity, which is also regulated by CaMKII. Together, this convincing evidence provides the fundamental insight that the crosstalk between PSD and the spine cytoskeleton may be modulated by targeting the phase separation of the PSD condensates.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84446.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Kang</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00f54p054</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Milovanovic</surname><given-names>Dragomir</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/043j0f473</institution-id><institution>German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.12.06.519305">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.06.519305v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Dragomir Milovanovic (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are several issues that can be further improved by additional control experiments or discussions on the shortcomings of the current form (if you do not want to provide further experimental evidence).</p><p>1) Quantitative assessment of in vitro experiments, statistical analyses: several of the in vitro experiments might gain from statistical analyses; examples are Figures 3E, 3G, 4B, 4I, and 4K. These experiments are used to establish effects, it is unclear why they are not statistically analyzed for the presence of differences. If the authors think that it is inappropriate to do so, it should be stated why and a word of caution on the conclusions may be appropriate.</p><p>2) Localization and roles of Homer proteins in neurons: the analyses of the experiments in Figure 6 seem preliminary. It is shown that transfected Homer1 (WT, R3E, R3E+EN) induces changes in spine width monitored by co-transfected GFP. R3E disrupts the ability of Homer1 to enhance spine head width, and restoring actin binding via the addition of EN restores it partially. It is important to assess whether the three Homer versions used in this experiment are expressed at similar levels and localized similarly. From the presented data, it seems that these analyses should be possible without new experiments. From the sample images, it seems that the R3E mutant Homer1 does not localize to spines, while the other versions do. The interpretation of this experiment is very different if actin-binding of Homer1 is necessary for the delivery of Homer1 to spines vs. Homer1 is localized to spines independent of its ability to bind to actin, but spine head width is controlled by Homer's ability to bind to actin.</p><p>3) It is well established that molecular crowding plays a crucial role in F-actin bundling. For example, in the reconstitution assays in Figure 1, the authors use 10 ÂµM of each component of PSD (total of 60 ÂµM), to which 5 ÂµM actin is added. Yet, in their control assays (Supp. Figure 1), only 10 ÂµM of each protein was checked with the same amount of actin. A control is missing where the total protein crowding would be preserved, for example, by adding BSA or protein to mimic non-specific protein crowding.</p><p>4) Is the F-bunding observed under these physiological ratios of PSD proteins and actin? For instance, a recent quantitative study (PMID: 34168338) suggests actin:Homer-1 is 200:1 or 100:1, which is in stark difference from the 1:2 molar ratio used in the study. The protein concentrations (molar ratios) need to match the physiological.</p><p>5) The imaging assay in hippocampal neurons uses an increased spine head size as a proxy for F-actin bundling. However, one needs to be careful as the baseline includes soluble mCherry, which is both much smaller in size and does not specifically enrich in the spines. The image of Homer 1 R3E shows overall lower localization at the spines. Thus, one cannot exclude that the spine enlargement upon overexpression of Homer 1 wt and R3E+EN is not primarily driven by their overall enrichment in the PSD phase. A suitable control for this assay would be mCherry-tagged PSD95, which would localize to the spines yet is not directly involved in F-actin bundling.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific Recommendations:</p><p>1. Quantitative assessment of in vitro experiments, statistical analyses: several of the in vitro experiments might gain from statistical analyses; examples are Figures 3E, 3G, 4B, 4I, and 4K. These experiments are used to establish effects, it is unclear why they are not statistically analyzed for the presence of differences.

If the authors think that it is inappropriate to do so, it should be stated why and a word of caution on the conclusions may be appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important issue. We performed statistical analysis of all the results as the reviewers asked. The details are included in the updated figures. The updated figures include Figures 3C 3E, 3G, 4B, 4I, and 4K (with corresponding descriptions added in the text of the manuscript). Student t-tests was used for all the analyses. These statistical results support the conclusions that we have drawn in the original version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Localization and roles of Homer proteins in neurons: the analyses of the experiments in Figure 6 seem preliminary. It is shown that transfected Homer1 (WT, R3E, R3E+EN) induces changes in spine width monitored by co-transfected GFP. R3E disrupts the ability of Homer1 to enhance spine head width, and restoring actin binding via the addition of EN restores it partially. It is important to assess whether the three Homer versions used in this experiment are expressed at similar levels and localized similarly. From the presented data, it seems that these analyses should be possible without new experiments. From the sample images, it seems that the R3E mutant Homer1 does not localize to spines, while the other versions do. The interpretation of this experiment is very different if actin-binding of Homer1 is necessary for the delivery of Homer1 to spines vs. Homer1 is localized to spines independent of its ability to bind to actin, but spine head width is controlled by Homer's ability to bind to actin.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this insightful point. It is important to know the impact of the mutations on Homer1âs synaptic targeting before assessing their potential roles in synaptic functions. We quantified the spine-to-shaft signal ratio of each construct expressed in the cultured neurons. Consistent with the observation of the reviewer, we found that Homer1-WT and Homer1-R3E+EN are more enriched in synapses than mCherry or Homer1-R3E (updated Figure 6). The result suggests that disrupting Homer/actin interaction can weaken the synaptic localization of Homer in spines, and thus the Homer1-R3E mutant is less capable in promoting spine head enlargement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is well established that molecular crowding plays a crucial role in F-actin bundling. For example, in the reconstitution assays in Figure 1, the authors use 10 ÂµM of each component of PSD (total of 60 ÂµM), to which 5 ÂµM actin is added. Yet, in their control assays (Supp. Figure 1), only 10 ÂµM of each protein was checked with the same amount of actin. A control is missing where the total protein crowding would be preserved, for example, by adding BSA or protein to mimic non-specific protein crowding.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for raising this point. We have performed a control experiment during the revision as suggested by the reviewer. To check whether higher concentrations of total proteins may also facilitate F-actin bundling, we performed a control experiment in which we mixed 5 ÂµM actin with 60 ÂµM Homer3 or 60 ÂµM BSA. We did not observe any F-actin bundling under these crowded conditions (added as Figure S1B in the revised manuscript), further supporting that phase separation of Homer with other PSD scaffold proteins are essential for Homer-mediated actin bundling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Is the F-bunding observed under these physiological ratios of PSD proteins and actin? For instance, a recent quantitative study (PMID: 34168338) suggests actin:Homer-1 is 200:1 or 100:1, which is in stark difference from the 1:2 molar ratio used in the study. The protein concentrations (molar ratios) need to match the physiological.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, actin is a super-abundant synaptic protein. However, most of actin would be in polymerized filamentous forms, and monomeric actin concentration in spines should not be very high. Our in vitro actin bundling assay is to test whether the Homer1-containg PSD condensate can facilitate actin polymerization and F-actin bundling. Thus, we only used a low actin monomer concentration (5 ÂµM) for our assay. If the Homer1-containg PSD condensate can bundle actin filaments at this low actin concentration, similar actin bundling should occur when the free actin concentration is higher than 5 ÂµM. Nonetheless, we agree with the reviewer that the ratio of PSD proteins to actin monomer in our assay may affect actin polymerization. We looked into this issue during the revision. A protein ratio of 100:1 or 200:1 (actin:PSD proteins) is technically impractical in our assay system. Instead, we tried a 1:0.5 molar ratio (i.e., 5 ÂµM actin with 2.5 ÂµM Homer/Shank/GKAP complex). The PSD condensates mediated F-actin bundling was robustly observed (see Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The imaging assay in hippocampal neurons uses an increased spine head size as a proxy for F-actin bundling. However, one needs to be careful as the baseline includes soluble mCherry, which is both much smaller in size and does not specifically enrich in the spines. The image of Homer 1 R3E shows overall lower localization at the spines. Thus, one cannot exclude that the spine enlargement upon overexpression of Homer 1 wt and R3E+EN is not primarily driven by their overall enrichment in the PSD phase. A suitable control for this assay would be mCherry-tagged PSD95, which would localize to the spines yet is not directly involved in F-actin bundling.</p></disp-quote><p>We did find that Homer1-WT and Homer1-R3E+EN are more enriched in the synapse than mCherry or Homer1-R3E (see updated Figure 6 and our corresponding description in point #2 above). This result suggests that actin-binding is required for Homer to localize in synapses. The dendritic spines are sensitive to PSD protein concentrations and overexpression of any of the scaffold proteins (PSD-95, GKAP, Shank, Homer) used in this study would increase the spine size. Thus, these proteins might not be good controls for the assay in this study. One way to mitigate this is to quantify the spine targeting of each Homer1 mutant as described in our response to the point #2 above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
