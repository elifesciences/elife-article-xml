elusive. Previous studies on the highly branched <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> PVD sensory neuron identified a membrane co-receptor complex that links extracellular signals to intracellular actin remodeling machinery, promoting high-order dendrite branching. In this complex, the claudin-like transmembrane protein HPO-30 recruits the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) to dendrite branching sites, stimulating the Arp2/3 complex to polymerize actin. We report here our biochemical and structural analysis of this interaction, revealing that the intracellular domain (ICD) of HPO-30 is intrinsically disordered and employs two distinct mechanisms to regulate the actin cytoskeleton. First, HPO-30 ICD binding to the WRC requires dimerization and involves the entire ICD sequence, rather than a short linear peptide motif. This interaction enhances WRC activation by the GTPase Rac1. Second, HPO-30 ICD directly binds to the sides and barbed end of actin filaments. Binding to the barbed end requires ICD dimerization and inhibits both actin polymerization and depolymerization, resembling the actin capping protein CapZ. These dual functions provide an intriguing model of how membrane proteins can integrate distinct mechanisms to fine-tune local actin dynamics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dendrite branching</kwd><kwd>actin cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>capping protein</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered protein</kwd><kwd>neuronal receptor</kwd><kwd>Arp2/3 complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Department of Biology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Baoyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001024</institution-id><institution>Roy J.

Various molecules can recruit the WRC to the membrane and/or simultaneously activate it through direct interactions, releasing the WCA to promote Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization. These ligands include small GTPases (e.g. Rac1 and Arf), acidic phospholipids (e.g. PIP<sub>3</sub>), adaptor proteins, and a wide array of membrane proteins containing the WIRS motif (WRC interacting receptor sequence, defined as Φ-x-T/S-F-x-x, where Φ is a bulky hydrophobic residue and x is any residue) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ding et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Eden et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kobayashi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Koronakis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lebensohn and Kirschner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rottner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Many WIRS-containing membrane proteins, such as SYG-1, Robo, DCC, Neogenin, TMEM132, neuroligins, and various protocadherins, are essential neuronal receptors that depend on the WIRS-WRC interaction to regulate diverse neural development processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaudhari et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chaudhari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Fan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Xing et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In previous studies, the claudin-like receptor HPO-30 was identified as a novel WRC-binding protein, which does not contain a WIRS motif. The HPO-30-WRC interaction is essential for high-order dendrite branching in the PVD sensory neuron in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zou et al., 2016</xref>). HPO-30 acts as a co-receptor with the cell adhesion molecule DMA-1. The extracellular domain of DMA-1 forms a multi-ligand complex with the secreted protein LECT-2 and the extracellular domains of the epidermal cell receptors SAX-7 and MNR-1, providing spatial cues for initiating dendrite branching in PVD neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zou et al., 2016</xref>). The intracellular domain (ICD) of HPO-30 directly binds to the WRC, while the ICD of DMA-1 binds the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) TIAM-1, increasing the local concentration of activated Rac1, the canonical activator of WRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zou et al., 2018</xref>). Together, the HPO-30-DMA-1 co-receptor organizes a multi-protein complex that bridges extracellular cues to the intracellular actin remodeling machinery to regulate high-order dendrite branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zou et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The interaction mechanism between HPO-30 ICD and the WRC remains elusive, and it is uncertain if the ICD has additional functions beyond its WRC binding activity. Unlike other WRC-binding membrane proteins, HPO-30 ICD lacks a WIRS motif and uses a non-WIRS mechanism for WRC interaction. Prior research has shown that deletion of the C-terminal half of the HPO-30 ICD strongly affects WRC binding in vitro and high-order dendrite branching in vivo. However, it is unclear whether the HPO-30 ICD uses a linear peptide motif analogous to the WIRS motif for WRC binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zou et al., 2018</xref>). Although HPO-30 shares homology with mammalian tight junction claudin proteins, its ICD sequence is conserved only in nematode worms. Intriguingly, HPO-30 ICD binds to both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and human WRC, suggesting a conserved interaction mechanism across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zou et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, understanding the HPO-30-WRC interaction is critical for identifying other potential membrane proteins that regulate the WRC in humans through the same interaction surface.</p><p>In this study, we conducted biochemical and structural analyses of the HPO-30-WRC interaction. Our findings reveal that the HPO-30 ICD differs from other WRC-interacting receptors, as the entire ICD sequence—rather than a short peptide motif like the WIRS—is involved in the interaction. We also discovered that dimerization is necessary for HPO-30 ICD to bind to the WRC, which works cooperatively with Rac1 to promote WRC activation. Surprisingly, we found that the HPO-30 ICD directly interacts with actin filaments in a dimerization-dependent manner. The dimeric form of HPO-30 ICD binds to both the side and the barbed end of actin filaments, inhibiting both actin polymerization and depolymerization, resembling the activity of the actin capping protein CapZ. These dual activities of HPO-30 ICD present a fascinating example of how a membrane receptor can regulate local actin dynamics by simultaneously controlling the localization and activity of a central actin nucleation factor and directly binding to and modulating actin filaments to support an essential biological process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HPO-30 ICD uses the entire sequence, rather than a short peptide motif, to bind the WRC</title><p>The HPO-30 ICD lacks a WIRS motif, which led us to hypothesize that it might use a different linear motif to bind the WRC.

This finding supports the previous qualitative data obtained under suboptimal pull-down conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zou et al., 2018</xref>). It is worth noting that while most mutants contained an N-terminal GST-tag, several mutations near the C-terminus of the ICD used a C-terminal GST-tag to improve the yield of full-length protein (∆8–10 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, lanes 10–13 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HPO-30 intracellular domain (ICD) binds to the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) using its entire sequence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: Cartoon representation of HPO-30 as a four-pass transmembrane protein, with the ICD binding to the WRC.

More extensive mutations in the ICD, either in the N-terminal, middle, or C-terminal regions, more severely disrupted the binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref> ∆11–14). These data suggest that the entire ICD sequence is involved in interacting with the WRC. This is distinct from WIRS-containing membrane proteins where the WIRS motif is essential for binding the WRC, and sequences outside the WIRS motif have only marginal contributions, if any (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>HPO-30 ICD contains residual structural elements, but is predominantly disordered in solution</title><p>Two potential models could explain how the entire ICD of HPO-30 binds to the WRC: either the ICD might fold into a three-dimensional structure to bind, or the ICD might exist as an extended linear peptide that makes an extensive contact with the WRC. To distinguish between these two models and understand how the binding occurs, we investigated the structure of the ICD using various approaches.</p><p>First, we submitted the sequence of ICD to multiple in silico structural prediction software. These programs include secondary structure analyses (JPred, PredictProtein, PSIPred, and SABLE) and ab initio tertiary structure predictions (LOMETS, QUACK, RaptorX, Rosetta, AlphaFold 2.0, and RoseTTAFold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamczak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernhofer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonneau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Drozdetskiy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Källberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">McGuffin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Minkyung et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wu and Zhang, 2007</xref>). Nearly all programs predicted that the ICD contains a short alpha helix followed by two short beta strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This is distinct from WIRS-containing proteins, where the WIRS motif must reside in unstructured sequences for proper binding. It is noteworthy that the sequences most critical for binding, such as ∆5, ∆6, and ∆7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, are within or close to these secondary structural elements. In contrast to the consistent secondary structure prediction, however, tertiary structure predictions yielded varied results, in which the secondary structural elements are folded differently depending on the program and the context of ICD sequence (isolated ICD vs. full-length HPO-30) used for the predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The variability observed in the predictions suggests that the ICD may not adopt a well-defined three-dimensional structure, but rather may exist as a large and heterogeneous conformational ensemble.</p><p>To further assess these structural predictions, we performed a series of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the AMBER99SB-disp force field, which combines a new generation of water model with parameters specifically designed to capture the behavior of partially disordered proteins in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Robustelli et al., 2018</xref>). The top-ranking conformations from all eight predictions were subjected to 200 ns simulations to assess the conformational stability of the predicted structural models. The trajectories showed significant conformational fluctuations, with large root mean square deviation (RMSD) up to 20 Å from their corresponding initial models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The snapshots of the simulated molecules revealed major random reorganization of the structural elements, suggesting that the predicted tertiary structures were transient or unstable conformations, or may require specific conditions or contexts to exist. Notably, in almost all simulated structures, the alpha-helical region remained relatively stable, supporting its presence in the largely disordered ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, these in silico analyses suggest that while the ICD may contain structural elements, it is likely disordered and does not possess a stable conformation in solution.</p><p>To experimentally validate the above computational analyses, we used circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to evaluate HPO-30 ICD secondary structure composition in solution. In agreement with the MD simulations, the CD spectrum of ICD did not display major peaks at the wavelengths characteristic of either alpha helices (positive at 193 nm and negative at 218 and 222 nm) or beta sheets (positive at 195 nm and negative at 217 nm), clearly distinct from the CD spectrum of bovine serum albumin (BSA) obtained under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Adding an osmolyte, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which is commonly used to promote protein folding, did not significantly alter the CD spectrum or enhance the ICD-WRC interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baskakov et al., 1999</xref>). Yet, careful examination of the CD spectrum revealed that the ICD is different from unstructured proteins, which typically exhibit a positive peak at 222 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hwang and Waite, 2012</xref>). This suggests that the HPO-30 ICD might contain some structural elements, possibly a helical region, as reflected by the negative peak at 222 nm.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>HPO-30 intracellular domain (ICD) is largely disordered but may contain secondary structural elements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CD spectrum of 2 mg/mL untagged HPO-30 ICD or bovine serum albumin (BSA) in identical buffer conditions (see Materials and methods).

The <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of untagged <sup>15</sup>N-labeled ICD were well resolved, from which we identified 50 distinct amide crosspeaks, out of the 51 expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The narrow <sup>1</sup>H chemical shift dispersion was consistent with our CD spectroscopy analysis and suggested that the ICD is predominantly disordered in solution. Fusing the ICD to two different solubility tags, including the monomeric 56 a.a. tag GB1 (B1 domain of streptococcal protein G, commonly used in NMR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zhou and Wagner, 2010</xref>) and the dimeric GST-tag, did not cause any significant chemical shift changes to the ICD crosspeaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>), suggesting that solubility tags and dimerization do not promote ICD folding. Moreover, the NMR spectra were nearly identical at different protein concentrations (50–700 µM) and temperatures (283–298K), suggesting that the ICD alone does not undergo concentration-dependent structural changes (data not shown).</p><p>While the 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N NMR spectroscopy can provide an overall assessment of the degree of structural disorder based on the magnitude of the <sup>1</sup>H chemical shift dispersion, a precise characterization of secondary structure content requires measuring the chemical shifts values of individual backbone nuclei. <sup>13</sup>C chemical shift values measured for carbons alpha are particularly strong indicators of secondary structure motifs. We therefore collected a set of conventional 3D triple resonance experiments (HNCA, HNCO, and HN(CO)CA) and were able to assign the backbone chemical shifts (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N, and <sup>13</sup>C) of 41 out of 51 a.a. of the ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

However, we observed small but consistent positive secondary Cα chemical shifts, suggesting the presence of a transient (~25–30%) alpha-helical motif in the same region that was predicted to form an alpha helix in many of the ab initio predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Although we could not obtain adequate signals for Cβ atoms, the chemical shift of CO was consistent with the Cα chemical shift data, further confirming that the same region of the ICD contained ~25–30% helical motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>Together, our data suggest that the HPO-30 ICD is predominantly disordered in solution, although it does contain some local secondary structures that could potentially fold into different conformations.

We first developed a new WRC construct in which a dual MBP-tag, (MBP)<sub>2</sub>, was tethered to the WRC. This (MBP)<sub>2</sub>-WRC would allow us to immobilize the WRC on amylose beads to pull down different monomeric vs. dimeric forms of HPO-30 ICD. Out of three different designs of (MBP)<sub>2</sub>-WRC, only the one with an (MBP)<sub>2</sub> tag tethered to the C-terminus of Abi2 through sortase-mediated protein ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2011</xref>) effectively pulled down GST-HPO-30 ICD (herein referred to as WRC:Abi2-(MBP)<sub>2</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), while the other two versions substantially interfered with the interaction. One construct, WRC:(MBP)<sub>2</sub>-HSPC300, has an (MBP)<sub>2</sub> tag fused to the N-terminus of HSPC300 which was previously used to immobilize the WRC and pull down WIRS-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, lane 6 vs 8), and the other, WRC:(MBP)<sub>2</sub>-Abi2, has (MBP)<sub>2</sub> fused to the N-terminus of Abi2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the regions near the N-terminus of HSPC300 or Abi2 are close to the HPO-30 ICD binding surface (but not the WIRS binding surface).</p><p>Using WRC:Abi2-(MBP)<sub>2</sub>, we compared the binding of ICDs that carry various monomeric vs. dimeric tags. We observed that the dimeric form of GB1-ICD (referred to as GB1-CC-ICD, in which we inserted a homodimeric coiled-coil sequence between GB1 and the ICD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">O’Shea et al., 1991</xref>) exhibited much stronger binding than the monomeric GB1-ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the tag sequences, rather than dimerization, influenced protein binding, we introduced chemically inducible dimerization (CID) tags, FKBP and FRB, to the ICD (with the GB1 tag at the N-terminus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banaszynski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In the presence of the dimerizing agent rapamycin, GB1-FKBP-ICD and GB1-FRB-ICD could form a tight heterodimer, as confirmed by size exclusion chromatography in the presence and absence of rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). Consistent with results from the constitutive dimeric tags, the addition of rapamycin to dimerize GB1-FKBP/FRB-ICD (F/F-ICD for short hereafter) clearly promoted the binding of HPO-30 ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes 2 vs 3). In fact, we observed robust binding of all dimeric constructs we tested, including GST-ICD, ICD-GST, and DLC8-ICD (DLC8 is a constitutive dimer from the dynein light chain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, all monomeric constructs including GB1-ICD, sumo-ICD, and mEGFP-ICD exhibited very weak, if any, binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).</p><p>ICD binding relies on the dimerization tags to bring two copies of ICD in close proximity, because a heterodimer containing only one copy of ICD (formed by mixing GB1-FKBP-ICD with GB1-FRB tag) was unable to support binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lanes 5–6). Similarly, a heterodimer containing one WT ICD and one mutant ICD (alanine ∆5 mutation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) had weakened binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>). It is important to note that when using the heterodimeric ICDs, we maintained the same total monomeric concentration of the WT ICD between heterodimers and homodimers. Thus, the lack of binding from heterodimers was due to the absence of the WT ICD dimer rather than a reduction in WT ICD concentration.</p><p>Various competition assays further support the observation that only dimeric form of the ICD can effectively bind to WRC. For example, even when added in 5000-fold excess, the chemically synthesized HPO-30 ICD peptide could not compete off GST-ICD binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In contrast, both F/F-ICD and DLC8-ICD binding to the WRC could be effectively competed off by GST-ICD in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Moreover, F/F-ICD was able to compete off GST-ICD binding to WRC only in the presence of rapamycin, but not in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). Taken together, our data strongly suggest that dimerization of the HPO-30 ICD is critical for its binding to the WRC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>HPO-30 ICD can self-associate</title><p>How do dimeric tags promote ICD binding to WRC? We hypothesized that dimeric tags facilitate ICD dimerization, and only dimerized ICD can bind to WRC. To test this hypothesis, we first examined whether the ICD could interact with another copy of ICD, which would indicate the potential for ICD dimerization. Indeed, we found GST-ICD effectively pulled down MBP-ICD, indicating self-interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This is consistent with our co-immunoprecipitation assay, which showed that HA-tagged full-length HPO-30 retained Myc-tagged full-length HPO-30 when co-expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The ICD-ICD interaction was readily disrupted by increased salt concentration (not shown) or higher pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that the interaction likely involves electrostatic interactions. We further asked which region in the HPO-30 ICD was important for the ICD-ICD interaction. Using the same alanine scan mutants as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, we found that mutations in various regions impaired the ICD-ICD interaction, especially the N-terminal (∆1 and ∆2) and the central regions (∆5, ∆6, and ∆7) of the ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). It is remarkable that ∆5, ∆6, and ∆7 sequences are also crucial for binding to WRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that intracellular domain (ICD) dimerization is closely linked to the WRC interaction.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>HPO-30 intracellular domain (ICD) can self-associate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels showing GST-ICD (300 pmol) pulling down MBP-ICD (6000 pmol).

For this, we compared the effect of monomeric and dimeric ICD on WRC activity using an optimized buffer in the pyrene-actin polymerization assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The CID FKBP/FRB-ICD constructs (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) allowed us to directly compare the monomeric vs. dimeric ICD by switching between DMSO and rapamycin, instead of using different tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).

This is supported by our observation that the ICD similarly inhibited actin polymerization induced by the isolated, constitutively active WCA peptide, with the dimerized ICD again showing more potent inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In fact, the HPO-30 ICD was able to inhibit spontaneous actin polymerization in the absence of any activator, including the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Therefore, our data suggest that the inhibitory effect of the ICD is likely a direct effect on actin, rather than through WRC, Rac1, WCA, or Arp2/3.</p><p>The strong, WRC-independent inhibitory effect of the ICD on actin polymerization made it difficult to directly examine how ICD binding influences WRC activity. To overcome this challenge, we reduced the ICD concentration to 1 µM to minimize its inhibitory effect. At this concentration, we did not observe HPO-30 ICD activating WRC alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Previous studies on the WIRS-containing ICD from the cell adhesion membrane protein protocadherin 10 (PCDH10) found that the PCDH10 ICD itself could not activate WRC but could enhance WRC activation induced by low concentrations of Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). We tested if HPO-30 ICD might act similarly to PCDH10, enhancing activity when WRC is mildly activated by Rac1. Interestingly, in this condition, we found that 1 µM monomeric ICD slightly, but robustly, increased Rac1-WRC-mediated actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, dashed blue vs. solid light pink curves). Since only dimerized ICD can readily bind WRC, we speculated that the enhanced activity was due to a small fraction of dimeric ICD existing in equilibrium with the monomeric form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test this hypothesis (while avoiding the dominant inhibitory effect of rapamycin-dimerized ICD observed even at 1 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, solid blue curve), we reduced the dimerized ICD concentration to 0.1 µM. Consistent with our hypothesis, at this low concentration, the dimerized ICD similarly promoted Rac1-WRC-medicated actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, solid green curve). This activating effect was specific to Rac1-activated WRC, as free WCA could not be further activated by dimerized ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Although we could not test higher concentrations of ICD due to its strong inhibitory effect on actin polymerization, low concentrations of dimeric ICD could enhance Rac1-WRC activity, suggesting ICD binding cooperates with Rac1 to promote WRC activation.</p><p>The cooperativity between Rac1 and the HPO-30 ICD in activating WRC suggests that the ICD has a preference for binding to activated WRC. Supporting this hypothesis, our EPD assay showed that GST-ICD pulled down more WRC in the presence of saturating concentrations of Rac1 (which was manifested by less WRC remaining in the pull-down supernatant, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>, lane 2 vs 4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Taken together, our data demonstrate that, while the HPO-30 ICD cannot activate the WRC by itself, it can synergistically cooperate with Rac1 to promote WRC activation, similar to the WIRS receptor PCDH10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). Our unexpected finding that the HPO-30 ICD strongly inhibits actin polymerization suggests that the ICD directly interacts with actin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>HPO-30 ICD binds to F-actin and inhibits actin depolymerization similar to CapZ</title><p>The strong inhibitory effect of the HPO-30 ICD on actin polymerization suggests the ICD could directly bind and sequester monomeric G-actin. However, we could not detect binding between GST-ICD or dimerized F/F-ICD and G-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). We next wondered if the ICD inhibited actin polymerization by binding to F-actin. In our F-actin co-pelleting assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Heier et al., 2017</xref>), we found that, compared to BSA, F/F tag, or the capping protein CapZ (which only binds to the barbed ends of F-actin), F/F-ICD more robustly bound to F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>).

Interestingly, we found that the same regions crucial for ICD’s interaction with the WRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and with itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>), including ∆1, ∆5, ∆6, and ∆7, were also the most essential for binding to F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>).</p><p>The above data strongly suggest that the HPO-30 ICD inhibits actin polymerization by directly binding to F-actin. Proteins with similar activity include capping proteins, such as CapZ. Capping proteins bind to the barbed end of actin filaments to impede both actin polymerization and depolymerization from the barbed end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caldwell et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Weeds and Maciver, 1993</xref>). To test whether the HPO-30 ICD may function as a capping protein, we used a depolymerization assay that is commonly utilized to measure CapZ activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caldwell et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cooper and Pollard, 1985</xref>). We found that the ICD, like CapZ, inhibited actin depolymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). This inhibitory activity was both concentration- and dimerization-dependent, suggesting that dimerization is critical for this capping-like activity. This aligns with our observation that dimeric ICD more potently inhibited actin polymerization than monomeric ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To determine which region(s) of the ICD are important for this capping-like activity, we tested the same alanine scan mutations used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>. As anticipated, the regions most critical for the depolymerization activity of the ICD were the same as those crucial for binding to actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>). Collectively, our results suggest that the HPO-30 ICD behaves analogously to capping proteins in obstructing both depolymerization and polymerization of F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>HPO-30 ICD binds to both the side and barbed end of actin filaments</title><p>In the above bulk solution assays, the binding of the ICD to F-actin was not dependent on dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>), but its inhibition of F-actin polymerization and depolymerization was dependent on dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A–C</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C and D</xref>). This suggests that the HPO-30 ICD may have two distinct activities on actin filaments, with only the dimerization-dependent activity resembling that of CapZ. This hypothesis could explain why more ICD co-pelleted with F-actin than CapZ did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>), as CapZ only binds to the barbed end of actin filaments (albeit with high affinity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caldwell et al., 1989</xref>), while the ICD may bind to both the barbed end (in a dimerization-dependent manner) and other surfaces of the actin filaments (in a dimerization-independent manner).</p><p>To understand how the HPO-30 ICD binds F-actin, we used single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (smTIRF) microscopy to directly visualize the interaction. For this assay, we first attached a SNAP tag to the N-terminus of various FKBP/FRB constructs or the CapZ β-subunit, and then labeled the SNAP tag using different SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor dyes (hereafter referred to as AF followed by the corresponding excitation wavelength). Actin was directly labeled with AF647 using previously established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>). We verified that the SNAP-tagged F/F-ICDs bound to the WRC in a rapamycin-dependent manner and to a level similar to the GB1-tagged F/F-ICD, suggesting that the SNAP tag did not affect ICD function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>, lanes 1–4). The labeled CapZ and F/F-ICD proteins exhibited capping activity comparable to their counterparts used in bulk solution assays (except for the AF647-labeled F/F-ICD, which was subsequently excluded from smTIRF assays described below) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>).</p><p>In the smTIRF experiments, SNAP<sup>AF488</sup>-CapZ (at 5 nM) was found to stably bind to the barbed end of filaments, and the binding stopped filament growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, top; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> green; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1 fig6video2">Figure 6—videos 1 and 2</xref>), consistent with the high affinity and very slow off-rate of CapZ at the barbed end shown in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caldwell et al., 1989</xref>). In contrast, SNAP<sup>AF546</sup>-F/F-ICD (15 nM, with eightfold molar excess of rapamycin) mainly bound to the side of actin filaments, instead of the barbed end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, bottom; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video3 fig6video4 fig6video5">Figure 6—videos 3–5</xref>) (see below). While we occasionally observed an ICD appearing to bind to the barbed end of a filament (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, bottom, for an example, at time 39.0 s), the filament continued to grow beyond the bound ICD, leaving the ICD bound to the same location on the filament. We could conclude that the ICD molecule bound to the filament and not the PEG-coated surface, because it moved together with the filament (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video3 fig6video4">Figure 6—videos 3 and 4</xref>). By using stringent criteria to prevent misidentification of non-specific background signals as binding events, we found that 33% of filaments had at least one binding event for SNAP-F/F-ICD over the 15 min duration of the experiment, which was significantly higher than the number of events for the SNAP-F/F tag under identical conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>HPO-30 intracellular domain (ICD) binds both the side and barbed end of actin filaments and slows polymerization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Examples of time lapse images from single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (smTIRF) experiments.

Therefore, we used higher concentrations of unlabeled ICD to see if it could inhibit actin filament growth as shown in the bulk solution assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video5">Figure 6—video 5</xref>). We found that 1 µM dimerized F/F-ICD significantly decreased the actin elongation rate from 2.3±0.5 subunits/s to 1.5±0.3 subunits/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Kuhn and Pollard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, black vs. solid blue). The same concentration of monomeric F/F-ICD also slowed down actin elongation, but to a lesser extent (2.0±0.4 subunits/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, open blue). This could be due to either the side binding activity of ICD or the presence of dimeric ICD in equilibrium with monomeric ICD, which could bind to the barbed end. Importantly, dimerized F/F tag did not significantly affect actin polymerization (2.1±0.4 subunits/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, gray). Unfortunately, we could not increase the unlabeled ICD concentration further to observe stronger inhibitory effects due to limitations in the volume of high-concentration protein stock that we could add to the microfluid chamber. In contrast, CapZ strongly inhibited actin polymerization, even at 5 nM (0.3±0.1 subunits/s). Further examination of the kymographs of individual actin filaments revealed that in the absence of ICD or CapZ, filaments typically grew at a uniform rate. In the presence of dimeric F/F-ICD, filaments grew more slowly and with occasional pausing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). In the presence of CapZ, filaments exhibited almost no growth most of the time over the course of the video (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that HPO-30 ICD and CapZ have similar inhibitory effects on actin filament elongation, although at the same concentration, the ICD exhibits less potent activity.</p><p>In the above smTIRF experiments, we encountered several technical challenges that prevented us from observing stable binding of the ICD to the barbed end, in contrast to the stable binding observed with CapZ. These challenges include limited concentrations of fluorophore-labeled ICD (nM, instead of µM that we could use in bulk solution assays), potential low affinity and fast off-rate of the ICD binding to the barbed end, difficulty in distinguishing barbed end binding from side binding due to light diffraction limit, lower than expected concentration of dimeric ICD (the dissociation constant of FKBP-rapamycin binding to FRB is ~12 nM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banaszynski et al., 2005</xref>), and fast binding/dissociation events potentially beyond the data acquisition speed (50 or 100 ms exposure time). To further investigate whether the ICD binds to the barbed end, we used a competition co-pelleting assay to determine if dimeric F/F-ICD could compete with CapZ for binding to the barbed end of F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Our results showed that the dimerized F/F-ICD, when applied at about 10 times the concentration of CapZ, significantly decreased CapZ binding by ~60%. In contrast, neither the monomeric F/F-ICD nor the dimerized F/F tag had an impact on CapZ binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This result suggests that dimeric ICD binds to the barbed end and can block CapZ binding, consistent with our findings that dimeric ICD is more effective in inhibiting actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>) and depolymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).</p><p>Combining our single-molecule and bulk solution results, we conclude that HPO-30 ICD monomers preferentially bind to the side of actin filaments, while dimers can bind to both the sides and the barbed end of filaments. Only the barbed end binding by dimeric ICD can inhibit actin filament growth in a manner similar to CapZ. These findings reveal a surprising function of the HPO-30 ICD in directly regulating actin cytoskeletal remodeling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>HPO-30 is a claudin-like membrane protein with a crucial role in higher order dendrite branching in <italic>C. elegans</italic> PVD neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zou et al., 2015</xref>). At branching sites, HPO-30 forms a co-receptor with the cell adhesion transmembrane protein DMA-1, which together transduce extracellular signals (from the epidermal proteins SAX-7, MNR-1, and muscle secreted LECT-2) to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, left). Previous studies showed that this process required the HPO-30 ICD to bind to the WRC, which in turn could activate Arp2/3 to generate branched actin networks to deform the membrane and promote new dendrite formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zou et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, our multifaceted analyses reveal two novel mechanisms employed by the HPO-30 ICD to regulate local actin dynamics. First, the ICD undergoes dimerization to bind the WRC, which, in addition to recruiting the WRC to local dendrite branching sites, can cooperate with Rac1 to enhance WRC activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, step 2). This mechanism can work synergistically with DMA-1, as the cytoplasmic tail of DMA-1 directly recruits the Rac-GEF, TIAM1, which would increase the local concentration of active GTP-Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zou et al., 2018</xref>). Second, the HPO-30 ICD directly binds to actin filaments to modulate actin dynamics, with monomeric and dimeric forms binding to the side of filaments, and the dimeric ICD alone binding to the barbed end to inhibit both actin polymerization and depolymerization, similar to CapZ activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, steps 1 and 2). These seemingly contradictory actin regulatory mechanisms may enable exquisite control of local actin dynamics necessary for dendrite branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, right, and see discussion below).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>HPO-30 intracellular domain (ICD) integrates two distinct mechanisms to regulate actin dynamics during dendrite branching.</title><p>Left: In <italic>C. elegans</italic> PVD neurons, a variety of molecules work together with the HPO-30/DMA-1 co-receptor to link extracellular signals to the intracellular actin network critical for driving dendrite branching. Right: Model of how HPO-30 ICD modulates actin dynamics. In (1), HPO-30 on the dendrite membrane undergoes dimerization (or oligomerization). Both monomeric and dimeric forms of HPO-30 ICD can bind to the side of actin filaments, but only the dimeric ICD can bind to the fast-growing barbed end. In (2), dimeric ICD binding to the barbed end acts as a capping protein, which stops long filament growth and helps reserve G-actin for the Arp2/3 complex to produce short, branched actin filaments. In (2), dimeric ICD can also interact with the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC). This recruits the WRC to the membrane and simultaneously promotes WRC activation by Rac1, which in turn stimulates Arp2/3 to produce branched actin filaments. In (3), the dual actions of HPO-30 ICD facilitate the formation of branched actin networks, which can help generate the ‘swelling’ of dendrite observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shi et al., 2021</xref>), an important indicator of the outgrowth of a new dendrite branch.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88492-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>HPO-30 presents a unique example of a transmembrane protein capable of interacting with the WRC, distinct from the previously identified WIRS peptide-containing receptors such as SYG-1, Robo, DCC, Neogenin, TMEM132, neuroligins, and various protocadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chaudhari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Fan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Xing et al., 2018</xref>). Unlike these receptors, the HPO-30 ICD does not use a WIRS motif or a similar short peptide motif to bind WRC. Instead, our structure-function analyses show that the entire ICD sequence is necessary for binding to the WRC, and dimerization of the ICD is crucial for this interaction. This novel WRC-binding mechanism should be conserved across animals, as the HPO-30 ICD is present only in nematodes but can bind to both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and human WRCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zou et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, HPO-30 represents a new class of transmembrane proteins that interact with the WRC using a distinct mechanism from the WIRS-containing receptors identified previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>Without a high-resolution structure of the ICD complexed with WRC, the exact conformation that the ICD adopts and how dimerization mediates WRC binding remain to be determined. Our computational and biophysical analyses consistently indicate that the monomeric ICD contains transient helical structure, but it is overall predominantly disordered in solution. Two possible mechanisms could explain how the ICD binds to WRC and why dimerization appears important for the interaction. In the first mechanism, the ICD may have one binding surface on the WRC. The dimerized ICD acts as one structural entity, which undergoes induced folding and adopts a stable conformation to bind the WRC. Induced folding has been proposed for many DNA-binding proteins and cell-signaling molecules, such as the interaction between E-cadherin and β-catenin or between <italic>Tg</italic>IST and STAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dyson and Wright, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Huang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Huber et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Huber and Weis, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Turjanski et al., 2008</xref>). In the second mechanism, the ICD may have two separate binding surfaces on the WRC. Dimerization tags attached to the ICD provide an avidity effect that promotes simultaneous binding of two copies of ICD to the two surfaces on the same WRC. Because ICD can directly bind to another ICD, we favor the first mechanism, but our data cannot rule out the second mechanism. The above two mechanisms can also explain how the ICD binds to the barbed end of actin filaments in a dimerization-dependent manner. Regardless of which mechanism is used, it is likely the ICD adopts two distinct conformations when binding to WRC vs. binding to the barbed end of F-actin. Such structural plasticity has been observed for signaling molecules with versatile functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bürgi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dishman and Volkman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Okuda et al., 2022</xref>). Resolving the high-resolution structures and identifying the key residues responsible for each binding event would allow us to differentiate the two functions of HPO-30 ICD more precisely.</p><p>The requirement of ICD dimerization for both WRC-binding and F-actin capping suggests an intriguing mechanism of how HPO-30 regulates actin remodeling at dendrite branching sites. Clustering of membrane receptors is a common mechanism to increase local signaling molecule concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Johannes et al., 2018</xref>). The enrichment of HPO-30 at developing PVD neuron dendrites correlates with the high level of F-actin in these branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zou et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to increasing its local membrane density, clustering of HPO-30 may facilitate dimerization of its ICD, which can in turn activate its ability to recruit the WRC and cap actin filaments. This dimerization-mediated functional switch can help the cell to distinguish signal from noise and achieve sharp spatiotemporal control of actin polymerization in response to upstream stimuli. It is worth noting that the regions of the ICD that most dramatically affect its ability to interact with another ICD are the same regions that are most important for binding to WRC and binding/capping F-actin. This again support the idea that dimerization (or oligomerization) is key to ICD function.</p><p>Our study indicates that the HPO-30 ICD has two functions upon binding to the WRC: (1) recruiting the WRC to dendrite branching site membranes and (2) enhancing WRC activation by Rac1. This dual action of binding and sensitizing the WRC has been observed in several WIRS-containing receptors, such as PCDH10 and PCDH19, where WIRS peptide binding recruits the receptor to the membrane while weak interactions from the flanking ICD sequences promote WRC activation by Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). Since the HPO-30 ICD strongly inhibits actin polymerization, it will be important to develop new assays to directly measure WRC activation, such as tracking WCA release, to understand how HPO-30 ICD binding enhances WRC activation by Rac1. As Rac1 activates the WRC by binding to two distinct sites located on the Sra1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ding et al., 2022</xref>), it is possible that HPO-30 ICD promotes Rac1-WRC activation by directly stabilizing Rac1 binding to either site or by destabilizing WCA sequestration.</p><p>To our knowledge, HPO-30 represents the first transmembrane protein that possesses actin capping (or capping-like) activity. The precise structural mechanism of how the dimeric HPO-30 ICD binds to the barbed end of actin filaments remains to be determined. It is possible that it binds to the same surface as CapZ. Alternatively, it might bind to a nearby surface that could either sterically clash with or allosterically destabilize CapZ binding. Regardless, the dual abilities of HPO-30 to promote WRC membrane recruitment and activation while also capping actin filaments and inhibiting actin polymerization may seem contradictory at first glance. However, capping activity, which is usually provided by cytosolic capping proteins like CapZ, is known to be critical for Arp2/3-based actin dynamics in both bead motility assays in vitro and many processes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akin and Mullins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Miyoshi et al., 2006</xref>). Capping proteins can stop long actin filament growth and simultaneously reserve G-actin by blocking its access to barbed ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carlier and Pantaloni, 1997</xref>). In parallel, capping protein can also prevent the barbed end from sequestering the WH2 sequence of WCA, which would otherwise deplete the activity of WASP family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Co et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Higgs et al., 1999</xref>). Together, by blocking the barbed end, the capping activity stimulates the formation of new branches through Arp2/3 and thus plays a crucial role in dynamically modulating the actin architecture to generate force against the surface where actin is localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akin and Mullins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Funk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, step 2). In principle, the capping activity of the HPO-30 ICD should act similarly to stimulate the formation of a highly branched actin network. Although the isolated ICD has apparently lower capping activity compared to the canonical capping protein CapZ, it has the advantage of concentrating the capping activity in the area immediately next to membranes, which can provide a more focused control of actin dynamics.</p><p>In summary, our study establishes HPO-30 as a novel membrane receptor that, upon dimerization, can directly integrate the activities of WRC-Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization and actin filament capping, distinguishing it from other WIRS-containing receptors and canonical barbed end cappers like CapZ. These two distinct functions of HPO-30 provide an intriguing model to explain how it regulates local actin dynamics to facilitate dendrite branching in PVD neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The synergistic action of both functions would promote the formation of highly branched actin networks, which help generate dendritic ‘swellings’ observed in PVD neurons immediately before dendrite branch outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, step 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shi et al., 2021</xref>). This mechanism likely works in conjunction with other actin machinery in the cell to achieve highly spatiotemporally controlled actin dynamics and neuronal cell branching.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for a.a. sequences of recombinant proteins used in this study.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identities: Pirta Hotulainen (Reviewer #2) and Yansong Miao (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, the Reviewers agreed on the fact that the dimerization of the ICD domain is not demonstrated. They acknowledge that the interaction of such disordered domains is complicated to study, but also that the current data are not sufficient to appreciate the detail of these intramolecular interactions. Furthermore, the effect of the ICD domain on actin polymerization is not entirely clear at this stage and would deserve additional experimental effort.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript investigates how the intracellular fragment (ICD) of the transmembrane protein HPO-30, involved in dendrite morphogenesis, interacts with the WAVE complex and regulates actin assembly.</p><p>The first part of the work shows that the ICD domain is itself unstructured and mostly inactive, but that its fusion to dimeric domains such as Gst tags increases its binding affinity to the WAVE regulatory subunits Sra1 and Nap1. Structural analysis by NMR and prediction software indicate that ICD is possibly composed of one α-helix and two β sheets which could dimerize into a structured domain in some conditions.</p><p>The second part of the work investigates how ICD domains promote WRC activation by the GTPase Rac1. The authors identify a dual effect of ICD, promoting both the activation of the Arp2/3 complex by WRC and Rac1 while binding to the side of actin filaments and inhibiting actin polymerization quite significantly.</p><p>This work is certainly important to the specialized community. The experiments are carefully conducted and well interpreted. However, a few important experiments are still missing to clearly demonstrate the dimerization of the ICD domain of HPO30 and to better understand its effect on actin assembly. This last comment is not meant to undermine the general quality of the work but suggests some further efforts to bring it to completion.</p><p>This work has potential but is still too preliminary at this stage:</p><p>1. Despite the authors' best efforts, the ability of ICD to dimerize is not formally demonstrated in this manuscript. The summary of the article shows that the authors are aware of the problem ('likely undergoes dimerization'), but the rest of the article is not so careful in its wording and misleads the readers. For a journal of the level of <italic>eLife</italic>, I think the authors should give a more precise answer to this problem.</p><p>2. I find the pull-down experiment in Figure 3F not very convincing. The authors must provide a control showing that the co-immunoprecipitation of HA and Myc-tagged proteins does not come from HPO being a transmembrane protein in this experiment.</p><p>3. About the pyrene actin experiments:</p><p>– Do ICD domains quench the fluorescence of pyrene when they bind to the side of actin filaments, as cofilin does?</p><p>– When the authors write that a given factor inhibits actin polymerization, they should specify whether they talk about rates of actin assembly or final amounts of polymer. To do this, they also need to provide pyrene curves on longer time scales and up to plateau values to assess steady-state levels of actin polymerization. Moreover, actin seems to polymerize really slowly in some experiments (for example, the black curve with 4 µM actin in Figure 4B). Why is that?</p><p>– For more clarity/simplicity, the authors should also provide data showing the effect of ICD constructs on actin polymerization only.</p><p>4. The authors must provide representative TIRF movies used for the quantification of Figure 6C and more details about how the movies are quantified. With a protein like CapZ, for example, we usually detect transitions between normal elongation and pauses where elongation is completely stopped. So the authors should be able to analyze two populations of filaments, one elongating normally and the other not. So do the measured speeds (sometimes up to 1 subunit per second) represent here averages or filaments continuously elongating at intermediate rates? Is something similar (normal elongation and pauses) observed with ICD or do filaments elongate at intermediate rates?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study evaluates two new mechanisms of how dendrite branching receptor HPO-30 regulates actin polymerization. While it directly binds filamentous actin, both on side of the filament and to the polymerizing barbed end, it also activates WRC, thus promoting Arp2/3-complex induced actin branching and polymerization. Altogether, combining these two mechanisms, it is expected that HPO-30 promotes the formation of a highly branched network with a short filament length.</p><p>The strength of this study is that it uses numerous biochemical and structural methods to clarify how the HPO-30 receptor regulates actin cytoskeleton. Methods and results seem solid and they support each other. As such this is a nice piece of work and helps future studies to clarify what exactly happens in neurons and in dendrite branching.</p><p>I would be careful with interpretations of neurons without any neuronal data. Arp2/3 complex-induced actin polymerization is for sure an important part of dendrite branching but I personally don't believe that it is enough. Therefore, model figure 7 can be slightly misleading or at least incomplete.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Daniel Kramer and colleagues have described a work that particularly focuses on the conformation and dimerization (or oligomerization) of HPO-30 ICD, and the ICD-mediated inhibition of Rac1-activated WRC for actin polymerization. It is an excellent effort with many high-quality results that address a very important biological question: how the conformation and oligomerization of disordered proteins affect actin or actin regulatory proteins, thereby regulating actin polymerization through tuning the protein conformation or oligomerization. It could be a report with high scientific significance if the mechanisms behind it could be dissected and interpreted better. In general, the biochemical experiments were done with high quality. I acknowledge the technical challenges behind such aspects of studying this ICD and many other disordered proteins on how they remodel the protein interactions and biochemical activities due to the nature of the protein being dynamic in conformational change or molecular interactions. While I very much appreciate the research done in this work, I also feel the several experimental results end up with incoherent interpretation and overstatement and are unable to support their conclusions. Several results are misinterpreted with speculation or overstatement that could be misleading.</p><p>1. The way the author used to conclude (e.g.e line 165) could be misleading. Neither the discrepancy between different prediction algorithms nor the different conformations from an individual algorithm should be considered solid evidence to conclude the dynamic conformation of a protein. Experimental validation using a structural biology approach, such as the NMR the authors did, or at least an MD simulation that measures the probability of each conformation, is reasonable. Here, with the NMR results, may the authors elaborate on if these results support the conformational flexibility and secondary structures of ICD in each examined fusion? The authors did not mention the NMR results of GST-ICD in the results though it was shown in Figure 2D.</p><p>2. May the authors describe if ICD forms any secondary structure when a dimeric GST is attached? One in silico prediction-based conclusion, &quot;HPO-30 ICD may use a folded structure, instead of a short peptide motif, to bind the WRC&quot; was not supported by another result about ICD conformation without tags, HPO-30 ICD, which is disordered in solution. It leaves a major weakness of the manuscript, which is the mechanism of the &quot;dimer&quot; concept that is used by switching among ICD-tag fusion, ICD only, and tag only in the different experiments. By that, the author often uses the dimerized tag as a presumption to conclude a dimerization of ICD, which is misleading. Please see below.</p><p>For example, the GST introduced stability of the ICD (as data not shown) imply a stable conformation or conformational constrain that prevents the proteolytic enzyme function during the protein purification procedures. Hence, firstly, the mechanisms for binding between ICD could be because of the conformational changes of ICD that are introduced by GST-dimer/other-dimeric tag instead of dimerizing ICD. I appreciate the use of different dimeric sets to support the importance of having a dimer tag. Nevertheless, there is a logical issue behind the conclusion. (a) Dimerization of ICD refers to the intermolecular interaction between two ICD monomers by having physical contact sites. (b) The dimerization of GST only provides a tag to bring two ICD monomers together, which does not provide a dimeric interface between ICDs. (c) with the same logic, a dimeric form of any unstructured/structured proteins will not introduce inter-molecular interaction by just being a dimer if the monomer does not provide a binding.</p><p>Second, the authors did not show experimental evidence to prove that GST-ICD is a dimer. Dimerization is a presumption based on GST, the final oligomerization status and potential heterogeneity of oligomerization of GST-ICD need to be defined experimentally. Otherwise, the authors can only claim that the dimeric motif (GST or FKBP-FRB) can facilitate the binding between ICD and WRC. Considering the IDR nature with elongated shape, several approaches are able to define its oligomerization status and heterogeneity, including SEC-MALS, AUC, and fluorescent-labeling and imaging-aided single particle-imaging by using a set of proteins at specified oligomerization status to generate a standard curve.</p><p>Third, in vivo dimerization conclusion is an overstatement. Co-IP experiments only can support the interactions between bait and prey, which do not verify dimerization, oligomerization status, or heterogeneity. Hence, the conclusion supporting the hypothesis on Page 20, lines 422-425, is invalid.</p><p>1. For Figure 3 supplementary 1D, the authors need to provide a standard and calibration to indicate the calculated MW and oligomerization status for samples before and after adding rapamycin. In addition, do F and F-ICD fully overlap before adding rapamycin on Superdex 75?</p><p>2. The different interpretations of why F/F-ICD inhibits Rac1-activated WRC in actin polymerization appear confusing. On one side, the authors hypothesize that a direct binding between ICD and actin is the key (page 19, line 396). By the way, no inhibition of actin spontaneous polymerization by ICD was observed. On the other side, authors claim that the inhibitory effect of ICD in the reaction pool with mixed G-actin, F-actin, WRC, ICD, and Rac1, is an inhibition on the Rac1-activated WRC by citing an opposite activation result where a mixture of PCDH10 ICD activate actin polymerization in the presence of WRC and Rac1. I had difficulty understanding how these different messages support each other and how these conclusions were deduced from these related but conflicting information. I guess that F/F-ICD might have different interactions towards Rac1 or have a higher affinity towards the Rac1-activated WRC after undergoing the conformational changes, such as from either disordered- or ordered changes to another ordered status or changes in complex oligomerization status.</p><p>3. Direct binding of ICD to F-actin is an appealing phenomenon in F-actin sedimentation assay. For Figure 5, TIRF imaging would help to understand the binding or bundling at this high concentration of ICD with spatial information between ICD and F-actins. I also suspect that F/F-ICD likely bundles F-actin at such concentration. Rap induced more ICD in pellet at molar ratio ICD: G-actin &gt;1, which has a much higher affinity to F-actin shown in 5 nM concentration TIRF assay in figure 6. These results suggest that either a high oligomerization of ICD happens on F-actin at this condition or F/F-ICD forms much-higher oligomer/aggregates in the solution without associating with F-actin.</p><p>Considering the impact of <italic>eLife</italic> in guiding future research, the current interpretation format would not be appropriate for future studies on the function and mechanism of disordered proteins.</p><p>Understanding ICD inhibition on the WRC-Rac1 complex would provide important knowledge. But the current result is not sufficient to understand the mechanism. Several key components are missing. 1. Quantitative biochemical characterization of inter and intramolecular interactions, such as Kd and oligomerization status, for single components or complex in the different combinations of ICD, WRC, Ras1, G-actin, or F-actin. If ICD is disordered, it will likely have weak interaction with binding partners, which could be technically challenging. Such weak interaction is reflected by the TIRF imaging, where the localization of ICD on F-actin is unstable, either sliding or with a rapid on/off rate. In addition, a higher-order oligomer (brighter dots) is not on the F-actin. I fully acknowledge the technical challenges behind such experiments to make a clear conclusion about the interactions involving the disordered region. I recommend examining the potential secondary structure behind such binding towards actin (G- or F-actin). Otherwise, a flexible interaction between a protein and an actin filament is hard to understand. One of the ways that might help us to understand it could be a surface charge. ICD is a positively charged polymer with a theoretical π of 9.18, which might provide non-specific interactions.</p><p><bold>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

They acknowledge that the interaction of such disordered domains is complicated to study, but also that the current data are not sufficient to appreciate the detail of these intramolecular interactions. Furthermore, the effect of the ICD domain on actin polymerization is not entirely clear at this stage and would deserve additional experimental effort.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript investigates how the intracellular fragment (ICD) of the transmembrane protein HPO-30, involved in dendrite morphogenesis, interacts with the WAVE complex and regulates actin assembly.</p><p>The first part of the work shows that the ICD domain is itself unstructured and mostly inactive, but that its fusion to dimeric domains such as Gst tags increases its binding affinity to the WAVE regulatory subunits Sra1 and Nap1. Structural analysis by NMR and prediction software indicate that ICD is possibly composed of one α-helix and two β sheets which could dimerize into a structured domain in some conditions.</p><p>The second part of the work investigates how ICD domains promote WRC activation by the GTPase Rac1. The authors identify a dual effect of ICD, promoting both the activation of the Arp2/3 complex by WRC and Rac1 while binding to the side of actin filaments and inhibiting actin polymerization quite significantly.</p><p>This work is certainly important to the specialized community. The experiments are carefully conducted and well interpreted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the supportive and insightful comments of the significance and quality of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, a few important experiments are still missing to clearly demonstrate the dimerization of the ICD domain of HPO30 and to better understand its effect on actin assembly. This last comment is not meant to undermine the general quality of the work but suggests some further efforts to bring it to completion.</p><p>This work has potential but is still too preliminary at this stage:</p></disp-quote><p>We also appreciate the reviewer’s constructive critiques and thoughtful suggestions, which have helped us to strengthen the manuscript. As described in detail below, we have completed nearly all of the suggested experiments, as well as several additional experiments, and have made significant revisions to the manuscript accordingly. We are confident that our work is now complete and ready for publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Despite the authors' best efforts, the ability of ICD to dimerize is not formally demonstrated in this manuscript. The summary of the article shows that the authors are aware of the problem ('likely undergoes dimerization'), but the rest of the article is not so careful in its wording and misleads the readers. For a journal of the level of eLife, I think the authors should give a more precise answer to this problem.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's feedback on the ambiguity in our previous writing about the ICD’s ability to dimerize. To clarify this point, we have revised our writing and have included new data from several different approaches in the revised manuscript to support the ICD-ICD interaction. Please also see our response to Reviewer #3 for further details on this topic.</p><p>We have added a new section titled “HPO-30 ICD can self-associate” to the Results (Line 402) to emphasize the significance of the ICD-ICD interaction.</p><p>We have moved the previous pull-down figure in a supplementary figure (the old Figure 3— figure supplement 2C) to a main figure (new Figure 4A), which shows that purified GST-ICD can pull down MBP-ICD, suggesting that the ICD can directly interact with itself through dimerization (or even oligomerization).</p><p>We have included new data in the new Figure 4B,C, showing the influence of various alanine-scan mutants on the ICD-ICD interaction. Interestingly, we found that the same regions critical for WRC interaction are similarly critical for the ICD-ICD interaction.</p><p>Additionally, in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 4A, we have included new data showing the sensitivity of the ICD-ICD interaction to disruption by the pH of the buffer, which suggests the interaction is likely mediated by electrostatic interactions.</p><p>We made extensive and careful attempts to measure the binding affinity of the ICD-ICD interaction using the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan. We had to use low concentrations of protein and a sub-optimal wavelength to prevent non-specific decreases in fluorescence due to the inner filter effect. Despite this, our controls using the monomeric GB1 protein showed a similar increase in fluorescence with concentration, making it impossible to conclude if the same increase in the ICD is due to dimerization or some other, non-specific, concentration effect. We then explored alternative methods by screening for a functional, non-fluorescent ICD (in which all Trp, Tyr, and Phe were removed) to titrate into the WT ICD. Unfortunately, our control experiments show that the fluorescence changes observed could be attributed to non-specific background signals, as we saw the same increase in high salt buffer, which we know disrupts the interaction between ICD molecules. We have summarized these negative results in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 2 to report the technical difficulties of quantifying the binding affinity. Due to the small size and unstructured nature of the molecule and the low affinity between ICD-ICD, we were unable to try other methods suggested by Reviewer #3. Despite these limitations, we believe our qualitative data and mutagenesis data shown in Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 have provided adequate support that the ICD can self-associate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I find the pull-down experiment in Figure 3F not very convincing. The authors must provide a control showing that the co-immunoprecipitation of HA and Myc-tagged proteins does not come from HPO being a transmembrane protein in this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the potential misinterpretation of the results presented in the previous Figure 3F caused by our writing. The purpose of these data is to show that the full-length (FL) HPO-30 has the potential to dimerize (or oligomerize), thus indicating dimerization of HPO-30 could happen in cells. This figure is not intended to suggest if dimerization of FL HPO-30 occurs through a direct interaction between HPO-30 or through other mediating molecules, nor does it indicate if dimerization occurs through the transmembrane domain of HPO-30 or through the ICD. To avoid possible overinterpretation of these data, we have moved this figure to a supplemental figure (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1B) and modified our writing accordingly. Please also see our response to Reviewer #3 for further details on this topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. About the pyrene actin experiments:</p><p>– Do ICD domains quench the fluorescence of pyrene when they bind to the side of actin filaments, as cofilin does?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this question. To address this concern, we have conducted additional experiments to show that ICD binding does not quench pyrene fluorescence from either G-actin or F-actin. These new data are presented in the new Figure 5—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– When the authors write that a given factor inhibits actin polymerization, they should specify whether they talk about rates of actin assembly or final amounts of polymer. To do this, they also need to provide pyrene curves on longer time scales and up to plateau values to assess steady-state levels of actin polymerization.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting this experiment. Per the reviewer’s suggestion, we extended the duration of the actin polymerization assay to a much longer time scale. Our results demonstrate that HPO-30 ICD significantly reduces the actin polymerization rate, which is consistent with our single-molecule data. We have included these new data in the new Figure 5—figure supplement 1E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, actin seems to polymerize really slowly in some experiments (for example, the black curve with 4 µM actin in Figure 4B). Why is that?</p></disp-quote><p>The rate of actin polymerization can vary depending on the age of the actin, which is a commonly observed phenomenon. We keep our purified G-actin in continuous dialysis conditions for several months, with fresh buffer changes twice a week. The polymerization ability of actin generally decreases over time, making it essential to only compare results obtained on the same day. We do not directly compare experiments obtained on different days or using different batches of actin. Critical experiments are typically repeated on different days to ensure we arrive at the same conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For more clarity/simplicity, the authors should also provide data showing the effect of ICD constructs on actin polymerization only.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful suggestion and have conducted the experiment as suggested. Our new data, as shown in the new Figure 5C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1E, clearly demonstrate that the ICD inhibits spontaneous polymerization of actin in the absence of any other effectors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors must provide representative TIRF movies used for the quantification of Figure 6C and more details about how the movies are quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. We would like to clarify that we did provide representative TIRF movies used for the quantification of Figure 6C (now new Figure 7C) in Video 5, which shows videos from all conditions side by side. We also provided detailed procedures of how we quantified these movies in the Materials and methods section of our manuscript. We hope this clarification resolves any prior misunderstandings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With a protein like CapZ, for example, we usually detect transitions between normal elongation and pauses where elongation is completely stopped. So the authors should be able to analyze two populations of filaments, one elongating normally and the other not. So do the measured speeds (sometimes up to 1 subunit per second) represent here averages or filaments continuously elongating at intermediate rates? Is something similar (normal elongation and pauses) observed with ICD or do filaments elongate at intermediate rates?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this discussion. We have added a new figure (new Figure 7E and Figure 7—figure supplement 2) to provide more detailed analysis of the differences in actin elongation rates between HPO-30 ICD and CapZ. The new figures provide representative kymographs and elongation curves (up to 10 events) for actin alone, with ICD, and with CapZ. For CapZ, we did observe transitions between normal elongation and a complete stop for long periods of time. In contrast, for HPO-30 ICD, we generally observed a slower rate (lower, intermediated slope) with less frequent pausing. We attribute this difference to the high affinity and very slow off rate of CapZ, compared to the low affinity of ICD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study evaluates two new mechanisms of how dendrite branching receptor HPO-30 regulates actin polymerization. While it directly binds filamentous actin, both on side of the filament and to the polymerizing barbed end, it also activates WRC, thus promoting Arp2/3-complex induced actin branching and polymerization. Altogether, combining these two mechanisms, it is expected that HPO-30 promotes the formation of a highly branched network with a short filament length.</p><p>The strength of this study is that it uses numerous biochemical and structural methods to clarify how the HPO-30 receptor regulates actin cytoskeleton. Methods and results seem solid and they support each other. As such this is a nice piece of work and helps future studies to clarify what exactly happens in neurons and in dendrite branching.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive evaluation of the significance and quality of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would be careful with interpretations of neurons without any neuronal data. Arp2/3 complex-induced actin polymerization is for sure an important part of dendrite branching but I personally don't believe that it is enough. Therefore, model figure 7 can be slightly misleading or at least incomplete.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the insightful comment from the reviewer about the complexity of dendrite branching, which we agree involves precise coordination of many different molecules. In response, we have revised the cartoon in Figure 7 to provide a more comprehensive depiction of other molecules known to be involved in PVD neuron dendrite branching, rather than solely focusing on HPO-30-WRC-Arp2/3. We hope this improved figure, now Figure 8, will not only help readers better understand the significance of our findings related to the HPO-30 ICD, but also place our work in the broader context of dendrite branching regulation. We acknowledge that other pathways may act in coordination with this pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Daniel Kramer and colleagues have described a work that particularly focuses on the conformation and dimerization (or oligomerization) of HPO-30 ICD, and the ICD-mediated inhibition of Rac1-activated WRC for actin polymerization. It is an excellent effort with many high-quality results that address a very important biological question: how the conformation and oligomerization of disordered proteins affect actin or actin regulatory proteins, thereby regulating actin polymerization through tuning the protein conformation or oligomerization. It could be a report with high scientific significance if the mechanisms behind it could be dissected and interpreted better. In general, the biochemical experiments were done with high quality.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's acknowledgement of the significance and quality of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I acknowledge the technical challenges behind such aspects of studying this ICD and many other disordered proteins on how they remodel the protein interactions and biochemical activities due to the nature of the protein being dynamic in conformational change or molecular interactions. While I very much appreciate the research done in this work, I also feel the several experimental results end up with incoherent interpretation and overstatement and are unable to support their conclusions. Several results are misinterpreted with speculation or overstatement that could be misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the constructive feedback from the reviewer on how to improve our work. We have taken the reviewer’s comments into consideration and have conducted a series of new experiments, including nearly all of the experiments suggested by the reviewer. Additionally, we have extensively revised our writing to address potential incoherence, overstatement, misinterpretation, or misunderstanding. We hope the reviewer finds that these revisions have significantly strengthened our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The way the author used to conclude (e.g.e line 165) could be misleading. Neither the discrepancy between different prediction algorithms nor the different conformations from an individual algorithm should be considered solid evidence to conclude the dynamic conformation of a protein. Experimental validation using a structural biology approach, such as the NMR the authors did, or at least an MD simulation that measures the probability of each conformation, is reasonable. Here, with the NMR results, may the authors elaborate on if these results support the conformational flexibility and secondary structures of ICD in each examined fusion? The authors did not mention the NMR results of GST-ICD in the results though it was shown in Figure 2D.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comments about the limitations of predicted structures and the importance of experimental evidence to support the structural dynamics of the ICD. To address these concerns, we have investigated the structural features of ICD by NMR through a near complete backbone chemical shift assignment as well as by extensive all-atom MD simulations, as suggested by the reviewer, to further evaluate the structural flexibility and dynamics of the ICD.</p><p>For the new NMR data, summarized in the new Figure 2D and Figure 2—figure supplement 1F,G, we recorded a set of triple resonance experiments (HNCA, HN(CA)CO, and HNCO) to assign the <sup>13</sup>C backbone chemical shifts of the ICD and evaluate the degree of transient secondary structures. Our results showed little deviation (&lt;1 ppm) from idealized random coil chemical shifts, indicating that the ICD is predominantly disordered in solution, which is consistent with our CD data and 2D NMR spectra. We did observe a small, but consistent positive secondary Cα chemical shift, suggesting the presence of a transient (~25-30%) alphahelical motif in the same region that was predicted to form an α helix in many of the <italic>ab initio</italic> predictions.</p><p>Furthermore, our new all-atom MD simulation results, summarized in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 3 and Figure 4—figure supplement 3C, demonstrate that HPO-30 ICD does not stably exist in any conformation predicted by various programs. Rather, it exists as a dynamic ensemble of various conformations throughout the simulations.</p><p>Together, these new experimental results corroborate the notion that the HPO-30 ICD alone is highly flexible and dynamic in solution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. May the authors describe if ICD forms any secondary structure when a dimeric GST is attached?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention and apologize for the confusion and misunderstanding caused. We did mention the NMR result shown in Figure 2D in Page 17, Line 352-359 of the previous manuscript. Upon re-examination, we realized that we described this result in a later part of the manuscript, which may have given the impression that we did not mention this result. We have revised our writing to mention this result upfront (Page 14, Line 250-254) and moved this result to the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1E to make it clearer. Our results showed that neither the monomeric GB1 tag nor the dimeric GST tag promoted ICD folding or secondary structure formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One in silico prediction-based conclusion, &quot;HPO-30 ICD may use a folded structure, instead of a short peptide motif, to bind the WRC&quot; was not supported by another result about ICD conformation without tags, HPO-30 ICD, which is disordered in solution.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's feedback on our <italic>in silico</italic> prediction-based conclusion about HPO30 ICD potentially using a folded structure to bind the WRC. We agree that this speculation lacked experimental support, and in the revised manuscript, we have replaced this assertion with a proposal of two equally possible mechanisms for the ICD-WRC binding (Page 49, Line 804821). In the first mechanism, the ICD may have one binding surface on the WRC. In this scenario, the dimerized ICD may act as one structural entity, which undergoes induced folding and adopts a stable conformation to bind the WRC. In the second mechanism, the ICD may have two separate binding surfaces on the WRC. In this case, dimerization tags attached to the ICD can provide an avidity effect that promotes simultaneous binding of two copies of ICD to the two surfaces on the same WRC. Because our data suggest ICD can directly bind to another ICD, we currently favor the first mechanism, but we acknowledge that our data cannot rule out the second mechanism. Until we can solve the high-resolution structure of the ICD-WRC complex, the binding mechanism will remain an open question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It leaves a major weakness of the manuscript, which is the mechanism of the &quot;dimer&quot; concept that is used by switching among ICD-tag fusion, ICD only, and tag only in the different experiments. By that, the author often uses the dimerized tag as a presumption to conclude a dimerization of ICD, which is misleading. Please see below.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this insightful comment and concur with the reviewer that using a dimerization tag, regardless of identity of the dimerization tag, does not guarantee ICD dimer formation. To address this concern, in our revised manuscript, we proposed two mechanisms that could explain the dimerization tag's function: (1) promoting ICD dimerization, or (2) promoting an avidity effect if the ICD has two distinct binding surfaces on the WRC. We still favor the ICD dimerization mechanism, as our data presented in the new Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 demonstrate that ICD can directly interact with each other, suggesting that ICD may indeed dimerize (or even oligomerize) and therefore it is plausible that the dimerization tags promote ICD dimerization. However, we acknowledge that without a high-resolution structure of the ICD-WRC complex, the precise mechanism of action will remain an open question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, the GST introduced stability of the ICD (as data not shown) imply a stable conformation or conformational constrain that prevents the proteolytic enzyme function during the protein purification procedures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention and apologize for any misunderstanding caused by our previous writing. We would like to emphasize that the GST-tag did not uniquely improve the stability HPO-30 ICD during protein purification. We have used various other affinity or solubility tags throughout the paper, which all produced ICD of similar quality. The only exception was when we observed obvious proteolysis in GST-tagged ∆8, ∆9, and ∆10 mutants (but not the wild type or other mutants), which led us to move the GST tag to the Cterminus of ICD to obtain full-length proteins for these mutants. Therefore, we do not think the GST tag uniquely stabilized the ICD. Moreover, the NMR spectrum of the ICD when attached to GST did not show any noticeable differences from the untagged ICD alone, as shown in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1E. This suggests that the GST tag could not induce a conformational change in the ICD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Hence, firstly, the mechanisms for binding between ICD could be because of the conformational changes of ICD that are introduced by GST-dimer/other-dimeric tag instead of dimerizing ICD. I appreciate the use of different dimeric sets to support the importance of having a dimer tag. Nevertheless, there is a logical issue behind the conclusion. (a) Dimerization of ICD refers to the intermolecular interaction between two ICD monomers by having physical contact sites. (b) The dimerization of GST only provides a tag to bring two ICD monomers together, which does not provide a dimeric interface between ICDs. (c) with the same logic, a dimeric form of any unstructured/structured proteins will not introduce inter-molecular interaction by just being a dimer if the monomer does not provide a binding.</p></disp-quote><p>We again appreciate the insightful comments/discussions regarding the distinction between dimeric tags and ICD dimerization. We hope that our responses to the preceding questions have provided ample clarification on this matter. Accordingly, we have revised our writing to reflect this distinction and explain why we favor the ICD dimerization model. Our data in the new Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 demonstrate that ICD self-association does occur, which supports the model that dimerization tags promote physical dimerization of ICD. However, we acknowledge that without a high-resolution structure of the ICD-WRC complex, we cannot precisely distinguish this model from others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the authors did not show experimental evidence to prove that GST-ICD is a dimer. Dimerization is a presumption based on GST, the final oligomerization status and potential heterogeneity of oligomerization of GST-ICD need to be defined experimentally. Otherwise, the authors can only claim that the dimeric motif (GST or FKBP-FRB) can facilitate the binding between ICD and WRC. Considering the IDR nature with elongated shape, several approaches are able to define its oligomerization status and heterogeneity, including SEC-MALS, AUC, and fluorescent-labeling and imaging-aided single particle-imaging by using a set of proteins at specified oligomerization status to generate a standard curve.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the helpful suggestions from the reviewer on experimentally determining the dimerization (or oligomerization) state of the ICD-ICD interaction. Pease see our detailed responses to Reviewer #1 for more information on this topic. We have provided evidence in the new Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A supporting direct ICD-ICD interaction, which is likely mediated by electrostatic interactions and is mediated by the same sequences important for WRC binding. While we considered the experiments suggested by the reviewer, due to the small size and disordered nature of the ICD as well as instrumental limitations, we ultimately decided to determine the binding affinity by measuring the intrinsic fluorescence from the single tryptophane residue in the ICD. Unfortunately, despite pursuing this approach for nearly three months, we were unable to obtain a definitive answer due to various experimental complications, which we explained in our responses to Reviewer #1 and summarized in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 2. Nevertheless, despite the lack of quantitative measurements of the affinity, we are confident that our new data have provided sufficient evidence supporting the direct interaction between ICD molecules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, in vivo dimerization conclusion is an overstatement. Co-IP experiments only can support the interactions between bait and prey, which do not verify dimerization, oligomerization status, or heterogeneity. Hence, the conclusion supporting the hypothesis on Page 20, lines 422-425, is invalid.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer's comment that co-IP experiments cannot confirm the dimerization, oligomerization, or heterogeneity of a protein complex. We apologize as our writing gave the impression that we seemed to rely on the co-IP experiment to verify the ICD dimerization. We want to clarify that we used co-IP as an auxiliary test to investigate whether HPO-30 has the potential to self-associate in cells, as we could not purify the full-length HPO-30. We did not arrive at the conclusion of ICD dimerization solely based on the co-IP experiment. Instead, we provide experimental evidence supporting direct ICD-ICD interaction using purified proteins, as shown in the new Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A. Please also see our response to Reviewer #1 for further details on this topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. For Figure 3 supplementary 1D, the authors need to provide a standard and calibration to indicate the calculated MW and oligomerization status for samples before and after adding rapamycin.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion. We have added standard proteins and calculated Mw, which are now shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, do F and F-ICD fully overlap before adding rapamycin on Superdex 75?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we can confirm that the two separate monomeric parts of F/F-ICD (i.e., GB1-FKBP-ICD and GB1-FRB-ICD) have very similar Mw and fully overlap before they were mixed with rapamycin in gel filtration. We have included gel filtration chromatograms obtained from largescale purification of the individual proteins in the new Figure 3—figure supplement 1E as supporting evidence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The different interpretations of why F/F-ICD inhibits Rac1-activated WRC in actin polymerization appear confusing. On one side, the authors hypothesize that a direct binding between ICD and actin is the key (page 19, line 396). By the way, no inhibition of actin spontaneous polymerization by ICD was observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the insightful question from the reviewer. Please see our responses to Reviewer #1 for information on the same topic. In response to this question, we have now provided new data in Figure 5C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1E, showing that the ICD inhibits the spontaneous polymerization of actin in the absence of any effector proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the other side, authors claim that the inhibitory effect of ICD in the reaction pool with mixed G-actin, F-actin, WRC, ICD, and Rac1, is an inhibition on the Rac1-activated WRC by citing an opposite activation result where a mixture of PCDH10 ICD activate actin polymerization in the presence of WRC and Rac1. I had difficulty understanding how these different messages support each other and how these conclusions were deduced from these related but conflicting information.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any confusion caused by our previous writing and appreciate the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now revised our manuscript to provide clearer explanations regarding the distinct activities of HPO-30 ICD in the actin polymerization assay. Our actin polymerization data in the old Figure 4 (new Figure 5) support two points. First, ICD strongly inhibits actin polymerization independent of WRC, WCA, or Arp2/3. Second, ICD binding to WRC promotes WRC activation by Rac1 (Figure 5E). This activating effect is dependent on WRC, because ICD does not have any effect on the activity of isolated WCA in the same conditions (Figure 5F). However, the strong inhibitory effect of ICD on actin polymerization, particularly at high ICD concentrations, masks its activating effect on the WRC, thus complicating our data presentation.</p><p>Regarding the comparison to the WIRS-containing receptor PCDH10, we use PCDH10 ICD as an example to demonstrate that such cooperativity observed between ICD and Rac1 is not unprecedented. We had no intention to infer that PCDH10 ICD shares the same mechanism as HPO-30 ICD in promoting Rac1-WRC activity.</p><p>We hope our new writing and explanation have addressed the reviewer's concerns and provided clarity on this matter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I guess that F/F-ICD might have different interactions towards Rac1 or have a higher affinity towards the Rac1-activated WRC after undergoing the conformational changes, such as from either disordered- or ordered changes to another ordered status or changes in complex oligomerization status.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful suggestion. We have performed an equilibrium pulldown experiment to test whether the ICD indeed prefers to bind the Rac1-activated WRC. Our new results in the new Figure 5 —figure supplement 1F demonstrate that the binding between ICD and the WRC was indeed enhanced by the presence of Rac1, as indicated by the reduced WRC signal in the supernatant of the pull-down reactions. These results suggest that the ICD preferentially interacts with the activated WRC, consistent with our observation that the ICD promotes WRC activation by Rac1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Direct binding of ICD to F-actin is an appealing phenomenon in F-actin sedimentation assay. For Figure 5, TIRF imaging would help to understand the binding or bundling at this high concentration of ICD with spatial information between ICD and F-actins. I also suspect that F/F-ICD likely bundles F-actin at such concentration. Rap induced more ICD in pellet at molar ratio ICD: G-actin &gt;1, which has a much higher affinity to F-actin shown in 5 nM concentration TIRF assay in figure 6. These results suggest that either a high oligomerization of ICD happens on F-actin at this condition or F/F-ICD forms much-higher oligomer/aggregates in the solution without associating with F-actin.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for the insightful analysis and pointing out the possibility of actin bundling activity. In our smTIRF imaging shown in Figure 7 and Video 3-5, we only observed events of the ICD binding to the side (or end) of F-actin, but not any clear bundling of F-actin, even when we increased the concentration of ICD from 15 nM (fluorophore-labeled) to 1 µM (unlabeled). To make a fair comparison between the single molecule experiment and the bulksolution assay, we have repeated the F-actin sedimentation assay using 1 µM ICD (new Figure 6A). At this lower concentration, the ICD still effectively co-pelleted with F-actin. Combining these observations, we conclude that while the ICD directly binds to the side or end of actin filaments, it does not bundle actin under our experimental conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Considering the impact of eLife in guiding future research, the current interpretation format would not be appropriate for future studies on the function and mechanism of disordered proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for recognizing the potential impact of our study on the field of disordered proteins. We have taken all the critiques raised by the reviewers seriously and addressed them point-by-point. We have also completed almost all the experiments suggested by the reviewers, as well as several other new experiments, which together have significantly strengthened our work. Moreover, our extensively revised writing now provides a more accurate presentation of our findings. Based on these improvements, we hope that our revised manuscript has met the high standards required for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Understanding ICD inhibition on the WRC-Rac1 complex would provide important knowledge.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize again for any misunderstanding our previous writing may have caused. Our study supports two distinct mechanisms of the ICD: (1) inhibition of actin polymerization, and (2) enhancement of WRC-Rac1 activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>But the current result is not sufficient to understand the mechanism. Several key components are missing. 1. Quantitative biochemical characterization of inter and intramolecular interactions, such as Kd and oligomerization status, for single components or complex in the different combinations of ICD, WRC, Ras1, G-actin, or F-actin.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment on the importance of quantitative measurements of molecular interactions for a full understanding of the function of ICD on the WRC and actin. In response, we have included quantification of the binding affinity between the ICD and WRC (new Figure 1D) and between the ICD and F-actin (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). Although we attempted extensively to quantify the binding affinity of the ICD-ICD interaction using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements, we faced technical challenges and could not obtain definitive results. Nonetheless, our qualitative pull-down data and mutagenesis data in the new Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A support the notion that the ICD-ICD interaction is weak and sensitive to buffer conditions. We believe that these data are sufficient to support the two mechanisms proposed for how HPO-30 ICD regulates the actin cytoskeleton.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If ICD is disordered, it will likely have weak interaction with binding partners, which could be technically challenging. Such weak interaction is reflected by the TIRF imaging, where the localization of ICD on F-actin is unstable, either sliding or with a rapid on/off rate. In addition, a higher-order oligomer (brighter dots) is not on the F-actin. I fully acknowledge the technical challenges behind such experiments to make a clear conclusion about the interactions involving the disordered region. I recommend examining the potential secondary structure behind such binding towards actin (G- or F-actin). Otherwise, a flexible interaction between a protein and an actin filament is hard to understand. One of the ways that might help us to understand it could be a surface charge. ICD is a positively charged polymer with a theoretical π of 9.18, which might provide non-specific interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the insightful feedback and suggestions regarding the nature of ICD-actin interaction. We also acknowledge the technical challenges in studying interactions involving disordered regions, and we agree that the weak interaction between ICD and actin presents such a challenge. However, we believe that such interactions are not necessarily difficult to understand, as flexible or disordered sequences can often mediate important protein-protein interactions, as seen in many other systems. For example, the WIRS peptide-WRC interaction, WCA-Arp2/3 interaction, and most SH2 and SH3 binding peptides all involve flexible or disordered sequences. Disordered regions were also shown to mediate actin binding for actin binding proteins like juxtanodin and calponin.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the high positive charge of HPO-30 ICD might contribute to non-specific interactions. However, we believe that the interaction between ICD and actin is more specific in nature. First, the ICD only interacts with F-actin, but not with G-actin, suggesting a specific interaction surface only present on the polymerized actin. Furthermore, in the new Figure 6—figure supplement 1D,E, we have provided new data using alanine scan mutants and actin pelleting assay to identify the regions important for F-actin binding. Moreover, in the new Figure 6—figure supplement 1F,G, we have provided new data showing how the alanine scan mutants affect the capping activity using the F-actin depolymerization assay. These results show that the same regions that are important for WRC binding or ICD binding are also the most important for F-actin binding and the capping activity. Together, our data support the conclusion that the interaction between the ICD and F-actin is specific in nature.</p><p>In summary, we appreciate the thoughtful comments from the reviewer and have taken them into account in our revised manuscript. We believe that our new data support the importance of specific regions of the ICD in its interactions with actin and WRC, and we hope that our revised manuscript will provide a clearer understanding of the mechanism of ICD-mediated regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.</p></body></sub-article></article>
