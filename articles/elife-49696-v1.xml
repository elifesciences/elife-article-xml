These borders are generated by cell segregation mechanisms that establish and maintain a precise organisation of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batlle and Wilkinson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dahmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fagotto, 2014</xref>). At some borders, a distinct boundary cell population is induced which serves as a signaling centre that regulates the patterning of cell differentiation within the tissue. The formation of a sharp and straight border enables such boundary signaling cells to be correctly organised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dahmann and Basler, 1999</xref>). It remains unclear whether or how the induction of a signaling centre is coordinated with border sharpening. In principle, border sharpening and formation of boundary signaling cells may involve parallel mechanisms that are not directly linked. However, studies of the vertebrate hindbrain found that Eph receptor and ephrin signaling is required both for border sharpening and the formation of boundary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Terriente et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xu et al., 1995</xref>), raising the possibility that there is a mechanistic link.</p><p>Eph receptor and ephrin signaling has major role in cell segregation and border sharpening in many tissues in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batlle and Wilkinson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cayuso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fagotto et al., 2014</xref>). Eph receptors comprise a large family of receptor tyrosine kinases that are activated upon binding to their membrane-bound ephrin ligands. Members of the EphA subclass bind to the GPI-anchored ephrinA ligands, whereas EphB receptors bind to transmembrane ephrinB ligands; an exception is EphA4 which binds to ephrinA and specific ephrinB family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gale et al., 1996</xref>). Upon interacting through cell-cell contact, Eph receptor and ephrin proteins are clustered and this activates signal transduction through both components, termed forward and reverse signaling, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Klein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pasquale, 2008</xref>). For Eph receptors, this involves kinase-dependent signaling that activates multiple intracellular pathways. In addition, signaling is mediated by a motif at the C-terminus of Eph receptors that binds to PDZ domain proteins. In the case of ephrinB proteins, signaling occurs through phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues by cytoplasmic kinases, and also through interaction of PDZ domain proteins.</p><p>Eph receptors and ephrins that have a high affinity for each other are expressed in complementary domains in many tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cayuso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gale et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rohani et al., 2014</xref>), such that activation of forward and reverse signaling occurs at the interface. Eph receptor and ephrin signaling can drive cell segregation and border sharpening through multiple mechanisms that likely depend upon whether the tissue is epithelial or mesenchymal: by decreasing cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fagotto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Solanas et al., 2011</xref>), by increasing cortical tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calzolari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canty et al., 2017</xref>), or by triggering cell repulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Poliakov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rohani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, Eph-ephrin signaling has been found to regulate cell differentiation in a number of tissues (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Laussu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wilkinson, 2014</xref>). The regulation of cell differentiation and segregation may be distinct and context-dependent functions. Alternatively, Eph-ephrin signaling could couple cell specification to maintenance of their organisation. For most tissues, it is unclear whether such coupling occurs, but a potential example is the formation of boundaries in the vertebrate hindbrain.</p><p>The hindbrain is subdivided into segments, termed rhombomeres (r1-r7), each with a distinct anteroposterior identity and demarcated by borders across which cell intermingling is restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fraser et al., 1990</xref>). These borders are initially fuzzy and then sharpened through the regulation of cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addison et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) in combination with cell segregation driven by Eph-ephrin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Irving et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kemp et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nieto et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xu et al., 1999</xref>). Boundary cells are induced to form at segment borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guthrie and Lumsden, 1991</xref>) and express specific molecular markers that distinguish them from non-boundary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Heyman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xu et al., 1995</xref>). In zebrafish, these include the Notch modulator, <italic>rfng</italic>, which by inhibiting neurogenesis promotes the maintenance of boundary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2004</xref>). Boundary cells are a source of neuronal progenitor cells in chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Peretz et al., 2016</xref>), and express a number of signaling molecules that may regulate local patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amoyel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gerety and Wilkinson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Riley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sela-Donenfeld et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weisinger et al., 2012</xref>). In the zebrafish hindbrain, boundary cells organise spatially-restricted neurogenesis within segments by expressing Semaphorin chemorepellants that position fgf20-expressing neurons in each segment centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gonzalez-Quevedo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Terriente et al., 2012</xref>). Clues to how boundary cells are induced at segment borders have come from studies of Eph receptor and ephrin function. Several Eph receptors are segmentally expressed in the hindbrain, in a complementary pattern to ephrinBs that they have high affinity for: <italic>ephA4</italic> in r3 and r5 is complementary to <italic>ephrinB3</italic> in r2, r4 and r6; <italic>ephB4</italic> in r2, r5 and r6 is complementary to <italic>ephrinB2</italic> in r1, r4 and r7. Disruption of Eph receptor or ephrin function leads to a decrease both in the sharpening of segment borders and in the expression of boundary markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sela-Donenfeld et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Terriente et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xu et al., 1995</xref>). These findings raise the questions of how Eph-ephrin signaling leads to boundary cell formation and whether this involves distinct pathways from border sharpening.</p><p>We set out to dissect mechanisms of signaling that underlie border sharpening and boundary cell specification in the zebrafish hindbrain. EphA4 and ephrinB3 act as a signaling pair since knockdown of either component disrupts the same segment boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Terriente et al., 2012</xref>). We find that boundary cell markers are expressed in <italic>epha4</italic>-expressing cells and are up-regulated by forward signaling. By creating a series of truncation and point mutants in <italic>epha4</italic>, we show that kinase-dependent and PDZ domain-dependent signaling both contribute to regulation of border sharpening and boundary-specific gene expression. We find that boundary marker expression is regulated by myosin II phosphorylation that occurs downstream of EphA4 activation and increases mechanical tension at segment borders. Mechanotransduction that induces boundary marker expression is mediated by nuclear translocation of Taz. The regulation of actomysosin contraction by Eph signaling thus couples the maintenance of sharp borders and induction of a boundary signaling centre.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Boundary marker expression occurs in ephA4-expressing cells</title><p>Since <italic>epha4</italic> (<italic>epha4a</italic>) is expressed in r3 and r5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xu et al., 1995</xref>), and <italic>ephrinb3</italic> (<italic>efnb3b</italic>) in r2, r4 and r6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2001</xref>), this Eph-ephrin pair interacts at all borders of r3 and r5. Due to the bidirectionality of activation, knockdown of either component will lead to loss of both Eph and ephrin activation, and it is therefore not possible to deduce whether forward and/or reverse signaling regulates boundary marker expression. A clue can come from determining whether boundary cells form in <italic>epha4</italic>-expressing cells, <italic>ephrinb3</italic>-expressing cells, or both. To address this, we carried out in situ analysis using the hybridisation chain reaction (HCR) which enables sensitive fluorescent detection of multiple transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choi et al., 2016</xref>). We found that <italic>rfng</italic> expression which marks hindbrain boundary cells occurs in <italic>epha4</italic>-expressing cells at the borders of r3 and r5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,C–C’’</xref>). <italic>rfng</italic> expression is also detected in a few cells that are not expressing <italic>epha4</italic>, which are most consistently found at the lateral edge of the r5/r6 border (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We also analysed expression of <italic>wnt1</italic>, which is expressed in the roof plate and in the dorsal part of hindbrain boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We found that <italic>wnt1</italic> expression in boundaries also occurs predominantly in <italic>epha4</italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Boundary cell formation thus occurs in cells in which forward signaling is occurring. However, <italic>rfng</italic> expression also occurs in some cells that are not expressing <italic>epha4</italic>, which could reflect a role of reverse signaling, or a dynamic relationship between <italic>epha4</italic> and <italic>rfng</italic> gene expression.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49696.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Boundary markers are expressed in epha4-expressing rhombomeres.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) HCR stainings for <italic>rfng</italic> and <italic>epha4. rfng</italic> is mainly expressed in <italic>epha4</italic>-expressing cells in rhombomeres r3 and r5, with a few <italic>rfng-</italic>expressing cells in adjacent segments, for example r6 (arrowhead).

EphA4 signaling regulates formation of an actin cable at boundaries, which is first detected at 15 hpf and has been implicated in maintenance of a straight border through actomyosin-dependent generation of cortical tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calzolari et al., 2014</xref>). Hindbrain boundary cells have a distinct shape from non-boundary cells, which is altered by knockdown of the myosin phosphatase regulator, <italic>mypt1</italic>, that leads to increased phosphorylation of myosin light chain (pMLC) and actomyosin contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gutzman and Sive, 2010</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we found a higher level of pMLC co-localising with the actin cable at hindbrain borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Furthermore, pMLC was no longer detected at the r2/r3, r3/r4 and r5/r6 borders in <italic>epha4</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).

Taken together, these findings support a model in which EphA4 activation leads to actomyosin phosphorylation and contraction at segment borders, which in turn increases nuclear localisation of Taz and boundary marker expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A key concept that came from early studies of compartment boundaries is that sharp borders enable the correct organisation of signaling centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dahmann and Basler, 1999</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether or how border sharpening and boundary cell formation are coordinated. We have studied this in the vertebrate hindbrain, in which segment borders are sharpened and boundary cells form that act as a signaling centre. We show that forward signaling of EphA4, which regulates myosin light chain phosphorylation that increases cortical tension, is required both for border sharpening and for hindbrain boundary cell formation. Furthermore, increasing myosin II phosphorylation by knockdown of <italic>mypt1</italic> increases boundary marker expression, whereas inhibition of myosin II function or actin polymerization blocks boundary marker expression. We show that EphA4 forward signaling and myosin phosphorylation induce nuclear translocation of Taz, which together with Tead1a regulates boundary marker expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It is likely that activation of other Eph receptors underlies increased pMLC and boundary gene expression at the r1/r2, r5/r6 and r6/r7 borders that are not disrupted in the EphA4 mutants; for example, EphB4 which underlies cell segregation and has complementary expression to ephrinb2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cooke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooke et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>rac3b</italic> gene which is adjacent to <italic>rfng</italic> is co-regulated in hindbrain boundary cells, and knockdown of <italic>rac3b</italic> disrupts actomyosin cable formation and border sharpness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Letelier et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together with our findings, this suggests that Eph signaling initiates boundary gene expression by increasing actomyosin contraction, which is then maintained in a positive feedback loop through expression of <italic>rac3b</italic>. Since increased tension underlies the maintenance of a straight border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calzolari et al., 2014</xref>), cell segregation and boundary cell formation are coupled, thus ensuring that boundary cells are organised at a sharp border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49696.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of EphA4 signaling and hindbrain boundary cell induction.</title><p>The diagram on the left depicts the activation of EphA4 forward signaling by ephrinB3, which through kinase-dependent and PDZ binding domain-dependent pathways increases the level of pMLC. pMLC promotes actomyosin contraction and translocation of Taz to the nucleus, where it interacts with Tead1a to upregulate boundary-specific gene expression.

These findings are consistent with studies of the regulation of cell repulsion and cortical tension by Eph receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fagotto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">O'Neill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rohani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rohani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>). Cell repulsion and tension are regulated by increased Rho activity, which leads to myosin light chain phosphorylation and actomyosin contraction at borders where Eph receptor activation is occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fagotto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rohani et al., 2014</xref>). Multiple kinase-dependent pathways have been found to link Eph receptor forward signaling to Rho activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jørgensen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kania and Klein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pasquale, 2008</xref>). Eph kinase-independent signaling can also lead to cell repulsion and segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>) and can activate Rho, for example through binding of Dishevelled to the PDZ domain binding motif of Eph receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tanaka et al., 2003</xref>). Such kinase-independent signaling leads to a less sustained cell repulsion response than occurs when Eph kinase function is intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, these findings reveal some functional overlap between kinase- and PDZBD-dependent signaling, with a greater role of Eph kinase-activated pathways both in cell segregation and boundary cell induction.</p><p>Previous studies had not resolved whether boundary cells form on one or both sides of the interface of hindbrain segments. We find that for r3 and r5 they form on one side of each interface, in the <italic>epha4</italic>-expressing cells, and this is because they are induced by forward and not by reverse signaling. This finding is consistent with evidence that although reverse signaling can trigger cell repulsion, forward signaling leads to much stronger cell repulsion and actomyosin contraction and thus has a dominant role in cell segregation and border sharpening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fagotto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">O'Neill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rohani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rohani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). However, <italic>rfng</italic> expression is also detected in some cells adjacent to r3 or r5 that are not expressing <italic>epha4</italic>, in particular at the r5/r6 border. The finding that such expression adjacent to r3 and r5 does not occur in <italic>epha4<sup>Δ651</sup></italic> or <italic>epha4<sup>KD</sup></italic> mutants argues against the possibility that any MLC phosphorylation induced by reverse signaling upregulates boundary marker expression. An alternative explanation is that <italic>rfng</italic>-expressing cells in r6 derive from intermingling of boundary cells across the segment border. This explanation requires that <italic>epha4</italic> expression is downregulated in r5 cells that intermingle into adjacent segments, and indeed recent work has found dynamic regulation of r3 and r5 cell identity following intermingling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addison et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The decrease in boundary marker expression in <italic>epha4</italic> mutants is partially rescued by <italic>mypt1</italic> knockdown, suggesting that there is residual activation of myosin II at specific borders, perhaps due to other Eph-ephrin pairs. Intriguingly, the r5/r6 boundary was not rescued in <italic>epha4</italic> null mutants, but was in <italic>epha4<sup>KD</sup></italic> and <italic>epha4<sup>Δ651</sup></italic> mutants. Since the <italic>epha4<sup>Δ651</sup></italic> mutant lacks forward but not reverse signaling, whereas the <italic>epha4</italic> null mutant lacks both, this could suggest that reverse signaling into r6 cells can induce boundary marker expression when tension is amplified by <italic>mypt1</italic> knockdown. Indeed, although forward signaling underlies actomyosin contraction in border sharpening, it remains possible that reverse signaling also leads to MLC phosphorylation, which can lead to boundary marker expression when increased by <italic>mypt1</italic> knockdown. However, <italic>rfng</italic> expression spreads into r5 but not r6 after <italic>mypt1</italic> knockdown, arguing against this idea. As some EphA and EphB receptors can form heteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fox and Kandpal, 2011</xref>), an alternative explanation is that truncated or kinase-dead EphA4 enables activation of another Eph receptor by ephrinB3. Indeed, EphB4, which has a low affinity for ephrinB3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noberini et al., 2012</xref>), is expressed in r5 and r6 and regulates cell segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cooke et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, <italic>mypt1</italic> knockdown leads to spreading of <italic>rfng</italic> expression into r3 and r5, several cell diameters away from the segment border, whereas EphA4 is assumed to be activated at the border. One potential explanation is suggested by the finding that during liver development ephrin-expressing cells extend processes into Eph-expressing territory and thus regulate cell behaviour away from the border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cayuso et al., 2016</xref>). If this also occurs in the hindbrain, it could lead to weak EphA4 activation a few cell diameters from the border, which can upregulate <italic>rfng</italic> expression when tension is amplified by <italic>mypt1</italic> knockdown. Another possible mechanism is through secretion of ephrin-containing exosomes, which have been detected in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gong et al., 2016</xref>), though it is not known whether exosomes mediate ephrin signaling in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Regulation of cell identity by Taz activity</title><p>There is increasing evidence for roles of Yap/Taz activity in maintaining stem cells, or in some tissues in promoting their differentiation to specific derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Panciera et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Varelas, 2014</xref>). In some contexts, nuclear translocation of Yap/Taz protein is regulated by forces originating from interaction of cells with extracellular matrix, from stretching, shearing and compression of cells, and from actomyosin contractility within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elbediwy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Halder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Low et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun and Irvine, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Varelas, 2014</xref>). Hindbrain boundary cells are neural progenitors that are prevented from differentiating through Notch activation, which is promoted by Rfng (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2004</xref>), thus maintaining the boundary signaling centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Terriente et al., 2012</xref>). Activation of Taz by actomyosin contraction therefore leads to the formation and maintenance of these specialised progenitors in part through regulation of Notch pathway activity. Likewise, an interplay between Yap/Taz and the Notch pathway that maintains progenitors has been found in other tissues (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Totaro et al., 2018</xref>). For example, Yap/Taz maintains epidermal stem cells by inhibiting Notch signaling through regulation of Notch pathway components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Totaro et al., 2017</xref>). In another example, the contractility of muscle cells activates Yap, which upregulates Jag2 expression, leading to Notch activation in neighbours that inhibits their differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Esteves de Lima et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Yap and Taz also have important roles in growth control in which genes that drive proliferation are upregulated by nuclear localisation of Yap/Taz, which is inhibited by activation of the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaspar and Tapon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Halder and Johnson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Low et al., 2014</xref>). Since cortical tension leads to nuclear localisation of Taz at hindbrain boundaries, this raises the question of whether actomyosin contraction increases cell proliferation in addition to inducing boundary marker expression. Studies in chick argue against this idea as hindbrain boundaries have a lower proliferation rate than segment centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guthrie et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Peretz et al., 2016</xref>), reflecting their role as a pool of neurogenic stem cells. However, recent work has found two-fold greater proliferation at boundaries than segment centres at late stages in the zebrafish hindbrain (after 26 hpf), which depends upon Yap/Taz and Tead activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Voltes et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, this work found that the Yap/Taz-Tead pathway is activated by actomyosin tension at boundaries and therefore increases cell proliferation downstream of Eph-ephrin signaling. Yap/Taz activation and cell proliferation declines by 40 hpf, concommitant with a switch of boundary cells to neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Voltes et al., 2019</xref>). However, since this study used reporters that detected Tead activity only after 20 hpf, it did not test an earlier role in boundary cell specification, which we find occurs prior to 18 hpf. Taken together, these findings suggest stage-specific functions of Yap/Taz activity in cell specification and proliferation at hindbrain boundaries.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Concluding perspectives</title><p>The mechanical regulation of gene expression enables an interplay between morphogenesis and cell identity that contributes to tissue patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Xia et al., 2019</xref>). The transcriptional control of cell differentiation leads to differential expression of mediators of morphogenesis, creating mechanical forces which can in turn feed back on the specification of cell identity. In the hindbrain, <italic>epha4</italic> expression is regulated by <italic>krox20</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Theil et al., 1998</xref>), such that cell segregation and border sharpening is coupled to segmental identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tumpel et al., 2009</xref>). Mechanical forces regulated by EphA4 signaling in turn lead to the specification of boundary cell fate, thus ensuring correct organisation of signaling centres. There is increasing evidence for roles of Eph receptors and ephrins in the regulation of cell differentiation through a diversity of pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Laussu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wilkinson, 2014</xref>). In some cases, Eph receptor activation seems to be deployed to only regulate cell differentiation, by acting through pathways distinct from those that underlie cell segregation. For example, Eph activation regulates cell fate choices in Ciona by antagonising Fgf signaling through inhibition of the MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Picco et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stolfi et al., 2011</xref>). It will be important to understand how Eph signaling has these distinct functions in cell segregation and regulation of cell differentiation in different contexts. It will also be interesting to determine whether it has broader roles in activating the Yap/Taz pathway to couple border formation and the control of cell identity. In particular, it may be fruitful to explore this in vertebrate development, in which Eph signaling underlies the formation and maintenance of sharp borders in many tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batlle and Wilkinson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cayuso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fagotto et al., 2014</xref>). Since the principal mechanisms that drive border sharpening are contact repulsion and cortical tension that require actomyosin contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fagotto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">O'Neill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rohani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref

hindbrain is deployed in other tissues to regulate gene expression through Yap/Taz activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Plasmids used in the construction process (Golden Gate TALEN and TAL Effector Kit 1.0, #1000000016) as well as pCS2TAL3-DD and pCS2TAL3-RR destination vectors (#37275 and #37276) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dahlem et al., 2012</xref>) were obtained from Addgene. TAL effector domains and FokI nuclease were cloned into these destination vectors to form the final pCS2-TAL vector for each TALEN, from which mRNA was synthesised using the SP6 mMessage mMachine kit (Life Technologies). Embryos were injected with equal amounts (100–300 pg) of RNA encoding each of the left and right TALEN arms. A founder with a frame shift (4 bp deletion and 2 bp insertion) that truncates the protein at residue five was used to raise the <italic>ephrinb3b</italic> mutant line. RVD sequences of <italic>ephrinb3b</italic> TALENs are in the Key Resources Table.</p><p>Point and truncated mutants of <italic>epha4a</italic> were generated by CRISPR/Cas9. For this, oligonucleotides targeting different <italic>epha4a</italic> sequences were cloned into the pDR274 plasmid for sgRNA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hwang et al., 2013</xref>; #42250 Addgene). In vitro synthesis of the sgRNA was done using the T7 RiboMAX Large Scale RNA Production System (#P1300 Promega). Embryos were injected with 200–300 pg gRNAs and 1.6 ng EnGen Cas9 protein (#M0646M NEB). The target and gRNA sequences, and mutations generated, are given in the Key Resources Table and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>. Immunostaining for EphA4 confirmed a complete absence of protein in homozygous null embryos.</p><p>To introduce the K658M mutation in the kinase domain of EphA4a, sgRNA and Cas9 protein were co-injected with a 74 bp donor oligonucleotide (Key Resources Table) containing three silent mutations at the gRNA target site, the K658M mutation and an additional silent mutation that generated an RsaI restriction site. Mutations were identified by amplicon restriction using restriction enzymes or T7 endonuclease I (#M0302L NEB) and verified by sequencing. A fish was identified carrying the K658M mutation together with a 6 bp deletion affecting three additional residues (649-651) in the kinase domain.</p><p>For the transient CRISPR knockouts of <italic>mypt1</italic>, <italic>yap1</italic>, <italic>taz</italic>, <italic>tead1a</italic> and <italic>tead3a</italic>, 3 to 5 crRNAs targeting the same gene (Key resources table) were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies Inc (IDT, Iowa, USA). crRNAs were annealed with equimolar amounts of tracRNA and 100 to 150 pg of each gRNA were co-injected with Cas9 protein. The generation of deletions was validated by PCR and in some cases by detection of mismatches by T7 endonuclease I digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auer et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization</title><p>For immunohistochemistry, embryos were fixed in 4% PFA for 2 hr and processed using standard methods. For anti-Taz stainings, antigen retrieval was carried out by heating fixed embryos at 90°C for 20 min in 150 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.5, which were then rinsed and treated with 0.025 U/ml DNAse1 for 75 min at 37°C prior to staining. Samples were imaged using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. Antibodies against Taz and pMLC were from Cell Signalling Technology (#D24E4 and 3671, respectively). Anti-EphA4 was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Irving et al., 1996</xref>). Actin was detected using phalloidin-atto 647N. Nuclear Taz staining was measured using Volocity software (Improvision) and statistical analysis carried out using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test.</p><p>For in situ hybridization, embryos were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C and kept in methanol at −20°C prior to processing.

Jordi Cayuso and colleagues now beautifully identify the underlying mechanism in the hindbrain of the zebrafish embryo. They show that, in r3 and r5, boundary cell markers are induced in <italic>epha4</italic>-expressing cells and are up-regulated by forward signaling. Moreover, they demonstrate that myosin II phosphorylation downstream of <italic>epha4</italic> activation increases mechanical tension at segment borders, which in turn results in induction of boundary cell markers via nuclear translocation of Taz. Thus, Eph signaling couples border sharpening with boundary cell formation through mechanotransduction and Taz/Tead nuclear regulation of gene expression. These findings provide very important novel insights and will be of great interest to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>A critical demonstration linking <italic>epha4</italic> signaling to regulation of border gene expression by Taz-mediated mechanotransduction is provided in Figure 6. However, the presentation of data in Figure 6D (<italic>epha4<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) must be improved. First, the stage of Figure 6D is not mentioned on the panel nor in the figure legend. I assume is 16phf, as in Figure 6B. If so, then the distribution/placement of the yellow arrowheads when comparing Figure 6B and D makes difficult to appreciate the described reduction in nuclear Taz at the affected boundaries. Maybe using asterisks in addition to yellow arrowheads could help. Also, as it might be difficult to fully appreciate the defect in Taz localization at the 16hpf stage, the authors may add a quantification of the results as they did for <italic>MO-mypt1</italic> in Figure 6I. Nonetheless, it appears that the nuclear localisation of Taz at boundaries at 16hpf is still not fully refined and may suffer from a certain variability, even among wild type embryos. In contrast, Taz expression pattern at boundaries is very clear at 18hpf, as in Figure 6C. I believe therefore the analysis would very much benefit from presenting the Taz phenotype in <italic>epha4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> at 18hpf, which would further strengthen the authors' case. Lastly, the stage in Figure 6E should be mentioned as well – i.e. 18hpf, and Figure 6G, G', H, H' are not 14hpf but 18hpf.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting and comprehensive study which investigates the fundamental question of whether morphogenetic processes, associated with sharpening of inter-rhombomeric boundaries in the zebrafish hindbrain, are coupled with cell fate determination events that create unique boundary cells. They utilize gene editing to create an allelic series of EphA4 genes to clearly demonstrate that forward signaling from EphA4 is required to establish boundary cell identities and this process involves dual inputs of kinase and PDZ signaling. These experiments indicate that there is a tight coupling of boundary sharpening and formation of boundary cell identities regulated by EphA4.</p><p>While published studies from these authors and other have previously analyzed events and processes in boundary sharpening this study provides novel insight into mechanisms of cell fate determination modulated by EphA4 signaling that govern formation of boundary cell identity. They show that mechanical tension gated by phosphorylation of MLC directly impacts the regulation of boundary cell identity. This involves actomyosin dependent nuclear localization of Taz that regulates boundary cell. identity markers.</p><p>This a very strong paper because the authors elegantly show through genetic manipulations and cellular analyses precisely how the opposing domains of EphA4 and Efnb3 trigger a series of events that coordinates morphogenetic process of cell sharpening directly to cell differentiation. This is important because it provides a means for regulating the neural progenitor stem population at rhombomere boundaries. These findings have significant relevance beyond the formation hindbrain boundaries as this type of signaling is important in other contexts where cell sharpening and differentiation programs appear to correlate with EphA4 signaling.</p><p>The figures and data supporting the conclusions are very clear and beautifully presented. I believe this is very high quality work, with novel insight and broad general interest to cell and developmental biologists. My only comment is that I would have liked to have seen a summary/model that illustrates the steps in these processes. I believe it would help tie this together and reinforce the findings with the reader.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Cayuso et al. report that forward activation of EphA4 via the kinase and PDZ domains leads to actomyosin phosphorylation and actin contraction at segment borders, which in turn increases nuclear localization of Taz that induces the expression of boundary markers by interacting with Tead1a. This is a very interesting work, which couples for the first time boundary sharpening by mechanical forces with the induction of boundary-specific genes, via EphA4 forward signaling. These findings are significant and novel. Therefore, in principal I fully support its publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Yet, there are some weaknesses in the data that should be addressed prior to its acceptance.</p><p>- The study uses many types of KO and KD techniques to eliminate the expression of multiple genes. However, no demonstration of the genotypes of the Crisp-Cas lines/Crispr-Cas transiently injected embryos as well as the loss of protein expression in the MO-injected embryos is provided to support the genetic and/or expression loss of the desired sequence/protein. These validations are necessary in the manuscript.</p><p>- A general EphA4 KO led to loss of pMLC in r2/r3, r3/r4 r5/r6 borders, as well as prevented the nuclear localization of Taz. However, there is no confirmation that these effects occur via the forward signaling only. Although the authors showed that the border expression of <italic>rfng</italic> and <italic>wnt</italic> is induced by the forward signaling of EphA4, these data are not sufficient to conclude that the entire pathway upstream to <italic>rfng</italic> expression is mainly mediated through the forward signaling. Only by using of the different EphA4 mutants in additional levels the pathway the authors can argue that the mechanical stabilization and Taz nuclear localization in the borders is mediated via the forward signaling.</p><p>- The authors don't show the pattern of the actin cables/pMLC in the <italic>mypt1</italic> KO. This is necessary in order to fully support the suggested model. Moreover, also in the rescues it would be nice to show not only the <italic>rfng</italic> expression rescue but the actual rescue if the actin cables/pMLC, as these are the actual readouts of the mechanical forces induced by EphA4.</p><p>- Taz KO/KD leads to loss of <italic>rfng</italic> in all boundaries, even in those not affected by <italic>epha4</italic> KO. Moreover, Tead1a KO leads to loss of <italic>rfng</italic> in a much milder way than Taz KO. These findings have to be explained in view of the suggested model of activation.</p><p>- The quality of the data in Figure 6 is poor. The nuclear localization data of Taz upon the different manipulations are hard to evaluate by the DAPI+ immunostaining. This is a very significant part of the study, and the authors have to present the cytoplasm-to-nuclear localization in a better way.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49696.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Taz phenotype in epha4<sup>-/-</sup> at 16hpf presented in Figure 6D is currently not very convincing.

The MOs used have previously been described and validated by others – we now make this clearer in the Materials and methods (subsection “Generation of mutants”). For all MO-mediated knockdowns, we also carried out transient Crispr-mediated knockouts to ascertain whether this leads to the same phenotype. When possible, we validated the effect of MO on protein level. We show that the Taz MO (Hong et al., 2005) leads to a decreased level of protein expression (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). For the <italic>mypt1</italic> MO, there is to our knowledge no antibody available to detect the zebrafish protein. <italic>mypt1</italic> MO and mutant embryos were previously shown (Gutzman and Sive, 2010) to alter cell shape and to increase phosphorylation of MLC, which is a target of Mypt1. Likewise, we find that <italic>mypt1</italic> morphant and mutant embryos have the same phenotype (increased boundary marker expression). The <italic>yap1</italic> MO has been validated by Fukui et al. (2014) by rescue and by analysis of splicing, and also used by Cebola et al., Nat Cell Biol 17, 615-626, 2015; Agarwala et al., <italic>eLife</italic> e08201, 2015; Kozlovskaja-Gumbriene et al., <italic>eLife</italic> e21049, 2017.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A general EphA4 KO led to loss of pMLC in r2/r3, r3/r4 r5/r6 borders, as well as prevented the nuclear localization of Taz.

As we have not analysed pMLC in the forward signaling mutants, we have softened our discussion of this point (subsection “EphA4 signaling and boundary cell formation”). A number of studies have shown that forward signaling is the main driver of segregation and border sharpening, and acts by increasing actomyosin tension (Canty et al., 2017; Fagotto et al., 2013; O’Neill et al., 2016; Rohani et al., 2011, 2014). However, we have shown in a cell culture model that reverse signaling leads to weaker repulsion that can contribute to cell segregation (Taylor et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019). Nevertheless, if reverse signaling does lead to some increase in pMLC at boundaries, this is not sufficient to induce boundary gene expression in forward signaling mutants, even after amplifying tension by <italic>mypt1</italic> knockdown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors don't show the pattern of the actin cables/pMLC in the mypt1 KO. This is necessary in order to fully support the suggested model. Moreover, also in the rescues it would be nice to show not only the rfng expression rescue but the actual rescue if the actin cables/pMLC, as these are the actual readouts of the mechanical forces induced by EphA4.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not show the increase in MLC phosphorylation after <italic>mypt1</italic> knockdown as this had been shown by Gutzman and Sive (2010) by Western blot analysis and immunostaining of the hindbrain. They were not able to detect pMLC at hindbrain boundaries in wild type embryos, but did when pMLC increases in the <italic>mypt1</italic> mutant. Their Western blot analysis revealed a five-fold increase in pMLC after <italic>mypt1</italic> knockdown. By optimising the immunostaining we were able to detect pMLC at hindbrain boundaries in wild type embryos. This extends the previous findings of myosin and actin cables at boundaries, which Calzolari et al. (2014) showed are EphA4-dependent. We agree that it would be nice to show that <italic>mypt1</italic> knockdown increases pMLC at boundaries in the EphA4 mutant, but feel that our findings together with the published work give compelling evidence for the pathway from EphA4 –&gt; pMLC –&gt; Taz –&gt; boundary gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Taz KO/KD leads to loss of rfng in all boundaries, even in those not affected by epha4 KO. Moreover, Tead1a KO leads to loss of rfng in a much milder way than Taz KO. These findings have to be explained in view of the suggested model of activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified these points in the revised manuscript (subsection “<italic>taz</italic> and <italic>tead1a</italic> are required for boundary marker expression”). That Taz knockout affects all hindbrain boundaries is consistent with increased pMLC and Taz nuclear localisation at all segment borders. EphB4 and ephrinB2 are segmentally expressed and drive cell segregation, and likely contribute to pMLC and boundary marker expression at the r1/r2, r5/r6 and r6/r7 borders that are not affected in the EphA4 mutants (mentioned in the Introduction and Results). However, we have found that there is some redundancy at these borders, and that at least one further Eph-ephrin pair is segmentally expressed. We now mention (see the aforementioned subsection) that the milder phenotype of tead1a knockout may be due to partial redundancy with family members that have not yet been analysed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The quality of the data in Figure 6 is poor.

For example, Voltes et al. (2019) analysed later stages and detected increased Taz protein but not its nuclear localisation at boundaries (they obtained indirect evidence for pathway activation by using a Tead reporter gene). We tested different conditions and found that it is important to carry out antigen retrieval (now mentioned in the subsection “Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization”). We have carried out stainings for <italic>epha4</italic> null, truncated and kinase dead mutants and present the new data (revised Figure 6). We also clarified (subsection “Myosin regulation downstream of EphA4 regulates Taz localization”, first paragraph) that there is an increase in Taz levels at boundaries, consistent with evidence that the actin cytoskeleton can regulate the stability of Taz. Not all boundary cells have nuclear Taz, which may reflect dynamic nuclear localisation. We now show examples of nuclear localisation in different boundaries (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p></body></sub-article></article>
