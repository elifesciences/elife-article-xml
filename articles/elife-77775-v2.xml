To detect and encode these stimuli, hair cells require steady ATP production, which can be accompanied by a buildup of mitochondrial byproducts called reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS buildup is thought to sensitize hair cells to ototoxic insults, including the antibiotic neomycin. Work in neurons has shown that neurotransmission is a major driver of ATP production and ROS buildup. Therefore, we tested whether neurotransmission is a significant contributor to ROS buildup in hair cells. Using genetics and pharmacology, we disrupted two key aspects of neurotransmission in zebrafish hair cells: presynaptic calcium influx and the fusion of synaptic vesicles. We find that chronic block of neurotransmission enhances hair-cell survival when challenged with the ototoxin neomycin. This reduction in ototoxin susceptibility is accompanied by reduced mitochondrial activity, likely due to a reduced ATP demand. In addition, we show that mitochondrial oxidation and ROS buildup are reduced when neurotransmission is blocked. Mechanistically, we find that it is the synaptic vesicle cycle rather than presynaptic- or mitochondrial-calcium influx that contributes most significantly to this metabolic stress. Our results comprehensively indicate that, over time, neurotransmission causes ROS buildup that increases the susceptibility of hair cells to ototoxins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hair cell</kwd><kwd>neurotransmission</kwd><kwd>ototoxicity</kwd><kwd>lateral line</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIADC000085-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lukasz</surname><given-names>Daria</given-names></name><name><surname>Beirl</surname><given-names>Alisha</given-names></name><name><surname>Kindt</surname><given-names>Katie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vivo imaging reveals that the synaptic vesicle cycle is a significant contributor to oxidative stress in sensory hair cells, rendering them susceptible to insults.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory hair cells are a highly active cell type present in the inner ear of all vertebrates and also uniquely present in the lateral line of aquatic vertebrates. Hair cells contain specialized synapses that work near constantly to convert sensory stimuli into electrical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McPherson, 2018</xref>). Similar to neurons, in hair cells, neurotransmission requires extensive amounts of energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rangaraju et al., 2014</xref>). These energy demands are met by ATP produced via mitochondrial respiration. Mitochondrial respiration is accompanied by the production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Elevated levels of ROS result in an accumulation of oxidative stress that renders neurons and hair cells more susceptible to insults and can ultimately lead to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wong and Ryan, 2015</xref>). In humans, hair-cell death or damage can result in irreversible hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mittal et al., 2017</xref>). What contribution the metabolic demands of synaptic transmission have on hair-cell health or susceptibility to insults is not known.</p><p>To convert sensory stimuli into neuronal signals, hair cells rely on two critical, metabolically demanding processes: mechanosensation and synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McPherson, 2018</xref>). At the apical end of hair cells, mechanosensory bundles detect sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Deflection of the mechanosensory bundle opens nonspecific cation channels known as mechanoelectrical transducer (MET) channels which allows potassium and calcium into the cell. MET channel function requires a calcium gradient in the mechanosensory bundle; maintenance of this gradient requires the plasma-membrane calcium-ATPase (PMCA) and is thought to pose a large energy demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dumont and Gillespie, 2000</xref>). MET channel-dependent cationic influx depolarizes the cell and triggers synaptic transmission at the base of the hair cell. Depolarization leads to the opening of basal, voltage-gated Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 calcium channels at the hair-cell presynapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandt et al., 2003</xref>). This calcium influx is detected by the calcium sensor Otoferlin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roux et al., 2006</xref>). Otoferlin is required to couple calcium influx with exocytosis and ultimately mediate the release of glutamate-containing vesicles onto the afferent neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Although the metabolic demands of mechanosensation have been implicated in increased susceptibility to ototoxic insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pickett et al., 2018</xref>), the contribution of neurotransmission to this process is unclear.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genetic basis of neurotransmission in the zebrafish posterior-lateral line.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon drawing of 5 dpf zebrafish larva with the posterior lateral line (LL) highlighted.

The primary pathway of entry of neomycin, gentamicin, and FM 4–64 is through mechanotransduction channels in the mechanosensory hair bundle. At the base of the hair cell is the ribbon synapse. The presynapse or ribbon (magenta) is surrounded by synaptic vesicles (SV, white circles). When mechanotransduction channels are activated, an influx of cations including calcium enters the hair bundle. Hair bundle activation leads to opening of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 voltage-gated calcium channels (blue) and presynaptic calcium influx. The calcium sensor Otoferlin (orange) facilitates fusion by coupling calcium influx with the exocytosis of SVs and the release of glutamate onto the innervating postsynaptic afferent terminal (gray).

This link is relevant to metabolism as mitochondrial-calcium uptake can stimulate mitochondrial respiration and ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tarasov et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, mitochondrial-calcium uptake may serve to promote the ATP production required to maintain both MET channel function and neurotransmission. Furthermore, work in neurons has shown that the recycling and recruitment of vesicle components consumes a significant portion of the ATP needed to sustain neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pulido and Ryan, 2021</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that vesicle endo- and exo-cytosis may pose similarly high energy demands in hair cells. These energy demanding processes and the resulting ROS byproducts produced by activity-driven ATP synthesis could ultimately prove to be cytotoxic.</p><p>To study the energy demands and metabolic impact of hair-cell neurotransmission we examined hair cells in the lateral line of larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Zebrafish allow us to study hair cells that are genetically, functionally, and morphologically similar to mammalian hair cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sheets et al., 2021</xref>). For example, in both zebrafish and mammals, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 calcium channels and Otoferlin are essential for proper hair-cell function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–D’</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sidi et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, because zebrafish are transparent, hair cells can be easily visualized using dyes or genetically encoded indicators (GEIs) to study cellular health and integrity. GEIs can also be used for measurements of evoked activity including: mechanosensitive-, presynaptic-, or mitochondrial-calcium signals as well as exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lukasz and Kindt, 2018</xref>). In addition to these tools and advantages, a large body of work has reinforced the utility of the larval zebrafish model to study hair-cell stressors, including ototoxic aminoglycosides (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coffin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In this study we find that, in hair cells, chronic neurotransmission is associated with increased susceptibility to the ototoxic aminoglycoside antibiotics neomycin and gentamicin. We show that over time, neurotransmission leads to increased ROS accumulation in the cytosol and mitochondria. Importantly, we find that it is the ATP demands of the synaptic vesicle cycle rather that either presynaptic calcium influx or mitochondrial calcium uptake that leads to significant ROS buildup and ototoxin susceptibility. Understanding what processes contribute to the susceptibility of hair cells to stressors is important and may lead to the development of future therapies to prevent the loss of hearing or balance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Cav1.3a</italic> and <italic>otofb</italic> mutations impair overlapping aspects of hair-cell neurotransmission</title><p>In sensory hair cells, the opening of presynaptic Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 channels enables calcium influx that initiates neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–D’</xref>). This process is aided by the calcium sensor Otoferlin which couples calcium influx with vesicle exocytosis. Our work uses zebrafish models lacking functional Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels or Otoferlin to understand how neurotransmission impacts the hair cell’s ability to respond to cellular stressors. Prior to examining cellular stressors in this system, we first thoroughly characterized how the lack of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels or Otoferlin impacts neurotransmission in lateral-line hair cells.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that <italic>ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a</italic> zebrafish mutants exhibit impaired hair-cell function as well as defects in hearing and balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sidi et al., 2004</xref>). Hearing and balance defects were also observed in zebrafish following morpholino knockdown of Otoferlin mRNA in hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee et al., 2015</xref>). Analysis of zebrafish <italic>otof</italic> morphants revealed that both <italic>otofa</italic> and <italic>otofb</italic> are present in hair cells in the zebrafish inner ear, while only <italic>otofb</italic> is present in hair cells of the lateral-line system.

This cation influx depolarizes the cell and triggers the influx of calcium through presynaptic Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 channels, followed by exocytosis of vesicles at the presynapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To measure mechanosensation-dependent and presynaptic calcium signals we used a membrane localized GCaMP (memGCaMP6s, hereafter referred to as GCaMP6s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C and E–H’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-L</xref>), along with a fluid-jet to deflect hair bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lukasz and Kindt, 2018</xref>). Previous work has shown that microphonic potentials (summed potentials dependent on mechanotransduction) are qualitatively reduced in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3a-deficient neuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nicolson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trapani and Nicolson, 2011</xref>). Therefore, we first examined mechanosensation-dependent calcium signals in hair bundles. In response to a 500 ms fluid-jet stimulus, we observed that the magnitude, slope, and duration of GCaMP6s signals in apical mechanosensory bundles were comparable to those observed in sibling controls in both <italic>ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a</italic> and <italic>otofb</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Because of the reported difference in microphonic potentials in <italic>ca<sub>v</sub>1.3a</italic> mutants, we also examined the baseline GCaMP6s intensity in the hair bundles of <italic>ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a</italic> and <italic>otofb</italic> mutants. We found that although it was not significantly different, the resting GCaMP6s intensity in hair bundles of <italic>ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a</italic> mutants tended to be higher relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>); no difference was observed in <italic>otofb</italic> mutants.

When we used a shorter, 200 ms stimulus, we observed similar trends with regard to: magnitude, duration, slope, and recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E-H</xref>). Because the resting calcium levels in hair bundles are higher in <italic>ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a</italic> mutants and the recovery of the GCaMP6s responses is faster, it is possible that <italic>ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a</italic> mutants have subtle defects in mechanotransduction. In the future, electrophysiological approaches are needed to assess mechanotransduction more carefully in both <italic>ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a</italic> and <italic>otofb</italic> mutants. Overall, our GCaMP6s measurements indicate that both Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3a- and Otofb-deficient hair cells exhibit largely normal evoked mechanotransduction. This result is important in light of previous work that found eliminating hair-cell mechanosensation could render hair cells more resistant to cellular stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pickett et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we are able to focus our studies on events downstream of hair-cell mechanosensation.</p><p>We next examined evoked GCaMP6s responses at the base of hair cells to characterize presynaptic calcium signals in <italic>ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a</italic> and <italic>otofb</italic> mutants. Our measurements at the base of hair cells revealed that during a 500 ms stimulus, the magnitude, slope, duration, and recovery of GCaMP6s signals in <italic>otofb</italic> mutants was unchanged compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2J-L</xref>).

We also examined the resting GCaMP6s intensity at the base of hair cells and found that, consistent with a loss of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-channel activity, resting calcium levels were significantly reduced in <italic>ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a</italic> mutants compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>); no difference was observed in <italic>otofb</italic> mutants. Our presynaptic measurements indicate that, similar to results obtained in mice, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels but not Otoferlin are required for presynaptic-calcium influx in lateral-line hair cells.</p><p>We next measured evoked exocytosis at the hair-cell presynapse in <italic>ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a</italic> and <italic>otofb</italic> mutants using the genetically encoded indicator (GEI) SypHy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J’</xref>). SypHy is a pH sensitive GFP (pHluorin), targeted to the interior of synaptic vesicles via fusion to synaptophysin. The low pH inside synaptic vesicles quenches SypHy fluorescence, but upon exocytosis, the pH rises along with SypHy fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Granseth et al., 2006</xref>). Upon hair-cell stimulation, we observed no increase in SypHy fluorescence in either mutant, revealing that both mutants lack evoked exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J’</xref>). This lack of exocytosis in zebrafish hair cells agrees with previously published data collected from the auditory system in <italic>Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3</italic> and <italic>Otof</italic> mouse mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roux et al., 2006</xref>).

Because of this discrepancy we used loose patch-clamp electrophysiology to quantify spontaneous afferent activity in <italic>ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a</italic> and <italic>otofb</italic> zebrafish mutants. In the lateral line, spontaneous spikes detected in afferent neurons (in the pLLg; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) result from the spontaneous fusion of vesicles at the hair-cell synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trapani and Nicolson, 2011</xref>).

Therefore, we investigated whether transient block of neurotransmission could also augment hair-cell survival. For this work we used a pharmacological approach. We first blocked Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels with the L-type calcium channel antagonist isradipine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fitton and Benfield, 1990</xref>). Previous work has demonstrated that isradipine blocks presynaptic calcium influx without impairing mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). For this experiment we preincubated larvae in 10 µM isradipine for 10 min, followed by a 30 min co-incubation with neomycin. After acute isradipine treatment, we observed no change in survival with a mean % hair-cell survival comparable to DMSO-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, 5-6 dpf). After we observed no protection using an acute isradipine application, we decided to switch to longer incubations. Here, we applied 10 µM isradipine to larvae at 4 dpf for 24 hr or at 3 dpf for 48 hrs prior to 100 µM neomycin treatment at 5 dpf. In contrast to our acute isradipine application, both of the longer 24 and 48 hr isradipine incubations significantly augmented hair-cell survival after neomycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G-H</xref>, 5 dpf). This indicates that a relatively long (~24 hr) block of presynaptic calcium influx can confer significant resistance to neomycin.</p><p>Similar to the genetic disruption in <italic>ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a</italic> mutants, isradipine treatment blocks not only presynaptic calcium influx but also downstream exocytosis. Therefore, we used pharmacology to acutely and specifically disrupt the synaptic vesicle cycle. To disrupt the synaptic vesicle cycle, we used the dynamin inhibitor Dynole 34–2, which blocks endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jackson et al., 2015</xref>). Previous work in neurons has shown that compensatory endocytosis is required to maintain a readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). To confirm Dynole 34–2 impairs hair-cell exocytosis without altering other aspects of hair-cell function, we performed several controls. Using calcium imaging, we found that 2.5 µM Dynole 34–2 treatment did not impair evoked mechanotransduction or presynaptic calcium influx compared to DMSO-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). Next, we recorded spontaneous spikes from hair-cell afferents to determine if Dynole 34–2 impairs exocytosis. Importantly, we found that after a 10-min treatment with 2.5 µM Dynole 34–2, the number of spontaneous spikes recorded from lateral-line afferents was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E-F</xref>). Overall, this functional assessment indicates that Dynole 34–2 specifically impairs hair-cell exocytosis without any detectable impact on hair-cell mechanotransduction or presynaptic-calcium influx. After verifying the efficacy of Dynole 34–2, we applied 2.5 µM Dynole 34–2 for the duration of the 30 min neomycin treatment. Like our isradipine experiments, for this transient Dynole 34–2 treatment, we observed no significant protection with a mean % hair-cell survival similar to DMSO-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, 5-6 dpf). However, pretreatment with 2.5 µM Dynole 34–2 for 24 or 48 hr prior to neomycin treatment offered significant protection compared to DMSO controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G-H</xref>, 5 dpf).</p><p>Taken together, analysis of our mutant models and our pharmacology experiments suggest that prolonged loss (~24 hr) of neurotransmission reduces neomycin susceptibility. Surprisingly, impairing the synaptic vesicle cycle even in the presence of normal calcium currents results in a level of neomycin resistance comparable to that observed in the absence of both calcium influx and exocytosis. This suggests that it is the synaptic vesicle cycle contributes to hair-cell neomycin susceptibility.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Chronic loss of Cav1.3a or Otofb protects hair cells against the ototoxin gentamicin</title><p>Neomycin is just one of many cytotoxic stressors that can be acutely damaging to hair cells.

The lack of gross differences in the observed pattern of formation of Neo-TR lysosomal puncta suggests that lack of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels or Otoferlin does not offer protection through differential lysosomal loading. Taken together, our assays using Neo-TR indicate that the neomycin protection observed in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3- or Otofb-deficient hair cells is not due to altered Neo-TR uptake, clearance, or trafficking into lysosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Hair cells that exhibit evoked neurotransmission are younger and more resistant to neomycin</title><p>Previous work by our group demonstrated while all hair cells in each lateral-line neuromast are mechanosensitive, only a subset of cells exhibit neurotransmission when depolarized by mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–E’, G–G’1–I’</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).

On one hand, we found that perturbations that result in chronic loss of neurotransmission in all hair cells confer protection from ototoxins. On the other hand, within wildtype hair cells, the presence of evoked neurotransmission correlates with protection from ototoxins compared to cells without evoked neurotransmission. Moving forward we explored what could explain this discrepancy. Numerous studies have shown that neuromasts rapidly acquire new cells over the course of development (2–4 dpf). By the time the lateral-line system becomes functional around 5 dpf, each neuromast contains cells of different ages. In addition, previous work has suggested that hair cells of different ages show differences in susceptibility to neomycin–namely that older hair cells are thought to exhibit higher susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murakami et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pickett et al., 2018</xref>). Based on this evidence we directly tested whether surviving hair cells with evoked neurotransmission at 5 dpf were in fact younger.</p><p>To differentiate hair cells based on age, we used two approaches: DAPI labeling and kinocilial height measurements. For DAPI labeling, we applied the vital dye at 3 dpf. At this stage, DAPI is only taken up by functionally mature cells via mechanosensitive ion channels. Importantly, similar to previous work using Hoechst label, we observed that DAPI is retained in the same set of hair cells days after dye labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pickett et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the presence of DAPI label at 5 dpf can distinguish older cells (DAPI-positive) from younger cells (DAPI-negative) that matured or were added to the neuromast after the initial DAPI labeling at 3 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B'</xref>). In addition to DAPI labeling, we measured the height of the tallest part of the hair bundle, the kinocilium, at 5 dpf. Previous work has shown that kinocilial height is a useful way to stage hair cells developmentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kindt et al., 2012</xref>). After DAPI labeling at 3 dpf, we found that the kinocilial heights of all DAPI-positive hair cells at 5 dpf were &gt;20 µm, consistent with a mature population of hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast DAPI-negative hair cells had a more even spread of kinocilial heights (2.5–23.5 µm), consistent with a developing population of hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Overall, these data indicate that either kinocilial height or DAPI labeling can be used to estimate hair-cell age. Moving forward we used kinocilial height measurements to determine whether older hair cells were more susceptible to neomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). After application of 100 µM neomycin for 30 min, we observed that younger hair cells had significantly higher survival compared to mature hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E-E'</xref>; % of young cells surviving: 63.17%±8.62, % of mature cells surviving: 10.93%±3.16). This indicates that within wildtype neuromasts, younger hair cells are indeed less susceptible to neomycin.</p><p>Next, we investigated whether cells that exhibit evoked neurotransmission are more resistant to neomycin because they are relatively younger. For this work we labeled hair cells with DAPI at 3 dpf and then used functional calcium imaging at 5 dpf to identify hair cells with (active) and without (inactive) evoked presynaptic calcium influx. We found that significantly more inactive cells were older and DAPI-positive compared to active cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–D’’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; active: 22.5%, inactive 87.5% cells per neuromast DAPI-positive). Overall, our DAPI experiments revealed that within a given neuromast, active hair cells exhibiting evoked neurotransmission represent a younger population of hair cells compared to inactive hair cells. Furthermore, their relative youth helps to explain how hair cells with evoked neurotransmission are more resistant to neomycin despite our evidence that chronic loss of neurotransmission is protective against neomycin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title><italic>Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3a</italic> and <italic>otofb</italic> mutants exhibit lower baseline mitochondrial oxidation</title><p>The lack of neurotransmission we observed in older hair cells was intriguing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>). It is also consistent with the hypothesis that over time, activity-driven ATP synthesis in hair cells can lead to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce cellular damage. If neurotransmission is a driver of these metabolic demands, synaptic silencing in older cells could be a way to prevent ROS accumulation and associated pathology. But whether neurotransmission correlates with an increase in ROS in hair cells is not known.</p><p>To investigate the relationship between ROS accumulation and neurotransmission, we applied the ROS indicator dyes CellROX Orange and MitoSOX Red to <italic>ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a</italic> or <italic>otofb</italic> mutant hair cells. CellROX Orange is a general indicator of cellular oxidation and ROS levels, while MitoSOX Red is an indicator used to specifically detect mitochondrial superoxide.

Together our CellROX Orange and MitoSOX Red measurements suggest that the loss of neurotransmission in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a or Otofb-deficient hair cells results in a lower baseline level of ROS accumulation and lower oxidative stress. ROS are known to impart damage to DNA, lipids, proteins, and many other molecules throughout the cell, rendering cells overall more susceptible to insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang and Lian, 2020</xref>).

In addition, mutations that impact hair-cell function in mice can not only impair development, but also lead to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwander et al., 2009</xref>). In the lateral line, hair cells regenerate after cell death, and the death of many hair cells may result in higher rates of cell turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 2003</xref>).

Overall, our TMRE and JC-1 labeling indicates that mitochondrial membrane potential is potentially lower in hair cells with impaired neurotransmission. A lower mitochondrial potential could explain the reduced oxidative stress detected in both <italic>ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a</italic> and <italic>otofb</italic> mutant hair cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title><italic>Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3a</italic> and <italic>otofb</italic> mutants exhibit reduced mitochondrial oxidation over time</title><p>Our TMRE measurements reflect mitochondrial activity at a single moment in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–L</xref>). In contrast our CellROX Orange and MitoSOX Red measurements likely reflect ROS that have accrued over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–H</xref>). One drawback to using these single wavelength vital dyes (TMRE, CellROX and MitoSOX) is that they rely on comparable dye uptake between our mutants and controls. Although we observed normal Neo-TR entry into hair cells in our mutants, it is possible that vital dye entry is impaired. Therefore, we examined how mitochondrial activity relates to ROS production over time using a genetically encoded indicator of oxidative stress, MitoTimer. Using a stable transgenic line expressing MitoTimer ensures that the indicator is present at comparable levels in both mutants and controls. MitoTimer localizes to mitochondria and exhibits an oxidation-dependent shift in fluorescence signal from green to red. MitoTimer has previously been used in lateral-line hair cells to detect the accumulation of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hernandez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pickett et al., 2018</xref>). For example, Pickett et al. demonstrated that historically older hair cells exhibit a higher red to green fluorescence ratio and are more susceptible to neomycin-induced cell death.</p><p>We used MitoTimer to measure differences in mitochondrial oxidation with age in hair cells of <italic>ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a</italic> or <italic>otofb</italic> mutants. The posterior lateral-line is still forming in larvae at 2–3 dpf; at these ages hair cells are newly formed and immature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kindt et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, at 5–6 dpf the lateral-line system is functional, and the majority of hair cells are fully mature. We measured the MitoTimer ratio (red to green) in younger hair cells in larvae at 3 dpf and in older hair cells in larvae at 5 dpf and 6 dpf. Similar to previous work, we observed a significant increase in the Mitotimer ratio, consistent with a buildup of mitochondrial oxidation, in control hair cells over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D-E</xref>). In addition, we found that the MitoTimer ratio was significantly reduced in older hair cells in both <italic>ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a</italic> and <italic>otofb</italic> mutants at 5 and 6 dpf compared to sibling controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>).

While these manipulations are specific for their respective targets, their functional outcomes overlap.

Therefore, it is possible that exo- and endo-cytosis rather than presynaptic calcium influx promotes susceptibility to ototoxins.

We targeted two critical components of hair-cell neurotransmission: presynaptic calcium influx and the synaptic vesicle cycle. Overall, we found that chronic but not transient disruption of neurotransmission can partially protect hair cells from aminoglycosides. Furthermore, our results show that, over time, neurotransmission leads to an accumulation of metabolic stress by modulating cell physiology at multiple levels: mitochondrial activity, levels of cytotoxic ROS byproducts, and oxidation within mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>). In line with recent work in neurons, our work suggests that the synaptic vesicle cycle is a strong driver of mitochondrial metabolism and metabolic stress. The accumulation of metabolic stress ultimately renders hair cells more susceptible to cytotoxic insults such as aminoglycoside exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Neurotransmission and aminoglycoside uptake, clearance, and packaging</title><p>A side effect of aminoglycoside treatment in humans is hair-cell loss that results in permanent hearing and balance impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitner-Glindzicz and Rahman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schacht et al., 2012</xref>). Since this side effect was first discovered, the susceptibility of hair cells to aminoglycosides has been a topic of intense investigation. Hair cells possess a unique pathway of entry for aminoglycosides, namely MET channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alharazneh et al., 2011</xref>). After initial entry through MET channels, aminoglycosides accumulate and remain confined inside hair cells where they can exert their pathological effects. Based on this premise, studies have established that blocking the MET channel is an effective method of protecting hair cells from aminoglycoside-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alharazneh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kenyon et al., 2021</xref>). However, in our study we found that neurotransmission-deficient hair cells are protected despite largely normal MET channel function as well as normal levels of neomycin accumulation and rates of neomycin entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Furthermore, our data indicates that the protective effects of blocking neurotransmission are not a result of augmented neomycin clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, we show that the pathology underlying aminoglycoside exposure extends beyond the kinetics of uptake, accumulation, and clearance.</p><p>Consistent with the idea that events downstream of drug entry and accumulation underlie the pathological effects of aminoglycosides, studies have examined how localization and packaging impact aminoglycoside pathology. After entering the hair cell, aminoglycosides rapidly build up in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alharazneh et al., 2011</xref>). In the cytosol, aminoglycosides can interact with the plasma membrane and can accumulate in organelles such as the ER, mitochondria, and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hailey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hashino et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Steyger et al., 2003</xref>). The sequestration of aminoglycosides in lysosomes has been of particular interest. For example, work has shown that pharmacologically blocking aminoglycoside uptake into lysosomes exacerbates hair-cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hailey et al., 2017</xref>). This indicates that lysosomes may play an important role in aminoglycoside degradation. In our study we found that the uptake of neomycin into lysosomes is normal in the absence of neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that neurotransmission does not overtly modulate the lysosomal sequestration of neomycin and that more rapid or more efficient lysosomal packaging does not explain the protection observed in the absence of neurotransmission.</p><p>Lysosomal packaging is of particular interest because it may explain why neomycin and gentamicin, despite belonging to the same family of antibiotics, exert their effects on very different timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Owens et al., 2009</xref>). For example, in the lateral-line system, gentamicin treatment takes several hours to kill hair cells, as opposed to minutes in the case of neomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coffin et al., 2013</xref>). It has been shown that, compared to neomycin, gentamicin is much more rapidly packaged into lysosomes following its entry into hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hailey et al., 2017</xref>). This rapid packaging is thought to be one reason gentamicin takes longer than neomycin to exert its pathological effects. In addition, studies have shown that these two aminoglycosides may initiate hair-cell death via different pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coffin et al., 2013</xref>). In our study we find that chronic loss of neurotransmission results in protection from both neomycin and gentamicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-F</xref>), despite different time-courses of pathology, lysosomal packaging and cell-death pathways. This suggests that blocking neurotransmission provides a general form of otoprotection and may broadly protect against differently behaving ototoxic compounds or insults.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Neurotransmission and cellular metabolism</title><p>How could neurotransmission broadly impact susceptibility to a range of ototoxic insults? In order for hair cells to hold up in the face of external insults, in general, it is critical for them to maintain cellular homeostasis. In particular, maintaining metabolic homeostasis is thought to be critical to surviving ototoxin exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). ROS are byproducts of cellular metabolism and are normally present in low concentrations in all cell types. In hair cells, excess ROS buildup can lead to mitochondrial oxidation and trigger cell-death pathways – especially when hair cells are challenged with an ototoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2000</xref>). Our results indicate that the energy demands of neurotransmission promote cellular metabolism, which leads to a buildup of ROS and more oxidized mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Importantly we show that blocking neurotransmission can lessen metabolic side effects related to these energy demands and protect hair cells from ototoxins.</p><p>Like in hair cells, neurotransmission in neurons has also been shown to be energy demanding. Studies in neurons suggest that both the electrical signaling and vesicle release required for neurotransmission require large amounts of ATP (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harris et al., 2012</xref>). These energy requirements can increase the production of ROS and ultimately result in mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular vulnerability, and neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). For example, dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra depend on the metabolically taxing, ATP-dependent process of calcium clearance for their pace-making function. These neurons have been shown to accumulate ROS to a much greater extent than neighboring neurons. This mitochondrial pathology is thought to lead to cell death and the loss of dopaminergic neurons that underlies Parkinson’s Disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dias et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, high ATP demands in these dopaminergic neurons are driven by the need to counterbalance the constant L-type calcium channel engagement that sets pacemaker function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guzman et al., 2010</xref>). In our work we also find that activity related to L-type calcium channel (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3) function increases levels of ROS in hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, after chronic pharmacological block of L-type calcium channels, dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra showed significantly lower mitochondrial oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guzman et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, in our study we found that chronic block of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels reduces mitochondrial activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), the amount of ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and mitochondrial oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) in hair cells. Thus, the metabolic demands associated with presynaptic calcium flux are high and potentially deleterious to both neuronal and hair-cell homeostasis and health. Furthermore, the pathological effects of these metabolic demands represent a common theme in both hearing loss and neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wong and Ryan, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition to presynaptic calcium channel activity, work in neurons has demonstrated that the synaptic vesicle cycle relies heavily on ATP produced by the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pulido and Ryan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rangaraju et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, our work in hair cells also reveals that the metabolic requirements for synaptic vesicle exocytosis – a process downstream of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel function – may underlie susceptibility to ototoxins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We found that hair cells with intact Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel function but impaired synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Otofb deficient- and Dynole 34–2 treated-hair cells) were protected from aminoglycosides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, hair cells with impaired exocytosis also show a reduction in mitochondrial activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, blocking Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel function in hair cells with impaired exocytosis did not confer any additional protection from neomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Together these results indicate that in hair cells, the majority of the ATP required for neurotransmission is used by the synaptic vesicle cycle. In fact, work in neurons has shown that the synaptic vesicle cycle is an underappreciated consumer of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pulido and Ryan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rangaraju et al., 2014</xref>). Within the synaptic vesicle cycle, work in neurons has shown that it is the compensatory endocytosis and synaptic vesicle replenishment following exocytosis that requires significant amounts of ATP. Mechanistically, these ATP demands may arise at least in part from vacuolar-type ATPases (V-ATPases) which reside in synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pulido and Ryan, 2021</xref>). V-ATPases consume ATP in order to help fill vesicles with neurotransmitters such as glutamate and therefore represent a large metabolic burden. Whether the metabolic demands of V-ATPase function are responsible for the metabolic burden and cellular stress associated with hair-cell neurotransmission is not known and awaits future work. Our work in hair cells and complementary work in neurons indicate that the synaptic vesicle cycle represents a source of metabolic stress that can impact cellular health. It is important to understand the specific mechanisms that generate this stress as they represent important targets for therapies to prevent metabolic stress-associated pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Long-term consequences of neurotransmission</title><p>Many studies on aminoglycoside ototoxicity point to mitochondrial involvement as they are thought to be a target of aminoglycosides (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foster and Tekin, 2016</xref>). Our study highlights how hair-cell neurotransmission impacts mitochondria – promoting cellular metabolism, leading to a buildup of ROS and more oxidized mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Under these conditions, when hair cells are challenged with aminoglycosides, mitochondrial pathology linked to neurotransmission and the targeting of aminoglycosides to the mitochondria synergize to initiate hair-cell death.</p><p>We also show that as hair cells mature and age, they accumulate more oxidized mitochondria; block of neurotransmission dramatically reduces this oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Presbycusis or age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is common in both animal models and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang and Tang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang and Puel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wong and Ryan, 2015</xref>). In animal models, ARHL is associated with an accumulation of ROS and mitochondrial damage. Our study suggests that neurotransmission may be a critical link between aging and hair-cell vulnerability. Interestingly, we did observe residual ROS accumulation and mitochondrial oxidation even in hair cells lacking neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). This indicates that in addition to neurotransmission, there are other factors that promote ROS accumulation and mitochondrial oxidation over time. In the future it will be interesting to use our model to explore what other factors contribute to the accumulation of these pathological effects. By fully understanding the mechanisms underlying ROS-induced mitochondrial oxidation within hair cells, it may be possible to protect hair cells from the damage that they incur over their lifetime.</p><p>One therapeutic option to protect hair cells would be to block neurotransmission. But without hair-cell neurotransmission hearing, balance, or lateral-line function are not possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sidi et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, in our previous work we demonstrated that, in the lateral line, the majority of hair cells within neuromast organs are synaptically silent with no detectable evoked presynaptic calcium influx or vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Given the relationship between hair-cell neurotransmission and metabolic stress, synaptic silencing may be a protective mechanism that occurs in older, more mature hair cells where ROS levels and mitochondrial oxidation are elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pickett et al., 2018</xref>). This is consistent with our present study where we show that synaptically silent hair cells are relatively older than synaptically active cells and are also more susceptible to neomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, in the lateral line, as hair cells age, synaptic silencing may serve as a mechanism to limit further ROS accumulation and mitochondrial oxidation. In this scenario, historically younger hair cells are tasked to take on neurotransmission, along with the accompanying metabolic burden. A shift of neurotransmission from older to younger hair cells could limit the amount of damage hair cells accumulate and ultimately prevent widespread cell death, especially when neuromasts are faced with insults like neomycin. Additional research is needed to investigate whether synaptic silencing occurs in mammalian hair cells and whether this mechanism could prevent the accumulation of ROS and mitochondrial oxidation. Such a mechanism would be extremely advantageous as mammalian hair cells do not regenerate and must be maintained over a lifetime.</p><p>Overall, our study shows that proper management of metabolic stress including ROS production and mitochondrial oxidation is critical for hair-cell health and resistance to ototoxins. Furthermore, we find that, over time, hair-cell neurotransmission increases ROS production and mitochondrial oxidation resulting in increased vulnerability to aminoglycosides. This aging-associated increase in vulnerability may shed light on presbycusis and the processes that lead to hearing loss with age. Future work will allow us to understand if this vulnerability extends to other classes of insults, such as noise or non-aminoglycoside ototoxic drugs like cisplatin. A better understanding of the pathologies of aging and the effects of ototoxins on hair cells may ultimately contribute to the development of therapies to prevent hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tübingen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ZIRC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zfin.org/ZDB-GENO-990623-3">http://zfin.org/ZDB-GENO-990623-3</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">See methods, animals</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Tg(myo6b:GCaMP6s-CAAX)<sup>idc1</sup>;</italic><break/>GCaMP6CAAX;</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2017</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-170113-3">https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-170113-3</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Membrane-localized calcium biosensor</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Tg(myo6b:mitoGCaMP3)<sup>w119Tg</sup></italic>; MitoGCaMP3;</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Esterberg et al., 2014</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-141008-1">https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-141008-1</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mitochondria-localized calcium biosensor</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Tg(myo6b:mitoTimer)<sup>w208Tg</sup></italic>; MitoTimer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pickett et al., 2018</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-190708-1">https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-190708-1</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mitochondria-localized ROS biosensor</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Tg(myo6b:SypHy)<sup>idc6Tg</sup></italic>;<break/>SypHy</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2018</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-171205-5">https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-171205-5</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hair-cell localized vesicle fusion indicator</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>cav1.3a<sup>tn004</sup> mutants; gemini; cacna1da</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sidi et al., 2004</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-030616-135">https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-030616-135</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mutants lacking functional Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 channels</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>otofb</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-211124-4">https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-211124-4</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Crispr-Cas9 mutant.

Small pins were inserted perpendicularly through the body of the fish behind the ear and into the notochord at the end of the tail. The hearts of pinned larvae were injected with a solution containing α-bungarotoxin (125 µM, 2133, Tocris Biosciences) to paralyze larvae for imaging.

The system includes a band-pass 488/561 nm filter set (59904-ET, Chroma) and is controlled using Prairie View software (Bruker Corporation). For memGCaMP6s and mitoGCaMP3 imaging we used a piezoelectric motor (PICMA P-882.11–888.11 series, PI Instruments) attached to the objective to acquire rapid five-plane Z-stacks. Z-stacks were acquired with a 1 µm interval to image mechanosensation-dependent calcium flux and a 2 µm interval to image presynaptic and mitochondrial calcium flux. Images were acquired using a 70 µm slit at a 50 Hz frame rate with a resulting a 10 Hz volume rate. Z-stacks were average projected into a single plane for analysis. For SypHy imaging, 3 separate synaptic planes were acquired 2 µm apart at a 50 Hz frame for each neuromast.</p><p>A fluid-jet was used to stimulate apical bundles to evoke vesicle fusion as well as calcium-dependent mechanosensation, presynaptic influx, and mitochondrial uptake. Fluid-jet stimulation was described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lukasz and Kindt, 2018</xref>). Briefly, a fluid-filled glass capillary (part # B150-86-10, Sutter Instruments) was used to deliver anterior and posterior directed fluid flow. Flow was triggered from the capillary using a pressure clamp system (HSPC-2-SB and PV-Pump, ALA Scientific Instruments) controlled by Prairie View software to coordinate imaging with fluid stimulation. A 500 ms or 200 ms step (mechanosensation and presynaptic calcium), 2 s 5 Hz alternating anterior and posterior (vesicle fusion), or 4 s step (mitochondrial calcium) fluid-jet stimulation was used to deflect the apical bundles of anterior-posterior responding posterior lateral line neuromasts.</p><p>For Dynole 34–2 pharmacology, calcium-dependent mechanosensation or presynaptic influx was measured in 0.1% DMSO during a 500 ms step stimulus. Then the solution was exchanged with one containing 2.5 µM Dynole 34–2 in 0.1% DMSO or 0.1% DMSO alone. Larvae were incubated in the new solution for 10 min. After this incubation period evoked calcium-dependent mechanosensation or presynaptic influx were reassessed.</p><p>To visualize changes in GCaMP6s, mitoGCaMP3, and SypHy signals, raw images were processed using a custom program with a user-friendly GUI interface in MATLAB R2014 (Mathworks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). This analysis has been described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lukasz and Kindt, 2018</xref>). The first 10 timepoints from each acquisition were removed to eliminate the initial photobleaching. Then the raw images were registered in X-Y to eliminate movement artifacts. A pre-stimulus reference image was used to generate a baseline image (F<sub>0</sub>). Then the baseline image (F<sub>0</sub>) was subtracted from each image acquired to generate a series of images that represent the relative change in fluorescence signal from baseline or ∆F. The ∆F signals were temporally binned (every 0.5 s), scaled and encoded by color maps, with darker colors (orange, red) indicating an increase in signal intensity. The color maps were then superimposed into the baseline (F<sub>0</sub>) grayscale images in order to visualize the spatial fluorescence intensity changes in hair cells during stimulation.</p><p>To quantify the fluorescence intensity changes from our GCaMP6s, mitoGCaMP3, and SypHy functional imaging, registered images were loaded into FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). In FIJI we used the Time Series Analyzer V3 plugin to create circular ROIs. For presynaptic GCaMP6s, mitoGCaMP3, and SypHy measurements, a circular region of interest (ROI) with a diameter 3.3 μm (~12 pixels with 268 nm per pixel) was placed at the base of each hair cell within a neuromast. For hair-bundle GCaMP6s measurements, a circular ROI with a 1.7 μm diameter (~6 pixels with 268 nm per pixel) was placed on the center of an individual bundle. We then measured and plotted change in the mean intensity (∆F/F<sub>0</sub>) within the region during the recording period. The mean intensity within each ROI was computed for each cell. The signal magnitude, defined as the peak value of intensity change upon stimulation was determined for all ROIs. In addition, the duration (time from stimulus onset to peak), and the slope (from stimulus onset to peak) was measured. After the stimulus peak, the half-life of the GCaMP6s signal was fitted using an exponential one-phase decay. To quantify the resting or baseline GCaMP6s in hair bundles or presynaptic compartment, the mean intensity during the pre-stimulus acquisition (2 s interval) was determined. For GCaMP6s hair-bundle measurements, GCaMP6s signals from all hair bundles were averaged to give a value for each neuromast. For GCaMP6s, mitoGCaMP3, and SypHy, and presynaptic measurements, only the signals from synaptically active hair cells were averaged to give a value for each neuromast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). For mutants without GCaMP6s, mitoGCaMP3, or SypHy signals, a comparable number of cells were chosen at random for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Afferent neuron electrophysiology</title><p>Postsynaptic currents from afferent cell bodies of the posterior lateral-line ganglion (pLLg) were recorded as described previously in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trapani and Nicolson, 2011</xref>). The pLLg was visualized using an Olympus BX51WI fixed stage microscope equipped with a LumPlanFl/IR 60 X/0.90 W water dipping objective (N2667800, Olympus). To record spontaneous postsynaptic currents, borosilicate glass pipettes were prepared with a long taper and resistances between 5 and 10 MΩ (P-97, Sutter Instruments). A Digidata 1440 A data acquisition board, Axopatch 200B amplifier, and pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices, LLC) were used to collect signals. A loose-patch configuration with seal resistances ranging from 20 to 80 MΩ was used in combination with voltage-clamp mode, and signals were sampled at 50 μs/pt and filtered at 1 kHz. Cell bodies were selected at random because mutants lack evoked spikes and therefore it is impossible to identify specific neuromasts innervated by a given neuron. Igor Pro (Wavemetrics) was used to analyze afferent electrophysiology recordings. The number of spontaneous events per neuron per minute within a 5-min recording window was quantified.</p><p>For the Dynole 34–2 assay, spontaneous baseline afferent signals were recorded from a single cell body from a 4–6 dpf larva for a minimum of 5 min. Then a microloader pipette tip (E5242956003, Eppendorf) was used to carefully deliver 10 µL of 125 µM Dynole 34–2 solution (for a final concentration of 2.5 µM Dynole 34–2 in 0.1% DMSO or 0.1% DMSO alone) over 5 s to avoid disrupting the recording. Recordings were continued for another 10 min to determine if the treatment had an effect on spontaneous afferent spike rate. The number of spontaneous events per neuron within the 5-min pre-treatment window was quantified to obtain a baseline before treatment, and the number of spontaneous events per minute the 10-min window after treatment was quantified for post-treatment quantification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Neomycin and gentamicin hair-cell death assays</title><p><italic>Tg(myo6b:memGCaMP6s)<sup>idc1</sup></italic> larvae were immobilized for imaging as described above. Larvae were then incubated in neomycin sulfate solution (75, 100, or 200 µM in CE3 media) for 30 min. After neomycin treatment, larvae were washed one time in CE3 media, followed by a 30 -s incubation with the vital dye FM 4–64 (2 µM, T3166, ThermoFisher), and three more washes in CE3 media. Next, fluorescent, two-color 488 and 561 nm Z-stacks were taken at 1.5 µm intervals using a Nikon A1 upright laser-scanning confocal microscope using a 60×1.0 NA water objective (Nikon Instruments, Inc). The number of surviving cells was identified primarily by counting intact GCaMP6s positive cells that also co-labeled with FM 4–64, a vital dye which disappears upon membrane fragmentation. Any very young or immature GCaMP6s-positive cells without visible hair bundles were excluded from analysis. The number of surviving cells was divided by total cells present before treatment to obtain % cells surviving neomycin treatment for a given concentration for each neuromast.</p><p>For the short-term isradipine and Dynole 34–2 assays, larvae were immobilized for imaging then pretreated for 10 min with 10 µM isradipine (I6658, Sigma-Aldrich) or 2.5 µM Dynole 34–2 (4222, Tocris Biosciences) in CE3 media before being co-incubated in isradipine or Dynole 34–2 and 100 µM neomycin sulfate solution in CE3 media for 30 min. This last incubation was followed by a single wash with CE3 media, incubation for 30 s in 2 µM FM 4–64 in CE3, and two more washes in CE3 followed immediately by imaging. For the long-term isradipine and Dynole 34–2 assays, free swimming 3 dpf or 4 dpf larvae were incubated in 10 µM isradipine or 2.5 µM Dynole 34–2 for 48 or 24 hr, respectively. At 5 dpf larvae were washed 3 X in CE3 before treatment with 100 µM neomycin for 30 min. After short- or long-term drug incubation and neomycin application, neuromasts were imaged and quantified as described above.</p><p>For the gentamicin assays, 5 dpf <italic>Tg(myo6b:memGCaMP6s)<sup>idc1</sup></italic> larvae were incubated in gentamicin sulfate (G1272, Sigma-Aldrich) solution (200 µM in CE3 media) for 2 hr before being washed 3 X in CE3 media and returned to E3 media for 24 hr. After the 24 hr recovery, the 6 dpf larvae were then incubated in 2 µM FM 4–64 for 30 s, followed by two washes in CE3 before imaging. Neuromasts were imaged as described for the neomycin cell death assay. GCaMP6s-positive cell bodies labeled with FM 4–64 were counted for both treated and untreated larvae. The number of surviving cells in the treated group was normalized by the number of cells in the untreated group for each genotype to obtain % cells surviving gentamicin treatment for each neuromast.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Neomycin-Texas Red uptake and clearance assays</title><p>To monitor neomycin uptake and clearance, neomycin sulfate (N1142, Sigma-Aldrich) was conjugated to Texas Red-X-succinimidyl ester (T20175, ThermoFisher) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stawicki et al., 2014</xref>). For imaging of the temporal components of neomycin-Texas Red (Neo-TR) uptake and clearance, an A1 Nikon upright laser-scanning confocal microscope with a 60×1.0 NA water objective was used to acquire images Z-stacks every 1.5 µm. For Neo-TR uptake, <italic>Tg(myo6b:memGCaMP6s)<sup>idc1</sup></italic> larvae were first imaged using a 488 nm laser in 1 mL CE3 to locate neuromasts then 1 mL of 50 µM Neo-TR was added to the solution for a final concentration of 25 µM. Two-color 488 and 561 nm imaging was begun immediately following the addition of Neo-TR with Z-stacks collected every 1 min for 10 min. Immediately following the collection of the final Z-stack for the uptake portion of imaging, the Neo-TR solution was removed, and larvae were washed 3 X with 1 mL of CE3. After the washout Z-stacks were collected every 90 s for 30 min to track Neo-TR clearance. After imaging, Neo-TR intensity was quantified using FIJI. For both uptake and clearance experiments, the Neo-TR channel was corrected for drift in FIJI. Then Z-stacks were max-projected. Neo-TR and GCaMP6s channels were max-projected, and the Neo-TR channel was background subtracted (rolling ball radius 50 pixels). The GCaMP6s channel was then subjected to mean automatic thresholding to generate a mask. This mask was applied to the maximum projected Neo-TR image and the multi-measure tool in FIJI was used to extract the average Texas Red intensity at each time point. The change in Neo-TR fluorescence intensity (∆F) was plotted over time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Live imaging of CellROX Orange, MitoSOX Red, TMRE, JC-1, MitoTimer, and DAPI</title><p>For baseline measurements, CellROX Orange (C10444, ThermoFisher), MitoSOX Red (M36008, ThermoFisher), TMRE (T669, ThermoFisher) and JC-1 (T3168, ThermoFischer) dyes were applied at 10 µM, 5 µM, 10 nM, and 1.5 µM respectively, in CE3. <italic>Tg(myo6b:memGCaMP6s)<sup>idc1</sup></italic> larvae were incubated in CellROX Orange or TMRE for 30 min or MitoSOX for 15 min in darkness. Nontransgenic larvae were incubated in JC-1 for 5 min in darkness. After dye incubation larvae were washed 3 X with CE3, and fluorescent 2-color 488 and 561 nm Z-stacks were taken at 2–2.5 µm intervals using a Nikon A1 upright laser-scanning confocal microscope using a 60×1.0 NA water objective. Laser and Z-stack settings were kept constant across each experiment. After imaging, the two most central slices encompassing the majority of the hair cell bodies were max-projected using FIJI. Mean automatic thresholding applied to the green channel (GCaMP6s) was used to create a mask encompassing all mature neuromast hair cells. This mask was used to create an ROI to measure the average intensity in the red channel (CellROX Orange, MitoSOX Red, or TMRE). For JC-1 measurements the green channel was used to generate a threshold and mask to quantify the intensity in both the green and red channels.</p><p><italic>Tg(myo6b:mitoTimer)<sup>w208</sup></italic> larvae were immobilized as described above and imaged at 3, 5, or 6 dpf using a Nikon A1 upright laser-scanning confocal microscope. Z-stacks of the 488 and 561 nm channels were collected at 2 µm intervals through the neuromast from apex to base. After imaging, max-projections of the green and red channel Z-stacks through the entire neuromast were generated using FIJI. Both channels were background subtracted with a mean rolling ball radius of 50 pixels. Mean automatic thresholding was applied to the green channel to generate a mask encompassing all MitoTimer-expressing neuromast hair cells. This mask was used to create an ROI to measure the average intensity of the green and red channel, then the ratio of the average fluorescence intensity in the red divided by the green channel was calculated for each neuromast.</p><p>DAPI labeling and kinocilial height measurements were used to differentiate between older and younger cells within a given neuromast at 5 dpf. To measure the height of the tallest part of the hair bundle, the kinocilium, a transmission PMT on a laser-scanning Nikon A1 confocal microscope was used to acquired Z-stacks every 0.5 µm. For DAPI labeling, 14 µM DAPI nuclear dye (D1306, ThermoFisher) in CE3 was applied to <italic>Tg(myo6b:memGCaMP6s)<sup>idc1</sup></italic> larvae for 30 s at 3 dpf. Larvae were then washed 3 X in CE3 before being returned to E3 solution. After labeling larvae were imaged in 405 and 488 nm channels using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope to identify DAPI-positive and DAPI-negative cells at 3 dpf or placed directly in an incubator at 28 °C. At 5 dpf, DAPI-labeled neuromasts were imaged to identify DAPI-positive and DAPI-negative cells. For calcium imaging experiments, after identifying DAPI-positive cells, presynaptic calcium imaging was performed using 2 s anterior and posterior step fluid-jet stimuli on the Bruker Swept-Field confocal microscope as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>All data shown are mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). All experiments were replicated at least twice on two independent days from different clutches. All replicates were biological-distinct animals and cells. Wildtype animals were selected at random for drug pre-treatments. When possible, control animals and drug treated or mutant animals were treated and examined simultaneously (same imaging chamber). Datasets were excluded only when control experiments failed. For experiments relying on single wavelength vital dyes (MitoSOX, CellROX and TMRE) trends were confirmed in a minimum of 3 independent experiments. In all datasets dot plots represent the ‘n’. N represents either the number of neuromasts, hair cells or the number of afferent neurons as stated in the legends. For all experiments a minimum of 3 animals and 6 neuromasts or afferent neurons were examined. Exact numbers are listed in the Source Data Files for each figure. Power analyses to determine appropriate sample sizes were performed using G*Power 3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faul et al., 2009</xref>). Sample sizes with adequate size were used to avoid Type 2 error. All statistical analysis was performed using Prism 8.0 software (GraphPad). A D’Agostino-Pearson normality test was used to test for normal distributions and F test was used to compare variances. To test for statistical significance between two samples, either paired or unpaired t-tests (normally distributed data), or Wilcoxon or Mann-Whitney tests (not normally distributed data) were used. For multiple comparisons a one-way ANOVA (normally distributed) with a Tukey or Dunnett’s correction, a two-way AVOVA (normally distributed data) with a Sidak’s correction or a Kruskal-Wallis test (not normally distributed data) with a Dunn’s correction was used as appropriate. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Raw data represented in dot plots, along with the mean, SEM, statistical test used, and exact p values are lists in the Source Data files.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing - original draft</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Zebrafish work performed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was approved by the Animal Use Committee at the NIH under animal study protocol #1362-13.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-77775-transrepform1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All summary data (Figures 1-7 and all supplements) generated or analyzed in this study are included in the Source Data files.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dave Raible for providing the <italic>myo6b:mitoTimer and myo6:mitoGaMP3</italic> transgenic lines.

hair cell synaptic activity results in increased vulnerability to ototoxic insult. The authors provide convincing evidence for neurotransmitter release altering susceptibility to aminoglycoside exposure through experiments examining mutants where synaptic release is disrupted. Changes in synaptic activity are accompanied by modest but significant changes in mitochondrial activity, consistent with previous studies revealing that mitochondrial changes impact hair cell susceptibility to damage. This work will inform future studies on how accumulating damage contributes to hair cell damage and ultimately hearing and balance disorders.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77775.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Raible</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00cvxb145</institution-id><institution>University of Washington</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00f54p054</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.02.22.481465">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.22.481465v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alan Cheng (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The study uses two mutant zebrafish line and claims that they have &quot;normal mechanotransduction as defined by GCAMP6s fluorescence and neo-TR uptake&quot;. Since aminoglycoside entry and toxicity can be altered by MET channel properties (O'Sullivan et al., PNAS 2020, Kenyon et al., JCI insights 2021, Hailey et al., JCI 2016), whether such properties remain completely normal in these mutant hair cells remain to be determined. The conclusion that MET is not involved seems unsubstantiated especially when the degree of toxicity reduction is rather small. Moreover, Trapani and Nicolson 2011 report that CaV1.3 mutants have reduced microphonics consistent with altered MET. It would be critical to establish that otof mutants have normal microphonics for robust conclusions to be drawn.</p><p>2. One would expect the intracellular calcium level as a whole pool be affected in the Cav1.3 mutants. Although the authors show there is no difference between those mutant and control hair cells in terms of calcium responses, are baseline levels lower?</p><p>3. An alternative explanation for why mutant hair cells are more resistant is that cells are actually younger. Mutants may show increased turnover of hair cells. The authors could address this point by using the DAPI dye labeling assay.</p><p>4. Cav1.3 KO hair cells in mice appear less differentiated suggesting abnormal development (Eckrich et al., Frontiers Cell Neuro 2019). This should be considered in discussing potential alternatives.</p><p>5. The authors make a point to show the differences in activity between &quot;old and young&quot; hair cells, and differences in survival between active and inactive cells. This leads to the question of whether the surviving hair cells are mostly young or old? This could be tested directly.</p><p>6. Experiments to test that Dynol 34-2 specifically affects synaptic signaling appear underpowered (Figure 2-2). Reviewer 1 notes that different tests are used for the different analyses even though both experiments compare pre and post-treatment. Additional experiments should be considered to support conclusions.</p><p>7. The majority of measures of mitochondria oxidation and activity use the fluorescence levels of a single colored dye, TMRE. If for some reason these dyes were not able to get into the hair cells or mitochondria of the mutant animals this would confound their results. The concern about the single color dyes could potentially be addressed by using a ratiometric dye like JC-1 in place of TMRE.</p><p>8. There are several issues with regards to statistical analysis that need to be addressed, although re-analysis is unlikely to alter conclusions.</p><p>Figure 2: D, E should be analyzed as a two-way ANOVA for dose and genotype.</p><p>Figure 3 C,D,E,F should be analyzed as a two-way ANOVA for time and genotype.</p><p>Figure 4 B should be analyzed as a two-way ANOVA for dose and active state.</p><p>Figure 5B: was an outlier test performed? 3 points look like potential outliers.</p><p>Figure 5 B,D, Figure 6 B,C inconsistent use of Mann-Whitney vs T-test.

First one would expect the intracellular calcium level as a whole pool be affected in the Cav3/1 mutants, can the author explain why there is no difference between those mutant and control hair cells? Second, aminoglycoside entry and toxicity can be altered by MET channel properties (O'Sullivan et al., PNAS 2020, Kenyon et al., JCI insights 2021), whether such properties remain completely normal in these mutant hair cells remain to be determined. The conclusion that MET is not involved seems unsubstantiated especially when the degree if toxicity reduction is rather small. Third Cav1.3 KO hair cells in mice appear less differentiated suggesting abnormal development (Eckrich et al., Frontiers Cell Neuro 2019). While ephys experiments is not required, revising the interpretation and conclusion seems appropriate.</p><p>2) The authors looked at neomycin uptake/clearance using Neomycin-TR and claim that there were no differences in lysosomal loading in Cav1.3a or Otof mutants by the presence of &quot;bright puncta&quot; (Figure 3-S1). The use of a lysosomal marker, such as LAMP1 for example, should be done to support their claim. Co-labelling for Neomycin-TR and a lysosomal marker would support the claims made. As the manuscript stands, the claim that neomycin protection observed in Cav1.3 or otofb mutants is not due to trafficking into lysosomes is not supported.</p><p>3) In Figure 4, the authors show that synaptically active cells are young and resistant to neomycin, and that most cells that survive neomycin are &quot;active&quot;. This contrasts with their overall findings that lessening metabolic demands, reduces ROS, leading to partial protection from ototoxic drugs. The confounding statements leads to overall confusion in the message of the protective mechanism. Furthermore, since the authors make a point to show the differences between &quot;old and young&quot; hair cells, this leads to the question of whether the surviving hair cells are mostly young or old from Figure 1? It would be beneficial to quantify this in the earlier figures to separate those populations. If would be ideal if there are alternative markers for older and younger cells than DAPI.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The concern about the single color dyes could potentially be addressed by using a ratiometric dye like JC-1 in place of TMRE or using a chronic treatment of one of the synaptic drugs in place of the mutants and then washing it out before dye treatment. At the very least the caveat of potential drug uptake confounds should be discussed in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77775.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Although this is a great experiment, our group does not have the knowledge and experience needed to make quantitative measurements of microphonics in a timely manner. In addition, the majority of studies that have examined microphonic potentials from neuromasts, although powerful, are not quantitative but rather qualitative. In our revision we made a serious attempt to reexamine MET the way we do best, using GCaMP. We examined GCaMP6s-dependent MET responses more carefully in both mutants. For our reanalysis we initiated a completely new set of experiments and reexamined MET responses during 2 stimulus durations (200 and 500ms) instead of 1 duration (500ms). We also examined additional features of the calcium-dependent MET response beyond response magnitude/MAX. This includes resting calcium in the hair bundles, as well as the duration, slope, and response recovery (return to baseline). Our analysis revealed no differences across the board for otof mutants compared to controls. Similar to our previous results we observed no difference in ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 mutants with regard to the magnitude of the MET-response during a 200- or 500-ms stimulus. But we did observe some differences in MET-responses of ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 mutants compared to controls. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 mutants have higher resting calcium levels in hair bundles (p = 0.08) and the recovery of the MET response (return to baseline) is significantly faster compared to controls. These additional properties are now compiled in Figure 1-S1. In addition, these new results are included in the Results section.</p><p>We also state, “Because the resting calcium levels in hair bundles are higher in ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a mutants and the recovery of the GCaMP6s responses is faster, it is possible that ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a mutants have subtle defects in mechanotransduction. In the future electrophysiological approaches are needed to assess mechanotransduction more carefully in both ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a and otofb mutants. Overall, our GCaMP6s measurements indicate that both Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3a- and Otofb-deficient hair cells exhibit largely normal evoked mechanotransduction.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. One would expect the intracellular calcium level as a whole pool be affected in the Cav1.3 mutants. Although the authors show there is no difference between those mutant and control hair cells in terms of calcium responses, are baseline levels lower?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now used our GCaMP6s transgenic line to investigate not only evoked MET responses but also resting calcium levels in both the hair bundles and at the presynapse in ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a and otof mutants. We find that in otof mutant resting calcium levels in the hair bundles and at the presynapse are unaltered compared to controls. This is in line with data showing normal evoked MET and presynaptic calcium responses in otof mutants. In previous work we have shown that block of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels with isradipine lowers resting cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium levels https://elifesciences.org/articles/48914 (see Figure 6A-F in this older paper). We now show that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a-deficient hair cells have significantly lower presynaptic calcium levels (Figure 1—figure supplement 1I). In addition (as mentioned above) calcium levels in the hair bundles are higher in ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a mutants compared to controls (p = 0.08; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). So yes! many pools of calcium are disrupted in ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a mutants. But otof mutants have no detectable changes with regard to baseline or evoked calcium responses. Overall, it was using these 2 mutants in combination that helped drive our conclusion linking exocytosis rather than calcium handling with protection from neomycin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. An alternative explanation for why mutant hair cells are more resistant is that cells are actually younger. Mutants may show increased turnover of hair cells. The authors could address this point by using the DAPI dye labeling assay.</p></disp-quote><p>Great suggestion. We have added an additional experiment to examine hair cell turnover in ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a and otof mutants compared to controls (See Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Here we used DAPI to label hair cells at day 3 and then examined how many DAPI+ hair cells remained at day 5. We chose this window to assay turnover because it was relevant to the ages used in our experiments. We found that the number of DAPI+ hair cells at day 3 vs day 5 was not significantly reduced in controls or in ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a and otofb mutants (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D, G). This indicates that increased turnover cannot explain the protection ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a and otof mutants. This data is now included in a new Results section “Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3a and otofb mutants show relatively normal maturation and no hair cell loss”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Cav1.3 KO hair cells in mice appear less differentiated suggesting abnormal development (Eckrich et al., Frontiers Cell Neuro 2019). This should be considered in discussing potential alternatives.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. It is likely that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 could be required for many aspects of hair cell development-as well as cell survival. In the results we now reference the Eckrich citation and others that link hair cell activity to development and cell survival. To try to understand if hair cell development or survival is impacted we have included additional experiments. Overall, our DAPI experiments (see the above point and Figure 5—figure supplement 1D, G) suggest that the same hair cells are alive at 3 and 5 dpf in all genotypes, indicating that there is not a dramatic increase in cell death, implying that cell survival is not affected in the mutants.</p><p>In the lateral line work has shown that when mechanotransduction is impaired, fewer hair cells are formed (for example in cdh23 and tmc2 mutants; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01604-2#Sec2 (see the supplement of this paper)), linking hair-cell activity to development. Based on this work, we quantified the overall number of hair cells at 3 and 5 dpf in the mutants compared to controls and found no difference (Figure 5—figure supplement S1B, E). Lastly, we examined the height of the tallest part of the hair bundle (the kinocilium) in our mutants compared to controls. Previous work has shown that these measurements can be used to developmentally stage hair cells (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22898777/). Our kinocilial height measurements at 5 dpf were not different in our mutants compared to controls. Overall, both our cell counting and hair bundle measurements point towards relatively normal development in ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a and otof mutants.</p><p>This data is now included in a new Results section “Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3a and otofb mutants show relatively normal maturation and no hair cell loss”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors make a point to show the differences in activity between “old and young” hair cells, and differences in survival between active and inactive cells. This leads to the question of whether the surviving hair cells are mostly young or old? This could be tested directly.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous work has demonstrated that historically younger hair cells have less oxidized mitochondria. Furthermore, this work found that hair cells with less oxidized mitochondria are resistant to neomycin (https://elifesciences.org/articles/38062). Other work in the lateral line has shown that lateral-line hair cells are not susceptible to ototoxins until after 4 dpf, suggesting hair-cell age is an important determinant of neomycin susceptibility (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378595503002594#FIGURE 5). In our present work we used a pulse chase of DAPI to identify old versus young hair cells and linked activity to younger cells. Overall, there are a lot of correlative analyses linking younger cells to neomycin resistance.</p><p>In our revision, we have attempted to more directly link the age of individual hair cells with susceptibility to the ototoxin neomycin. First, we performed another pulse-chase with DAPI, abelling at 3 dpf, and then examined hair cells at 5 dpf. At 5 dpf we measured the height of the tallest part of the hair bundles, the kinocilium, to assess hair cell maturity in older, DAPI+ cells and younger, DAPI- cells. Here we found that at 5 dpf, all older, DAPI+ hair cells had a kinocilial height of 20µm or greater (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-C). After using kinocilial measurements to classify old/young cells (young&lt;20µm; old≥20µm), we applied neomycin to hair cells. From this work we found that 66% of younger cells survived, compared to 14.5% of older cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-E’). These experiments strongly indicate that younger cells are significantly more likely to survive. These results are also now included in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Reviewer 1 notes that different tests are used for the different analyses even though both experiments compare pre and post-treatment. Additional experiments should be considered to support conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added additional numbers to support the functional assessment of Dynole 34-2. We added additional electrophysiological recordings of spontaneous afferent spikes before and after Dynole 34-2. This has added power to these analyses (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E-F).</p><p>In addition, we redid the calcium imaging experiments to make similar pre- and post-comparisons. Previously, analyses were different between calcium imaging and electrophysiology because in the calcium imaging experiments -in control samples- we observed a reduction in signal magnitude after the repeated recordings needed to capture both the MET- and presynaptic calcium measurements. (This was not the case for our electrophysiology data -no reduction in spikes was observed in our control group (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E)). Because of this reduction in controls we had normalized the calcium imaging data to our mock treated groups. This made the data presentation confusion.</p><p>Upon redoing the calcium imaging we performed the MET and presynaptic measurements in independent samples to minimize the number of our recordings. Now there is no difference in our control samples pre- and post-treatment (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, C). Overall, now the calcium imaging comparisons are more straightforward and in line with our electrophysiology data.</p><p>In Figure 2—figure supplement 1 A-E the data follows a normal distribution but in F one of the datasets does not. Because of these differences we used a paired-test (A-E) and Wilcoxon test (F), respectively. Our statistics section now more clearly outlines when different tests are used. In addition, the source data files highlight data distributions and tests used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

With regards to measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential using TMRE, we verified that there are differences between ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and otof mutants compared to controls in three separate sets of experiments. In our methods section we also now state, “For experiments relying on single wavelength vital dyes (MitoSOX, CellROX and TMRE) differences were confirmed in a minimum of 3 independent experiments.”</p><p>We did make a solid effort towards using the ratiometric dye JC-1 to quantify differences in mitochondrial membrane potential in our mutants. In our hands we found this dye to be quite toxic and reduced the incubation time dramatically from previous work. Regardless of these challenges, we examined JC-1 label in our mutants. Using JC-1 we saw a reduction in ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and otof mutants, but this data did not reach significance (p=0.07 for cav1.3 and p=0.34 for otof). This is now shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 3 and is included in our Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

The dye abelling data is quite variable. Currently we do not feel comfortable doing an outlier analysis to remove datapoints. The overall result was observed in multiple independent experiments. Just one of those experiments is shown in Figure 5B. We also observed a similar amount of variability in all of our experiments, suggesting that the variability may be a part of the biology. Because of the reproducibility of the results we are confident in the data as it stands.</p><p>There are what seem to be some inconsistences with the statistics – for example similar datasets using a Mann-Whitney vs a t-test.

To test for statistical significance between two samples, either paired or unpaired t-tests (normally distributed data), or Wilcoxon or Mann-Whitney tests (not normally distributed data) were used. For multiple comparisons a one-way ANOVA (normally distributed) with a Tukey or Dunnett’s correction, a two-way AVOVA (normally distributed data) with a Sidak’s correction or a Kruskal-Wallis test (not normally distributed data) with a Dunn’s correction was used as appropriate.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The study uses two mutant zebrafish line and claims that they have “normal mechanotransduction as defined by GCAMP6s fluorescence and neo-TR uptake”.

In addition to the analyses to more carefully examine MET function we have also done our best to soften our statements regarding MET function being ‘normal’ in cav1.3 and otof mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors looked at neomycin uptake/clearance using Neomycin-TR and claim that there were no differences in lysosomal loading in Cav1.3a or Otof mutants by the presence of &quot;bright puncta&quot; (Figure 3-S1).

A previous study, (https://www.jci.org/articles/view/85052) did an excellent job of characterizing Neo-TR puncta in lateral-line hair cells.

For our analyses we have now used both DAPI label and hair bundle height to delineate young and old hair cells (Figure 4—figure supplement v1A-C). We also use hair bundle measurements as a way to directly show that older hair cells in the lateral line are more susceptible to neomycin (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D’E). It is interesting that younger hair cells are more likely to exhibit presynaptic activity than older hair cells. We believe that this activity is common to young, newly formed cells and that the activity ceases as cells age, thus leaving older hair cells both inactive and more susceptible to neomycin due to the fact that they previously experienced significant amounts of presynaptic activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The concern about the single color dyes could potentially be addressed by using a ratiometric dye like JC-1 in place of TMRE or using a chronic treatment of one of the synaptic drugs in place of the mutants and then washing it out before dye treatment.

We found that once the isradipine is washed off and the TMRE dye labeling protocol is finished, the membrane potential measurements are normal. This suggests that either blocking calcium channel activity does nothing to TMRE label or it suggests that TMRE label only reflects a snapshot of current activity levels, which may return to a more normal level after drug washout, rather than reflecting any long-term effects of drug treatment. Although these results are really interesting, at this point, significantly more work is needed to distinguishing between these scenarios.</p><p>In our Results section, we now highlight the weakness of using single wavelength dyes. We end this explanation by emphasizing why the MitoTimer result is important.</p><p>“Our TMRE measurements reflect mitochondrial activity at a single moment in time (Figure 5I-L). In contrast our CellROX Orange and MitoSOX Red measurements likely reflect ROS that have accrued over time (Figure 5A-H). One drawback to using these single wavelength vital dyes is that they rely on comparable dye uptake between our mutants and controls. Although we observed normal Neo-TR entry into hair cells in our mutants, it is possible that vital dye entry is impaired. Therefore, we examined how mitochondrial activity relates to ROS production over time using a genetically encoded indicator of oxidative stress called MitoTimer. Unlike vital dyes, by using a stable transgenic line MitoTimer is present at comparable levels in mutants and controls. MitoTimer localizes to mitochondria and exhibits an oxidation-dependent shift in fluorescence signal from green to red.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
