This is illustrated by the selective sensitivity of mDA neurons of the substantia nigra compacta (SNc) in patients with Parkinson’s disease, while those in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are relatively spared. Here, we used single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of approximately 70,000 mouse midbrain cells to build a high-resolution atlas of mouse mDA neuron diversity at the molecular level. The results showed that differences between mDA neuron groups could best be understood as a continuum without sharp differences between subtypes. Thus, we assigned mDA neurons to several ‘territories’ and ‘neighborhoods’ within a shifting gene expression landscape where boundaries are gradual rather than discrete. Based on the enriched gene expression patterns of these territories and neighborhoods, we were able to localize them in the adult mouse midbrain. Moreover, because the underlying mechanisms for the variable sensitivities of diverse mDA neurons to pathological insults are not well understood, we analyzed surviving neurons after partial 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions to unravel gene expression patterns that correlate with mDA neuron vulnerability and resilience. Together, this atlas provides a basis for further studies on the neurophysiological role of mDA neurons in health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>substantia nigra</kwd><kwd>ventral tegmental area</kwd><kwd>vulnerability</kwd><kwd>6- hydroxydopamine</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VR 2020-00884</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perlmann</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003792</institution-id><institution>Hjärnfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perlmann</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007464</institution-id><institution>Torsten Söderbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perlmann</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004047</institution-id><institution>Karolinska Institutet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yaghmaeian Salmani</surname><given-names>Behzad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VR 2016-02506</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perlmann</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single nuclei RNA sequencing unmasks 16 variants of midbrain dopamine neurons within a continuum of their gene expression landscape and resolves their differential vulnerability.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dopamine (DA) neurons localized in the ventral midbrain (mDA neurons) comprise the brain’s largest and most extensive source of DA neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Björklund and Dunnett, 2007</xref>). These neurons are known to perform a wide variety of functions, and distinct mDA neuron assemblies are known to play diverse functional roles. For example, mDA neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are mainly associated with controlling motor functions. In contrast, those in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and retrorubral field (RRF) have been associated more strongly with motivation, learning, and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Björklund and Dunnett, 2007</xref>). Notably, mDA neurons are also characterized by their varying impact on disease. For example, the hallmark motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) result from the degeneration of SNc neurons. On the other hand, mDA neurons in the VTA have been linked to neural pathways that are affected in addiction, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and other psychiatric conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Björklund and Dunnett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garritsen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poulin et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing and other methods that resolve differences in, for example chromatin state between single cells, have increased our understanding of mDA neuron diversity and innervation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garritsen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poulin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poulin et al., 2018</xref>). This diversity is of great significance in normal brain functions and disease, for example in forming multiple DA-controlled circuits enabling versatile DA neurotransmission and explaining different vulnerabilities of distinct groups of mDA neurons. However, methods dependent on capturing certain cell types, such as neurons sensitive to cell dissociation, can result in biased datasets where the most sensitive neuron groups are underrepresented. In addition, as the scRNAseq studies of mDA neurons published so far have analyzed a relatively low number of mDA neurons, the resolution of these datasets is still quite limited. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) is a more efficient and reliable sampling alternative for individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krishnaswami et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, snRNAseq of human mDA neurons, enriched by sorting for NR4A2-labelled nuclei, yielded a 180-fold increase in absolute neuronal numbers compared to similar datasets based on scRNAseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kamath et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Our present study combined fluorescent sorting and snRNA-seq to explore the diversity of a large number of mouse mDA neurons, resulting in a comprehensive atlas of mDA neuron populations. By additionally analyzing nuclei from a partial toxin-induced mDA neuron degeneration model, we were able to investigate questions of selective and variable vulnerability among these distinct populations. Our findings provide a foundation for future investigations into the projections and functions of molecularly distinct mDA neuron groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single nuclei RNA sequencing of the ventral midbrain</title><p>Perhaps partly because of the challenges in dissociating and isolating whole mDA neurons, previous studies have only analyzed a relatively small fraction of all mDA neurons from each dissected brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dougalis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hook et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">La Manno et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poulin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tiklová et al., 2019</xref>).

Accordingly, mice (n=6) were unilaterally injected with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 0.7 μg or 1.5 μg) into the medial forebrain bundle, which leads to partial cell death of mDA neurons on one hemisphere of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine differential survival among diverse mDA neurons, nuclei from intact and lesioned hemispheres were collected six weeks after lesioning when the acute phase of cell death had already occurred. To avoid omitting low red fluorescent protein (RFP)-expressing nuclei from analysis, a relatively relaxed gating in fluorescently activated nuclear sorting (FANS) was used, resulting in an approximately equal number of mCherry<sup>+</sup> and mCherry<sup>-</sup> nuclei from each sample per brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). After snRNAseq and quality control, 36,051 nuclei from the intact and 32,863 from the lesioned hemisphere were retained for bioinformatic analysis (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Sequencing data were subjected to normalization, variance stabilization, and dimensional reduction and then visualized by uniform manifold approximation (UMAP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Louvain clustering was adopted, dividing all nuclei into 26 clusters (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). A hierarchical clustering dendrogram illustrating the relationship between clusters was also constructed, and cluster-specific markers were identified and used to annotate previously known cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This analysis revealed the presence of different cell types, including oligodendrocytes; oligodendrocyte precursor cells; astrocytes; and various types of neurons known to be localized in the midbrain but also with some inclusion of cell types known to be localized both in the forebrain and hindbrain. Neuronal clusters were mainly comprised of different types of glutamatergic (GLU), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Although the analysis of gene expression in a dot-plot confirmed that most nuclei were dopaminergic, a smaller number of nuclei distributed in clusters expressing low levels of mDA neuron markers showed characteristics of GABAergic, glutamatergic neurons, or maturing myelinating oligodendrocytes (mODC). A few clusters remained unassigned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

However, it may be more accurate to consider differences between closely related mDA neuron groups as a gradually shifting continuum within a gene expression landscape. Thus, we found using a hierarchical definition of the relationship more accurate when using the dendrogram to describe diversity. By this definition, mDA neurons are distinct and constitute a neuron type, clearly different from, for example, HyDA and other types of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. Within individual neuron types, such as the closely related mDA neurons, we define the next hierarchical level as ‘territories’, while ‘neighborhoods’ is the most highly resolved level of diversity that, based on the bioinformatic analysis, can be defined meaningfully. According to this classification, each one of the territories and neighborhoods should constitute specified adjacent leaf nodes of the cluster tree with a common ancestor node in the hierarchical dendrogram. Notably, leaf nodes of a neighborhood or territory need not be sibling nodes.</p><p>Furthermore, territories and neighborhoods should be distinguishable by clearly defined gene expression signatures and occupy a relatively well-defined space, that is not scattered, in the UMAP. This classification subdivided mDA neurons into 7 territories and 16 neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Accordingly, genes that are commonly and significantly enriched in intact nuclei from clusters with either &gt;90% (vulnerability genes) or &lt;50% (resilience genes) normalized cell loss were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Thirty-nine genes fulfilled the stringent cutoff criteria for vulnerability genes. In contrast, only ten genes fulfilled the cutoff criteria for resilience genes (Materials and methods). The selected genes were ranked based on average Log2 fold change, and vulnerability and resilience gene modules were constructed, consisting of 20 and 8 most significantly enriched genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). The composite average expression of the gene sets (modules) was visualized in violin plots for neighborhoods and territories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). As expected, the vulnerability and resilience gene module expression in territories and neighborhoods corresponded to the distribution of the clusters used as input for identifying the gene modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, linear regression analysis also demonstrated a highly significant overall correlation between cell loss and the vulnerability module scores (p-value = 3.89e-10), even when the input clusters were excluded from analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, vulnerability and resilience gene modules can predict cell loss in the data set. This suggests that the identified module genes may be functionally associated with either sensitivity to or protection against 6-OHDA-induced cell stress. One of the vulnerability genes, <italic>Slc6a3</italic>, encodes the dopamine transporter used to import 6-OHDA to the cytosol. Thus, it is unsurprising that neurons of the Gad2 and Ebf1 territories expressing low levels of <italic>Slc6a3</italic> are less vulnerable. However, when regression analysis was repeated using a vulnerability gene module in which <italic>Slc6a3</italic> had been excluded, correlation to cell loss remained highly significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>, p-value = 1.73e-09).

The main goal of this approach was to identify common transcriptomic states in nuclei from the different conditions via a learned joint structure (see Materials and methods). We used this integrated dataset to validate further the predictive value of the identified vulnerability and resilience gene sets. Vulnerability and resilience modules were plotted across the integrated clusters and were color-coded by territory identities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the integrated dataset, the clusters are completely independent of the merged data-based annotations assigned to integrated territories and neighborhoods. Therefore, the distribution of the two modules’ scores across the integrated clusters is a good indicator of how predictive they can be, given the territorial identities of the integrated clusters. Of note, the module scores corresponded well to the clusters, as integrated clusters with the <italic>Sox6</italic> territory identity and most of the clusters with the <italic>Pcsk6</italic> territory identity showed considerably high and low values of the vulnerability and resilience modules, respectively.</p><p>Conversely, integrated clusters with <italic>Gad2</italic> and <italic>Ebf1</italic> territory identities showed high resilience module values and low vulnerability module values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Non-mDA clusters were excluded from this statistical analysis.

However, two clusters consisted almost exclusively of nuclei from the lesioned hemisphere. To distinguish them from territories harboring nuclei characteristic of the normal non-lesioned /intact hemisphere of the brain, they were named <italic>mostly lesion</italic> (ML) clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). Although expression of typical mDA neuron markers such as <italic>Th</italic> and <italic>Slc6a3</italic> was low, the ML-clusters were part of the mDA neuron dendrogram branch and shared a parent node with <italic>Sox6</italic>-territory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>). Thus, these nuclei were likely derived from surviving mDA neurons that have become transcriptionally altered due to cellular stress. We took advantage of the integrated dataset described above to analyze this further. Using original territory labels, visualizing the integrated data by UMAP was consistent with data from non-integrated original analysis and demonstrated that the mDA neuron nuclei clustered together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Next, the integrated data territories were annotated based on the cluster composition of inherited merged (original) territory identities and the enriched markers for the original territories (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Notably, the nuclei forming the ML-clusters were now entirely integrated within the mDA neuron territories, supporting the hypothesis that they originated from healthy mDA neurons. In addition to ML clusters being predominantly made up of lesioned nuclei, <italic>Sox6</italic> expression level and abundance were also clearly higher than <italic>Calb1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). Both visualizations of ML-clusters nuclei in the integrated UMAP and quantifications demonstrated that most (&gt;80%) of all ML nuclei were confined to two territories, <italic>Sox6</italic> and <italic>Pcsk6</italic>. It thus seems plausible that the ML nuclei originated from altered neurons in these two territories.

First, gene expression in all nuclei from the lesioned hemisphere was compared to all nuclei from the intact hemisphere.

Second, nuclei from the ML-clusters were compared to nuclei from all other territories. Consistent with a more dramatic and long-lasting influence from lesioning in the ML-clusters, 1577 genes were found to be differentially expressed in this comparison. Several of the most strongly upregulated genes, including <italic>Atf3, Creb5, Xirp2, Clic4, Sprr1a</italic>, and <italic>Mmp12</italic>, have in previous studies been associated with cellular stress, cell death, and cell signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>).

However, we now know that a substantial diversity exists beyond the anatomically defined cell groups, supported by studies focused on mDA neurons using rapidly emerging single-cell methods to characterize cellular diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garritsen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hook et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">La Manno et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poulin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poulin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tiklová et al., 2019</xref>). Here, the goal was to create a comprehensive gene expression atlas over the mouse mDA neuron gene expression landscape by using snRNA-seq for the analyses. In addition, we wished to address the differential vulnerability to neuronal stress within the diverse groups of mDA neurons.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, global gene expression patterns differ substantially between cell types such as astrocytes, neurons, or endothelial cells. In addition, different neuron types with distinct developmental origins usually differ substantially in scRNA sequencing analyses. Thus, DA neurons from the hypothalamus, which have a distinct developmental origin from mDA neurons, differ from mDA neurons by many differentially expressed genes. Our study was primarily motivated by the more challenging need to describe differences across the population of related mDA neurons, which have a common developmental origin and a high degree of molecular similarities. The challenge in the analysis is evident from UMAP visualizations, as presented here, where mDA neurons are distributed in a shifting gene expression landscape without clearly distinct borders between groups of mDA neurons. Thus, defining distinctive sub-types within such a nuanced gene expression landscape may be misleading, as noted in several previous single-cell studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kozareva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yao et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we chose a nomenclature that better reflects the continuity between mDA neuron groups by referring to categories of mDA neurons as belonging to ‘territories’ and ‘neighborhoods’. We do not propose that the taxonomy presented here should be viewed as universal or a definitive endpoint, but rather should be seen as high-resolution gene expression analysis that will help to guide further studies that use strategies to understand connectivity, neurophysiology, and behavior in investigations of relevant neuronal sub-circuits influenced by mDA neurons.</p><p>The mDA neuron atlas presented here is based on the sequencing of a large number of mDA neurons (40,000 in total), which was achieved by using snRNA-seq, which is superior to scRNA-seq for reducing sampling bias. Furthermore, in support of a robust sampling, a large proportion of mDA neurons population was analyzed from each dissected brain (consistently above 20%), a 50–100 times improvement from our previous single-cell study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tiklová et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, the neurons belonging to the SNc (<italic>Sox6</italic> territory) corresponded to roughly one-third of all mDA neurons, a proportion that conforms to previous stereological cell counting of mouse mDA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Björklund and Dunnett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zaborszky and Vadasz, 2001</xref>). Thus, we assume that the cellular stoichiometry, as presented in the present snRNA-seq atlas, roughly corresponds to the distribution of mDA neurons in the adult mouse brain.</p><p>Previous scRNA-seq studies have described mDA neuron groups characterized by gene expression patterns that resemble those in different territories and neighborhoods. Comparisons to those studies are described and referenced in Supplementary Results and show that distinguishing gene expression features seen in six of the seven territories described here are similar to those found in previous single-cell studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hook et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">La Manno et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poulin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tiklová et al., 2019</xref>). However, the presented mDA neuron atlas illustrates previously unknown diversity within these groups. Thus, the <italic>Sox6</italic> territory was divided into four neighborhoods with partly unique anatomical localizations within the SNc. In addition, the gene expression signature of the <italic>Pcsk6</italic> territory, comprising a relatively large number of cells, did not correspond well to previously described mDA neuron groups. Thus, the <italic>Pcsk6</italic> territory neurons apparently correspond to an mDA neuron group previously not recognized.</p><p>Moreover, while <italic>Vip<sup>+</sup></italic> mDA neurons were identified in several previous single-cell studies, we show here that the <italic>Ebf1</italic> territory can be divided into two related neighborhoods encompassing <italic>Vip<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>Col24a1<sup>+</sup></italic>mDA neurons, respectively. Although these cells were most enriched in PAG, they were scattered also in other regions such as PBP and CLi. <italic>Col24a1<sup>+</sup></italic>likely corresponds to a specific population of <italic>Npw<sup>+</sup></italic> mDA neurons, localized in PAG, VTA, and the dorsal raphe, which project to the extended central amygdala and modulate mouse behavior under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Motoike et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We also extended our analysis to neurons exposed to neuronal stress by sampling nuclei from the lesioned after partial unilateral exposure to the neurotoxin 6-OHDA. The mechanisms of neuronal stress leading to the degeneration of mDA neurons in PD differ from events following exposure to neurotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blesa and Przedborski, 2014</xref>). However, it is known that most insults to mDA neurons, including those resulting from 6-OHDA exposure, affect SNc more severely than neurons of the VTA, indicating an inherent higher vulnerability of these neurons. This is evident in our analysis, where normalized cell loss was most severe within the <italic>Sox6</italic> territory. However, a notable high vulnerability was also seen outside the <italic>Sox6</italic> territory, for example within the <italic>Pdia5</italic> and <italic>Pcsk6</italic> territories. Indeed, the <italic>Pcsk6</italic>_NH1, apparently localized within the PBP, is even more vulnerable than the <italic>Sox6</italic>_NH3. Within the VTA territories, resilient neighborhoods included several that express Slc17a6 encoding the glutamate transporter VGLUT2, a protein linked to increased and decreased dopamine neuron vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kouwenhoven et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Steinkellner et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The information on normalized cell death was used to identify genes enriched in highly vulnerable or resilient clusters.

We note that several genes in these modules may be functionally linked to either vulnerability or resilience: <italic>Kcnj6</italic> is a known marker for SNc neurons and has, in previous studies, been shown to be associated with the vulnerability of these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liss et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>Rgs6,</italic> regulator of G-protein signaling 6, has been implicated in age-dependent α-synuclein accumulation and mDA neuron degeneration when mutated in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Nos1ap</italic>, nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor protein, may play a role in excitotoxic neuronal damage in neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2016</xref>)<italic>. Atp8a1,</italic> ATPase phospholipid transporting 8A1, may be implicated in neuroprotective effects caused by pumping phosphatidylserine across the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). In addition, the protein encoded by the <italic>Vsnl1</italic> gene is a calcium sensor that is known to be increased in cerebrospinal fluid in Alzheimer’s patients and may be linked to disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zetterberg, 2017</xref>). Therefore, the analysis of 6-OHDA vulnerability complements the atlas in ways that will be valuable for understanding how the molecular gene expression landscape influences sensitivity to pathological stress. It will be important in future studies to extend these studies to mouse and human neurons exposed to pathology that more resembles that seen in PD.</p><p>To avoid extensive influence on gene expression from the acute toxin effects in dying cells, brain tissue was collected for nuclei isolation several weeks after 6-OHDA exposure. Most nuclei derived from the lesioned hemispheres of dissected brains were scattered in UMAP analysis with nuclei from the intact hemisphere, suggesting that the toxin had not caused any severe gene expression alterations. However, nuclei in the ML clusters were an exception, as they were derived almost exclusively from neurons dissected from the lesioned hemisphere. These toxin-exposed neurons displayed more profound and long-lasting alterations in gene expression. We addressed the origin of these cells in an integrated data set, and it is plausible from this analysis that most of these altered neurons were derived from neurons belonging to the two most vulnerable <italic>Sox6</italic> and <italic>Pcsk6</italic> territories. Gene expression changes in ML-clusters’ included severe down-regulation of typical mDA neuron gene markers such as <italic>Th</italic> and <italic>Slc6a3</italic>. In addition, many enriched genes have previously been associated with neurodegeneration or response to neuron stress. For example, <italic>Atf3, Lifr, Sprr1a</italic> have been reported to be part of a regeneration-associated gene program in peripheral nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kanaan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seijffers et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Atf3</italic> is also known to be upregulated as a result of activation of the unfolded protein response pathway via PERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>Ngf</italic>, encoding the nerve growth factor, is known to be neurotrophic to mDA neurons and is dysregulated in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mogi et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, part of this stress response is likely to be neuroprotective and likely reflects a cellular survival response in affected cells.</p><p>In conclusion, the work presented here provides a comprehensive atlas over mDA neuron diversity in mice. Combined with the included anatomical analysis and assessment of neuron vulnerability after toxin stress, we anticipate that this will be a useful resource in studies to understand the intricate functions of neurocircuitries involving dopamine neurotransmission functionally.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse lines and genotyping</title><p><italic>Slc6a3<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ekstrand et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>Pitx3<sup>GFP</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2004</xref>) <italic>Rpl10a-mCherry</italic> (<italic>TrapC<sup>fl</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hupe et al., 2014</xref>) and their genotyping have been described before. <italic>Slc6a3<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>TrapC<sup>fl</sup></italic> lines were intercrossed to generate <italic>Slc6a3<sup>Cre/+</sup>; TrapC<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice.

Then, module eigengenes (MEs) and module connectivity (kMEs) were calculated, using the ‘group.by’ and ‘group_name’ arguments stated above. Hub genes were selected based on the top 30 ranked kME values. Correlations among modules were calculated using ME as ‘feature’ and ‘sig.level’=0.05. Enrichment analysis on the hdWGCNA modules was done using the R packages ‘enrichR’ and ‘GeneOverlap’. The enrichR databases used were 'GO_Biological_Process_2021', GO_Cellular_Component_2021', and 'GO_Molecular_Function_2021', with maximum number of genes to test per module set to 100, ranked by kME values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Generation of human dataset</title><p>Human dataset including count matrix, barcodes, features and metadata files were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the accession number (GSE178265; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kamath et al., 2022</xref>). Genes with reads present in fewer than 1 nucleus (libraries), and <italic>Malat1</italic> were removed. Libraries with detected UMIs below 650 and UMI/Gene below 1.2 and, with percent_mito above 10 were also removed. Reciprocal PCA (RPCA) approach was used to integrate individual SNc samples separately per condition (control vs diseased), by which each sample is projected into the others’ PCA space, and the integration anchors are defined by the requirements of mutual neighborhood. Next the control and diseased dataset were integrated into one dataset, using RPCA approach. Louvain resolution 0.1 was used for clustering and the clusters of dopaminergic nuclei were identified by plotting typical markers. These dopaminergic clusters of 25003 nuclei (control = 17039,, LBD = 4642, PD = 3,322 nuclei) were subset for downstream analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Integration of human and mouse dataset</title><p>Orthology mapping package ‘Orthology.eg.db’, version 3.13.0 was used to map NCBI gene IDs between species.

Then human control dopaminergic nuclei were used as query to be projected onto the reference UMAP structure, using the MapQuery() function. Next, the mouse intact only <italic>Sox6</italic> territory nuclei were used to make the reference UMAP, with the same parameters as above and the human nuclei with the transferred label ‘Sox6’ from the previous step were used as a subset query to be mapped with a higher resolution to the <italic>Sox6</italic> neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement

In this study, over 30,000 mDA neurons have been analyzed at the genome-wide gene expression level, idenfying mDA territories and neighborhoods (that some may call “subtypes”), a descripon of the mDA neuron diversity that goes far beyond what has been published previously.</p><p>Although several single-cell RNA sequencing studies of mDA neurons have added to our understanding of mDA diversity, they have been limited by the low numbers of sequenced mDA neurons. As the reviewer specifically referred to the study by Poulin et al., 2014, it should be noted that in this report, 159 mDA neurons were analyzed by qPCR – not by RNAseq – of 96 previously identified marker genes. Despite those limitaons, this was indeed a highly impressive study, suggesng five different mDA neuron subtypes (as compared to the 16 neighborhoods described here), published before the era of single-cell genome-wide gene expression methods and advanced bioinformac tools were available. On average, the following scRNAseq studies typically captured a few hundred mDA neurons - compared to over 30,000 in this study. None of the studies menoned in our manuscript were close to capturing the full diversity, and the informaon on mDA neuron diversity is, for this reason, somewhat fragmented in the scienfic literature. Indeed, the seven mDA “subtypes” described in the excellent reviews by Poulin et al., 2020 in Trends in Neurosciences and Garritsen et al., 2023 in Nature Neuroscience are integrated interpretaons of the results from numerous independent studies, each methodologically unique. Several previously idenfied groups, especially Vglut2+ populaons in VTA and SNpc, have been considered poorly defined. As menoned above, our findings in this study could reliably idenfy, by computaonal analyses and combinatorial marker expression in situ, 16 different neighborhoods within the mDA populaon and localize them in the ssue (Figure 4, Supplementary figures 4-1 to 4-3, described further in Supplementary Results). To menon three examples: Within Sox6+ SNpc, we idenfied four different variants (neighborhoods) with partly unique anatomical localizaon. In addion, the large group of mDA neurons referred to as the Pcsk6 territory has not been clearly defined in earlier studies. We also idenfied a novel mDA neuron group that is related to the previously well described Vip-expressing mDA neurons. These and other novel features are menoned in the manuscript and in Supplementary Figure 4-1 to 4-3.</p><p>Although we have, for the consideraon of the space and intelligibility, characterized the 16 neighborhoods with only a few selected key marker genes, we have idenfied numerous addional novel markers, some of which are shown in dot plots in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 3, which can be used to characterize these groups further.

This limits the impact of the proposed work. It also isn't clear what the vulnerability factors may be in the neurons that die. Beyond the characterizaon of which neurons die - what is the reason that these neurons are suscepble to lesion? Also, the interpretaon of these findings is going to be limited by the fact that 6-OHDA is an injectable, and the effects depend on the accuracy of injecon targeng and the equal access of the toxin to access all cell populaons. Though the site of injecon (MFB) should hit most/all of the forebrain-projecng DA cells, the injecon sites for each animal were not characterized (and since the cells from animals were pooled, the effects of injecon targeng on the group data would be hard to determine in any case).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the results are presented to provide a comprehensive and valuable resource rather than explaining molecular mechanisms. The reviewer points out that “what the vulnerability factors may be in the neurons that die” is unclear. However, our study was designed to answer the queson: What genes are enriched in clusters of mDA neurons that are parcularly likely to die aer toxic stress? Using single-cell analysis, we believe this queson had higher priority than atempng to idenfy gene expression changes occurring during the cell death process. We agree that we cannot answer why neurons are suscepble to lesions, only idenfy genes that correlate with either high or low sensivity. Thus, the genes we refer to as “vulnerability genes” and “resilience genes” are candidates for influencing differenal vulnerability. Hard evidence for such influence will require addional and extensive funconal analysis. As for the variability of injecon and the characterizaon of individual animals, we wish to menon the online interacve explorer available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://perlmannlab.org/resources/">https://perlmannlab.org/resources/</ext-link> . It allows visualizaon of nuclei distribuon per territory and neighborhood for each mouse, making it easy to determine the cell loss rao and cell distribuon per animal. There is indeed variance in the proporons of intact/lesioned total nuclei per animal. This is also evident from the DAT autoradiographs shown for each lesioned animal and presented in Figure Supplement 5-1 A. Importantly, the relave UMAP distribuon of nuclei is quite similar between individual animals. To further invesgate this, we used Pearson’s Chi square test of independence with a conngency table for animals, each with two categorical variables as the proporon of nuclei from intact vs lesioned parts of the vMB (see added Supplementary figure 5-1 C ). This shows that – while there is a difference in the number of nuclei remaining aer lesioning – the relave distribuon among clusters and neighborhoods is similar between animals. We have clarified this point in the manuscript (see page 12 ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am also not clear why the authors don't explore more about what the genes/pathways are that differenate these condions and why some cells are parcularly vulnerable or resilient. For example, one could run GO analyses, weighted gene co-expression network analysis, or any one of a number of analysis packages to highlight which genes/pathways may give rise to vulnerability or resilience. Since the manuscript is focused on idenfying cells and gene expression profiles that define vulnerability and resilience, there is much more that could have been done with this based on the data that the authors collected.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed GO analysis for the genes upregulated and downregulated in the ML clusters (specific to the lesion condion) in the original manuscript (Please see figure supplement 7-1 C-E, and the newly added Supplementary file 10), but we agree with the reviewer that we could also have analyzed funconal categories of genes correlang with differenal vulnerability. Thus, we have used tools recently developed by Morabito et al., Cell Reports Methods (2023), and their hdWGCNA package to address this queson. This method is parcularly suitable for analyzing high-dimensional transcriptomics data such as single-cell RNA-seq or spaal transcriptomics. We calculated the coexpression network based on the lesioned nuclei of the mDA territories. Of the 9 co-expression modules calculated, one has the highest expression in Sox6 territory and has genes in common with the vulnerability module. Another co-expression module has genes in common with the resilience module and is most highly expressed in Otx2 and Ebf1 territories. We also did GO analysis for these co-expression modules and added addional GO analysis of the ML-enriched genes (see Supplementary Figure 7-1 D,E, the newly added Supplementary Figure 6-3, and the newly added Supplementary file 9). Text describing these addional analyses are menoned on page 15 and 17.</p><p>In addition, we wish to emphasize our idenficaon of the genes we refer to as vulnerability and resilience modules in the previous version of the manuscript. Several of the genes were discussed in the previous version of the manuscript but we have now included more informaon on these genes, based on previously published studies and discuss their potenal funconal roles (see pages 22 &amp; 23 in the Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another limitation of this study as presented is the missed opportunity to integrate it with the rich literature on midbrain dopamine (and non-dopamine) neuron subtypes. Many subtypes have been explored, with divergent funcons, and can usually be disnguished by either their projecon site, neurotransmiter identy, or both. Unfortunately, the projecon site does not seem to track parcularly well with transcriptomic idenes, aside from a few genes such as DAT or the DRD2 receptor. However, this could have been more thoroughly explored in this manuscript, either by introducing AAVretro barcodes through injecon into downstream brain sites, or through exisng evidence within their sequencing dataset. There are likely clear interpretaons from some of that literature, some of which may be more excing than others. For example, the authors note that vGluT2-expressing cells were part of the resilient territory. This might be because this is expressed in medially-located DA cells and not laterally-located ones, which tends to track which cells die and which don't.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript consists of a comprehensive descripon of transcriponal diversity. Although of clear value, we believe that addional, comprehensive analysis that combines snRNAseq with, e.g., AAVretro barcodes must be done in a separate study. It should also be noted that we describe each territory and neighborhoods in the further detail in the Supplementary Results, which contains references to the relevant literature. In line with the comments, this secon has now been expanded with further references to relevant studies (see Supplementary Results related to Figure 4-figure supplements 1-3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not immediately clear why the authors used a relaxed gate for mCherry fluorescence in Figure 1.This makes it difficult to definively isolate dopaminergic neurons - or at least, neurons with a DATCre expression history. While the expression of TH/DAT should be able to give a fairly reliable idenficaon of these cells, the reason for this decision is not made clear in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We used a relaxed gang to ensure that we could capture nuclei expressing low levels of RFP, which we believe could be especially relevant for the lesioned dataset (see page 5). We did not find that it would be advantageous to use a more stringent gang that would risk losing all cells expressing no (or very low levels) RFP. Idenfying mDA neurons based on their typical markers is straighorward, as their transcriponal relaonship is evident from the expression profile of several markers, including transcripon factors such as Nr4a2, Pitx3, and En1. In addion, as pointed out in response to Reviewer #1, point 5, atypical DA neurons expressing Th and other mDA markers with no or low levels of Slc6a3 (DAT) were isolated. We believe the study is more complete by the inclusion of these cells. Moreover, we included a sufficiently large number of cells, which ensured a comprehensive analysis of mDA neurons in relaon to other cell types dissected from the ventral midbrain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors state that a major advantage of their approach is that it prevents biased datasets when compared to methods that rely on capturing certain cell types. I was wondering if the authors could follow up on this topic with a more detailed descripon of their methodological advantages regarding potenal sampling bias. This is somewhat unclear to me, given that the results of the present study are largely consistent with previous work on this topic.</p></disp-quote><p>As expanded on above (see response to the inial comment in the public review), we strongly disagree that there is litle novelty in our study. None of the previous studies come close to describing the mDA neuron populaon with a similar resoluon, which is unsurprising given the differences in the number of analyzed mDA neurons in this versus previous reports. We agree with the reviewer that our data is consistent with previous studies, when they are all combined. Thus, we idenfied mDA neuron groups that correspond (or roughly correspond) to major DA neuron groups idenfied in previous studies (see pages 8-14 in the Supplementary Results). However, the atlas presented here goes well beyond anything published in scope and resoluon. The diversity we define is comparable to findings that, with careful cross-paper analyses, can be stched together from previous single-cell studies. However, even such a combined analysis does not unravel the resoluon and diverse categorizaon of what we have demonstrated herein (16 neighborhoods in midbrain dopaminergic territories). Considering the well-established problems of dissociang and isolang whole neurons from adult brain ssue, this is likely due to sampling bias, resulng in an almost complete exclusion of some sub-populaons of neurons. We have added text on page 20 to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In the abstract, the authors state that their &quot;results showed that differences between mDA neuron group could best be understood as a connuum without sharp differences between subtypes&quot;. However, I am not sure whether this is the most appropriate descripon of the authors' results, parcularly when looking at the schemac overview shown in Fig. 4F. To me, it seems more likely that genecally-defined DA subtypes overlap with discrete ventral midbrain subnuclei - parcularly in the case of Sox6-expressing cells, which are almost exclusively located in the SNc. In the case of genes that are specific for the VTA, there also seems to be a strong bias toward certain VTA subnuclei, although I agree that arguments can be made that there is some topographic organizaon along a dorso-ventral and medio-lateral gradient, which seems to be largely consistent with the anatomical locaon of projecon-defined dopamine neurons as described previously by Poulin et al., 2018 (Nature Neuroscience).</p></disp-quote><p>What was meant by connuum must be interpreted in the context of the transcriponal landscape of mDA neurons and not their anatomical localizaon. As stated in the paper, the dendrogram depicon of mDA neurons’ transcriptome can be misinterpreted as an indicaon of sharp boundaries and discrete groups in transcriponal profiles. In contrast, we assert that differences between developmentally related mDA neurons are beter described as a connuum with areas in the gene expression landscape defined by the expression of shared genes but without sharp borders between them. We decided to name different areas within this connuum as “territories” at the higher hierarchical level and “neighborhoods” at the more highly resolved level. Hypothecally, such categorizaon can be even more fine-grained, but we find it unlikely that a resoluon beyond the neighborhood level is biologically relevant. As pointed out, the Sox6 territory is the territory that best qualifies as a disncve subtype, while mDA neurons in, e.g., the VTA consist of much higher and nuanced diversity. Importantly, all mDA neurons are much more related to each other than cell types lacking a common developmental origin, including hypothalamic DA neurons. Thus, our effort to define differences in such a gene expression connuum is, in our opinion, more accurate than conveying the message that the diversity consists of subtypes comparable in difference to other cell types that lack a close developmental relaonship with the mDA neuron populaon. Such disnct neuron types, despite using the same neurotransmiter as hypothalamic DA neurons, appear as disnct islands in the UMAP snRNA-seq landscape and typically harbor hundreds of differenally expressed genes. As pointed out in the Discussion, several other studies have noted similar difficules in defining different subtypes among related neurons in e.g. the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus (Kozareva et al., 2021; Saunders et al., 2018; Tasic et al., 2018; Yao et al., 2021). For example, Yao et al., 2021, used a similar hierarchical definion to avoid the implicaon that different groups (“neighborhoods” in this study) should be defined as disnct subtypes of neurons with obvious disncve funcons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) I recommend that the authors revise the introducon to include more current literature on this topic. The review by Bjoerklund and Dunnet, 2006, is very informave and important, but there is more current literature available that discusses anatomical, molecular, and funconal heterogeneity in the ventral midbrain. For example, it would be nice to incorporate recent work from the Awatramani lab on the mapping of the projecon of molecularly defined dopamine neurons (Poulin et al., 2018; Nature Neuroscience).</p></disp-quote><p>We deliberately avoided including primary references to previously described diversity in the Introducon since numerous papers are relevant to cite. Instead, we refer to three essenal reviews, including the recent arcles from Awatramani and Pasterkamp. In the Supplementary Results related to Figure 4 (pages 8-14 in the Supplementary Results), we include many references and the Poulin 2018 paper. We believe that this is the appropriate place for a comprehensive discussion on anatomical, molecular, and funconal heterogeneity. In the revised manuscript's main body, we now emphasize that previous literature is discussed in the Supplementary Results (see page 11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Fig. 1C, the authors show a sample image demonstrang overlap between TH and mCherry, but this has not been quanfied. Similarly, there seem to be no sample images and quanficaon for the contralateral side that was exposed to 6-OHDA.</p></disp-quote><p>The mouse lines used here (Dat-Cre and Rpl10a-mCherry) have been characterized before (Toskas et al., Science Advances 2022). The labelling colocalizes nearly fully with TH, with some excepons (see response below to point #5). We have now complemented with addional data showing an IHC image of one of the midbrain of a unilaterally lesioned mouse in Figure Supplement 5-1E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors state that they focused their analysis on 33,052 nuclei expressing above-threshold levels of either Th OR Slc6a3. However, there seem to be cell populaons in the ventral midbrain of mice that express TH mRNA but not TH protein, and these cells do not seem to be bona fide dopamine neurons (see work from the Morales lab). Similarly, not all dopamine neurons may express DAT mRNA. I was wondering how these discrepancies may influence the authors' analysis and interpretaon.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the presence of cells lacking TH protein despite Th mRNA being expressed has been previously described. We also detected these cells across SNpc and VTA and now show these data as a newly added supplementary figure 2-1. In our dataset, the Gad2 territory, located in the ventromedial VTA, contains cells that express many typical mDA markers, such as Pitx3, but very low levels of TH protein. We have idenfied these based on Pitx3-EGFP and Gad2 mRNA co-expression (figure supplement 4-3). In other parts of VTA and SNpc, most cells seem to co-express Th mRNA and protein and are labeled with Dat-Cre. Also scatered in these areas, we could detect some rare mDA cells that lack TH protein. It should be noted that in our mDA territories other typical mDA neuron genes were expressed, such as Slc18a2, Ddc, Nr4a2 and Pitx3, and thus, they were not solely defined by the presence of Th and/or Slc6a3. Cells that do not have a history of DAT-expression, and therefore were not mCherry labelled, were also included in the analysis due to the relaxed gang used during FANS isolaon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The sex and age of the mice that are used for the experiments are not stated in the Materials and Methods secon under &quot;Mouse lines and genotyping&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.
