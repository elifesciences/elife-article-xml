myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) affects the long arm of chromosome 20 and has been predicted to harbor a tumor suppressor gene. Here we show that <italic>MYBL2</italic>, a gene within the 20q CDR, is expressed at sharply reduced levels in CD34+ cells from most MDS cases (65%; n = 26), whether or not they harbor 20q abnormalities. In a murine competitive reconstitution model, <italic>Mybl2</italic> knockdown by RNAi to 20–30% of normal levels in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors resulted in clonal dominance of these ‘sub-haploinsufficient’ cells, which was reflected in all blood cell lineages. By 6 months post-transplantation, the reconstituted mice had developed a clonal myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorder originating from the cells with aberrantly reduced <italic>Mybl2</italic> expression. We conclude that downregulation of <italic>MYBL2</italic> activity below levels predicted by classical haploinsufficiency underlies the clonal expansion of hematopoietic progenitors in a large fraction of human myeloid malignancies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00825.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00825.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00825.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Blood cells are produced within bone marrow by specialized stem cells and progenitor cells. Abnormalities in this process lead to a group of diseases known as myeloid malignancies, which include acute myeloid leukaemia—in which the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells—and myelodysplastic syndromes, which are caused by too few mature blood cells being produced.</p><p>Many individuals affected by these disorders possess a shortened form of chromosome 20 that lacks a number of genes. This deletion is only ever seen in one of their two copies of the chromosome—suggesting that at least some of these genes are essential for survival—but the identity of the gene(s) that are associated with the increased risk of myeloid malignancies is unknown.</p><p>Now, Heinrichs et al. have uncovered a key tumor suppressor among those genes frequently lost on chromosome 20. The gene, which is called <italic>MYBL2</italic>, encodes a transcription factor that helps to control the cell division cycle. Myeloid malignancy patients lacking one copy of this gene showed levels of <italic>MYBL2</italic> expression that were less than 50% of those in healthy individuals. This suggests that additional mechanisms must be acting to reduce expression of their remaining copy of the gene. Surprisingly, <italic>MYBL2</italic> levels were also reduced in myeloid malignancy patients who possessed two intact copies of chromosome 20, indicating that loss of a single copy represents only one mechanism to reduce <italic>MYBL2</italic> expression, i.e., the ‘tip-of-the-iceberg’. Hence, this finding reveals a more general role for <italic>MYBL2</italic> as it indicates that more patients are likely to be affected by altered expression of this gene.</p><p>To confirm their findings from studies in patients, Heinrichs et al. used gene silencing techniques to reduce the expression of <italic>MYBL2</italic> in mice and showed that this induced symptoms of myeloid malignancies in the animals. Moreover, injection of modified cells from these animals into healthy mice also induced symptoms in the recipients. The modified cells are able to expand more robustly than normal cells, and this dominance induced by downregulation of the tumor suppressor increases the risk of malignancy.</p><p>In addition to revealing a new tumor suppressor gene and its contribution to myeloid malignancies, the study by Heinrichs et al. highlights the importance of gene dosage in mediating the effects of tumor suppressors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00825.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00825.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Myelodysplastic Syndromes</kwd><kwd>MYBL2</kwd><kwd>20q CDR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH P01 CA-108631</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heinrichs</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><name><surname>Conover</surname><given-names>Lillian F</given-names></name><name><surname>Bueso-Ramos</surname><given-names>Carlos E</given-names></name><name><surname>Kilpivaara</surname><given-names>Outi</given-names></name><name><surname>Stevenson</surname><given-names>Kristen</given-names></name><name><surname>Neuberg</surname><given-names>Donna</given-names></name><name><surname>Loh</surname><given-names>Mignon L</given-names></name><name><surname>Garcia-Manero</surname><given-names>Guillermo</given-names></name><name><surname>Kantarjian</surname><given-names>Hagop M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reduced expression of <italic>MYBL2</italic> contributes to malignancies of the blood by permitting uncontrolled expansion of blood cell progenitors, implying a tumor suppressor function for this gene.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The molecular changes underlying human myeloid malignancies remain difficult to unravel, posing major obstacles to the development of effective countermeasures. Although the silencing of tumor suppressor genes by chromosomal deletions, point mutations, or other mechanisms is an acknowledged factor in myeloid cell transformation, the specific involvement of gene dosage is not well understood. In broadest terms, single-copy loss of a suppressor gene can be sufficient to modify gene function and promote tumorigenesis (classical haploinsufficiency), while in other tumors, the loss of two alleles is required (two-hit paradigm of Knudson) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Knudson, 1971</xref>). Recent evidence indicates that more subtle reductions in suppressor gene function may contribute importantly to myeloid malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rosenbauer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2007</xref>), leading to the need for faithful animal models to establish that such changes are truly involved in tumorigenesis.</p><p>Loss of an interstitial segment of chromosome 20q (20q CDR) is detected in about 4% of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Haase et al., 2007</xref>), and this region is variably affected in different types of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), including polycythemia vera (10%) and primary myelofibrosis (12%), and less commonly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 1%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bench et al., 2000</xref>). Notably, only heterozygous deletions have been found in studies of myeloid malignancies with loss of chromosome 20q, without any evidence of homozygous deletion or mutations of a gene within the affected region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heinrichs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huh et al., 2010</xref>). These findings implicate a gene within the 20q CDR that is essential for cell viability, but whose tumor suppressor function is strongly dose-dependent and does not follow the classical Knudson model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Knudson, 1971</xref>), which predicts biallelic gene inactivation. Instead, monoallelic loss, with or without additional epigenetic or microRNA (miRNA)-mediated downregulation of the remaining allele, may reduce gene expression levels sufficiently to promote myeloid cell transformation. Thus, we sought to identify candidate tumor suppressor genes within the 20q CDR on the basis of their reduced expression in malignant myeloid progenitor cells, as we have reported previously for <italic>CTNNA1</italic> in myeloid malignancies with deletions of chromosome 5q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ye et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Here we identify <italic>MYBL2</italic>, which encodes a transcription factor with functions in checkpoint control of the G2 cell cycle phase, as a key tumor suppressor gene in over one half of all MDS cases, whether characterized by a 20q deletion or a normal karyotype. Reductions of <italic>MYBL2</italic> dosage to levels below those commensurate with single-copy loss conferred a competitive advantage to hematopoietic progenitor cells in both primary and secondary transplantation assays and were associated with histopathologic changes typical of myeloid neoplasia. These findings implicate aberrantly low levels of <italic>MYBL2</italic> expression as a central mechanism in the development of clonal dominance in MDS and other myeloid malignancies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>MYBL2</italic> identified as a potential tumor suppressor</title><p>We first studied the gene expression profiles of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells from eight MDS cases with cytogenetically evident aberrations of chromosome 20q, as compared to CD34+ cells from normal individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We found that <italic>MYBL2</italic>, which resides near the center of this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), was among the top-scoring genes downregulated in MDS cells compared to normal CD34+ controls. <italic>MYBL2</italic> encodes a highly conserved transcription factor that acts as a major component of the dREAM complex, which controls the G2-to-M phase transition within the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Korenjak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lewis et al., 2004</xref>). The mean expression level of <italic>MYBL2</italic> (39%) was less than that of normal CD34+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that mechanisms beyond the deletion of one allele might affect the remaining allele. Thus, on the assumption that some MDS cases with a normal karyotype might also have reduced expression of a gene or genes within the 20q CDR, we undertook an expression analysis of CD34+ cells from 18 MDS cases with a normal karyotype and the eight cases with a 20q aberration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>), compared to CD34+ cells from four normal bone marrow samples. <italic>MYBL2</italic> was the top-scoring gene among 108 differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Further analysis showed that in 17 (65%) of 26 MDS patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), <italic>MYBL2</italic> expression levels in CD34+ cells were reduced to ≤45% of normal CD34+ cells levels (mean 32.8%). These microarray data were confirmed by QRT-PCR analysis of <italic>MYBL2</italic> expression levels in 10 MDS cases and eight normal CD34+ bone marrow samples, including four additional normal control CD34+ samples that were not part of the original microarray analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, <italic>MYBL2</italic> levels measured by QRT-PCR in MDS samples were highly correlated (r = 0.966) with those determined by microarray analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Hence, <italic>MYBL2</italic> appears to be expressed at reduced levels in nearly two-thirds of MDS cases, including those with a normal karyotype, suggesting that it functions as a dose-dependent tumor suppressor gene.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00825.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Gene expression analysis of CD34+ cells from MDS patients with a 20q aberration or a normal karyotype.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heat map showing the top-scoring 25 genes that were either up- or downregulated in CD34+ cells from 26 MDS patients vs normal donors (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref> for patient characteristics).

To model gene dose insufficiency by RNA interference (RNAi), we used a set of eight shRNA-expression vectors in the MDS/AML cell line SKM1, which reduced <italic>MYBL2</italic> expression to 5–30% of the endogenous <italic>MYBL2</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), approximating the endogenous levels we had identified in CD34+ cells from patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To identify the genes most highly correlated with decreased <italic>MYBL2</italic> expression, we introduced our shRNA-expression vectors into normal primary human CD34+ cells and measured gene expression at 48 hr post-transduction. Nearly all differentially expressed genes were downregulated after <italic>MYBL2</italic> knockdown (81 of 89 genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because these results are based on eight different <italic>MYBL2</italic>-specific shRNAs, each with different knockdown efficiency, this analysis ensures the robustness of the data and eliminates potentially confounding off-target effects by individual shRNAs.

A potential candidate is aberrant DNA methylation, especially in view of the 921 base-pair CpG island that spans the proximal promoter and the first exon of the <italic>MYBL2</italic> gene. However, analysis of this site using bone marrow cell DNA from 30 MDS patients failed to detect any methylated cytosines, indicating that DNA methylation is not a frequent mechanism for <italic>MYBL2</italic> downregulation in MDS (JP Issa, personal communication, 2012). This finding is supported by a recently published study that did not identify methylation affecting the <italic>MYBL2</italic> gene in cells from 83 MDS cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Del Rey et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We also considered that the upregulation of one or more miRNAs targeting <italic>MYBL2</italic> might explain our results. We pursued this notion in a subset of patient samples (seven with low <italic>MYBL2</italic> expression and two with normal <italic>MYBL2</italic> expression, together with three controls) by analyzing the expression levels of <italic>mir-29a</italic> and <italic>mir-30e</italic>.

The bone marrow in experimental mice was hypercellular and contained more than 95% mature myeloid cells at the expense of erythroid cells (&lt;5%), while 2% of the cells had a dysplastic morphology. The spleens were frequently enlarged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), the white pulp was virtually absent, and the whole organ showed evidence of extramedullary hematopoiesis. Notably, one mouse developed an erythroid leukemia characterized by a block of differentiation at the CD71-positive stage at 6 months post-transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In summary, the histopathologic findings in these mice indicate a clonal myeloproliferative disorder with dysplastic features.</p><p>To identify the cells principally involved in the clonal dominance associated with this disorder, we analyzed the Lin<sup>−</sup>/Sca1<sup>+</sup>/Kit<sup>+</sup> (LSK) bone marrow cells of the affected mice (n = 12) in comparison to controls.

The picture beginning to emerge from these investigations is that a broad array of molecular changes have the potential to drive the biology and clinical phenotypes of MDS in unique ways. Yet, the disease remains very heterogeneous and none of the molecular lesions that have been convincingly linked to MDS pathogenesis affect more than a fourth of cases overall, with a prevalence of 1–15% being much more common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bejar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Shih et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we identified <italic>MYBL2</italic> as a dosage-dependent tumor suppressor gene that was reduced in expression to sub-haploinsufficient levels in 17 (65%) of 26 human MDS cases. This result is somewhat surprising given that <italic>MYBL2</italic> has been implicated as a gene that is typically overexpressed (rather than downregulated) in several types of cancer and whose elevated expression correlates with a poor prognosis in human breast cancer and other malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amatschek et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Paik et al., 2004</xref>). However, no direct evidence demonstrating oncogenic activity by overexpressed <italic>MYBL2</italic> has been reported to date. High levels of expression of this transcription factor in other tumor types may reflect the greater proliferative rate of the tumor cell population compared to resting cells, so that the apparently levels of high <italic>MYBL2</italic> activity may be a consequence rather than a cause of malignant transformation. By contrast, the proliferative fraction of cells in myeloid neoplasia is generally quite low.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate the surprising finding that abnormally low levels of <italic>MYBL2</italic> expression have the unique property of imparting a clonal advantage to multipotent hematopoietic progenitors, leading rapidly to the clonal dominance of such cells within the myeloid, and B- and T-lymphocyte cell lineages. The persistence of clonal dominance in recipient mice for more than 6 months after bone marrow cell transplantation, and in recipients of secondary transplants, indicates that the affected multipotent hematopoietic cells have both self-renewal and long-term repopulating ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Morrison and Weissman, 1994</xref>). Hence, our finding establishes MYBL2 as a key tumor suppressor gene of the 20q CDR affected in human MDS and MPD. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that haploinsufficiency for other genes within the 20q CDR cooperates with aberrantly low expression of <italic>MYBL2</italic> to move the cells toward malignant transformation, as has been shown for the CDR associated with the 5q-syndrome, where haploinsufficiency of the gene <italic>RPS14</italic> as well as loss of expression of an miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ebert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlow et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Starczynowski et al., 2010</xref>) are critical steps in MDS pathogenesis.</p><p>Most intriguing is our finding of decreased <italic>MYBL2</italic> expression in MDS cases with a normal karyotype, which suggests that interstitial deletion of chromosome 20q is not the only mechanism by which <italic>MYBL2</italic> activity can be reduced in MDS. Indeed, low levels of <italic>MYBL2</italic> were apparent in 10 (56%) of 18 of our normal-karyotype MDS cases, and 38% of those reported by Pellagatti et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pellagatti et al., 2010</xref>). We were unable to implicate aberrant methylation of the <italic>MYBL2</italic> genomic locus as an additional mechanism of gene-dosage reduction; instead, we found elevated expression levels of <italic>mir-29a</italic> and <italic>mir-30e</italic>, which are known to target <italic>MYBL2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Martinez et al., 2011</xref>), in CD34+ cells from patients with MDS and low levels of <italic>MYBL2</italic> expression. In addition, others have shown that overexpression of <italic>mir-29a</italic> in murine bone marrow cells leads to acute myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Han et al., 2010</xref>). Combined with our results, this observation suggests that mir-29a may be oncogenic, at least in part, because it targets <italic>Mybl2</italic> transcripts. Finally, we identified a case with heterozygous missense mutation in <italic>MYBL2</italic> that led to the loss of gene function, analogous to the effect of monoallelic gene deletion. Thus, our results indicate that the MYBL2 transcription factor gene is targeted by diverse molecular events in MDS, including not only deletion within the 20q chromosomal region, but also heterozygous loss-of-function mutations and the repression of gene expression by dysregulated miRNAs.</p><p>Clarke et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clarke et al., 2012</xref>) have also described an association between <italic>MYBL2</italic> expression levels and the occurrence of hematologic disorders, including MDS, in aged <italic>Mybl2</italic> haploinsufficient mice. These authors were able to show that haploinsufficiency for the <italic>Mybl2</italic> gene increases susceptibility to age-related myeloid neoplasia. Our data indicate that more pronounced gene dosage reduction of <italic>Mybl2</italic> might be even more advantageous for clonal dominance. Although our findings do not rule out a causal role for straight-forward haploinsufficiency in myeloid malignancies, they strongly suggest that the oncogenic effects of reduced <italic>MYBL2</italic> dosage are more pronounced as the dosage level falls to near 30% of normal, in keeping with the continuum model of tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger et al., 2011</xref>). We would also stress that in the range of <italic>MYBL2</italic> dosage reductions in this study were modeled based on those found in CD34+ cells from MDS clinical samples, in which the reductions of <italic>MYBL2</italic> gene dosage were predominately in the range of 20–30% of normal levels, and thus were considerably lower than the 50% predicted by classical haploinsufficiency. Importantly, expression levels lower than 20% appear incompatible with cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), consistent with the known function of MYBL2 as a key regulator of G2-to-M transition and the fact that biallelic inactivation of this gene causes early embryonic lethality in the mouse due to a block in inner cell mass formation during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tanaka et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Our results implicating a transforming role for sub-haploinsufficient levels of <italic>MYBL2</italic> build upon earlier studies implicating progressive inactivation of <italic>CTNNA1</italic> and the graded reduction of <italic>PU.1</italic> expression in the molecular pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rosenbauer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). Our approach, which tested the effects of graded levels of <italic>Mybl2</italic> knockdown of hematopoietic progenitors in vivo, provides compelling evidence for the importance of reductions of tumor suppressor gene levels below the 50% level associated with classical haploinsufficiency in the molecular pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Clinical samples</title><p>Bone marrow samples represented 28 MDS patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) seen at the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).

This signature was also examined in an independent cohort of 94 normal karyotype patients using KNN.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Protein extracts were prepared by SDS lysis and normalized by total protein content (BCA assay). Total protein (5–25 µg) was separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted on PVDF membranes.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Lou Staudt, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The reviewers are unconvinced by the argument that <italic>MYBL2</italic> levels must be reduced to sub-haploinsufficient levels to cause myeloid malignancy. After all, Clarke et al show that deletion of a single copy of <italic>MYBL2</italic> is sufficient to cause myeloproliferation in mice. The authors do not test an shRNA that only reduces <italic>MYBL2</italic> levels by 50%, so they cannot rule out the possibility that <italic>MYBL2</italic> could function as a typical haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. It would seem best to tone down this aspect of the Discussion.</p><p>2) The phenotypic description of the mice shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is incomplete. First, it is unclear if hematologic disease was the cause of death in any of these mice (except for the one that developed AML) or if these findings were noted at the time of elective euthanasia. A Kaplan–Meier curve showing survival (if reduced) or a clear statement such as “although transduced cells expressing <italic>Mybl2</italic> hairpins demonstrated a clonal growth advantage, recipient mice appeared well with no evidence of overt hematologic disease for XX months” (if not). Along these lines, what were the peripheral blood counts and spleen sizes of the recipient mice shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> when they were euthanized? An elevated reticulocyte count can be a measure of ineffective erythropoiesis in mice (and humans) with MDS: were these measured or estimated from peripheral blood smears? Recticulocyte counts would have also been of interest for the secondary recipients shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and Southern blot analysis to assess clonally at the level of vector integration would have also been informative. Finally, how did the disease phenotype compare in primary and secondary recipients with respect to the quantitative parameters outlined above?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00825.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The reviewers are unconvinced by the argument that</italic> MYBL2 <italic>levels must be reduced to sub-haploinsufficient levels to cause myeloid malignancy.

A new paragraph introducing these results has been added to the Results section (beginning “We also evaluated the circulating blood counts in 13 of the 17 mice at the time of euthanasia 6–7 months after transplant”).</p><p>Our strategy was to evaluate all of the mice at 6–7 months post-transplant, which is a time at which long-term hematopoietic reconstitution has been achieved in competitive repopulation assays. Thus, a Kaplan–Meier curve can’t be included as the mice were electively euthanized and the majority of the primary recipients appeared well at 6–7 months post-transplant.</p><p>The circulating blood abnormalities in the secondary animals appeared much more pronounced as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, panel b. We now comment on this finding within the Results section, and the new paragraph begins “Analysis of blood samples collected from secondary recipients at 10 weeks revealed a marked clonal advantage for GFP+/Mybl2-RNAi cells transplanted from each of the four mice with primary disease”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
