Understanding how this pathway is regulated in development remains a major challenge. Recent studies suggested that Hippo signaling can be modulated by cytoskeletal tension through a Rok-myosin II pathway. How cytoskeletal tension is regulated or its relationship to the other known upstream regulators of the Hippo pathway remains poorly defined. In this study, we identify spectrin, a contractile protein at the cytoskeleton-membrane interface, as an upstream regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway. We show that, in contrast to canonical upstream regulators such as Crumbs, Kibra, Expanded, and Merlin, spectrin regulates Hippo signaling in a distinct way by modulating cortical actomyosin activity through non-muscle myosin II. These results uncover an essential mediator of Hippo signaling by cytoskeleton tension, providing a new entry point to dissecting how mechanical signals regulate Hippo signaling in living tissues.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06567.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06567.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06567.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Organs including the liver, eyes, and lungs are made up of millions of cells, and how these organs stop growing once they reach their final size has fascinated scientists for decades. The cells in developing organs must communicate with each other and respond appropriately to the signals that they receive from other cells. This requires so-called “signaling pathways”. One such pathway that involves a protein called Hippo is known to control when cells should grow and divide and when they should stop. If this pathway does not work correctly, it can cause too many cells to be formed, which may result in cancer.</p><p>The Hippo signaling pathway can also be regulated by an extensive network of protein filaments found within cells, called the cytoskeleton. This network can exert forces on the cells, which can have a major impact on cell growth. However, the mechanism behind the interaction between the cytoskeleton and the Hippo signaling pathway is poorly understood.</p><p>Now, Deng et al. have engineered fruit flies in which the expression of individual genes had been artificially reduced, and looked for flies that had enlarged wings. Three genes identified in these experiments encode different subunits of a large spring-like protein, called spectrin, which is part of the cytoskeleton. This suggests that normally spectrin limits wing size. Furthermore, spectrin was also found to control the size of other organs in the fruit flies, such as the eyes and ovaries. In all of these organs, the Hippo signaling pathway failed to work properly in the absence of spectrin. Deng et al. then further explored the relationship between spectrin and Hippo signaling and found that cells without spectrin show abnormally high levels of tension in their cytoskeleton. When flies that lacked spectrin were engineered to reduce this tension, these flies developed normal sized organs. These findings reveal the importance of cytoskeleton tension in controlling tissue growth, and provide a new entry point to understand how normal tissues grow to their characteristic size and how such process goes awry in cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06567.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06567.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>organ size</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>myosin activity</kwd><kwd>cell tension</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Duojia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY015708</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deng</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Jianzhong</given-names></name><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Yonggang</given-names></name><name><surname>Qing</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Duojia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A contractile structural protein of the membrane-associated cytoskeleton is a Hippo signaling component that works through the regulation of non-muscle myosin activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Hippo signaling pathway controls organ size in <italic>Drosophila</italic> through coordinated regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harvey and Tapon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Halder and Johnson, 2011</xref>). This pathway involves a core kinase cascade in which the Hippo-Salvador (Hpo-Sav) kinase complex phosphorylates and activates the Warts-Mats (Wts-Mats) kinase complex, which in turn inactivates the Yorkie (Yki) oncoprotein through phosphorylation. This phosphorylation event excludes Yki from the nucleus, where it normally functions as a coactivator for the expression of Hippo pathway target genes. The conserved function of Hippo signaling in mammalian growth control and tumorigenesis has stimulated much interest in understanding the regulation of this pathway in development, regeneration, and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry and Camargo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson and Halder, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Genetic studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggest that the Hippo kinase cascade is modulated by a diverse array of upstream regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boggiano and Fehon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enderle and McNeill, 2013</xref>). Prominent among these are three membrane-associated tumor suppressor proteins, Expanded (Ex), Merlin (Mer) and Kibra, which act semi-redundantly to activate downstream signaling, by recruiting the core kinase cassette to the plasma membrane or cytoplasmic sequestration of Yki through direct binding. Other tumor suppressor proteins implicated as upstream regulators of the Hippo kinase cascade include the atypical cadherins Fat (Ft) and Dachsous (Ds), apical basal polarity regulators Crumbs (Crb), Scribble (Scrib), Discs large (Dlg), and Lethal giant larvae (Lgl), the Ste20-like kinase Tao-1, the protein tyrosine phosphatase Pez, and the cell adhesion molecule Echinoid (Ed). At least some of these tumor suppressors have been shown to play a conserved role in Hippo signaling in mammals, which have also acquired additional regulators such as Angiomotin (Amot), α-catenin, and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yu and Guan, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In an exciting recent development, studies in cultured mammalian cells have implicated YAP and TAZ, the mammalian counterpart of Yki, as key mediators of mechanotransduction, whereby changes in cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction, cell shape, or the actomyosin cytoskeleton influence cellular behaviors such as proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aragona et al., 2013</xref>). Molecular interrogation of this mechanotransduction process suggests that the subcellular localization and thus the activity of YAP/TAZ is regulated by the contractile actomyosin through a Rok (Rho-associated protein kinase)-myosin II pathway. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, excessive actin polymerization or activation of Rok-myosin II also lead to increased Yki activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sansores-Garcia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rauskolb et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that cytoskeleton tension is a conserved regulator of Hippo signaling in diverse animals. Despite these exciting progresses, important questions remain: what is the relationship between the actomyosin cytoskeleton and the other reported upstream regulators such as Kibra, Ex, and Mer in Hippo pathway regulation? Furthermore, since mechanical force can be sensed and transduced in many subcellular regions such as cell–cell junction, plasma membrane-associated cytoskeleton cortex, cytoplasmic stress fiber and even nuclear membrane-associated cortex, what is the exact nature of the cytoskeletal force that is relevant to Hippo signaling?</p><p>Spectrin is a large spring-like protein that forms the spectrin-based membrane skeleton (SBMS) right beneath the plasma membrane by crosslinking short F-actin and binding integral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett and Baines, 2001</xref>). Spectrin proteins are conserved in all eukaryotes from protozoa to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baines, 2009</xref>). Spectrin exists mainly as heterotetramers of α and β subunits, in which the α and β subunits are assembled side to side in an antiparallel fashion to form rod-like αβ dimers that in turn self-associate head to head to form tetramers. With the help of Adducin protein, these tetramers crosslink with short F-actin to form a lattice-like network that supports the structural stability of the plasma membrane. Indeed, spectrin was first identified as proteins that contribute to the mechanical resilience of erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennett and Gilligan, 1993</xref>), and mutations in spectrin genes result in severe anemia characterized by abnormally shaped erythrocytes with increased membrane fragility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delaunay, 2007</xref>). A recent study reported that the SBMS functions independently of actin dynamics to maintain the pre-stress status of touch receptor neurons (TRNs) in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and therefore enhances the overall mechanosensitivity of these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krieg et al., 2014</xref>). Whether the SBMS plays a direct role in mechanotransduction, or the relationship between the SBMS and the actomyosin cytoskeleton in mechanotransduction, is less clear.</p><p>The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> encodes one α subunit (α-Spec) and two β subunits (β-Spec and βHeavy-spec or βH-Spec), which generate two spectrin tetramers, (αβ)<sub>2</sub> and (αβH)<sub>2</sub>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovarian follicle cells, β-Spec and βH-Spec are localized to the basolateral and apical membrane, respectively, while α-Spec is localized along the entire apical–basal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 1997</xref>). Here, we report the identification of spectrin genes as negative growth regulators and upstream regulators of the Hippo signaling pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Interestingly, unlike the previously reported upstream regulators of the Hippo pathway such as Crumbs, Kibra, Ex and Mer, spectrin regulates Hippo signaling through a distinct mechanism by modulating the activity of non-muscle myosin II.

To explore this relationship further, we tested whether spectrin knockdown enhances the mild overgrowth phenotype caused by mutations in upstream regulators of the Hippo signaling, considering that they usually work redundantly to regulate Hippo signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hamaratoglu et al., 2006</xref>).

Another hallmark of defective Hippo signaling is the alteration of interommatidial cell number in pupal retina. Wild-type eyes have an average of 12 interommatidial cells surrounding each unit eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carthew, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Complete loss of Hippo signaling, as shown by mutants lacking components of the core kinase cascade, results in prolonged expression of <italic>cut</italic> and formation of multilayer PFCs in stage 10 egg chambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meignin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Polesello and Tapon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2008</xref>).

Thus, spectrin functions as a widespread regulator of Hippo signaling in multiple tissue contexts. The requirement of spectrin in both imaginal discs and PFCs distinguishes it from Ft-Ds, which is required in imaginal discs but dispensable in the PFCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett and Harvey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Silva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Willecke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meignin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Polesello and Tapon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated how spectrin regulates Hippo signaling. Since spectrin usually functions as a scaffold protein at the membrane–cytoskeleton interface, we first examined the subcellular localization of three membrane-associated upstream regulators of Hippo signaling: Ex, Mer, and Kibra. Of note, similar to spectrin, these proteins regulate Hippo signaling in both imaginal discs and PFCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hamaratoglu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meignin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Polesello and Tapon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumgartner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Genevet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). We detected no visible changes in the subcellular localization of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B′</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together with the synergist effect of spectrin knockdown with <italic>ex</italic>, <italic>mer</italic>, or <italic>kibra</italic> mutations described above, these results suggest that spectrin likely functions in parallel with Ex, Mer, and Kibra to regulate Hippo signaling.</p><p>Given recent studies implicating the actomyosin cytoskeleton as a regulator of Hippo signaling, we examined the possibility that the SBMS may regulate Hippo signaling through the actomyosin cytoskeleton, whose major components are non-muscle myosin II and F-actin. As the major force generator in most cell types, the activity of non-muscle myosin II is regulated by phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin II (MLC) by multiple kinases including Rho-associated protein kinase (Rok) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>). Phosphorylation of MLC greatly increases the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activity of myosin in the presence of actin and leads to the generation of contractile forces or tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Somlyo and Somlyo, 2003</xref>).

Careful examination of the p-MLC signal revealed a polarized effect of spectrin knockdown that is consistent with the subcellular distribution of the different spectrin subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 1997</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>): reducing α-Spec led to elevated p-MLC level in both apical and basolateral cortices of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B′</xref>), but reducing βH-Spec caused increased p-MLC only in the apical cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D′</xref>) while reducing β-Spec caused increased p-MLC only in the basolateral cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F′</xref>). A similar increase of p-MLC was observed in the wing imaginal disc upon <italic>α-spec</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–I′</xref>) and confirmed in mutant clones carrying the <italic>α-spec</italic><sup><italic>rg41</italic></sup> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–G′</xref>).

Moreover, expression of Sqh<sup>EE</sup> in <italic>mer</italic> or <italic>ex</italic> mutant clones led to a dramatic increase in the number of ECPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>), suggesting a synergistic effect between cytoskeletal tension and the canonical upstream regulators of the Hippo pathway in tissue growth.

Through the identification of all the spectrin subunits as negative growth regulators (tumor suppressors) and the characterization of their mechanism of action in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we have uncovered the SBMS, a cytoskeleton directly underneath the plasma membrane, as an essential regulator of the actomyosin cytoskeleton in Hippo signaling. The negative regulation of myosin II activity is unique to the spectrin, since it is not shared by other known upstream tumor suppressors of the Hippo pathway. Rather, the spectrin-Myo II pathway functions in parallel with the other upstream regulators to modulate Hippo signaling in vivo. Although spectrin was reported to regulate the Hippo pathway during the preparation and review of this paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fletcher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wong et al., 2015</xref>), our study is the first to uncover a functional link between the SBMC and Myo II activity, or to establish the parallel relationship between spectrin-MyoII-mediated actomyosin activity and the other known upstream regulators of Hippo signaling. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that a structural membrane skeleton protein regulates Hippo signaling by modulating actomyosin contractility.</p><p>Our study also provides new insight into the nature of force production that is relevant to Hippo signaling. Previous studies implicating cytoskeletal tension as a regulator of Hippo signaling were based on whole-cell perturbation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aragona et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rauskolb et al., 2014</xref>). Since the actomyosin cytoskeleton is distributed in diverse subcellular compartments such as the cell cortex, the cytoplasm and the cell–cell junction, it was unclear from these experiments which subcellular pool(s) of the actomyosin cytoskeleton are relevant to Hippo signaling. Our observation that loss of the SBMS leads to defective Hippo signaling with elevated p-MLC levels only around the cell cortex suggests that the actomyosin cytoskeleton directly underneath the plasma membrane is functionally linked to the Hippo pathway. Interestingly, ablation of apical spectrin (βH-spec) and basolateral spectrin (β-spec) leads to localized activation of p-MLC in the apical and basolateral cortex, respectively. Yet, both ablations result in similar Hippo-related growth defects. Based on these findings, we infer that the actomyosin cytoskeleton in both membrane domains is relevant to Hippo signaling, in contrast to a previous report suggesting that only apical actin polymerization affects Hippo signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandez et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>While our study has uncovered a functional link between spectrin and actomyosin activity, the molecular mechanisms by which actomyosin activity regulates Hippo signaling remain to be determined. At present, there are contrasting views on whether cytoskeleton-mediated regulation of Yki/YAP activity is Wts/Lats-dependent or Wts/Lats-independent (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Low et al., 2014</xref>). Our characterization of spectrin is more consistent with a Wts/LATS-dependent mechanism, since YAP phosphorylation is decreased by spectrin knockdown in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) and that overexpression of Wts can rescue the ECPC phenotype of spectrin RNAi without rescuing the high p-MLC levels in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Nevertheless, our data cannot exclude the possibility of Wts/Lats-independent mechanisms.</p><p>Previous studies have focused on the different functions of the SBMS and the actomyosin cytoskeleton in cell biology. Much of the studies on SBMS have emphasized its role in the maintenance of plasma membrane integrity, while studies of the actomyosin cytoskeleton have implicated it in diverse cellular processes from mechanotransduction to cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett and Baines, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lecuit and Lenne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campellone and Welch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lecuit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Machnicka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takeichi, 2014</xref>). Although spectrin subunits have been reported to physically interact with several proteins that may directly or indirectly impact the actomyosin cytoskeleton, such as F-actin, Adducin, α-Catenin and Moesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gardner and Bennett, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pradhan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Medina et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barkalow et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), functional coupling between these two cytoskeleton systems remains poorly understood. Our current study uncovers a previously underappreciated functional link between these two cytoskeleton systems and demonstrates that this link is physiologically important for regulating the Hippo pathway in multiple developmental contexts. We speculate that mechanical stimuli on cell membrane may be transduced first to the SBMS directly underneath the plasma membrane, which then regulates actomyosin tension to influence cell behaviors. Conversely, the actomyosin cytoskeleton may also regulate the function of the SBMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fukata et al., 1999</xref>). Understanding the detailed molecular mechanism by which the SBMS regulates Myo II activity will provide an important entry point to dissect the crosstalk between the SBMS and the actomyosin cytoskeleton in diverse cellular processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics</title><p><italic>UAS-α-specRNAi, UAS-β-specRNAi</italic> and <italic>UAS-βH-specRNAi</italic> lines were obtained from Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> Resource Center (VDRC, stock ID 25387, 42054 and 37075). <italic>UAS-rokRNAi</italic> was obtained from the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (stock ID 34324).

Your article has been favorably reviewed by Janet Rossant (Senior editor and Reviewing editor) and 2 other reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this is a very interesting paper on the role of the F-actin crosslinking protein Spectrin as a regulator of fly Yki, the ortholog of mammalian YAP/TAZ. Spectrin inactivation causes wing overgrowth by modulating contractility of cortical actin thus demonstrating a linkage between spectrins, the cortical cytoskeleton and modulation of the downstream Hippo pathway. The data are clear, important and deserving publication in this journal. However there were several major concerns and some minor ones that need to be addressed before we can consider a revised manuscript.</p><p>1) All of the data presented are consistent with spectrin playing some kind of upstream role in regulating actomyosin and thus directly or indirectly regulating Hippo signaling. However, to claim, as the authors do throughout the text that “spectrin functions as a general regulator of Hippo signaling in multiple tissue contexts” is incorrect. The authors themselves clearly show in this paper that the effects of spectrin and associated cortical tension are genetically distinct from cell polarity determinants or merlin that are the more established upstream inputs of the Hippo cassette. The fact that these distinct pathways are genetically synergistic, rather than epistatic, reinforces the notion that these are parallel cues, as previously shown in mammalian cells. In fact, the conclusion that “these results further support the view that the spectrin and myosin II-mediated cytoskeletal tension functions in parallel with the canonical upstream regulators of the Hippo pathway to regulate downstream signaling” is a more correct interpretation. We would suggest that one pathway is the canonical Hippo pathway and the other is not. This is a point of novelty that should be actually highlighted.</p><p>2) There is very little in the paper to suggest that the loss of spectrin actually affects the Yki co-activator localization in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system. Is there any evidence for this?</p><p>3) The <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal retina has been an excellent model to study the mechanical force contribution to cell patterning during development (see references below). However, the evaluation of mechanical tension, as presented in the manuscript, is good but not robust. The major “read outs” of the tension used in this report are the p-MLC levels and the number of cells per cluster, ECPC. Indeed, the high level of p-MLC might imply high tension, but the high tension could also result in different cell shape/pattern, especially in <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal retina. There is no good description and/or quantification regarding cell shapes. Moreover, there is no clear indication how the tension is related to the extra number of cells (i.e., ECPC). To improve the paper it is suggested that the retinal cell pattern should be better quantified and the pattern linked to mechanical tension, and/or to quantify the tension by laser ablation (Hayashi T, Carthew RW. Surface mechanics mediate pattern formation in the developing retina. Nature 431: 647-652, 2004. Hilgenfeldt S, Erisken S, Carthew RW. Physical modeling of cell geometric order in an epithelial tissue. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105: 907-911, 2008).</p><p>4) The paper demonstrates a linkage between spectrins and the role of actomyosin in regulating Hippo signaling, but it is not clear how the spectrin network is linked to the actomyosin cytoskeleton. What happens to the integrity of the cytoskeleton in spectrin mutants? What are the essential domains of spectrin required for this interaction? Also it is not clear where and how the parallel upstream Hippo pathways intersect.</p><p>5) The data on possible spectrin function in mammalian cells is very minimal: knockdown of spectrin in a mammary cell line led to increased nuclear Yap with decreased phosphorylation at Hippo-responsive sites. Do they also see effects related to cortical tension changes in mammalian cells?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06567.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers agreed that this is a very interesting paper on the role of the F-actin crosslinking protein Spectrin as a regulator of fly Yki, the ortholog of mammalian YAP/TAZ.

There is no good description and/or quantification regarding cell shapes. Moreover, there is no clear indication how the tension is related to the extra number of cells (i.e., ECPC). To improve the paper it is suggested that the retinal cell pattern should be better quantified and the pattern linked to mechanical tension, and/or to quantify the tension by laser ablation (Hayashi T, Carthew RW. Surface mechanics mediate pattern formation in the developing retina. Nature 431: 647-652, 2004. Hilgenfeldt S, Erisken S, Carthew RW. Physical modeling of cell geometric order in an epithelial tissue. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105: 907-911, 2008)</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comment that, although we observed changes in p-MLC levels, which indicate changes in actomyosin contractility, we did not measure mechanic tension directly. Measuring retinal cell shape/pattern is insufficient for this purpose since it is influenced by many factors such as cell adhesion, cell death, cell movement, not all of which are directly related to cell tension (Larson et al., Plos Computational Biology 6: e1000841, 2010). In another word, cell shape is not a more direct assay for cell tension than p-MLC. As suggested by the reviewers, the best way to quantify cell tension is by laser ablation. Although this technique has been done in fly embryos and larval discs, it is very challenging in pupal discs (we are not aware of any previous reports of this technique in the pupal eyes).</p><p>Although we did not measure mechanic tension directly by laser ablation, we did show that increased MLC activity, either due to loss of spectrin or direct overexpression of active MLC, both result in similar extra cells per cluster (ECPC) phenotype. Further, the ECPC phenotype of spectrin mutant is rescued by dampening MLC activity. Thus, although we have not measured mechanic tension directly, we can conclude that spectrin regulates Myosin II activity and this regulation underlies the role of spectrin in growth control. To more precisely convey our results, we use “actomyosin activity” or “actomyosin contractility” instead of “mechanical tension” or “cell tension” in the revised manuscript. We also modified the Title of the paper to better convey this point.</p><p><italic>4) The paper demonstrates a linkage between spectrins and the role of actomyosin in regulating Hippo signaling, but it is not clear how the spectrin network is linked to the actomyosin cytoskeleton. What happens to the integrity of the cytoskeleton in spectrin mutants? What are the essential domains of spectrin required for this interaction? Also it is not clear where and how the parallel upstream Hippo pathways intersect</italic>.</p><p>How the spectrin and actomyosin networks are linked to each other is poorly understood in any epithelial system. We agree with the reviewers that this is an important question but feel that addressing this question is beyond the scope of the current paper. As suggested by the reviewers, we have examined the integrity of cytoskeleton in spectrin mutant cells and did not observe any gross abnormality (data added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J-J’</xref>).</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that understanding how the parallel upstream Hippo pathways intersect is important. It was recently reported that cytoskeleton tension regulates Hippo signaling through the Jub-Wts complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rauskolb et al., 2014</xref>). We examined this possibility but did not observe detectable changes in Jub-Wts complex in spectrin mutant cells. This data is added in the revision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) The data on possible spectrin function in mammalian cells is very minimal: knockdown of spectrin in a mammary cell line led to increased nuclear Yap with decreased phosphorylation at Hippo-responsive sites</italic>. <italic>Do they also see effects related to cortical tension changes in mammalian cells?</italic></p><p>Thanks for the suggestion.
