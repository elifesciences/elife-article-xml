chromosomal DNA and regulate genomic transactions, with their nuclear import and deposition involving importin-β proteins and a dedicated repertoire of histone chaperones. Previously, a histone H3-H4 dimer has been isolated bound to importin-4 (Imp4) and the chaperone ASF1, suggesting that H3 and H4 fold together in the cytoplasm before nuclear import. However, other studies have shown the existence of monomeric H3 in the nucleus, indicating a post-import folding pathway. Here, we report that the predominant importin associated with cytoplasmic H3 is importin-5 (Imp5), which hands off its monomeric cargo to nuclear sNASP. Imp5, in contrast to Imp4, binds to both H3 and H4 containing constitutively monomeric mutations and binds to newly synthesised, monomeric H3 tethered in the cytoplasm. Constitutively monomeric H3 retains its interaction with NASP, whereas monomeric H4 retains interactions specifically with HAT1 and RBBP7. High-resolution separation of NASP interactors shows the ‘s’ isoform but not the ‘t’ isoform associates with monomeric H3, whilst both isoforms associate with H3-H4 dimers in at least three discrete multi-chaperoning complexes. In vitro binding experiments show mutual exclusivity between sNASP and Imp5 in binding H3, suggesting direct competition for interaction sites, with the GTP-bound form of Ran required for histone transfer. Finally, using pulse-chase analysis, we show that cytoplasm-tethered histones do not interact with endogenous NASP until they reach the nucleus, whereupon they bind rapidly. We propose an Imp5-specific import pathway for monomeric H3 that hands off to sNASP in the nucleus, with a parallel H4 pathway involving Imp5 and the HAT1-RBBP7 complex, followed by nuclear folding and hand-off to deposition factors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>histone</kwd><kwd>nuclear import</kwd><kwd>trafficking</kwd><kwd>importin</kwd><kwd>histone chaperone</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>208801/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pardal</surname><given-names>Alonso Javier</given-names></name><name><surname>Bowman</surname><given-names>Andrew James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Import, folding, and delivery of histones to sites of incorporation in a timely manner can thus impact a broad range of genomic processes and are of great current interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burgess and Zhang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Filipescu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gurard-Levin and Almouzni, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mendiratta et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Histones are synthesised in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus associated with importin proteins (also known as karyopherins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernardes and Chook, 2020</xref>). Once in the nucleus, importins interact with RanGTP, leading to the unloading of their cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chook and Süel, 2011</xref>). Work on different organisms has cemented the notion that, despite certain redundancy, most importin–histone interactions are specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baake et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mühlhäusser et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mosammaparast et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mosammaparast et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blackwell et al., 2007</xref>). For instance, H2A and H2B have been shown to associate with importin-9 (Imp9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Padavannil et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mosammaparast et al., 2001</xref>), whereas H3 and H4 have been shown to associate with Imp4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Campos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2011</xref>) and, to a lesser extent, Imp5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2011</xref>). Similar selectivity occurs in yeast, with H3 and H4 shown to interact with homologs Kap123 and Kap121, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mosammaparast et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, in vitro H3-H4 have broader binding profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Soniat et al., 2016</xref>) and can be imported by a number of importins in reconstituted systems using isolated nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mühlhäusser et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Histone chaperones also associate promptly with newly synthesised histones, providing an environment for solubility and ensuring correct folding before targeting towards sites of DNA deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pardal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mendiratta et al., 2019</xref>). Numerous factors have been isolated in complex with H3 and H4 from cytosolic extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Groth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Campos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parthun et al., 2011</xref>); however, as many of these factors are overwhelmingly found in the nucleus under native conditions, it is not clear how well cytosolic extracts represent the true cytoplasm of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apta-Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paine et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paine et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>Nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein was first identified as an H1-binding protein expressed in testis (tNASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O’Rand et al., 1992</xref>) that also interacted with HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alekseev et al., 2005</xref>). In dividing somatic cells, a shorter splice isoform is prevalent (sNASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Richardson et al., 2000</xref>), whereas both isoforms often occur in transformed cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>). Subsequently, NASP has been shown to interact predominantly with H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Groth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Campos and Reinberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cook et al., 2011</xref>). NASP displays multivalent interactions with its histone cargo, binding to a peptide epitope at the C-terminus of H3 via a canonical TPR–peptide interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bao et al., 2022</xref>), and to an N-terminal region of H3 via a site on the surface of the TPR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cook et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). The latter interaction is structurally compatible with H3-H4 dimer binding in conjunction with ASF1. However, the TPR-H3 C-terminal peptide interaction is structurally exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bowman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). These structural analyses may partly explain why NASP binds a superstoichiometric amount of H3 over H4; that is, NASP binds to both an H3 monomeric and an H3-H4 dimeric pool of histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apta-Smith et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite significant investigation, it is still not clear where, and in association with what factors, folding of newly synthesised H3-H4 occurs in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pardal et al., 2019</xref>). Isolation of an H3-H4 dimer bound to Imp4 and ASF1 in cytosolic extracts has been accepted as evidence for H3 and H4 folding in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Campos et al., 2015</xref>). However, it has been shown that such extracts often contain soluble nucleoplasmic components due to the difficulty in rupturing the plasma membrane whilst leaving the nuclear membrane intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apta-Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paine et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paine et al., 1983</xref>), and thus how these extracts relate to the cytoplasm is not clear. H3 and H4 tethered in the cytoplasm immediately after translation remain monomeric and do not fold with their endogenous counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apta-Smith et al., 2018</xref>), whilst superstoichiometric binding of H3 by NASP suggests the presence of a stable monomeric pool of H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apta-Smith et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, monomeric histones serve as effective substrates for nuclear import in isolated nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mühlhäusser et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting a monomeric substrate can be recognised by importins, at least in permeabilised cells.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the interactome of histones H3 and H4 using constitutive monomeric mutants and post-synthesis trapping using the RAPID-release approach. We identify Imp5 as a primary binder of monomeric H3 and H4 in the cytoplasm, with histone-specific interactions maintained by a number of histone chaperones. Fractionation of NASP-associated complexes revealed a stable NASP-H3 monomer population, roughly equal in size to that of NASP-H3-H4-containing complexes. NASP and Imp5 binding are mutually exclusive, with in vitro experiments showing RanGTP is necessary for hand-off to occur. Lastly, we show that NASP associates with H3 rapidly after its import, suggesting it is a receptor for monomeric H3 after transfer from Imp5. These findings support a model in which newly synthesised H3 and H4 are imported as monomers bound to Imp5 and fold in the nucleus once associated with their histone chaperones.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Constitutively monomeric H3 and H4 translocate to the nucleus and retain binding to a subset of histone chaperones and importins</title><p>To probe factors that interact with monomeric histones, we designed mutations that preclude folding of the heterodimer, trapping histones in their otherwise transient, post-synthesis state. As any mutation may omit potential binders, two divergent strategies were taken: (1) breaking the α2 helix of the histone fold domain by insertion of three glycine residues (helix-breaker mutations [HB]) and (2)- disruption of the histone fold by substituting three hydrophobic core residues (fold-disruptor mutations [FD]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>H3 and H4 dimerisation mutants translocate to the nucleus but do not incorporate into chromatin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Positions of fold-disruptor (FD) substitutions (asterisks) and helix-breaker (HB) insertions (brackets).

Both sets of mutants showed nuclear fluorescence in interphase cells, demonstrating that they are import-competent, but did not colocalise to mitotic chromosomes, suggesting that they are not incorporated into chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We further tested chromatin incorporation using fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Chromatinised histones should turnover very slowly, whilst soluble histones should recover almost immediately. Indeed, we found that while recovery of WT histones in the bleached region was slow, recovery of mutant histones occurred within seconds. We therefore conclude that non-dimerising mutants of H3 and H4 are imported into the nucleus, but are not incorporated into chromatin.</p><p>To test whether the mutants can fold with their endogenous counterpart, we purified C-terminal eGFP fusions using single-step, GFP-Trap pulldowns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), using eGFP fluorescence to ensure equal loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As endogenous histones are unusually small, they are well-resolved from other interacting proteins and can be unambiguously identified by Coomassie staining after SDS-PAGE. Whilst WT H3.1-eGFP pulled down H4, and H4-eGFP pulled down H3, mutant histones failed to pull down any of their endogenous counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate the associations of mutant histones, we performed Western blots, probing the pulldowns with antibodies for a number of known interacting factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Whilst WT H3 interacted with the full cohort of probed histone chaperones, H3 mutants only interacted with NASP (both s and t isoforms) and Imp5, but surprisingly not Imp4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). H4 similarly lost the majority of its interacting proteins, retaining only the HAT1 complex; HAT1 and RBBP7 (RbAp46) and Imp5, but not Imp4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Taken together, these findings show that constitutively monomeric mutants are imported into the nucleus, show differences in their chaperone profiles, but share the common binding of Imp5 over Imp4.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Interactomes of histone monomer mutants</title><p>To unbiasedly identify factors interacting with monomeric H3 and H4, we performed affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1 fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 1 and 2</xref>).

Associated complexes were affinity captured using GFP-Trap resin before separation on either a glycerol gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) or by native PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). SDS-PAGE analysis of gradient fractions revealed an sNASP-H3 monomer complex that could be unambiguously separated from other H3-H4 containing complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, fractions 6–8, arrows). Western blotting confirmed the presence of sNASP and H3 in this complex, and the absence of H4, in addition to the absence of co-chaperones HAT1, RBBP7, ASF1A, and ASF1B, all of which eluted with the H3-H4 dimer displaying the H4K5Ac mark of newly synthesised histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, UBR7 came down with sNASP, but did not migrate with the main sNASP-H3 species, as may be expected from our monomeric histone mutant analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), but overlapped with the broad sNASP co-chaperone peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>Native PAGE resulted in greater separation compared to glycerol gradient centrifugation, with individual bands representing distinct complexes being observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To identify components of each band, further separation in a second dimension under denaturing conditions was performed before staining with Coomassie or probing by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Free sNASP is clearly visible as the major species in band 3, with partially degraded versions as minor species in bands 1 and 2. sNASP-bound H3, without H4, migrated as a separate species in band 5 (arrow), whereas H3-H4 and co-chaperones eluted in various species from bands 6–11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>Curiously, a minor, higher molecular weight band was detected in the anti-NASP Western blot under a long exposure, which runs at a size indicative of the tNASP isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This was intriguing as only the shorter sNASP isoform was expressed as the eGFP-fusion and may relate to a low level of dimerisation with the endogenous protein, which has been suggested from the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2021</xref>) and biochemical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Campos et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, only the s, and not the t, isoform co-migrated with the H3 monomer band. To investigate this further, we used an HEK293-F CRISPR knock-in cell line to separate complexes from both isoforms under endogenous expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). As expected, the CRIPSR knock-in showed similar amounts of both splice isoforms, and again only the sNASP isoform co-migrated with an H3 monomer species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, arrow), suggesting that monomer binding may be an sNASP-specific function.</p><p>To more accurately assign components to each species, bands from sNASP 1D native gels were excised and subjected to mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Label-free quantification (LFQ) of total precursor intensity for top hits (full list in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) was plotted for each band in sequence, with the corresponding profiles revealing distinct sub-complexes associated with sNASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). Band 5 was validated as containing monomeric H3 bound to sNASP without H4 and, surprisingly, UBR7. The UBR7 containing complex was estimated as roughly one-tenth of the NASP-H3 signal, which may explain the elution of UBR7 in the glycerol gradient: that is, the minor NASP-H3-UBR7 complex elutes separately from the major NASP-H3 complex on a glycerol gradient, but similarly in native PAGE. Band 7 contained peak signals for the HSC70 protein HSPA5, in addition to the histone chaperones RBBP7, ASF1A and B, and both H3 and H4, whereas band 8 contained peak signals for HSPA1A and HSPA8 together with a smaller proportion of H3 and H4. The NASP complex in band 9 contained the co-chaperones HAT1, RBBP7, and ASF1A and B, along with H3 and H4. DNAJC9 was not detected, suggesting that it does not form a complex with sNASP.</p><p>In summary, NASP forms distinct complexes containing either an H3 monomer or H3-H4 dimers, with monomeric H3 associating specifically with the s isoform. A sub-population of the NASP-H3 monomer pool is bound to the putative E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR7, previously shown to associate with H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Campos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kleiner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lambert et al., 2015</xref>) and NASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hogan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isobe et al., 2020</xref>), whilst H3-H4 dimer-bound forms split into at least three complexes that differentially contain co-chaperones HAT1, RBBP7, ASF1A-B, and/or the HSC70 family proteins HSPA1A, HSPA5, and HSPA8. Strikingly, we did not detect Imp5 in NASP-bound complexes despite it co-purifying with monomeric H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that NASP and Imp5 form mutually exclusive complexes with histones.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Imp5 and sNASP are mutually exclusive in binding H3 and require RanGTP for hand-off</title><p>We next investigated the interplay between Imp5 and sNASP binding. To prevent extraneous factors affecting our analysis, we used purified recombinant proteins reconstituted in vitro. Imp5 was able to bind equimolar concentrations of H3 and H4 when separated by size-exclusion chromatography, demonstrating a direct interaction with histones, and interacted with both monomeric histones and H3-H4 dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), as expected from its association with both WT and monomeric mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>As sNASP and Imp5 elution overlapped in size-exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we used glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation to separate the two species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).

Interestingly, Imp5-H3 and sNASP eluted in separate fractions, suggesting direct competition for binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In the reverse experiment where Imp5 was added to the NASP-H3 complex and equilibrated for 3 hr on ice, Imp5 was able to strip sNASP of its histone, with almost all H3 co-fractionating with Imp5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This suggests that, firstly, as pre-assembled complex was used as input, NASP-H3 has a dissociation rate significantly below the incubation time for competition (3 hr), secondly, Imp5 has a significantly higher dissociation constant than NASP towards monomeric H3, and thirdly, the dissociation of Imp5-H3 in vivo likely requires additional factors, such as release by RanGTP, rather than being mediated by direct competition.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>H3 binding by Imp5 and sNASP is mutually exclusive and relies on RanGTP for histone transfer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Imp5-H3 reconstituted complex was purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and incubated on ice (control) for 3 hr before separating through ultracentrifugation on a 5–40% glycerol gradient.

RAPID-release consists of two components: the histone cargo with a cytoplasmic tether localising to the outer mitochondrial membrane and a protease that can be locally activated through rapamycin-induced recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apta-Smith et al., 2018</xref>). The system is highly adaptable and can be modified to study both localisation and interactions using appropriate functional tags such as fluorescent proteins and/or proximity ligation tags, such as APEX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Firstly, to test the dynamic nature of Imp5’s association with tethered H3, we released H3-mCherry in the presence of co-expressed eGFP-Imp5. The colocalisation observed under static conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>) disappeared when rapamycin was added to the cells, with H3 being imported rapidly and Imp5 remaining in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, top), as quantified by the reduction in Pearson’s R value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, bottom, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>), suggesting that the Imp5-H3 interaction is cytoplasm-specific, and that hand-off to the nuclear chaperoning machinery is a rapid event.</p><p>Secondly, to address which factors associate with tethered H3 proteome-wide, we incorporated an APEX2 tag into the tethered construct in a doxycycline-inducible FRT HeLa cell line. The APEX2 peroxidase allows for time-resolved, fast proximity biotinylation, requiring the xenobiotic biotin-phenol as a substrate and the addition of hydrogen peroxide for 1 min as catalyser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lam et al., 2015</xref>). Preliminary analysis showed that the APEX fusion presented slower release kinetics when compared to H3-eGFP alone, possibly due to the increase in steric hindrance derived from a considerably larger fusion construct, with the majority of tethered H3 being released 60 min after addition of rapamycin, and all being released by 120 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>). We performed proximity ligation reactions in triplicate at 0 min (cytoplasmic interactions), 10 min (mixed), and 120 min (nuclear interactions) after rapamycin addition, allowing a 1 min labelling window. After quenching, biotinylated peptides were isolated under denaturing conditions. In this way, ideally only interactions that occurred in the cell and not during post-lysis procedures were recorded.</p><p>The 0 min and 10 min datasets were very similar, owing to cleavage of the H3-eGFP-APEX2 tag being slower than the APEX2-free version (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), restricting our analysis to 0 and 120 min, relating to cytoplasmic and nuclear interactions, respectively. To control for unspecific interactions, we filtered our results against a control comprised of tethered APEX without H3. Enrichment in the nucleus or cytoplasm was visualised in a volcano plot by plotting the LFQ ratio against a probability value derived from three biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata4 fig5sdata5">Figure 5—source data 4 and 5</xref>), with the triplicate LFQ scores for specific hits plotted individually alongside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Colouring hits based on their nuclear localisation, as determined by the Human Protein Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/">https://www.proteinatlas.org/</ext-link>), revealed annotated cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins enriched at 0 min, and annotated nuclear proteins present at 120 min, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p>Both Imp4 and Imp5 were detected bound to H3 in the cytoplasm, but Imp5 was ∼100-fold enriched over Imp4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>), demonstrating that at its endogenous level Imp5 is the primary importin associated with cytoplasmically tethered H3. NASP was only detectable after H3 had translocated to the nucleus, as were other known histone chaperones such as RBBP7, RBBP4 (RbAp48), and MCM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata5">Figure 5—source data 5</xref>), supporting our previous findings that NASP interacts with histones in the nucleus and not in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apta-Smith et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, we detected the HSC70 family member HSPA8, which bound to H3 comparably across the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>), suggesting a compartment-independent role for this chaperone. Histone H4, as a common contaminant, was identified at similar levels across samples including the tethered APEX control, suggesting affinity for the tag or resin, and had to be excluded from analysis. In summary, in situ methods identify Imp5 as the major H3 binding importin in vivo, with NASP binding H3 only once it has translocated to the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>NASP binds rapidly to newly imported H3</title><p>As the APEX2-tag suppressed the cleavage rate of tethered H3 in the RAPID-release assay, we were unable to probe early events following H3 import. To address this, we removed APEX and introduced the RAPID-release system into an eGFP-NASP CRIPSR cell line, swapping the H3-eGFP for H3-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Endogenously expressed eGFP-NASP was entirely nuclear, with no enrichment over the tethered histone, further showing they do not interact in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Release of H3-mCherry by addition of rapamycin followed similar kinetics to previously described H3-EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apta-Smith et al., 2018</xref>), resulting in a half-maximum cleavage at around 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Unlike Imp5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), association could not be inferred from the microscopy alone as H3-mCherry is diffuse in the nucleus after release, similar to NASP. To address this, we performed co-IPs at 10 min, 1 hr, and 24 hr intervals after histone release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) to capture the interaction. Interestingly, H3’s association with NASP peaked at the 10 min time point, when the nucleus experiences the highest surge of the released histone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, red arrows), strongly suggesting that NASP associates with H3 as it enters the nucleus. Association with H3 was also present at later time points, with 24 hr likely to represent an equilibrium between soluble and chromatin-bound state. This suggests that NASP can also interact with post-nucleosomal histone and is not necessarily limited to the interaction with incoming, newly synthesised H3. Taken together, these findings suggest that NASP is the predominant nuclear receptor for H3 monomers via a rapid hand-off event from Imp5.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>NASP binds rapidly to newly imported H3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design combining a histone pulse with co-immunoprecipitation.

Several studies have identified Imp4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jasencakova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Campos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ask et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Campos et al., 2015</xref>), but also Imp5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mühlhäusser et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2011</xref>), as interacting with histones H3 and H4. In this study, we provide evidence that Imp5 is the primary importin bound to H3 when detected by in situ methods, and that, in contrast to Imp4, Imp5 interacts preferentially with a monomer of H3.</p><p>Due to the lack of structural information regarding Imp5’s interaction with histones, it is not immediately clear why there is a functional difference in their binding. A recent structure of Imp4 in complex with H3-H4 and ASF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bernardes et al., 2022</xref>) agrees with our finding that Imp4 does not interact with monomeric H3 and H4 mutants, in that, although Imp4 interacts predominantly with the N-terminal region of H3, it also makes contacts with the histone fold domain of H4. This is in contrast to Imp9’s interaction with its H2A-H2B cargo, where it fully encapsulates an H2A-H2B dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Padavannil et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, whilst a divergent histone interaction between Imp4 and Imp5 should not be ruled out, it seems likely that Imp5 binds to H3 and H4 in a similar way as Imp4, but potentially with more emphasis on the H3 N-terminal region, having lost the necessity for an H3-H4 dimer substrate.</p><p>Imp5 binding to H3 precludes NASP interaction, both in proteomic analyses and in in vitro binding experiments, with the nuclear localisation of NASP suggesting NASP acts downstream of Imp5 in the histone chaperoning pathway. The TPR domain of NASP has two distinct interaction sites with histone H3: an H3 N-terminal binding surface and an H3α3-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bowman et al., 2017</xref>). Overlapping binding sites likely explains the H3 N-terminal competition between importin and chaperone that we see; however, if this were the only Imp5 interaction site, one might expect NASP to remain bound through the H3α3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bao et al., 2022</xref>). Additional interactions between Imp5 and the histone fold domain of H3 could be one explanation for the lack of trimeric complex. Alternatively, H3α3 binding by NASP may be more complex and require additional factors. In either case, we show it is RanGTP that provides the switch necessary for release of H3 from the importin, which is in contrast to Imp9-H2A-H2B, where RanGTP alone was insufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Padavannil et al., 2019</xref>), highlighting further diversity amongst importin-β proteins and their handling of histones.</p><p>If newly synthesised H3 and H4 are rapidly imported into the nucleus as monomers bound to Imp5, what is the role of the long-established Imp4-H3-H4-ASF1 complex? The most likely explanation would be a parallel pathway for importing H3 and H4 that have folded in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Campos and Reinberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2011</xref>). An alternative scenario could be that Imp4 recognises post-nuclear H3-H4-ASF1, promoting the re-import of H3-H4 dimers that may have escaped. Indeed, the H3-H4-ASF1 complex would be small enough to transit the nuclear pore passively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frey et al., 2018</xref>), with ASF1, unlike NASP, not containing a nuclear localisation sequence.</p><p>The necessity to sequester monomeric histones in the nucleus may relate to the folding kinetics of H3-H4. In vitro studies suggest that H3-H4 folding is the rate-limiting step in the dimerisation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banks and Gloss, 2004</xref>), with a millisecond timescale comparable to that of nuclear pore transit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kubitscheck et al., 2005</xref>). NASP may therefore be regarded as having a ‘holdase’ function, as has been suggested for the ATP-independent small heat shock protein family of molecular chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jakob et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mymrikov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ecroyd, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Taipale et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mogk and Bukau, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reinle et al., 2022</xref>), preventing aggregation of H3 in the nuclear milieu before encountering H4. It is interesting that it is specifically sNASP rather than tNASP that co-separates with the H3 monomer, suggesting alternative functions for these two splice isoforms. tNASP incorporates exon 8 that functionally extends the acidic region of sNASP. How this insertion mediates the differing binding profiles we see would be an interesting future question. The role of NASP as a holdase is easily reconciled with the idea of NASP overseeing a reservoir of soluble histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cook et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hormazabal et al., 2022</xref>), which would be compatible with it acting in the nucleus. In addition, the presence of NASP in downstream complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Groth et al., 2011</xref>), mediated by interactions outside of the TPR-H3 peptide interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bowman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), supports NASP guiding the transition from monomeric import to a heterodimer capable of DNA deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bowman et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The holoenzyme HAT1-RBBP7’s interaction with monomeric H4 mutants suggests that HAT1-RBBP7 may function as a counterpart to NASP-H3, accepting H4 from Imp5 in the nucleus prior to folding. In support of this, structural characterisation of the homologous Hat1p-Hat2p complex from yeast suggests that dimerisation with H3 is not necessary for interaction with H4, which is mediated predominantly with the H4 tail and α1 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2014</xref>). The HAT1-RBBP7 complex is responsible for H4K5Ac and H4K12Ac on newly synthesised histone H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Verreault et al., 1998</xref>). Interestingly, in NASP pulldowns we find histone H4K5Ac peaking in bands with sparse HAT1, suggesting a catalytic turnover of HAT1, but with retention of RBBP7, which may be related to its interactions with H3 N-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yue et al., 2022</xref>). The low levels of ASF1 detected in complex with HAT1 are notable and suggest a transitory state, potentially involving competition between the TPR domain of NASP and ASF1 for the H3α3 helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">English et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Natsume et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bao et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, we found the ubiquitin ligase UBR7 co-migrating with a NASP-H3 monomer peak. UBR7 associates with H3 and its centromeric homolog CENP-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Campos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foltz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lambert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kleiner et al., 2018</xref>), with proposed interactions occurring between its PHD finger domain and the methylated tail of H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kleiner et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, UBR7 is also responsible for H2BK120-directed monoubiquitin ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikary et al., 2019</xref>). The function of UBR7 in the context of soluble H3 is less clear and need not relate directly to the major function of the NASP-H3. Indeed, UBR7 co-migrated with sNASP and H3 in native PAGE, but did not fractionate with sNASP-H3 after glycerol gradient centrifugation, suggesting a distinct subcomplex population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). According to our label-free quantification, UBR7 was roughly one order of magnitude lower than the NASP-H3 pool, further suggesting that it may have a secondary role in histone metabolism, potentially related to histone degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cook et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hormazabal et al., 2022</xref>) or redeposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hogan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>With regards to integration with the heat shock protein folding machinery, we observe interactions with different HSC70-type chaperones, namely, HSPA8, HSPA1A-B, and HSPA5. Intriguingly, HSPA8 forms a complex with NASP and H3-H4 which is distinct from other co-chaperoning complexes, perhaps relating to the degradation of misfolded histones, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cook et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hormazabal et al., 2022</xref>). Their cross-compartment binding could also relate to the folding or re-folding of aggregated histones, as recently suggested for the HSP70 recruitment factor DNAJC9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hammond et al., 2021</xref>). We did not detect DNAJC9 associating in a co-chaperoning complex with NASP, which, along with DNAJC9’s recognition of an H3-H4 dimer, may suggest that DNAJC9 acts after NASP binding or in a parallel pathway for aggregated or misfolded dimers. The presence of HSPA8 bound to cytoplasmically tethered H3 is in agreement with previous findings that show HSP70 proteins bind to newly synthesised H3 before folding with H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Campos and Reinberg, 2010</xref>). We also detect the new histone chaperone C1QBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2021</xref>) bound to monomeric mutants of both H3 and H4. However, we do not see association with NASP, suggesting a potential upstream function of this protein. The role of these novel histone-binding factors in the histone chaperoning pathway will require further analyses to reveal their function in detail.</p><p>In summary, we propose a model in which monomeric H3 and H4 are imported into the nucleus via an Imp5-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In this model, H3 and H4 are transferred to NASP and HAT1-RBBP7, respectively, dimerising in the nucleus rather than the cytoplasm. The ability to form stable nuclear pools of monomeric histones would provide an additional level of contingency for counteracting imbalances in histone supply, enabling a soluble reservoir of histone to be maintained under adverse cellular conditions.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for nuclear translocation of histones H3 and H4 as monomers and processing in the nucleus Imp5 imports histone H3 and H4 as monomers whilst Imp4 has a preference for dimers, albeit with some redundancy.</title><p>Upon nuclear translocation, RanGTP induces cargo dissociation with H3 being transferred to sNASP and H4 to the HAT1 complex. These chaperones may have a holdase function that buffers imbalances in individual histone supply. H3 and H4 fold and enter the deposition pathway via a number of distinct NASP-bound complexes.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81755-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>This study introduces new approaches to address the transient nature of soluble histones. The non-dimerising mutants greatly increase the pool of soluble histones for analysis, but could lead to non-physiological interactions. This does not seem to be an issue in this study as both mutants and wild type have overlapping interactomes, with mutants losing binding partners relative to the wild type rather than gaining. RAPID-release combined with APEX2 allows labelling in living cells in intact compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lam et al., 2015</xref>). However, it produces higher concentrations of cytoplasmic H3 in the proximity to the OMM than would naturally occur, which may drive non-specific interactions to some degree. In addition, proximity-dependent biotinylation protocols suffer from promiscuous labelling biased towards ubiquitous factors, as well as peptide masking by naturally biotinylated proteins, potentially limiting interactome analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gingras et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim and Roux, 2016</xref>). Our results with H4 non-dimerising mutants imply that the HAT1 complex functions in parallel to sNASP-H3. However, an H4-HAT1 complex has yet to be isolated from cell extracts. Whether this is due to a transient or weaker interaction that does not survive biochemical extraction, or whether a monomeric H4 population represents the limiting factor for histone H3-H4 dimerisation, is still to be determined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

and Gibson assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gibson, 2009</xref>). All constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing. The open-reading frame from Imp5 isoform 1 (UniProt identifier: O00410-1) was amplified from HeLa cDNA and ligated into pEGFP-C1. For bacterial protein expression, Imp5 was re-cloned into pGEX-6P1 (Cytiva). (His)<sub>6</sub>-sNASP, H3, and H4 histones constructs have been detailed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bowman et al., 2017</xref>). The RAPID-release plasmids were used as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apta-Smith et al., 2018</xref>). In order to contain the two-component RAPID-release system in a single vector, the tethered cassette (H3.2mCherry-TVMVcsx2-FRB-OMP25) and the protease cassette (FKBP12-TVMV-AI) were cloned either side of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). CRISPR knock-in cell lines were obtained following the D10ACas9 nickase using the paired guide RNAs protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ran et al., 2013</xref>). For the homologous DNA repair (HDR) template, 800 bp upstream and downstream of the start codon were amplified from genomic DNA, and ligated through Gibson assembly to EGFP and mCherry, respectively, so that an in-frame 5′ fusion to exon 1 was formed. This was cloned into pBlueScript II KS (+) as destination plasmid. Guide RNAs were prepared as described, combining two complementary oligonucleotides into D10ACas9 vector pX461-PSPCas9N(BB)–2A-GFP (Addgene #48140). For the inducible expression of H3-APEX-GFP, APEX2 was inserted between the H3 and GFP cassettes in the RAPID release vector pH3-eGFP<sup>TVMVcsx2</sup>-FRB-OMP25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apta-Smith et al., 2018</xref>) and subcloned into pcDNAFRT/TO (Thermo) plasmid for recombination in the HeLa Flp-In T-REx system.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jerry L Workman as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hongda Huang (Reviewer #2); Eric Campos (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The article is interesting because it touches on the underappreciated handling of new histones as monomers, and explains how the monomeric histones are imported into the nucleus. It is also interesting from a molecular point of view because histone monomers may perhaps add an additional regulatory mechanism by which different H3 variants are assembled with H4 at the right time (perhaps something for the authors to look into in future studies).</p><p>The goal of showing how monomeric histones are handled is achieved, but their interpretation of previously published results is too often dismissed through hand waving (e.g., subcellular fractionations are inherently flawed), or speculative (untested) statements (e.g., the H3-H4-ASF1-Imp4 complex previously identified by various groups, represents nuclear histones that diffused out of the nucleus). There are important prior findings that would also be interesting to discuss (some examples are listed below). That said, it should be emphasized that the authors' findings are novel and very interesting.</p><p>Experimental Recommendations:</p><p>1. Figure 3: The level of protein overexpression should be indicated. If Figure S2E shows a western from cell extracts (it presumably is, but the panel is not included in the figure legend), there is then a high degree of overexpression, which should be discussed.</p><p>2. Figure 3D: There are multiple bands on the silver-stained gel with a molecular weight near that of the band labeled as sNASP, but they don't all have the same migration pattern on the glycerol gradient. One of these bands should be UBR7 but were any of the other bands NASP as well (if not, what were they)?</p><p>3. It may be worth showing more of the matching western blot (cropped very close to the sNASP signal) to show if any other NASP bands appeared below (or not).</p><p>Recommendations regarding interpretation and points of discussion:</p><p>4. The cytoplasmic pool of histones is very low, which is why prior biochemical purifications from the cytoplasm started with large amounts of extracts. Yes, subcellular fractionations suffer from some cross-contamination, but that does not explain why histones isolated from cytoplasmic sNASP largely lacked PTMs seen in nucleosomal histones (MS analysis in the cited NSMB 2010).</p><p>5. Speculation on ASF1-Imp4 solely associating with evicted nucleosomal histones that diffuse to the cytoplasm is not particularly convincing. That would require formal testing, and it could very well be that there is more than one way to import histones into the nucleus.</p><p>6. Figure 3E-G: It's curious that the majority of sNASP was not associated with any histones. Could this be due to the overexpression?</p><p>7. How do HSPA8 and other prior data fit into the monomeric histone model? Do you, for example, foresee monomeric histones being modified on ribosomes as demonstrated by the Loyola lab, folded by HSP8, and directly transferred to Imp5?</p><p>8.- The pitfalls of protein overexpression/co-overexpression, following mutant histones, and of artificially tethering large amounts of histones to the mitochondrial outer membrane could be better discussed (these are really cool techniques, but they of course have their limitations).</p><p>9. Similarly, overexpressed, mitochondrial-tethered APEX2-tagged protein should not be said to represent 'endogenous conditions'. (Though it certainly is a great use of technology!)</p><p>10. Discuss some of the limitations, especially regarding the existence of a soluble pool of monomeric H4 and their functional relevance in vivo.</p><p>11. RBBP7 and RBBP4 are also called RBAP46 and RBAP48, respectively.

We have addressed the issues raised and have submitted a revised version detailing our changes, which we hope will satisfy the reviewers’ concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experimental Recommendations:</p><p>1.

Figure S2E is indeed a western from whole cell extracts, but it is from the CRISPR eGFP knock in HeLa cell line shown in panels A, B, C, and D of the same figure. The legend was erroneously truncated in the version submitted, a full legend explaining the figure is now included in the revised version Figure 3 - figure supplement 2. In addition, we have now included a new supplementary figure (new Figure 3 -figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript) showing the level of protein expression in transiently transfected HEK293-F cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 3D: There are multiple bands on the silver-stained gel with a molecular weight near that of the band labeled as sNASP, but they don't all have the same migration pattern on the glycerol gradient. One of these bands should be UBR7 but were any of the other bands NASP as well (if not, what were they)?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer points to several bands around the predominant sNASP species that differ in elution profiles. These most likely represent the co-chaperoning factors identified in the mass spec analysis (HAT1 (49.5 kDa), RBBP7 (47.8 kDa), UBR7 (48 kDa), and HSP70 proteins). As they all migrate at similar positions in SDS-PAGE, we performed western blots to identify a number of them individually. These complexes migrate with H3-H4, and are thus likely co-chaperoning complexes of NASP which have been identified previously by others, and which we separate at a higher resolution in Figure 3E and G. We think we may have caused confusion by omitting a label indicating which panels were western blots within Figure 3D (although it was noted in the legend). To address this, we have added a label to the lefthand side of the figure in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It may be worth showing more of the matching western blot (cropped very close to the sNASP signal) to show if any other NASP bands appeared below (or not).</p></disp-quote><p>The full uncropped western blot for this figure (along with other westerns) is shown in the supporting material file. We do see some minor lower molecular weight bands on a long exposure. However, these most likely represent low level proteolytic degradation due to NASP having significant disordered regions. We have now shown a larger portion of the cropped area in the main Figure 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations regarding interpretation and points of discussion:</p><p>4. The cytoplasmic pool of histones is very low, which is why prior biochemical purifications from the cytoplasm started with large amounts of extracts. Yes, subcellular fractionations suffer from some cross-contamination, but that does not explain why histones isolated from cytoplasmic sNASP largely lacked PTMs seen in nucleosomal histones (MS analysis in the cited NSMB 2010).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s referenced work that sNASP-bound histones do not contain nucleosomal modifications. In our eyes the question is not whether these cytoplasmic or nucleosomal, but whether they are cytoplasmic or nucleoplasmic. Immunostaining and GFP fusions show that NASP is nuclear, whereas cell fractionation shows it is cytosolic. We attempted to reconcile this in Apta-smith et al., 2018. Our results here agree with the work of Campos et al., 2010, in that NASP is an early binder of newly synthesised H3, interacting before ASF1 and HAT1-RBBP7, but we propose that this happens in the nucleus as NASP is an overwhelmingly nuclear protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Speculation on ASF1-Imp4 solely associating with evicted nucleosomal histones that diffuse to the cytoplasm is not particularly convincing. That would require formal testing, and it could very well be that there is more than one way to import histones into the nucleus.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we have emphasised this too much in the discussion and model, and, although it is a possibility, we don’t provide any evidence for it. We have removed this from the model (Figure 7) and represented it more clearly in the text in the revised discussion, and curtailed our speculation whilst still indicating it as a possible explanation:</p><p>Discussion, page 10:</p><p>“If newly synthesised H3 and H4 are rapidly imported into the nucleus as monomers bound to Imp5, what is the role of the long-established Imp4-H3-H4-ASF1 complex? The most likely explanation would be a parallel pathway for importing H3 and H4 that have folded in the cytoplasm {campos_new_2010, alvarez_sequential_2011}. An alternative scenario could be that Imp4 recognises post-nuclear H3-H4-ASF1, promoting the re-import of H3-H4 dimers that may have escaped. Indeed, the H3-H4-ASF1 complex would be small enough to transit the nuclear pore passively {frey_surface_2018}, with ASF1, unlike NASP, not containing a nuclear localisation sequence.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 3E-G: It's curious that the majority of sNASP was not associated with any histones. Could this be due to the overexpression?</p></disp-quote><p>It is an interesting observation. We don’t think it is due to overexpression per se, as the CRISPR eGFP knock-in (which should represent close to endogenous levels of NASP driven by its endogenous promoter) had a significant proportion of free sNASP compared to histone-bound sNASP (Figure 3G). The reviewer is correct, however, in that this may be exacerbated somewhat in the overexpression line used for proteomic analysis (Figure 3E). To address this, we have performed an anti-NASP western blot on the HEK293-F cells overexpressing eGFP-sNASP and find that the level of expression is modest compared the endogenous level. This is represented as a new Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><p>As the complex profiles are very similar between Figure 3E (overexpression) and Figure 3G (endogenous) we don’t think the over-expression is affecting complex formation, whose characterisation was the purpose of this figure, but may have effects on the bulk levels of soluble histone as seen in Cook et al., 2011. In our eyes it would make sense that chaperoning proteins are in excess of their histone substrate so that there is significant room to buffer fluctuations in free histone levels, especially upon, for example, acute replication stress as has been shown by others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. How do HSPA8 and other prior data fit into the monomeric histone model? Do you, for example, foresee monomeric histones being modified on ribosomes as demonstrated by the Loyola lab, folded by HSP8, and directly transferred to Imp5?</p></disp-quote><p>The role of HSPA8 and other HSP70 family chaperones in histone folding pathway is interesting, but in our eyes these interactions are difficult to interpret as they occur in numerous complexes and may rather relate to the likelihood of hydrophobic regions of histones being exposed in any one complex rather than a predetermined pathway. Campos et al., 2010 and Alvarez et al., 2011 isolated HSP70 proteins in complex with monomeric H3, with our APEX2 data showing HSPA8 (HSP70) associates with monomeric H3 tethered in the cytoplasm, reinforcing these findings. However, we also see it binding to NASP-H3-H4 complexes alongside other HSP70 members (HSPA1A and HSPA5). Further, recent findings from the Groth lab have identified DNAJC9 as a specific histone binding protein which aids in the recruitment of HSP70 proteins to histones (Hammond et al., 2021). We have now discussed these points in the paragraph starting -</p><p>“With regards to integration with the heat-shock protein folding machinery, The presence of HSPA8 bound to cytoplasmically tethered H3 is in agreement with previous findings that show HSP70 proteins bind to newly synthesised H3 before folding with H4 {campos_new_2010, alvarez_sequential_2011}.”</p><p>In terms of the Loyola lab’s finding that H3 K9 is methylated on ribosomes by SETDB1, we don’t see any reason why this would not also be the case for H3 imported as a monomer via the Imp5 pathway. But we also don’t see any reason why it would be necessary for import as it is predominantly a pre-deposition mark for heterochromatin, and therefore didn’t explicitly expand on it in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.- The pitfalls of protein overexpression/co-overexpression, following mutant histones, and of artificially tethering large amounts of histones to the mitochondrial outer membrane could be better discussed (these are really cool techniques, but they of course have their limitations).</p></disp-quote><p>We accept that the manuscript may not have proportionally discussed the limitations of the techniques employed now included a new subsection “Limitations of the Study” on these limitations at the end of the “Discussion” section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.
