The process begins when the small (40S) subunit of the ribosome binds eIF1, eIF1A, eIF2, GTP, Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>, eIF3, and eIF5, to assemble the 43S PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dever et al., 2016</xref>). eIF1 and eIF1A bind near the P and A sites of the 40S subunit, respectively, and promote loading of the ternary complex (TC) comprising eIF2, GTP, and Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>. eIF5 is the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for eIF2 and stimulates GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Paulin et al., 2001</xref>); however, irreversible release of the inorganic phosphate is inhibited at this stage of the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Algire et al., 2005</xref>). The heteromultimeric factor eIF3 has multiple interactions with the PIC and is involved in nearly every step of translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aitken and Lorsch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Valásek, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The 43S PIC is assembled in an ‘open’ conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fekete et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Llácer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maag et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Passmore et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pestova et al., 1998a</xref>) that can bind an mRNA in a process called mRNA recruitment. eIF3 and a set of mRNA recruitment factors – eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4B – facilitate this step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mitchell et al., 2011</xref>). After initial mRNA loading, the PIC remains in an open conformation and scans the 5'- untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA for the start codon, usually an AUG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>). Recognition of the start codon by the Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> triggers a series of key steps – eviction of eIF1, movement of the C-terminal tail of eIF1A out of the P site, and subsequent release of the previously-hydrolyzed inorganic phosphate by eIF2 – ultimately shifting the PIC from an ‘open’ to a ‘closed’ conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dever et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Llácer et al., 2015</xref>). The 48S PIC thus formed is committed to the selected start codon and joining with the large (60S) subunit of the ribosome to form the final 80S initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Acker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dever et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Whereas a combination of genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches have illuminated the molecular details of PIC formation and start-codon selection, the intermediate events of mRNA recruitment are less well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aitken and Lorsch, 2012</xref>). We demonstrated that the individual absence of eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF3, or the eIF4G•eIF4E complex greatly reduces the extent, the rate or both of mRNA recruitment to the PIC in a <italic>S. cerevisiae in vitro</italic> reconstituted translation initiation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitchell et al., 2010</xref>). Structural and biochemical work indicates that eIF3 binds on the solvent side of the 40S subunit but its five core subunits have multiple interactions with other components of the PIC including distinct interactions with the mRNA near the entry and exit channels of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aitken et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Llácer et al., 2015</xref>). Also, yeast eIF4B binds directly to the 40S ribosomal subunit, modulates the conformation of the ribosome near the mRNA entry channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Walker et al., 2013</xref>), and has a functional interaction with eIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Andreou and Klostermeier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harms et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Walker et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, eIF4A has not been shown to bind stably to the PIC but forms a heterotrimeric complex with eIF4G and eIF4E (eIF4A•4G•4E), collectively referred to as eIF4F, which interacts with the mRNA.</p><p>mRNA can form stable secondary structures via local base-pairing of complementary sequences but also has a natural tendency to form global structure, marked by a combination of entangled or compacted conformations inherent to polymers longer than their persistence lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2012</xref>) and the sum of many, possibly dynamic, individual base-pairing and other (tertiary) interactions between both neighboring and distant parts of the molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Halder and Bhattacharyya, 2013</xref>). Hairpin structures in the 5'-UTR are generally inhibitory to translation initiation and the prevailing model of mRNA recruitment suggests that eIF4A – localized to the 5'-end via the eIF4G–eIF4E–5'-m<sup>7</sup>G-cap chain of interactions – unwinds these hairpins to allow PIC attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Merrick, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pelletier and Sonenberg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ray et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Svitkin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yoder-Hill et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>eIF4A is a DEAD-box RNA-dependent ATPase thought to act as an RNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Andreou and Klostermeier, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Linder et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schreier et al., 1977</xref>). It cooperatively binds RNA and ATP with no apparent RNA sequence specificity, although, recent ribosome profiling experiments suggested that eIF4A may have a preference for binding polypurine sequences in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwasaki et al., 2016</xref>). eIF4A is thought to disrupt structures by local strand separation, possibly by bending the RNA duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Henn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Linder and Jankowsky, 2011</xref>). Intermediate states of the catalytic cycle may have higher affinities for RNA; however, ATP hydrolysis to ADP causes a decrease in affinity of eIF4A for RNA, which may allow recycling of the factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Andreou and Klostermeier, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jankowsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lorsch and Herschlag, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lorsch and Herschlag, 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pause et al., 1993</xref>). Several studies demonstrated that both yeast and mammalian eIF4A are able to disrupt short RNA duplexes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rajagopal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ray et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rogers et al., 1999</xref>) and more recent work suggests that mammalian eIF4A can unwind a large hairpin when the RNA is stretched between two tethers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">García-García et al., 2015</xref>). Also, sensitivity to inhibition of translation by a dominant negative mutant of mammalian eIF4A is correlated with the degree of secondary structure in the 5'-UTR, supporting a role for eIF4A in removing structures from the 5'-end of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Svitkin et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, eIF4A is a slow helicase when unwinding stable duplexes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">García-García et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lorsch and Herschlag, 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rajagopal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rogers et al., 1999</xref>) and it is unclear whether it could support in vivo rates of translation initiation in the range of 10 min<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Palmiter, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Siwiak and Zielenkiewicz, 2010</xref>) if this is its function. Several more potent helicases appear to promote translation by resolving stable structural elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Parsyan et al., 2011</xref>), raising the possibility that eIF4A instead performs a distinct role during initiation on all mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). A study in yeast employing ribosome profiling to compare the in vivo effects of inactivating eIF4A versus Ded1 – a considerably more robust DEAD-box RNA helicase – demonstrated that translation of mRNAs with 5'-UTRs possessing high degrees of structure tend to be specifically dependent on Ded1, but relatively few mRNAs are similarly hyper-dependent on eIF4A, despite comparable requirements for the two helicases in maintaining global translation initiation. Consistent with this, analysis of reporter mRNAs harboring inhibitory hairpin structures indicated that yeast eIF4A is either ineffective or dispensable in the presence of Ded1 in resolving stable, local secondary structures in the 5'-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sen et al., 2015</xref>). In a separate study, minor decreases in the normally high cellular levels of yeast eIF4A also resulted in depressed global rates of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Firczuk et al., 2013</xref>), providing additional evidence that eIF4A may be important for translation of all mRNAs and must be present in excess of other components of the translational apparatus. Consistent with the idea that it acts generally rather than by disrupting specific secondary structures in 5'-UTRs, eIF4A has been shown to promote translation of an mRNA possessing a short (8 nucleotide (nt)) 5'-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blum et al., 1992</xref>) and a viral mRNA with a low degree of structure in its 5'-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Altmann et al., 1990</xref>), and to stimulate 48S PIC formation on mRNAs with little secondary structure in their 5'-UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002</xref>). Recent experiments using a fluorescence-based equilibrium binding assay indicated that eIF4A enhances the affinity of mammalian PICs for both a natural and an unstructured model mRNA, although ATP hydrolysis was only required for this effect with the natural mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sokabe and Fraser, 2017</xref>). How the helicase and ATPase activities of eIF4A, alone or as a part of eIF4F, contribute to its role in promoting initiation on diverse mRNAs remains unclear.</p><p>Here – using an in vitro translation initiation system reconstituted from purified <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> components – we examined the interplay among eIF4A, the eIF4G•eIF4E complex (hereafter referred to as ‘eIF4G•4E’), the mRNA, and the PIC in eIF4A-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis and mRNA recruitment. We monitored eIF4A ATPase in the context of the PIC and asked how eIF4A activity might be utilized for the recruitment of mRNAs possessing various degrees of structure, ranging from the natural (structured) <italic>RPL41A</italic> mRNA to short model mRNAs comprised mostly of CAA-repeats expected to lack significant structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sobczak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zuker, 2003</xref>) beyond fluctuations in polymer conformation or transient interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2012</xref>) (hereafter called ‘unstructured’ mRNA). We show eIF4A and eIF4A•4G•4E are both faster ATPases in the presence of the PIC and that this effect is independent of the stimulation provided by RNA or eIF4G•4E, but is dependent on the 3g and 3i subunits of eIF3. eIF4A increases the rate of recruitment for all mRNAs tested, ranging from the natural <italic>RPL41A</italic> mRNA to short unstructured messenger RNAs. Structures in the 5'-UTR and on the 3' side of the start codon synergistically inhibit mRNA recruitment in a manner relieved by eIF4A. Our data indicate that eIF4A can relieve inhibition of mRNA recruitment arising from structure created by elements throughout the length of the mRNA rather than only resolving secondary structures in the 5'-UTR. Overall, these results are consistent with a recent model suggesting that eIF4A may modulate the conformation of the 40S ribosomal subunit to promote mRNA recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sokabe and Fraser, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ATP hydrolysis by eIF4A promotes recruitment of the natural mRNA <italic>RPL41A</italic> as well as a short, unstructured model mRNA</title><p>To better understand how eIF4A-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis is related to the removal of RNA structure and mRNA recruitment, we compared the kinetics of recruitment of the natural mRNA <italic>RPL41A</italic> (possessing structural complexity throughout its length; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) with a 50 nucleotide (nt) model mRNA made up of CAA-repeats and an AUG codon at positions 24–26 (CAA 50-mer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aitken et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>; see RNAs 1 and 10 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Briefly, 43S PICs containing 40S, TC, eIF1, eIF1A, eIF5, and eIF3 were formed in the presence of saturating levels of eIFs 4A, 4B, 4E, and 4G (see mRNA Recruitment Assay in Materials and methods). eIF4A, 4G, and 4E are assumed to form the heterotrimeric eIF4F complex under experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitchell et al., 2010</xref>). Reactions were initiated by simultaneous addition of ATP and an mRNA labeled with a [<sup>32</sup>P]−7-methylguanosine (m<sup>7</sup>G) cap, enabling mRNA recruitment to the PICs and formation of 48S complexes. Reaction timepoints were acquired by mixing an aliquot with a 25-fold excess of a non-radioactive (‘cold’) capped mRNA identical to the labeled one in the reaction, effectively stopping further recruitment of radiolabeled mRNA. The rate of dissociation of recruited mRNAs from the PIC in the presence of the cold chase mRNA was negligible for all mRNAs in the study (data not shown). Free mRNA and 48S complexes were resolved via gel electrophoresis on a native 4% THEM polyacrylamide gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitchell et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We first compared the kinetics of recruitment for <italic>RPL41A</italic> with CAA 50-mer in the presence and absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

In contrast, in the presence of ADP, and in reactions lacking either nucleotide or eIF4A, less than 20% of <italic>RPL41A</italic> mRNA was recruited after 6 hr, indicating a dramatically lower rate that could not be measured accurately due to the low reaction endpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>).

Single turnover conditions in which the concentration of enzyme is saturating and greater than the concentration of the substrate, similar to those employed in the mRNA recruitment experiments above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), would be ideal to study the ATPase activity for comparison. However, such an approach was technically not feasible because the low affinity of yeast eIF4A for ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rajagopal et al., 2012</xref>) made it impossible to create conditions where eIF4A is saturating for ATP binding and stoichiometric to or in excess of ATP. Using saturating ATP under experimentally accessible concentrations of PIC and eIF4A led to a situation in which the first few turnovers of ATP hydrolysis produced by any possible eIF4A•PIC complexes would be below the limit of detection using either radioisotope or spectrophotometric ATPase assays. In addition, based on the high (~5 µM) concentration of eIF4A required to achieve maximal rates of mRNA recruitment, we also could not achieve a situation in which PICs were saturating over eIF4A because such concentrations of PICs are not experimentally achievable. Thus, we were not able to perform pre-steady state kinetic ATPase experiments. Instead, to inquire whether the ATPase activity of eIF4A is affected by the presence of the PIC, we used multiple turnover conditions in which [eIF4A] &lt;&lt; [ATP] in the in vitro reconstituted translation initiation system. Although steady-state kinetics do not allow direct comparison to single-turnover mRNA recruitment assays, the approach still enables detection of the effects of other components of the system on repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis by eIF4A and eIF4A•4G•4E. Thus, if the PIC in the absence of mRNA (i.e., prior to mRNA recruitment) or the presence of mRNA (i.e., during and after mRNA recruitment) promotes a state of eIF4A with altered ATPase activity, it should be possible to detect it using this approach.</p><p>ATPase was monitored with an enzyme-coupled assay in which pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase are used to regenerate ATP from ADP and, in the process, oxidize NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup>, producing a change in absorbance at 340 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bradley and De La Cruz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kiianitsa et al., 2003</xref>); (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; see Materials and methods). eIF4A is an RNA-dependent ATPase, thus the presence of mRNA stimulates the rate of ATP hydrolysis.

NADH absorbance at 340 nm was recorded every 20 s using a microplate reader.

In fact, in the presence of the PIC, eIF4G•4E only increases the k<sub>cat</sub> for eIF4A by 2.3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>; compare ‘Complete PIC’ and ‘Complete PIC – eIF4G•4E’), ~2 fold less than the effect of eIF4G•4E on eIF4A in isolation.

Eliminating the 40S subunit, eIF2, eIF3, or the 3g and 3i subunits of eIF3 in the absence of eIF4G•4E abrogated all stimulation of ATPase activity, yielding k<sub>cat</sub> values the same as those observed with eIF4A alone (~0.6 min<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, compare dark blue bar to light blue cross-hatched bars). These data suggest that stimulation of the ATPase activity of eIF4A, in the absence of eIF4G•4E, requires the complete 43S PIC and eIF3, in particular subunits 3i and 3g. This result suggests the possibility that eIF4A can interact directly with one or more components of the PIC – for example, eIF3i and 3g – independently of interactions that might be mediated by eIF4G; and its interactions with the PIC or eIF4G•4E confer comparable stimulation of eIF4A’s ATPase activity (6.0-fold vs. 4.0-fold).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>K<sub>m</sub> values suggest distinct mechanisms of eIF4A activation by the PIC components and eIF4G•4E</title><p>Formation of the eIF4A•4G•4E complex reduces the K<sub>m</sub> for ATP (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) in ATP hydrolysis by an order of magnitude, from 2500 µM to 250 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>, compare ‘4A’ to ‘4A•4G•4E’).

In summary, all four unstructured CAA-repeats mRNAs that we studied can be recruited by the PIC at appreciable levels independently of eIF4A, but eIF4A still stimulates their rates of recruitment by roughly an order of magnitude.</p><p>To probe the effects of defined, stable secondary structures on the functioning of eIF4A in mRNA recruitment, we examined 250-mer mRNAs comprising CAA-repeats throughout the sequence except for a single 21-nt insertion predicted to form a 9 bp hairpin of −10 kcal/mol stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zuker, 2003</xref>), situated in the 5'-UTR either proximal or distal to the 5'-cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, RNAs 5–6, Key; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We confirmed the presence and location of the single hairpin in RNAs 5 and 6 and absence of significant secondary structure in RNA 4 by incubating RNAs 4–6 at 26˚C with a 3'−5' RNA exonuclease, ExoT, specific for single-stranded RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deutscher et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zeng and Cullen, 2004</xref>).</p><p>To our surprise, in the absence of eIF4A, neither the cap-proximal nor the cap-distal hairpins significantly influenced the extent of recruitment, achieving endpoints between 70% and 80%, comparable to the unstructured CAA 50-mer and 250-mer RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, RNAs 5–6 vs. 1–4).

Thus, at odds with the expectation that stable structures in the 5'-UTR would impose strong obstacles to mRNA recruitment to the PIC, we found that addition of a cap-proximal or cap-distal hairpin in the 5'-UTR of an otherwise unstructured mRNA confers little or no inhibition of the extent of recruitment and only a modest reduction in the rate, in the presence or absence of eIF4A. Moreover, the observation that these hairpins in the 5'-UTR actually decrease the enhancement of the rate of mRNA recruitment provided by eIF4A relative to what we observed with the unstructured mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, RNAs 5–6 vs. 4) is not readily consistent with the idea that the factor's predominant function is to unwind stable secondary structures in the 5'-UTRs of mRNAs to facilitate PIC attachment. If this were the case, one might have expected larger rate enhancements for mRNAs with stable structures in their 5'-UTRs than for mRNAs containing little inherent structure, the opposite of what we actually observe. It is possible that eIF4A is not efficient at unwinding such stable structures, which results in a lower k<sub>max</sub> and a lower degree of stimulation.</p><p>To probe further the effects of RNA structural complexity on mRNA recruitment and eIF4A function, we examined a chimeric mRNA comprising CAA-repeats in the 5'-UTR and the natural sequence (with associated structural complexity) from <italic>RPL41A</italic> 3' of the AUG start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, RNA 7).

Thus, the hairpin insertions conferred the predicted strong inhibition of PIC recruitment and marked dependence on eIF4A in the context of the chimeric mRNA containing native <italic>RPL41A</italic> sequences, but not in an otherwise unstructured mRNA. We note however that stimulation of the recruitment rate by eIF4A (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) was considerably less than the ~60 fold and ~190 fold increases observed for the chimeric mRNA lacking a hairpin (RNA 7) and for native <italic>RPL41A</italic> (RNA 10), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, RNAs 8–9 vs. 7,10); and the k<sub>max</sub> values for mRNAs 8–9 also remain well below the values for mRNA 7 and <italic>RPL41A</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, RNAs 8–9 vs. 7 and 10). These differences might be explained by the inability of eIF4A to efficiently resolve these stable secondary structures, as already suggested above.</p><p>Comparing k<sub>max</sub> values for RNA 4 to RNAs 5–9 shows that the combined effects of structures in the 5'-UTR and 3' to the AUG (in RNAs 8 and 9) is considerably more than the additive effects of either structural element alone (in RNAs 5–7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, RNAs 4–9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Whereas structures in the 5'-UTR (RNAs 5 and 6) or 3' to the start codon (RNA 7) on their own have 2–3-fold effects on k<sub>max</sub> relative to the k<sub>max</sub> for the unstructured RNA 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>, compare k<sub>max</sub> values for RNA 4 and RNAs 5–7: 6.2 min<sup>−1</sup> vs. 2.3-3.4 min<sup>−1</sup>, respectively), combining them (RNAs 8 and 9) produces a ≥ 30 fold effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>, compare k<sub>max</sub> values for RNA 4 and RNAs 8 and 9: 6.2 min<sup>−1</sup> vs. 0.16 min<sup>−1</sup> and 0.20 min<sup>−1</sup>, respectively). Because the additive effects of structures in the 5'-UTR (RNAs 5 and 6) and structures 3' to the start codon (RNA 7) would only be ~6 fold (~2-fold X ~ 3 fold), the &gt;30 fold effect observed by combining them indicates that structures in both regions synergistically inhibit the rate of mRNA recruitment. This synergy is also reflected in the dramatically reduced recruitment endpoints of RNAs 8–9 seen in the absence of eIF4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, red bars; RNAs 4–7 vs. 8–9). It is possible that, in the absence of significant RNA structure on the 3' side of the AUG codon, PICs are able to load directly in the unstructured region containing the AUG codon located downstream of the stem loops in RNAs 5 and 6, in a manner only slightly encumbered by the stable hairpins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Agalarov et al., 2014</xref>). When the structured <italic>RPL41A</italic> mRNA is present beyond the start codon in RNAs 8 and 9, it may make this direct loading impossible, perhaps by sterically occluding or otherwise blocking access to the internal unstructured region, thereby forcing the PIC to attach near the 5'-cap and scan through the structured 5'-UTR to reach the AUG codon. This latter situation likely reflects the state of most (if not all) natural mRNAs, in which PICs do not have access to large segments of unobstructed, unstructured internal RNA on which to directly load.</p><p>The fact that eIF4A restores the extent of recruitment of RNAs 8 and 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, RNAs 8–9, black bars), albeit at relatively low recruitment rates, indicates that eIF4A can eventually resolve the synergistic inhibition produced by structures in the 5' and 3' segments of these messenger RNAs. It is noteworthy, however, that eIF4A gives considerably larger rate enhancements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) for the mRNAs harboring only native <italic>RPL41A</italic> sequences (RNAs 7 and 10) than those burdened with synthetic hairpins (RNAs 5–6 and 8–9), suggesting that eIF4A is better able to resolve the complex array of relatively less stable structures in <italic>RPL41A</italic> compared to a highly stable local structure in the 5'-UTR.</p><p>In general, mRNAs with the lowest <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf36"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">b</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">o</mml:mi><mml:mtext mathvariant="sans-serif"> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">I</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">F</mml:mi><mml:mn mathvariant="sans-serif">4</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> values had the highest <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf37"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> values and those with higher <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf38"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">b</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">o</mml:mi><mml:mtext mathvariant="sans-serif"> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">I</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">F</mml:mi><mml:mn mathvariant="sans-serif">4</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="sans-serif">A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> values had lower <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf39"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>, compare RNAs 7–10 to RNAs 1–6).

In this model, as the concentration of eIF4A is increased, it decreases the rate-limiting barrier for mRNA recruitment (left hand barriers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>) and consequently accelerates the rate of the reaction. Once this barrier is lowered below the level of the next highest barrier (right hand barriers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>), no further increase in rate will be observed (i.e., the rate plateaus and apparent saturation is achieved) because the rate becomes limited by this second, eIF4A-independent step. If the eIF4A-dependent barrier is large – for example because the mRNA is highly structured – it takes more eIF4A to get to the point at which the eIF4A-independent step becomes rate-limiting because there is more energetic distance between the two barriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In contrast, if the first barrier is smaller, as expected for mRNAs with little structure, there is less energetic distance between the two barriers and a lower concentration of eIF4A is required to reduce the eIF4A-dependent barrier to the point at which the second, eIF4A-independent barrier becomes rate-limiting, and further increases in eIF4A concentration no longer increase the rate of recruitment. To explain the differences in k<sub>max</sub> values, we posit that the second, eIF4A-independent barrier is higher for the more structured mRNAs, leading to the observed lower k<sub>max</sub> values. An alternative model that is also consistent with the data is that even at very high concentrations eIF4A cannot fully reduce the RNA unwinding barrier for the highly structured mRNAs and thus the rate saturates before this barrier reaches the level of the barrier for the eIF4A-independent step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>), leading to low k<sub>max</sub> values.

We have previously shown that the 5'-cap enforces the requirement for several eIFs, including eIF4A, in mRNA recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitchell et al., 2010</xref>) and more recent work in the mammalian system provided evidence that the 5'-cap-eIF4E-eIF4G-eIF3-40S network of interactions is required to promote mRNA recruitment via threading of the 5'-end into the 40S entry channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). As before, we monitored the kinetics of mRNA recruitment at various concentrations of eIF4A with capped or uncapped versions of mRNAs described above, including RNA 1 (CAA 50-mer), RNA 4 (CAA 250-mer), and RNA 7 (unstructured 5'-UTR with <italic>RPL41A</italic> sequence 3' of the AUG; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the k<sub>max</sub> observed with saturating eIF4A was comparable with or without the 5'-cap for RNAs 1 and 7, and was 1.5-fold lower with the cap than without it for RNA 4. In contrast, in the absence of eIF4A, the rates of recruitment for uncapped versions of the unstructured model mRNAs 1 and 4 were 3.7- and 2.5-fold higher, respectively, than the rates of the corresponding 5'-capped mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, compare 0 µM eIF4A points in the inset graphs). This effect was even more pronounced for RNA 7, containing natural mRNA sequence 3' of the AUG, which was recruited 15-fold faster when uncapped versus capped in the absence of eIF4A.

Taken together, our data indicate that even for short mRNAs with low structural complexity, the 5'-cap inhibits recruitment in the absence of eIF4A, consistent with our previous observations with a natural mRNA and our proposal that the cap serves, in part, to enforce use of the canonical mRNA recruitment pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitchell et al., 2010</xref>). This effect could be due, in part, to the 5'-cap-eIF4E interaction directing the PIC to load at the 5'-end of the mRNA and impeding it from binding directly to downstream, unstructured RNA segments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31476.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The 5'−7-methylguanosine cap inhibits mRNA recruitment in the absence of eIF4A.</title><p>Observed rates of mRNA recruitment (min<sup>−1</sup>) when eIF4A was not included in the reaction, in the presence (black bars) or absence (red bars) of the 5'-cap.

Given the natural propensity of an mRNA to form structure it is difficult to envision how an mRNA could be unwound by eIF4F and eIF4B, released into the cytoplasm and then bound by the PIC without the mRNA reforming its structure. In another proposed model, eIF4F and eIF4B could interact with the PIC, forming a ‘holo-PIC’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aitken and Lorsch, 2012</xref>) that relaxes the mRNA and attaches to it synchronously. Some support for a model in which eIF4F interacts with the PIC to promote mRNA recruitment came from hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments that indicated mammalian eIF4G binds to the 40S subunit near the eukaryotic expansion segment 6 of the 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). Other work has indicated that yeast eIF4B binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Walker et al., 2013</xref>) and modulates the conformation of the mRNA entry channel, and that mammalian eIF4B interacts with 40S subunit rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Methot et al., 1996</xref>). These results also support the idea that the eIF4 factors play roles in mRNA recruitment that require binding to the PIC. In addition, in mammals (but not <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) eIF4G interacts with eIF3, which could serve to bring the eIF4F complex onto the PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">des Georges et al., 2015</xref>). Our observation that the PIC stimulates the ATPase activity of eIF4A, both in the context of the eIF4F complex and in the absence of eIF4G•4E, indicates that eIF4A and eIF4F functionally interact with the PIC, and is consistent with the holo-PIC model. Remarkably, the 6-fold stimulation of eIF4A’s ATPase activity by the PIC observed in the absence of eIF4G•4E is comparable to the stimulation provided when eIF4A binds to eIF4G•4E to form the eIF4F complex (4–5-fold; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rajagopal et al., 2012</xref>]).</p><p>Our data indicate that the Complete PIC is required for full ATPase activation of eIF4A, with the 3g and 3i subunits of eIF3 playing a particularly important role.

On the other hand, mammalian eIF4A has also been shown to stimulate initiation in vitro on mRNAs with low degrees of 5'-UTR structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blum et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002</xref>), and it was shown to perform a critical function in 48S PIC formation on β-globin mRNA that could not be executed by other helicases (Dhx29 or Ded1) more effective than eIF4A in resolving stem-loop structures within 5'-UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abaeva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pisareva et al., 2008</xref>).

Ribosome profiling studies in yeast revealed that the vast majority of mRNAs display a similar, strong dependence on eIF4A for efficient translation, whereas mRNAs with long, structured 5'-UTRs generally exhibit a special dependence on the helicase Ded1 in addition to their general requirement for eIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sen et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, there is evidence in both mammalian and yeast systems that eIF4A has a general function in PIC attachment to mRNAs while also playing a role for particular mRNAs burdened with 5'-UTR structures. We employed the reconstituted yeast system to test this hypothesis.</p><p>We observed that ATP hydrolysis by yeast eIF4A accelerates recruitment of structured as well as unstructured mRNAs, and this acceleration does not correlate with the amount of secondary structure in the 5'-UTR. Taken together with our observation that the PIC accelerates ATP hydrolysis by eIF4A, one explanation for the ability of eIF4A to stimulate mRNA recruitment regardless of 5'-UTR structure would be that one function of eIF4A is to modulate the conformation of the 40S ribosomal subunit, as recently proposed by Sokabe and Fraser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sokabe and Fraser, 2017</xref>). For instance, ATP hydrolysis by eIF4A, stimulated at least in part by eIF3 subunits, might act to open the mRNA entry channel, allowing the PIC to engage with and/or move along the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) – similar to the proposed function of mammalian helicase Dhx29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hashem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pisareva et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31476.019</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Possible models for the mechanism of action of eIF4A in promoting mRNA recruitment to the PIC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) eIF4A modulates the conformation of the PIC to promote mRNA recruitment. In this model, binding of eIF4A•4G•4E to the PIC induces an opening of the mRNA entry channel of the 40S subunit (highlighted by red arrows), which enables mRNA binding. The ATPase activity of eIF4A might drive this opening. ATP hydrolysis might also promote loading of the message into the mRNA entry channel, concomitant with any necessary melting of structure. This model is consistent with our observations that the ATPase activity of eIF4A is stimulated by the PIC and that recruitment of unstructured mRNAs is accelerated by ATP hydrolysis by the factor. (<bold>B</bold>) A holistic model for the roles of eIF4A and eIF4F in mRNA recruitment. This model attempts to bring a variety of observations from the literature together with the data presented in this study. mRNAs have complex, often dynamic, structures due to numerous local and distant interactions (red dotted lines) as well as the inherent tendency of polymers longer than their persistence lengths to fold back on themselves. These complex global structures can occlude the 5'-ends of the mRNAs and the start codon, making it difficult for the PIC to bind and locate them. Individual eIF4A molecules might keep the mRNA in a partially-unwound state so that the 5’-end can be located by eIF4F and the PIC. ATP hydrolysis by the eIF4A molecule bound to eIF4F allows it to load the 5'-end of the mRNA into the entry channel of the 40S subunit. Loading might involve opening of the mRNA entry channel or another conformational change in the PIC and active transfer of the mRNA into the channel. After loading of the 5’-end, eIF4A•ADP dissociates from the complex. This allows the next (3’) eIF4A molecule on the mRNA to bind to eIF4G, which activates its ATPase, enabling loading of that mRNA segment and thus movement of the PIC down the message. This cycle repeats until the start codon is located. The two models presented in (<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>) are not mutually exclusive and it is possible that eIF4A, given its high cellular concentration, performs multiple tasks.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-31476-fig5-v2"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Structural complexity beyond the 5'-UTR inhibits mRNA recruitment in a manner alleviated by eIF4A</title><p>We observed that addition of native <italic>RPL41A</italic> mRNA sequence 3' of the start codon inhibits recruitment of mRNA to the PIC, even if the 5'-UTR is made up of CAA-repeats, and this inhibitory effect is ameliorated by eIF4A. This result is surprising because in the canonical model of initiation eIF4A functions to resolve structures in the 5'-UTR. We also found that, in combination, isolated hairpins in the 5'-UTR and structural complexity 3' of the AUG codon synergistically inhibit mRNA recruitment. Thus, structure created by elements beyond the 5'-UTR strongly influences the rate of mRNA recruitment to the PIC and eIF4A is able to diminish these inhibitory effects. We envision that the <italic>RPL41A</italic> sequences 3' of the AUG introduce an ensemble of relatively weak secondary or tertiary interactions that occlude the 5'-UTR and start codon and thus impede direct PIC attachment and AUG recognition, and that eIF4A can efficiently resolve these structural impediments. The <italic>RPL41A</italic> sequences might interact directly with the 5'-UTR or simply create structures that envelop it, sterically occluding access to the 5'-UTR and the start codon. In addition, RNAs longer than their persistence length inherently fold back on themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2012</xref>), which could further serve to create a steric block to the 5'-UTR. By binding to single-stranded segments, eIF4A may serve to increase their persistence length, helping to untangle the messenger RNA. It is intriguing that eIF4A was 15- to 20-fold more effective in overcoming the inhibitory effect of the <italic>RPL41A</italic> sequences versus the 5'-UTR hairpins in the RNAs containing one or the other inhibitory element (RNA 7 vs. RNAs 5 and 6). This could be explained by proposing that eIF4A is more efficient at resolving the relatively weak interactions that contribute to the overall structure of an mRNA compared to highly-stable local structures. Indeed, only a handful of native mRNAs are known to possess stable hairpin structures in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rouskin et al., 2014</xref>), yet eIF4A is essential for translation of virtually all mRNAs in vivo. Moreover, it was shown that the DEAD-box RNA helicase Ded1 rather than eIF4A is required to overcome the inhibitory effects of stable hairpin insertions on reporter mRNA translation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sen et al., 2015</xref>). Combined with these previous findings, our results support a model in which yeast eIF4A acts to disrupt moderately stable, transient interactions throughout an mRNA that sequester the mRNA 5'-UTR or start codon within the overall mRNA structure, whereas Ded1 is more effective in resolving stable, local secondary structures in the 5'-UTR or the initiation region of an mRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A holistic model for eIF4A function in mRNA recruitment</title><p>A possible model for eIF4A function that seems consistent with previous studies in both mammalian and yeast systems and the results presented here is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. This model is not mutually exclusive with that depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> in which eIF4A modulates the structure of the 40S ribosomal subunit. In the holistic model, eIF4A – which is present in large excess of ribosomes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Firczuk et al., 2013</xref>) – binds to an mRNA throughout its length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lindqvist et al., 2008</xref>) and mediates the relaxation of local structures, helping to expose the 5'-cap. The eIF4F complex associates with the cap, the 5'-end of the mRNA and the PIC. Direct loading of the PIC onto the 5'-UTR near the start codon is not possible because the start codon is still occluded within the overall structural ensemble of the mRNA and because the cap-eIF4E interaction directs the PIC to the 5'-end. Interaction of the eIF4F complex with the PIC leads to an acceleration of ATP hydrolysis by the bound eIF4A. This hydrolysis event could mediate opening of the mRNA binding channel, as suggested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, and loading of the 5'-end of the mRNA into it. It would also result in a low affinity, ADP-bound state of eIF4A that would dissociate from the mRNA, eIF4G and the PIC. During loading of the mRNA, the eIF4E-eIF4G association with the cap may be disrupted, as proposed by Pestova and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). Movement of the PIC on the mRNA would then lead to its encountering a new eIF4A molecule, which could then associate with eIF4G. Association of the mRNA-bound eIF4A with eIF4G and the PIC would increase its ATP hydrolysis activity by 14-fold, which would again promote mRNA loading into the 40S subunit and dissociation of eIF4A•ADP. This cycle could repeat itself until the start codon is located. The successive cycles of PIC-eIF4G-eIF4A interaction at the entry channel followed by eIF4A dissociation posited in this model could bias the directionality of scanning in the observed 5'−3' direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Spirin, 2009</xref>). In addition, the cycling of eIF4A molecules into and out of the complex at each step is consistent with previous observations that an ATPase deficient mutant of eIF4A acts in a dominant-negative fashion to inhibit translation initiation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pause et al., 1994</xref>), as the mutation would block dissociation of eIF4A molecules when they encounter eIF4G in the scanning PIC, and thereby impede progression through the 5'-UTR. Although speculative, this model brings together previous results in the field with our observations that the PIC stimulates ATP hydrolysis by eIF4A and eIF4F, that eIF4A accelerates recruitment of mRNAs regardless of their degree of structure, and that structure throughout the length of mRNAs inhibits recruitment in a manner relieved by eIF4A. It builds upon previous models for eIF4F function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yoder-Hill et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>As noted above, there is considerable evidence that mammalian eIF4A can promote PIC attachment and scanning by unwinding stable secondary structures in mRNA 5'-UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pestova et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Svitkin et al., 2001</xref>), and this function might be more prominent in mammalian cells than in yeast. However, even in yeast there is evidence that mRNAs with longer, more structure-prone 5'-UTRs have a heightened requirement for eIF4A, just not to the same extent observed for Ded1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sen et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, in addition to the broader functions depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, eIF4A likely also cooperates with other helicases in resolving stable secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2016</xref>) in 5'-UTRs during PIC attachment and scanning, both in mammals and yeast. The fact that eIF4A is not required for 48S PIC assembly with certain internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), for example that of hepatitis C virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pestova et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Spahn et al., 2001</xref>), can be explained by proposing that IRES interactions with the 40S subunit evoke a conformational change in the ribosome that enables the initiation region of the mRNA to bind directly into the mRNA binding cleft, bypassing all proposed functions of eIF4A in PIC attachment and scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doudna and Sarnow, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of the model, the events we observe in our mRNA recruitment assay reflect only the first engagement of a PIC with a messenger RNA. Once multiple ribosomes have been loaded onto an mRNA to form a polysome, the structure of the mRNA presumably changes dramatically, and structures on the 3' side of the start codon would play a different role than they do in early rounds of initiation. Future studies of initiation events on polysomal mRNA might reveal interesting differences from the starting phase of translation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP (products 10585, 16800, 14121, 23160, respectively) were purchased from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA).

All incubations and experiments were performed at 26°C. PICs were formed at 2x of the final concentration in 1x Recon buffer, in the absence of mRNA and ATP. PIC formation was initiated by incubating eIF2 and GDPNP for 10 min, subsequently Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> was added to the reaction and incubated for another 7 min. Next, eIFs 1, 1A, 40S, 3, 5, 4A, 4B, 4G•4E, and RiboLock were added. Order of addition of eIFs did not make a difference. The reaction was incubated for 10 min to allow complex formation. Subsequently, the PICs were combined with the ‘Reporter Mix’ containing phosphoenolpyruvate, NADH, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase (added as a 10x stock of the final concentrations all in 1x Recon buffer) resulting in concentrations in the final reaction of 2.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mM NADH, and a 1/250 dilution of the pyruvate kinase (600–1,000 units/mL) and lactate dehydrogenase (900–1400 units/mL) mix (PK/LDH mix). Reactions were brought up to volume with 1x Recon buffer, such that when they were initiated by addition of mRNA (added as a 10x stock of the final concentration in 1x Recon) and ATP•Mg<sup>2+</sup> (added as a 4x stock of the final concentration in 1x Recon buffer) the total reaction volume was 12 µl. 10 µl of the reaction were then immediately transferred to the microplate for analysis by the Tecan plate reader and changes in absorbance of 340 nm light were monitored over time, taking readings every 20 s for 40 min. Because the assay measures the slope of a straight line (i.e., multiple turnover conditions), the lag in time between initiating the reaction and start of the measurements by the plate reader has no effect on the results. Initiating the reactions using an injection, capable of monitoring rapid kinetics did not reveal any differences in results; that is, there was no evidence of a ‘burst’ phase in the initial part of the reaction. Increasing or decreasing the concentration of the PK/LDH mix by 3-fold did not influence the observed rate of ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that the rate of NADH oxidation is not limited by PK/LDH activity.

Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will see, the reviewers thought that the question was interesting, but unfortunately, they also thought that the data were not compelling, with complementary concerns. For example, reviewer 1 finds that the evidence in support of the two main conclusions is insufficient, while reviewer 3 agrees that &quot;there is in fact little direct supporting data in the manuscript for the model&quot; presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. In addition, various significant specific concerns were raised. Given these assessments, we have no choice but to decline the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The paper addresses the role of an ATPase eIF4A in mRNA recruitment. The authors make two main statements: (i) PIC stimulates the ATPase of eIF4A, indicating that the factor works in association with the ribosome complex rather than exclusively with mRNA and (ii) ATP hydrolysis by eIF4A accelerates the rate of mRNA recruitment regardless of the mRNA structure in the 5'UTR. I cannot see sufficient evidence in support of either statement as detailed below.</p><p>1) The authors measure multiple turnover ATPase activity of eIF4A, which turns out to be hardly stimulated by the mRNA (30 µM/min without and 40 µM/min with mRNA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The functional relevance of this activity remains unclear and it is difficult to compare it with the rate of translation initiation. Related to this problem, the rate of the multiple-turnover ATPase monitored in the paper is rather low. How does it correlate to the rate of translation initiation in vivo? In this context, the authors should refer to the newer work that allows to calculate the rate of initiation based on the ribosome profiling experiments, rather than citing a paper from 1975 (Introduction, sixth paragraph). The mRNA-independent multiple-turnover activity is not explained by the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and seems inconsistent with the importance of eIF4A for mRNA recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and existing literature).</p><p>2) The only reliable effects on the ATPase are on k<sub>cat</sub> by 40S and on K<sub>m</sub> by 4G-4E. Other effects of factor omission are small and can be hardly interpreted. The paper should be shortened considerably when describing these effects.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, the authors present titrations by eIF4A to study mRNA recruitment. This makes it very difficult to compare with the ATPase experiments, because eIF4A is an enzyme in the ATPase reaction, and thus the dependence on eIF4A for the ATPase rate should be linear. Instead, for the mRNA recruitment it is an &quot;activator&quot;, hence the hyperbolic dependence. The authors do not provide sufficient kinetic link between the ATPase and mRNA recruitment. Exactly this is an important point which is not directly shown and remains unclear and is also not explained by the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>4) Except for the tightly folded hairpin structures, there is no evidence that the mRNAs used in this paper form any secondary or tertiary structures or form any sort of collapsed polymer chains. Thus, the statements concerning the role of eIF4A in unfolding such structures (or stabilizing the unfolded state) are speculations not related to the data.</p><p>Technical problems:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: the data are not well presented, as the initial phase of kinetic experiments are compressed at the Y axis. Use a log time axis or at least allow for some distance between the Y axis and the beginning of the time courses. For the faster cases, the rate constant appears to rely on a single point, because the end level is achieved after 2-3 min (again, this is not well presented). Add more points at the initial part of the curve. Important: show the time courses of mRNA recruitment and of ATP hydrolysis in the same time course. Minor problem: Dark blue and black symbols are difficult to distinguish, use distinct colors.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, It remains unclear whether &quot;+&quot; in A, B, C, E is with or without mRNA, because the values all differ, e.g., 30 µM/min without mRNA and 40 µM/min with mRNA in A, 14 µM/min for PIC (without mRNA?) in B and 40 µM/min for PIC in C (with mRNA as in A?). This has to be clearly stated and the values have to be comparable. The experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> is kinetically senseless, as it represents an ATPase measurement with a mixture of PIC-stimulated and unstimulated reactions; no reliable information can be extracted here.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>. The difference between (7) -cap and (7) +cap relies on one experimental point at low concentration of eIF4A; this is not convincing, more points should be added.</p><p>4) The paper is exceedingly long, with significant redundancy between the Introduction and Discussion, and is not well written.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Here Yourik et al. use a yeast in vitro reconstituted system to demonstrate that mRNA recruitment to the PIC is stimulated by eIF4A regardless of degree of secondary structure. They also find that global structure per se rather than structure located within the mRNA 5'UTR confers a requirement for eIF4A. The experiments appear well performed and the manuscript is well written. My main concern is that an appropriate explanation for the effects seen by the authors (That is, why does global mRNA structure [even downstream of the AUG codon]) (and the 3'UTR?) impart eIF4A responsiveness? The authors do present a working model to explain why this could be so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), but there is in fact little direct supporting data in the manuscript for this model. Does eIF4A bind to the coding region before ribosome recruitment? How does binding of eIF4A to the mRNA body stimulate 5' end-mediated initiation events? As such we are left with a real interesting observation, but no understanding into how it could be functioning. If eIF4A is required to resolve global structure, then what makes TISU and the HCV mRNA (or chimeric templates containing these 5'UTR) eIF4A-independent? I also assume that the mechanism presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> will only be valid for the first round of translation initiation, since thereafter the mRNA will be translating with most internal structure distorted by the 80S ribosomes. Hence eIF4A-mediated unwinding of global structure should not be required for subsequent rounds of re-initiation.</p><p>How do the authors reconcile their data with those of Christopher Fraser's group where substantial initiation events were observed on (CAA)4-5'UTR betaglobin-β-globin mRNA (PMID 28559306, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) in the absence of eIF4A?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;eIF4A is stimulated by the pre-initiation complex and enhances recruitment of mRNAs regardless of structural complexity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a revised version of a manuscript in which the authors study the mechanism of action of eIF4A in mRNA recruitment using an in vitro reconstituted translation initiation system from budding yeast and mRNAs with varying degrees of structure. They present novel data showing that the PIC stimulates the ATPase activity of eIF4A. ATP hydrolysis by eIF4A accelerates the rate of recruitment for all mRNAs that were employed, regardless of their degree of secondary structure. They conclude that eIF4A also exhibits an important general role in loading mRNAs onto the PIC, in addition, unwinding mRNA structure. The authors conclude that eIF4A breaks many weak interactions formed within a mRNA that occludes the 5'-UTR and start codon and then acts to facilitate engagement of the 5'-cap structure. The revised manuscript is significantly improved over the original version. The data regarding transcripts #4 vs. #7 are interesting and provocative – enough so, to allow the speculation and the revised model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> (even though the initiation of HCV and TISU mRNAs remain unexplained).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While many of the experiments are insightful, the ability of the PIC to stimulate the eIF4A-dependent hydrolysis of ATP is less satisfactory, and should perhaps be dropped from the title. Also, because the experiments were performed with yeast eIF4A, this should be indicated in the title, if it is not changed: &quot;Yeast eIF4A is stimulated by the pre-initiation complex and enhances recruitment of mRNAs regardless of structural complexity&quot;.</p><p>2) None of the models explain the difference in the affinity of eIF4A to the PIC in the presence of different mRNAs. If eIF4A is recruited through the eIF4F complex to the cap and moves towards the start codon or is required to change the conformation of the 40S, its affinity is defined by the interactions with the 4F complex or the ribosome. It is not clear how the mRNA concentration should enter here and this should be explained.</p><p>3) Subsection “eIF4A relieves inhibition of recruitment produced by structures throughout the length of mRNAs”, ninth paragraph. The &gt;30-fold effect by a combination of secondary structures in the 5'UTR and the coding region is not obvious, as it looks like 9-11-fold. Furthermore, even an additive effect (if translated in terms of deltaG) should lead to 3x60 (xfold for construct 6 multiplied by xfold for construct 7) = 180-fold acceleration, compared measured 11 or 9 for mRNAs 8 and 9. Something does not add up here.</p><p>4) Introduction – &quot;[…]no apparent sequence specificity[…]&quot; As noted in the recent publication from the Ingolia lab (Iwaski et al., 2016), there does appear to be a preference for a polypurine sequence.</p><p>Also in the Introduction – &quot;[…]ATP hydrolysis causes a decrease in affinity of eIF4A for RNA[…]&quot; It would seem that eIF4A•ADP does not bind RNA well, however, the slow chemical step of ATP hydrolysis is associated with tighter binding of RNA as evidenced by either nitrocellulose filter binding or UV crosslinking.</p><p>5) Concerning the in vivo rate of initiation – it is likely that all in vitro studies that examine only the binding of a single ribosome to a mRNA will likely be an order of magnitude slower than the rate measured in vivo as the in vivo rate could reflect that of polysomal re-initiation, which is much more efficient (that would be a consequence of an intramolecular effect).</p><p>6) The stimulation of ATP hydrolysis is about 2-fold by the 43S/PIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This is not very dramatic given the number of components involved, the presence of RNA in the 40S subunit and the presence of components known to enhance eiF4A function (eIF4G/4E and eIF4B). In fact, the limited stimulation seen with added eIF4G/4E may readily reflect that it is present at only 10% of the concentration of eIF4A. Perhaps the most unusual feature of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which is the apparent inhibition by either eIF4B or eIF5. Secondly, as noted in panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, roughly 75% of the ATPase activity of the combination of the 40S/PIC + eIF4A occurs in the absence of added RNA.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> – previous studies (see also Lorsch and Herschlag) have indicated an eIF4A Km value for ATP in the 200-400 nM range. What is so different to cause a change such as that seen in panel D?</p><p>8) Discussion – an extensive discussion is centered around a limited stimulation of the eIF4A-dependent ATP hydrolysis. This should be considerably condensed. A clear contrast of yeast vs. mammalian systems should be highlighted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31476.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The paper addresses the role of an ATPase eIF4A in mRNA recruitment.

Due to technical limitations we cannot measure eIF4A ATPase activity under single turnover conditions as we did for mRNA recruitment. We have now added a section to the text describing the reasons we used multiple-turnover kinetics and making clear the inherent strengths and weaknesses of this approach (subsection “The ATPase activity of eIF4A•4G•4E is increased by the PIC”, first paragraph). Despite the limitations, measuring the ATPase kinetics under multiple turnover conditions provides important insights into if and how eIF4A, eIF4G•4E, and the rest of the PIC functionally interact. Although burst phase kinetics cannot be observed, our results clearly demonstrate that eIF4A’s ATPase activity is stimulated by the PIC in both the presence and absence of mRNA, as described in more detail below.</p><p>We also agree with the reviewer that more modern estimates of initiation rates would be desirable additions to the older value we cited. We have been unable to find direct experimental measurements of initiation rates using ribosome profiling. We consulted with several experts in this area – Nick Guydosh (NIDDK, NIH) and Nick Ingolia (UC Berkeley) – and both indicated that they were unaware of the use of ribosome profiling to measure initiation rates. Although no direct measurement of the rate of translation initiation using ribosome profiling appears to be available, we have added citations of recent computational modeling studies that utilize ribosome profiling data as one component of overall estimates of quantitative parameters for protein synthesis. If we have missed any relevant studies in our search, we would be happy to include them.</p><p>The values of k<sub>cat</sub> for ATP hydrolysis by the eIF4A•4G•4E complex in the presence of the PIC (~8 min<sup>-1</sup>) are well within the estimated range of the rates of translation initiation in vivo (e.g., 110 min<sup>-1</sup>).</p><p>Lastly, we have completely reworked the explanation of how our data fit into possible models for the mechanism of mRNA recruitment (e.g., subsection “A holistic model for eIF4A function in mRNA recruitment”) and have revised the final figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) accordingly. We also point out that our data are consistent with a recent proposal by Sokabe and Fraser that eIF4A may act, in part, to modulate the conformation of the PIC – for instance, the opening and closing of the mRNA entry channel in the 40S subunit – facilitating loading of mRNAs regardless of their degree of structure. We have modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> to contain such a model as one of the possible interpretations. This idea, which is not mutually exclusive with the holistic model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, is consistent with our observations that eIF4A accelerates the rate of recruitment even for unstructured mRNAs and that the PIC stimulates the rate of ATP hydrolysis by the factor, indicating a functional interaction between them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The only reliable effects on the ATPase are on k<sub>cat</sub> by 40S and on K<sub>m</sub> by 4G-4E. Other effects of factor omission are small and can be hardly interpreted. The paper should be shortened considerably when describing these effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Our original presentation of activation of eIF4A’s ATPase by the PIC and its components was confusing and we have now substantially reworked it, both in the text and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>The presence of the PIC accelerates ATP hydrolysis by 4-fold for the eIF4A•4G•4E heterotrimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and by 6-fold for eIF4A alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) compared to the rates observed in the absence of the PIC. These effects are similar in magnitude to the previously established stimulation of eIF4A’s ATPase by eIF4G•4E. Thus, our data suggest that there is a functional interaction between eIF4A and the PIC that is comparable in efficacy to the canonical interaction of eIF4A with the other two subunits of eIF4F. Our data also show that the eIF3g and eIF3i subunits of the eIF3 complex are fully required for this stimulation, as is an intact 43S PIC.</p><p>For clarity, we revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to report k<sub>cat</sub> values (min<sup>-1</sup>), which are much easier to compare to observed rate constants reported elsewhere in the paper and in the literature than the velocity values (µM/min) we presented originally. In order to provide an easier interpretation of the ATPase data we have also added a color code and legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and moved the K<sub>m</sub> values to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. We also changed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> panels C and D (blue and pink cross-hatched bars) to emphasize that omission of eIF2, eIF3, or eIF4G•4E had comparable or even greater effects on the k<sub>cat</sub> than did omitting the 40S subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, compare &quot;Complete PIC&quot; to &quot;-40S&quot;, &quot;-2&quot;, &quot;-3&quot; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> &quot;-eIF4G•4E&quot;). As suggested by reviewer 1, we significantly shortened the ATPase section, removed panels B and D from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and included two tables in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> that display all of the values for a more facile comparison of the k<sub>cat</sub> and K<sub>m</sub> effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, the authors present titrations by eIF4A to study mRNA recruitment.

This also allows us to measure the maximal observed rate constant for recruitment (k<sub>max</sub>), which is what we report in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Changes in K<sub>1/2</sub> values can suggest mechanistically important differences in eIF4Adependent mRNA recruitment efficiency and thus we felt this was an important parameter to measure and, in some cases, discuss. We agree with the reviewer that we did not adequately explain the connection (and caveats) between the ATPase and mRNA recruitment experiments, and, as explained in response #1 above, we have now attempted to do so. Also as explained above, we have significantly revised our description of how our data meshes with previous studies and suggests a holistic model for the role of eIF4A in mRNA recruitment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Except for the tightly folded hairpin structures, there is no evidence that the mRNAs used in this paper form any secondary or tertiary structures or form any sort of collapsed polymer chains.

Moreover, there is a large body of work indicating that nearly all natural sequences have a tendency to form structure via numerous interactions (reviewed in Halder and Bhattacharyya, 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Technical problems:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: the data are not well presented, as the initial phase of kinetic experiments are compressed at the Y axis.

Minor problem: Dark blue and black symbols are difficult to distinguish, use distinct colors.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> plots to show the early time points by moving the y-axis. We also added an inset to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, which shows 3 time-points in the first minute (earliest at 20 sec.) of the reaction, which is the fastest that we could measure. For the CAA-50mer the beginning of the curve is not covered well, as the reviewer suggests, thus the observed rate (4.0 min<sup>-1</sup>) is an estimate; however, because the reaction achieves a higher degree of mRNA recruited over time than do the reactions lacking either eIF4A or ATP the conclusion still holds that ATP and eIF4A both enhance recruitment of the CAA 50-mer. We now make clear that the 4 min<sup>-1</sup> rate constant is an estimate (subsection “ATP hydrolysis by eIF4A promotes recruitment of the natural mRNA <italic>RPL41A</italic> as well as a short, unstructured model mRNA”, third paragraph).</p><p>As explained above, for technical reasons ATPase kinetics were monitored under multiple turnover conditions whereas recruitment could be studied in the single-turnover regime. Thus, we cannot directly compare them side-by-side. However, the changes in the rate of ATP hydrolysis provide insights into how the eIF4A ATPase activity is affected by the presence of the PIC, both in the presence and absence of mRNA.</p><p>As recommended, we made the blue data points in the plots a lighter color so that they are easier to distinguish from the black.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, It remains unclear whether &quot;+&quot; in A, B, C, E is with or without mRNA, because the values all differ, e.g. 30 µM/min without mRNA and 40 µM/min with mRNA in A, 14 µM/min for PIC (without mRNA?) in B and 40 µM/min for PIC in C (with mRNA as in A?). This has to be clearly stated and the values have to be comparable. The experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> is kinetically senseless, as it represents an ATPase measurement with a mixture of PIC-stimulated and unstimulated reactions; no reliable information can be extracted here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have completely reformatted <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, including by adding labels clearly indicating where there is a saturating amount of ATP or <italic>RPL41A</italic> mRNA: panels A and B have a saturating amount of ATP while <italic>RPL41A</italic> mRNA is varied and panels C and D have a saturating amount of <italic>RPL41A</italic> while ATP is varied.

Our intent is to demonstrate that the main difference in the observed rates, plotted as a function of eIF4A concentration, occurs in the absence of eIF4A. To illustrate this point more clearly, we added insets with a magnified view of the observed rates at low concentrations of eIF4A, up to 0.5 µM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The paper is exceedingly long, with significant redundancy between the Introduction and Discussion, and is not well written.</p></disp-quote><p>We rewrote and shortened large portions of the manuscript, with particular attention to the ATPase section in the Results and minimizing redundancy between the Introduction and the Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Here Yourik et al. use a yeast in vitro reconstituted system to demonstrate that mRNA recruitment to the PIC is stimulated by eIF4A regardless of degree of secondary structure. They also find that global structure per se rather than structure located within the mRNA 5'UTR confers a requirement for eIF4A. The experiments appear well performed and the manuscript is well written. My main concern is that an appropriate explanation for the effects seen by the authors (That is, why does global mRNA structure [even downstream of the AUG codon]) (and the 3'UTR?) impart eIF4A responsiveness? The authors do present a working model to explain why this could be so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), but there is in fact little direct supporting data in the manuscript for this model.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concern of reviewer 3 and we revised our manuscript and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to convey better how our data integrate with previous studies to suggest a holistic model for the role of eIF4A, as described in response #1 to reviewer 1. We note that our data are also consistent with a recent model suggesting that eIF4A modulates the conformation of the 40S ribosomal subunit to allow mRNA loading (Sokabe and Fraser, 2017). In this model, modulation of the conformation of the ribosome by eIF4A would stimulate the recruitment of any mRNA. We formatted <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> accordingly, adding an illustration of such a model. We further note that the two models presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are not mutually exclusive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does eIF4A bind to the coding region before ribosome recruitment? How does binding of eIF4A to the mRNA body stimulate 5' end-mediated initiation events? As such we are left with a real interesting observation, but no understanding into how it could be functioning.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous work strongly suggests that eIF4A does not have any sequence specificity and binds throughout the length of the mRNA (Lindqvist et al., 2008; Rajagopal et al., 2012). Given the high concentration of eIF4A in the cell (Firczuk et al., 2013) we believe that a reasonable inference would be that eIF4A can bind to an mRNA prior to translation initiation. mRNAs form numerous intramolecular interactions (Halder and Bhattacharyya, 2013), which may lead to occluding the 5'-end and start codon by sequences located throughout the rest of the message. We cannot provide any additional mechanistic insights at this time but believe that the previous body of work allows us to speculate that eIF4A binding to the message would relax the overall folded structure in order to make the 5’-end accessible to binding by eIF4F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) as suggested previously (Spirin, 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If eIF4A is required to resolve global structure, then what makes TISU and the HCV mRNA (or chimeric templates containing these 5'UTR) eIF4A-independent?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. We suspect that these elements allow alternative modes of entry, perhaps, in part, by making accessible binding sites for certain components of the translational machinery in a manner that escapes occlusion by the overall fold of an mRNA. For example, an IRES may be large enough to dominate the structural landscape of a region of an mRNA. Like IRESs, TISU elements appear to allow mRNA recruitment in a manner distinct from canonical translation initiation. Perhaps part of the function of the TISU element is to ensure the 5’-end of the mRNA with the cap-proximal start codon is not occluded by the rest of the mRNA – either because it binds one or more protein factors or by preventing interactions with other RNA elements. It is certainly an intriguing question, but one we do not have an answer for.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also assume that the mechanism presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> will only be valid for the first round of translation initiation, since thereafter the mRNA will be translating with most internal structure distorted by the 80S ribosomes. Hence eIF4A-mediated unwinding of global structure should not be required for subsequent rounds of re-initiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the mRNA will likely have a very different structure once multiple ribosomes are translating it in a polysome. One of the limitations of our system (especially when doing single turnover kinetics) is that we can only monitor one round of translation initiation. Although our data might be representative of only the first round of initiation, indeed, the structural elements throughout the message must be resolved for recruitment to take place. At this time we cannot rule out the possibility that the bulk of the work for eIF4A may be to facilitate the first round of translation initiation. We modified the Discussion to state this idea (subsection “A holistic model for eIF4A function in mRNA recruitment”, last paragraph) and note that further experimentation with polysomes would be of great interest in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How do the authors reconcile their data with those of Christopher Fraser's group where substantial initiation events were observed on (CAA)4-5'UTR betaglobin-β-globin mRNA (PMID 28559306, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) in the absence of eIF4A?</p></disp-quote><p>The two types of mRNAs used in the study cited are short CAA-repeat mRNAs, much like the CAA 50-mer in our manuscript, and the Globin-Luc mRNA, encoding luciferase with a globin 5′ UTR. In both Sokabe and Fraser, 2017 as well as our manuscript, the CAA-repeats mRNA could be recruited in the absence of hydrolyzable ATP; however, we also show that the kinetics were faster when hydrolyzable ATP (and eIF4A) were present. In contrast, Sokabe and Fraser were not able to follow kinetics and thus could not discern effects on rates. In their equilibrium studies, Globin-Luc mRNA, harboring structural complexity, required ATP hydrolysis for recruitment, which is similar to what we see with RNAs 7-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Taken together, our data are consistent with the model presented by the Fraser lab and we modified our presentation to emphasize this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Lastly, both we (subsection “holistic model for eIF4A function in mRNA recruitment”, first paragraph) and the Fraser lab point out that unwinding of the mRNA is a possible additional function of eIF4A, not mutually exclusive with the idea that the factor modulates the conformation of the PIC.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While many of the experiments are insightful, the ability of the PIC to stimulate the eIF4A-dependent hydrolysis of ATP is less satisfactory, and should perhaps be dropped from the title.

If eIF4A is recruited through the eIF4F complex to the cap and moves towards the start codon or is required to change the conformation of the 40S, its affinity is defined by the interactions with the 4F complex or the ribosome. It is not clear how the mRNA concentration should enter here and this should be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer correctly points out, we cannot provide mechanistic insight into the exact affinities of eIF4A for other components of the translational machinery.

It is possible that mRNA structure inhibits recruitment (i.e., high ∆G for unwinding) and eIF4A lowers that energetic barrier. RNAs with a higher degree of structure require more enzymatic (eIF4A) activity to lower this energetic barrier and achieve the maximal rate of translation initiation, ultimately resulting in a higher <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf50"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Also, the Materials and methods section (subsection “mRNA Recruitment Assay”, first paragraph) contains the exact assay conditions and refers the reader to previous literature (Walker et al., 2013; Aitken et al., 2016) further detailing the mRNA recruitment system in yeast.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “eIF4A relieves inhibition of recruitment produced by structures throughout the length of mRNAs”, ninth paragraph. The &gt;30-fold effect by a combination of secondary structures in the 5'UTR and the coding region is not obvious, as it looks like 9-11-fold. Furthermore, even an additive effect (if translated in terms of deltaG) should lead to 3x60 (xfold for construct 6 multiplied by xfold for construct 7) = 180-fold acceleration, compared measured 11 or 9 for mRNAs 8 and 9. Something does not add up here.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern of the reviewer and would like to take this opportunity to clarify how the magnitudes of the effects were calculated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> compares the fold stimulation of the rate of recruitment in the presence of saturating eIF4A versus in the absence of eIF4A, for each construct. That is, the 60-fold effect for construct 7 is calculated by dividing the maximal rate of recruitment of construct 7 in the presence of saturating eIF4A (k<sub>max</sub>) by the rate of recruitment of construct 7 in the absence of eIF4A (KobsnoeIF4A). In contrast, in the original manuscript drew a comparison of the maximal rates of mRNA recruitment (k<sub>max</sub>) among RNAs 4-9. The 30-fold effect is from comparing the maximal rates of recruitment at saturating eIF4A, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>; compare k<sub>max</sub> for RNA 4 vs. RNAs 8 and 9). Constructs 5 and 6 contain a hairpin in the 5'-UTR and their k<sub>max</sub> is lower than that for construct 4 by 2.1-fold and 2.7-fold, respectively. Construct 7 contains structure in the coding region but not in the 5'-UTR and its k<sub>max</sub> is ~2-fold lower as compared to construct 4. When structure is present in the 5'-UTR and the coding region (i.e. constructs 8-9) the k<sub>max</sub> is decreased by ~30-fold with respect to the k<sub>max</sub> measured for RNA 4, thus the effects are more than additive. We agree that the previous version of the manuscript did not elaborate on how each comparison was drawn and in the subsection “eIF4A relieves inhibition of recruitment produced by structures throughout the length of mRNAs” we added parenthetical explanations of how each comparison and calculation of effects was derived (e.g., in the eighth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Introduction – &quot;[…]no apparent sequence specificity[…]&quot; As noted in the recent publication from the Ingolia lab (Iwaski et al., 2016), there does appear to be a preference for a polypurine sequence.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for referring us to this work, which we have now included in the fifth paragraph of the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also in the Introduction – &quot;[…]ATP hydrolysis causes a decrease in affinity of eIF4A for RNA[…]&quot; It would seem that eIF4A•ADP does not bind RNA well, however, the slow chemical step of ATP hydrolysis is associated with tighter binding of RNA as evidenced by either nitrocellulose filter binding or UV crosslinking.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that there is evidence for high affinity states in the catalytic cycle of DEAD-box proteins. However, these states are intermediate in the catalysis and ultimately ATP hydrolysis results in a weaker affinity for the RNA in the ADP-bound state. We added this important point raised by the reviewers as well as the relevant literature references in the fifth paragraph of the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Concerning the in vivo rate of initiation – it is likely that all in vitro studies that examine only the binding of a single ribosome to a mRNA will likely be an order of magnitude slower than the rate measured in vivo as the in vivo rate could reflect that of polysomal re-initiation, which is much more efficient (that would be a consequence of an intramolecular effect).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the insight. We weakened our statement in comparing the rate of eIF4A catalysis with rates of initiation in vivo (Introduction, sixth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The stimulation of ATP hydrolysis is about 2-fold by the 43S/PIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This is not very dramatic given the number of components involved, the presence of RNA in the 40S subunit and the presence of components known to enhance eiF4A function (eIF4G/4E and eIF4B). In fact, the limited stimulation seen with added eIF4G/4E may readily reflect that it is present at only 10% of the concentration of eIF4A. Perhaps the most unusual feature of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which is the apparent inhibition by either eIF4B or eIF5. Secondly, as noted in panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, roughly 75% of the ATPase activity of the combination of the 40S/PIC + eIF4A occurs in the absence of added RNA.</p></disp-quote><p>The k<sub>cat</sub> for ATP hydrolysis by eIF4A in the presence of eIF4G•4E is increased 3.4-fold by the PIC, whereas the k<sub>cat</sub> in the absence of eIF4G•4E is increased 6-fold by the PIC. The latter is bigger than the effect of eIF4G•4E on the k<sub>cat</sub> of eIF4A in the absence of other components (4-fold). We have now tried to emphasize and clarify these points further by making the comparisons more explicit throughout the manuscript. We believe the confusion arose because the effect of leaving out single components (e.g., 40S subunits) in the presence of eIF4G•4E is only 2-fold. This suggests that the remaining components provide a small amount of stimulation, even in the absence of a complete PIC. When eIF3 and 40S subunits are omitted together, this resulted in nearly a 3-fold decrease in rate, almost to the full 3.4-fold effect cited above. We now make these points more clearly in the third and fifth paragraphs of the subsection “The ATPase activity of eIF4A•4G•4E is increased by the PIC”. In contrast, in the absence of eIF4G•4E, when any single core component of the PIC is omitted (e.g., 40S, eIF2, or eIF3), k<sub>cat</sub> is reduced by nearly 6-fold, to the level observed with eIF4A on its own, as described in the last paragraph of the subsection “The presence of the 43S PIC and eIF3 increases eIF4A ATPase activity in the absence of eIF4G•4E”. We now also emphasize in the Discussion that the 6-fold stimulation of eIF4A’s ATPase activity by the PIC in the absence of eIF4G•4E is slightly larger than the effect of eIF4G•4E on eIF4A in isolation (Discussion, first paragraph). We apologize that we were not clearer in the previous version of the manuscript.</p><p>Removing eIF4B or eIF5 from the reaction did not cause any inhibition, but rather had no effect on the k<sub>cat</sub> compared to when all of the components were present (k<sub>cat</sub> ~ 8 min<sup>-1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, compare &quot;Complete PIC&quot; to &quot;-4B&quot; and to &quot;-5&quot;).</p><p>The reviewers are correct that it would be interesting to determine if the effects seen here are increased when eIF4G•4E is saturating and stoichiometric with respect to eIF4A. However, we are not able to achieve this scenario for technical reasons, including the fact that eIF4G•4E becomes insoluble at high concentrations. In addition, it should be noted that the concentration of eIF4A in vivo in yeast is ~10-20-fold higher than that of eIF4G (von der Haar and McCarthy (2002) Mol. Micro. 46: 531-544), indicating that our concentration regime is physiologically reasonable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> – previous studies (see also Lorsch and Herschlag) have indicated an eIF4A Km value for ATP in the 200-400 nM range.

The reviewers are correct that the K<sub>m</sub>s we report here for eIF4A and eIF4F are 2-5-fold higher than previously reported values for the yeast and mammalian factors. We now make this point and suggest that the discrepancies could be due to differences in buffer conditions or the RNAs used to activate the ATPases (e.g., poly(U) or poly(A) vs. structured and natural mRNAs here) in the last paragraph of the subsection “Km values suggest distinct mechanisms of eIF4A activation by the PIC components and eIF4G•4E”.
