Light energy is converted by two photosystems—photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII). Globally, nearly 50% of photosynthesis takes place in the Ocean, where single cell cyanobacteria and algae reside together with their viruses. An operon encoding PSI was identified in cyanobacterial marine viruses. We generated a PSI that mimics the salient features of the viral complex, named PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup>. PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> is promiscuous for its electron donors and can accept electrons from respiratory cytochromes. We solved the structure of PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> and a monomeric PSI, with subunit composition similar to the viral PSI, providing for the first time a detailed description of the reaction center and antenna system from mesophilic cyanobacteria, including red chlorophylls and cofactors of the electron transport chain. Our finding extends the understanding of PSI structure, function and evolution and suggests a unique function for the viral PSI.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01496.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01496.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01496.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Photosynthesis—the process by which plants and other organisms harness the energy in sunlight—is the source of almost all oxygen, food and fuel on earth. Oxygenic photosynthesis in living cells involves a series of reactions catalyzed by large protein complexes, various other soluble chemicals, and the transfer of electrons from so-called donors to acceptors. The energy in the sunlight is captured by two membrane-embedded protein complexes—photosystem I, which is the most powerful electron donor in nature, and photosystem II—and converted into chemical energy.</p><p>Almost half of the world’s photosynthesis occurs in the oceans, and is performed by single-celled cyanobacteria and algae. Interestingly, some of the genes that encode photosynthetic enzymes in cyanobacteria are also found in the genomes of viruses that infect these bacteria. It is thought that these viruses can alter photosynthetic pathways in their hosts, but the interactions between these viruses and their hosts are not fully understood.</p><p>Now, Mazor et al. have created a photosystem I complex that mimics the viral version of this complex, and have gone on to solve its three-dimensional structure. This mimetic virus-encoded complex was shown to be a ‘promiscuous’ electron acceptor: this means that, unlike most electron acceptors, it can accept electrons from more than one electron donor.</p><p>Further, Mazor et al. solved the structure of photosystem I from <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, a cyanobacterium that lives in fresh water; and found some surprising differences between it and the only other published structure for photosystem I from a cyanobacterium (which was from a species that lives in hot water springs). These included differences in components involved in the electron transfer chain—a series of chemical reactions in which electrons are passed from donor to acceptor molecules—that were thought to be highly conserved. Other differences in the structures allowed Mazor et al. to identify the location of a unique chlorophyll pigment group in the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> photosystem I.</p><p>Since <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is commonly used as a model to study photosynthesis, an improved understanding of its photosystem I should lead to further improvements in our knowledge of photosynthesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01496.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01496.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cyanobacteria</kwd><kwd>electron transfer</kwd><kwd>photosynthesis</kwd><kwd><italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp.

Cyanobacterial photosynthetic membranes contain two photosystems, of which PSII mediates the extraction of electrons from water, the initial electron donor, to the plastoquinone pool. PSI mediates electron transfer from cytochrome C553 (or plastocyanin in eukaryotes) to ferredoxin, thereby generating the reducing power needed for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation in the form of NADPH. The architecture of oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria has largely been determined and the structures of both photosystems from thermophilic cyanobacteria have been solved at high resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jordan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferreira et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nelson and Ben-Shem, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amunts et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Umena et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Photosynthetic reaction centers are classified according to their terminal electron acceptor as either type I, with an iron sulfur cluster acceptor, or type II, with a quinone terminal acceptor. PSI, a type I reaction center, presumably evolved from the simpler homodimeric bacterial reaction centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buttner et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liebl et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baymann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nelson and Ben-Shem, 2005</xref>). We currently know only two versions of the type I reaction centers: the relatively simple bacterial homodimer found in green sulfur bacteria (GSB), <italic>heliobacteria</italic> and <italic>Chloracidobacterium</italic> or the much more complex PSI with its 11–15 subunits found in cyanobacteria and all photosynthetic eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buttner et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hauska et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nelson and Yocum, 2006</xref>). Although sequence conservation between the PsaA/B subunits of PSI and the single large subunit of the homodimeric reaction centers is low, their inferred membrane topology is similar, and the sequence conservation around the bound iron sulfur cluster is high, supporting the notion of a common ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mulkidjanian and Junge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blankenship and Hartman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baymann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mazor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rutherford et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In the earth ocean’s, mainly single cell organisms, cyanobacteria or algae, perform oxygenic photosynthesis. One of the most intriguing aspects of marine cyanobacterial photosynthesis is the involvement of various viruses in the process. Hints on this involvement come from the presence of photosynthetic genes in viral genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>). Many marine phages encode for either the D1 gene or both D1 and D2 which together make up the reaction center of PSII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, several subunits of the NDH1 complex and soluble cytochromes are also found in the viral metagenome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Philosof et al., 2011</xref>). The presence of these genes suggests that marine viruses have the ability to alter the host photosynthesis pathways in ways, which are still not completely understood. Recently, an operon encoding a complete, albeit minimal, PSI complex was found in the genome of several marine cyanophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharon et al., 2009</xref>). The viral PSI has a unique gene composition compared to the PSI composition of its hosts. PsaL and PsaI are missing and a unique PsaJ-PsaF (PsaJF) fusion-protein exists.</p><p>The absence of both PsaL and PsaI from the viral PSI suggests that it functions as a monomer and does not assemble trimers since both PsaL and PsaI are important for the formation of the cyanobacterial trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chitnis and Chitnis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 1995</xref>). In eukaryotes, the PsaF subunit is important for electron transfer between plastocyanin (PC) and the PSI complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farah et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hippler et al., 1996</xref>). Although the structures of PsaF from cyanobacteria and plants are very similar, the role of PsaF is less well defined in cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chitnis et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hippler et al., 1996</xref>). Structurally, the N-terminus of PsaF forms a major ‘bump’ in the flat, luminal side of PSI. Within this domain, the eukaryotic PsaF contains several additional positively charged residues that stabilize the interaction between PSI and PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farah et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hippler et al., 1996</xref>). In the viral PSI the N-terminus of PsaF is deleted and as a result the luminal face of PSI is expected to be relatively flat.</p><p>The unique light harvesting and transfer requirements, together with the large number of interconnected subunits, have resulted in a very high degree of structural conservation in PSI complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Shem et al., 2003</xref>). For example, approximately 90 chlorophyll molecules, bound by the PSI reaction center remained largely unmoved by more than 2 billion years of evolution between the thermophilic cyanobacterium <italic>Thermosynechococcus elongatus</italic> and the flowering plant <italic>Pisum sativum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jordan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Shem et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amunts et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2010</xref>). A common feature of PSI is the presence of low energy chlorophyll molecules called ‘red chlorophylls’. Red chlorophylls are present in the reaction center of cyanobacteria and in the light-harvesting belt of the plant PSI. In cyanobacteria, red chlorophylls can affect the trapping kinetics of excitation energy as shown by measurements done on PSI from various species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gobets et al., 2001</xref>). The location of the red chlorophylls within the internal antenna of PSI is still a matter of debate, the inter species variability of the red absorption suggests that they are located in a relatively variable region of PSI. Currently, all the calculations of individual pigment energies are based on the high resolution PSI structure from <italic>Thermosynechococcus elongatus</italic>, which contains a relatively large number of red pigments. New, high resolution structures are needed to compare antenna system across various species.</p><p>In this work, we characterized both biochemically and structurally a phage-mimetic PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> constructed in <italic>Synechocystis.</italic> We find that the fused subunit PsaJF is incorporated into the PSI complex and that this incorporation results in a promiscuous PSI, able to accept electrons from respiratory cytochromes. We also present a high resolution model for the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PSI monomer, which allows us to identify for the first time the changes in the antenna system and electron transport chain (ETC) that exist between <italic>Synechocystis</italic> and <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic>. The location of red chlorophylls in the thermophilic vs the mesophilic cyanobacteria is discussed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of a trimeric PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup></title><p>We hypothesized that the consequences of this viral JF gene product would be a PSI complex with more promiscuous electron acceptor reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharon et al., 2009</xref>). Cyanobacteria employ a multitude of electron transfer reactions in their membrane systems. These systems are at least partially insulated by spatial confinement of the various electron donors and acceptors, but the molecular interactions between these donors and acceptors may also contribute to pathway isolation. To explore the promiscuity of viral PSI complexes, we constructed a phage-mimetic PsaJ-PsaF fusion in the easily cultivable cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis sp.</italic> PCC 6803. The borders of <italic>PsaJ</italic> and <italic>PsaF</italic> are easily located in the viral gene and the high conservation of the PsaF subunit enabled us to duplicate the salient features of the viral gene into our artificially constructed fusion made from the corresponding <italic>Synechocystis</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>Synechocystis</italic> strains carrying the fused <italic>PsaJF</italic> gene as their sole source of PsaF and PsaJ, grow at wild type rates in heterotrophic conditions and without added carbon. After purifying the PSI complex from the photosynthetic membranes of both wild-type and <italic>PsaJF</italic> strains, we found that the trimer to monomer ratio is similar in both strains, indicating that the assembly and stability of PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> is not disturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The crystal structure of the PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> complex was solved by molecular replacement, first by using the previously determined cyanobacterial structure as a search model (PDB ID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1JBO">1JBO</ext-link>) and later with a higher resolution model from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (see ‘Results’ below).

As such, even at this relatively low resolution, some interesting features are apparent. The structure clearly shows the presence of the fused subunit integrated in the PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Deleting the N-terminus of PsaF resulted in a flattened plateau on the luminal side of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Three chlorophyll molecules and four carotenoids are coordinated by PsaJ and PsaF in the <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic> PSI structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We find that all of these ligands are probably lost during the assembly of PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> and could not be traced in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In spite of the relatively low resolution, we find that the overall organization of the other cofactors in PSI is hardly affected in PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> demonstrating the mild effect of the JF mutation on the overall organization and integrity of the complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> is a promiscuous electron acceptor</title><p>Next we tested whether PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> is a promiscuous electron acceptor. We measured the half-life of PSI reduction by a mammalian respiratory cytochrome c. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, P700 in PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> is reduced much faster by a respiratory cytochrome c than in the wild-type complex. However, PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> is reduced by its native electron donor cytochrome c553 (CytC553) with similar kinetics compared to the wild-type PSI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This is in contrast to eukaryotic PSI where the N-terminus of PsaF was shown to be important for the electron donation reaction between plastocyanin and PSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hippler et al., 1996</xref>). The similar electron donation rates observed with CytC553 are in agreement with previously published results obtained from PsaF and PsaJ deleted strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">1994b</xref>). When the light-dependent oxidation of cytochrome c was followed we obtained similar results. Compared to the wild-type complex, PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> had faster cytochrome oxidation kinetics when respiratory cytochrome was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and similar kinetics when native CytC553 was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The similarity between the reaction kinetics of PSI reduction together with the similar cellular growth rates of wild-type and PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> strains shows that deleting the N-terminus of PsaF causes no gross perturbation to the interaction between PSI and CytC553, that is, the N-terminus of PsaF does not play any positive role in this interaction in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>. The N-terminus of PsaF can act as a negative regulator of some electron donation reactions, especially from positively charged donors such as respiratory cytochromes. We suggest that this was the original function of PsaF in a more primitive form of PSI and only later, as PSI evolved, the binding site was refined to its final configuration. In the viral PSI, such promiscuity can be beneficial when the viral reaction center encounters the highly variable cytochromes found in marine cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mazor et al., 2012</xref>) or alternatively to allow PSI to accept electrons from respiratory activities when PSII activity is compromised.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01496.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> is a promiscuous electron acceptor.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) P700 reduction kinetics (after a 100 ms pulse of orange light) showing faster reduction kinetics of a PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> complex with respiratory CytC (red line) compared to the wild-type complex (blue line).

Their conservation in all cyanobacterial species, arguably the most diverse group of microorganisms, suggests that over evolutionary time periods losing them is detrimental. Different small subunits, however, are functionally connected. For example, in cells lacking PsaJ, PsaF is only partially incorporated into the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 1994a</xref>). A similar situation is seen in PsaI deleted cells, where PsaL is only partially assembled into the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 1995</xref>). In both the cases, a ‘simple’ single transmembrane (TM) helix (PsaJ or PsaI) seems to be necessary for the assembly of a more complex subunit (PsaF or PsaL, respectively).</p><p>To improve the diffraction from our crystals, and increase the observation to parameter ratio of our model, we purified and crystallized the monomeric form of PSI.

We inserted 10 histidine residues at the C-terminus of PsaL, similar to an approach previously shown to completely disrupt trimer formation without adversely affecting PSI activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tang and Chitnis, 2000</xref>). As expected, extending the C-terminus of PsaL caused no significant effect on cell growth or PSI activity and resulted in a homogenous population of monomeric complexes that were readily purified and crystallized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>Fortuitously, PsaL and PsaI were missing from the final purified complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), making the subunit composition of the crystallized PSI very similar to the viral PSI complex (the only difference is the single TM subunit PsaM which is found in our preparation and is absent from the viral PSI operon). This shows that the subunit composition of the phage complex is sufficient to produce a stable and active PSI complex.</p><p>The crystals obtained from this monomeric form of PSI belong to a higher symmetry space group (P212121), had a reduced cell volume (∼3.75 × 10<sup>6</sup> Å<sup>3</sup>) and, most importantly, diffracted to a resolution of 2.8 Å. At this resolution, the entire complement of ligands and cofactors is revealed, and it is feasible to carry out a detailed comparison between the thermophilic and mesophilic complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Electron transport chain</title><p>The available structures of PSI from thermophilic cyanobacteria and higher plants show complete conservation in all the components of the electron transport chain (ETC) from P700 to the iron sulfur clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jordan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Shem et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amunts et al., 2007</xref>).

The ring-to-ring distances between the chlorophylls of this trimer do not suggest direct coupling, but, surprisingly, our model revealed the presence of an additional chlorophyll trimer, related by the pseudo C2 symmetry axis of the reaction center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6A,B</xref>). The new trimer is formed by an additional chlorophyll, B40, which is coordinated by the head group of a phospholipid (one of three present in PSI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). The phosphate oxygen atom lays 2.8 Å from the magnesium atom of B40. This coordination of chlorophylls by lipids is reminiscent of the situation in light-harvesting complex II (LHC-II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Standfuss et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, CP29, which is highly homologous to LHC-II, does not contain such a configuration and this probably contributes to the different non photochemical quenching properties of both proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pan et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The position of this new chlorophyll (B40) is occupied by subunit PsaX in <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Surprisingly, and in spite of the large structural changes observed in this region, this lipid is still clearly visible, this high degree of conservation demonstrates the important role of the PSI lipids. The fact that the newly discovered chlorophyll trimer in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> relates to its counterpart by pseudo C2 symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggests that this configuration preceded the association of PsaX, which may have been an adaptation to high temperature. Possibly the most important role of PsaX is to protect this lipid at higher temperatures. The occurrence of this chlorophyll trimer suggests that these trimers have a structural role and the appearance of the red absorption results from fine-tuning of their position. It is likely that the pigment environment contributes significantly to its spectral properties.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Photosystem I is one of the most complex enzymes in nature. Even though the evolution of photosynthesis must have taken a complex path, today we can only see a limited snapshot of this path. The high degree of sequence conservation and the importance of pigments to the photosynthetic process further limit our ability to deduce function from mere sequences.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Viral reaction centers</title><p>The prevalence of photosynthetic genes in marine cyanophage genomes suggests that photosynthesis and respiration play an important part in the phage–host interaction. Aside from the PSI operon, genes for other subunits of the major complexes of the photosynthetic electron transport chain reside in phages including PSII, NDH-I, F-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Philosof et al., 2011</xref>). Small soluble proteins like cytochromes and ferredoxins are also abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sharon et al., 2011</xref>). A common property of these genes is that they cluster together as a distinct group when compared to their cyanobacterial counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zeidner et al., 2005</xref>). In some cases, it is possible to suggest that viral subunits modify the flow of electrons in the photosynthetic chain based on the known function of the cyanobacterial counterpart. This is the case with the virally encoded NDH-I subunits, where the function of the native, bacterial complex in cyclic electron flow is established.</p><p>In this study, we show that a phage specific mutation, removal of the N-terminus of PsaF, results in a promiscuous PSI complex. It is known that the properties of the small electron donor (either PC or CytC553) largely determine its mode of interaction with PSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hervas et al., 2005</xref>). Marine cyanobacteria contain an especially diverse set of soluble cytochromes with variable physical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mazor et al., 2012</xref>). How this diversity is manifested with respect to cellular respiration and photosynthesis is a matter for future experiments. However, our findings suggest that photosynthesis performed during phage infection and catalyzed (at least partially) by phage proteins (‘Viral photosynthesis’) utilize very different cytochromes efficiently and will not be sensitive to the nature of the electron donor. The existence of both NDH-I subunits and a promiscuous PSI operon in a single phage genome suggests that cyclic electron flow is enhanced during phage replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Philosof et al., 2011</xref>). This can be achieved by increasing the flow of electrons into the photosynthetic electron transport chain through the NDH–I complex or by utilizing electrons from respiratory cytochromes or both. It is important to consider the two most common phage photosynthetic proteins, D1 and D2, in that light. The suggested function of virally encoded D1 and D2 is to replenish the rapidly damaged host D1 and D2 proteins during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alperovitch-Lavy et al., 2011</xref>). This seems to partially contradict the notion of increased cyclic electron flow in infected cells but it is probable that some basal level of linear electron flow in the cells plays a major part in phage multiplication. Detailed studies performed in phage-infected cells are needed to uncover the facts needed to support these hypotheses.</p><p>We suggest that the phage-encoded PSI complex with its unique gene composition adds an important step to the scenario of PSI evolution from a primordial homodimeric entity to the current highly evolved complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nelson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mazor et al., 2012</xref>). In this scenario, the formation of the primordial heterodimer allowed for the evolution of the unique properties of the peripheral subunits, trimer formation in the case of PsaL and interaction with electron donors in the case of PsaF. The specificity and complexity of biological machines increases along their evolutionary path and PSI is a prime example of this property. Cyanobacterial PSI is much more complicated and intricate than its ancestral homodimer and the plant PSI adds additional levels of complexity over the cyanobacterial complex. The preservation of simpler forms of PSI is therefore quite unique and stems from the relatively simple life cycle of phages and from the unique evolutionary requirements associated with this life cycle. For example, some marine phages from the <italic>Myoviridae</italic> family can infect different species of cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sullivan et al., 2003</xref>) and this creates unique requirements on their genes such as utilizing the different chlorophyll species found in <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> and <italic>Synechococcus</italic>. The viral complex preserves some of the properties of the common PSI ancestor, lost from both the cyanobacterial and plant PSI. One of these properties appears to be promiscuity for electron donors as exemplified by the fused PsaJF subunit. The incredible richness uncovered by ocean genomic surveys suggests that further sampling will reveal further examples of ancestral forms of PSI and other unique versions of highly conserved genes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mesophilic cyanobacterial PSI</title><p>The two structures described in this work provide the first detailed look at the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PSI complex. The two most prominent differences between <italic>Synechocystis</italic> and <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic> are the longer trapping time for excitation energy and the stronger red absorbance found in <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic>. Both of these differences are probably related to the number of red-shifted pigments found in PSI. This study provides definite proof for the absence of the putative ‘red’ chlorophyll trimer in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> and narrowed the number of coupled pigment dimers to two. Further calculations should help identifying other, more subtle alteration in pigment energy along the antenna system. Structurally, the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PSI complex revealed the PsaX-less conformation of the antenna and it is evident that this configuration is closer to the plant PSI inner antenna and thus can be considered the ancestral arrangement.</p><p>One of the most surprising findings is the conserved lipid binding by the PsaB loop close to PsaX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is the region of PSI that underwent the most drastic changes between <italic>Synechocystis</italic> and <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic>, however the presence of the lipid is not affected by them. This suggests that the function of this lipid (and by inference the function of the other PSI lipids) is related to assembly process of PSI, possibly to support reinsertion into the membrane after the synthesis of an extended stromal loop. The absence of any sequence identifiable binding site for this lipid stems from the hydrophobic interactions made between its hydrocarbon tails and several chlorophyll molecules without involving any protein atoms. This highlights the significance of detailed structural information in elucidating the biology of complex biological assemblies.</p><p>A cluster of water molecules located between Fx and Q1<sub>B</sub>, conserved between <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic> and <italic>Synechocystis</italic> was revealed. The two branches of the PSI ET chain are not equivalent, the PsaB located branch being faster. This water cluster may modulate the contribution by Tryptophan PsaB 664 to the electron transfer between Q1<sub>B</sub> and Fx. The high structural conservation observed in this region implies that the final answers can only be reached using ever more detailed models and refined calculation methods which will include all participating atoms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Culture conditions</title><p>Cyanobacteria were cultured in BG11 medium supplemented with 10 µg/ml Ferric ammonium citrate, 5 mM glucose and 10 µg/ml chloramphenicol under continuous white light (∼40 µE) in 30°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Strain construction</title><p><italic>Synechocystis</italic> <italic>PsaJ</italic> (amino acids 1–40) and <italic>PsaFΔN</italic> (amino acids 84–165) were amplified by PCR and fused together with a Cys-Ser-Cys linker between them.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Werner Kühlbrandt, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and one of whom, James Barber, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an excellent and well-written paper. Through X-ray crystallography it explores two intriguing facets of photosystem I. (i) It explores the possible role played by the prevalence of photosynthetic PSI genes in marine cyano phages genomes and (ii) it seeks to understand the structural differences between PSI of mesophilic (<italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803) and thermophylic cyanobacteria (<italic>Thermosynechococcus elongatus</italic>) in relation to their optical and functional properties.</p><p>With regard to the first question they have constructed, using genetic engineering, a phage-like PSI (removal of the N terminus of PsaF and fusion psaJ and psaF genes) and determined its structure at 3.8Å. Apparently the consequential and significant conformational changes that occur on the electron donor results in a promiscuous PSI complex able to utilize electrons from a wider range of soluble cytochromes that are normally functional only in respiration.</p><p>The second question has been explored by purifying and crystallizing the monomeric form of PSI from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803. Here the resolution of the structure is better at 2.8Å. Differences between this structure and that published for PSI isolated from <italic>Thermosynechococcus elongatus</italic> are discussed with particular focus on the identification of long wavelength absorbing chlorophylls known as “red chlorophylls”. Several important differences have been identified to explain why <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic> has a higher content of red chlorophylls than <italic>Synechocystis</italic>.</p><p>Fascinating details include the possible identification of the notorious “red” chlorophylls in PS-I, a conserved lipid involved in chlorophyll coordination, and the conserved water cluster in the electron transfer path.</p><p>Nevertheless, the manuscript needs to be revised to address the following concerns:</p><p>1) The presence of entire PS-I genomes in marine cyanophages is intriguing, but the discussion of its biological significance, and of the structure of the phage-mimetic PS-I complex, in this manuscript is slightly disappointing. The manuscript would benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the possible role of the virally-encoded PSI in present-day organisms and in PS-I evolution, rather than referring obliquely to things that are “not at all clear” or “a matter of debate”. What is unclear and what is the debate? What would it take to clarify the issues and resolve the debate?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> is presumably an SDS gel. If so, please state this in the figure legend. Why then does PsaF run at almost twice the mass of the PsaJF fusion protein? Should the fusion protein not be substantially larger than PsaF? Where is PsaJ on the wt gel?</p><p>3) Is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> depth-cued? If yes, please say so in the figure legend. If not, what are the shadowy chlorine rings? Assuming that it is depth-cued, there are at least 4 chlorophylls that are present in the <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic> but not in the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> structure. How can we be sure that these are not the red chlorophylls of <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic>?</p><p>4) The functional or structural role of the conserved water clusters in the electron transfer path deserves a more detailed discussion.</p><p>5) An outline of how the viral PSI was constructed in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> should be provided. How were the PsaJ and PsaF genes replaced by the single, viral PsaJF gene? Did the authors remove the original PsaJ and PsaF genes, and then insert the PsaJF gene? If this is the case, where was the PsaJF gene inserted?

What is unclear and what is the debate? What would it take to clarify the issues and resolve the debate</italic>?</p><p>We have made significant expansions in our discussion on these points, and tried to be as clear and as explicit as possible.</p><p><italic>2)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref> <italic>is presumably an SDS gel. If so, please state this in the figure legend. Why then does PsaF run at almost twice the mass of the PsaJF fusion protein? Should the fusion protein not be substantially larger than PsaF? Where is PsaJ on the wt gel</italic>?</p><p>We have modified the legend to clearly indicate the use of a SDS gel in the figure. The JF fusion is actually ∼20 amino acids shorter than PsaF. In addition, the soluble domain of PsaF was exchanged with the single TM helix of PsaJ and the final protein is much more hydrophobic than PsaF alone. This is the reason for the unusual migration of this polypeptide. We have verified by sequencing and MS analysis that both the DNA and the expressed protein conform to our design and of course the presence of a correct length fusion protein in the structure provides the final proof in this matter. PsaJ as well as the other small subunits of PSI are not resolved in this particular gel setup.</p><p><italic>3) Is</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>depth-cued? If yes, please say so in the figure legend. If not, what are the shadowy chlorine rings? Assuming that it is depth-cued, there are at least 4 chlorophylls that are present in the Thermosynechococcus but not in the Synechocystis structure. How can we be sure that these are not the red chlorophylls of Thermosynechococcus</italic>?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is indeed depth cued and we have now indicated this fact in the legend. We are not sure to which chlorophyll molecules this comment refers to. There are three chlorophylls coordinated by PsaL which are missing from the monomeric structure, and three other chlorophylls are missing from the PSI<sup>PsaJF</sup> model. We have made a composite image that includes all chlorophylls from the high resolution structure and added to it the PsaL coordinated chlorophylls to give a complete picture of the antenna arrangement. In some cases the superposition is close enough so that the rings occupy essentially the same position, which can be confusing. A single peripheral chlorophyll (in addition to B33) is absent from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (numbered M1601 in <italic>Thermosynechococcus,</italic> in the upper left corner of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Strictly speaking this chlorophyll can be red chlorophyll as well. However, our discussion of red chlorophylls is based on chlorophylls pairs, which, based on their ring to ring distances, may be electronically coupled. In that sense chlorophyll 1601 is distant and cannot be affected by other pigments. Other mechanisms for controlling the excitation energy of chlorophylls, such as their interaction with amino acid side chains, cannot be currently predicted and require experimental verification that is outside the scope of the current work.</p><p><italic>4) The functional or structural role of the conserved water clusters in the electron transfer path deserves a more detailed discussion</italic>.</p><p>We have expanded to some extent our discussion on the water cluster. However determination of its potential importance requires additional experiments and computational methods that are well beyond the scope of the current work.</p><p><italic>5) An outline of how the viral PSI was constructed in Synechocystis should be provided. How were the PsaJ and PsaF genes replaced by the single, viral PsaJF gene? Did the authors remove the original PsaJ and PsaF genes, and then insert the PsaJF gene? If this is the case, where was the PsaJF gene inserted? Did the authors also remove the PsaL and PsbI genes, as they were not present in the viral operon</italic>?</p><p>We included a more detailed description of the construction of the PsaJF strain. In short, since PsaF and PsaJ are adjacent to each other in the genome of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> we replaced both genes with the PsaJF gene under the control of the native PsaF promoter. The phrasing of the comment suggests that we used the viral PsaJF gene and we would like to clarify that we fused the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PsaJ and PsaF genes. Other labs conveyed to us that they were unsuccessful in generating a functional PsaJF strain using the viral gene. We used <italic>Synechocystis</italic> genes in order to avoid additional problems in the integration of the modified subunit into the PSI complex and address the question of removing the PsaF N terminus in a more precise manner. A similar strategy was employed, for example, when the importance of the positive patch in the PsaF N terminus was addressed using a chimeric gene made of the N terminus of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> PsaF fused to the PsaF gene of <italic>Synechococcus</italic>.</p><p>PsaL and PsaI are not deleted in the strain used to prepare the monomeric PSI. However, both polypeptides are absent from the complex at very early stages of our preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>) and again the final model leaves no doubt as to their absence. This was a fortuitous discovery made during our attempts to crystalize the complete monomeric form of PSI that are ongoing.</p></body></sub-article></article>
