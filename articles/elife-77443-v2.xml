Their activity has been attributed to DNA double-strand breaks resulting from topoisomerase II poisoning and to eviction of histones from select sites in the genome. Here, we show that the extensively used anthracyclines Doxorubicin, Daunorubicin, and Epirubicin decrease the transcription of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)-dependent gene targets, but not interferon-responsive genes in primary mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) macrophages. Using an NMR-based structural approach, we demonstrate that anthracyclines disturb the complexes formed between the NF-κB subunit RelA and its DNA-binding sites. The anthracycline variants Aclarubicin, Doxorubicinone, and the newly developed Dimethyl-doxorubicin, which share anticancer properties with the other anthracyclines but do not induce DNA damage, also suppressed inflammation, thus uncoupling DNA damage from the effects on inflammation. These findings have implications for anticancer therapy and for the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs with limited side effects for life-threatening conditions such as sepsis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anthracyclines</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>DNA damage response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>647888</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chora</surname><given-names>Angelo Ferreira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/BIMMEC/ 4665/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chora</surname><given-names>Angelo Ferreira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXPL/MED-IMU/0620/2021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neves-Costa</surname><given-names>Ana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXPL/MED-OUT/0745/2021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neves-Costa</surname><given-names>Ana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mechanistic characterization of NF-κB transcription inhibition by anthracyclines opens new possibilities for improved cancer chemotherapy and the treatment of inflammation-driven conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In innate immune cells, including macrophages, the recognition of microbial-associated molecular patterns and non-microbial molecules by specialized germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors activates the transcription of a large number of pro-inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Medzhitov and Horng, 2009</xref>). The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) family of transcription factors, comprising p65/RelA, RelB, c-Rel, p100, and p105, plays a prominent role in regulating inflammatory gene induction while preventing cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hayden and Ghosh, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The most abundant member of the NF-κB family, RelA, is retained in the cytoplasm by the inhibitor protein IκBα. In response to a variety of stimuli, IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation frees RelA for nuclear translocation and DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen and Greene, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh and Baltimore, 1990</xref>). RelA-dependent IκBα re-synthesis is required for RelA nuclear eviction and the timely termination of NF-κB-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beg and Baldwin, 1993</xref>). NF-κB sustained activity can perpetuate inflammation and contribute to the pathogenesis of many chronic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldwin, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Anthracyclines, mostly Doxorubicin, have been used for many decades against a wide variety of cancers (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hande, 1998</xref>). These anticancer drugs target topoisomerase II (TopoII), thereby inducing DNA damage, including DNA double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tewey et al., 1984</xref>). The stabilization of the otherwise transient TopoII–DNA complex by anthracyclines activates DNA damage responses (DDRs) and ultimately senescence or programmed cell death by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nitiss, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eom et al., 2005</xref>). Other biological activities of anthracyclines with potential clinical impact include DNA intercalation, helicase inhibition, and free radical formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hande, 1998</xref>). More recently, anthracyclines were shown to evict histones from discrete chromosomal regions and to contribute to apoptosis in a TopoII-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that anthracyclines induce disease tolerance to infection in vivo. In mouse models of sepsis, low doses of anthracyclines, such as Epirubicin, led to less severe disease and decreased mortality independently of circulating and organ pathogen load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Figueiredo et al., 2013</xref>). We further found that ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated), a master DNA damage sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maréchal and Zou, 2013</xref>), is required for Epirubicin-mediated disease tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Figueiredo et al., 2013</xref>). In breast cancer cells, Epirubicin was already known to activate ATM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Millour et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to roles in DDRs, ATM participates in a complex network of signaling pathways that intersect with NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piret et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). One central finding in Epirubicin-treated septic animals, which we also observed in the monocytic cell line THP-1 challenged with pro-inflammatory stimuli, was the strong suppression of cytokine secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Figueiredo et al., 2013</xref>).

Here, we investigate how low doses of anthracyclines regulate the pro-inflammatory transcriptional program in primary mouse macrophages and ask whether the DNA damaging activities of anthracyclines are required for the transcriptional downregulation of cytokines and other pro-inflammatory mediators.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cytokine secretion and DNA damage</title><p>We investigated the role of DDRs in cytokine downregulation induced by anthracyclines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Figueiredo et al., 2013</xref>).

Using the alkaline comet assay to detect strand breaks, we observed that DNA damage caused by Epi was time- and dose dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We then quantified the DNA damage using phosphorylation of histone H2AX at Ser139 (γH2AX) as a surrogate marker. In BMDMs, DNA damage was strongly induced by Epi in the range of concentrations that modulated cytokine production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and was comparable to that of Etoposide (Eto), another well-studied TopoII inhibitor that causes DNA breaks and induces ATM-mediated DDRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caporossi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banáth and Olive, 2003</xref>). γH2AX levels also showed that the inflammatory challenge did not induce significant extra DNA damage in the conditions used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The lack of interdependency between DNA damage and cytokine modulation was then assessed for other anthracyclines. These drugs all share a tetracycline ring decorated with one or multiple amino sugars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and their activities range from failing to induce DNA breaks to being potent inducers of double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pang et al., 2013</xref>). Eto is not a member of the anthracycline class but inhibits TopoII like Doxo and Epi. We quantified the DNA damage induced by the different anthracyclines in BMDMs and observed that whereas Epi and the closely related Doxorubicin (Doxo) led to a dose-dependent increase inγH2AX signal, Aclarubicin (Acla) and Doxorubicinone (Doxo-none) did not induce significant damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, E</xref>). The comet assay further established that DNA damage caused by Acla is comparable to the basal damage in untreated cells, in sharp contrast with the highly damaging effects of Epi and Eto (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Acla and Doxo-none were then tested for their ability to regulate cytokines. Acla was very strong at downregulating all the cytokines tested at concentrations without significant toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>). Whereas downregulation of TNF and IL12 was a common property of the anthracyclines tested, Doxo-none was less potent than Epi, Doxo, and Acla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Doxo-none differs from the other anthracyclines for not inducing DNA breaks nor histone eviction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qiao et al., 2020</xref>). To further uncouple the DDR from cytokine modulation by anthracyclines we tested whether Eto and a variant of Doxo, Dimethyl-doxorubicin (diMe-Doxo), could also downregulate cytokines. diMe-Doxo was made incapable of causing DNA damage while leaving histone eviction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qiao et al., 2020</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref> shows that TNF was not downregulated by Eto but was by diMe-Doxo. In line with this observation, none of the anthracyclines tested regulated cytokine production differently in <italic>Atm</italic><sup>−/−</sup> BMDMs or in the presence of the ATM inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F–I</xref>). Therefore, structural damage to DNA alone is unlikely to explain the observed effect of anthracyclines on cytokine secretion. Instead, the control of cytokine secretion upon inflammatory challenges is likely to be more associated with the histone eviction activity of the anthracyclines.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Anthracyclines negatively regulate the transcription of NF-κB target genes</title><p>Before dissecting the molecular mechanisms of cytokine downregulation by anthracyclines, we investigated the in vivo effects of the administration of these drugs in a model of septic shock. To this end, we co-administered Epi or Acla to mice that were challenged with <italic>E. coli</italic>. We found that the circulating levels of TNF were significantly decreased in mice treated with either Epi or Acla for 8 hr following the initial challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting physiological relevance for our findings. We then investigated the effects of anthracyclines on transcription and their dependence on DNA damage. We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in BMDMs pre-treated with either Epi or Acla and challenged thereafter with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By comparing mRNA levels of untreated with those of 4 hr LPS-treated BMDMs, we detected strong induction of pro-inflammatory gene expression, in line with the well-described patterns of transcriptional regulation in response to this TLR4 agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 1). Differential expression analysis revealed 455 genes at least fivefold upregulated in LPS-treated BMDMs compared with untreated, whereas only 75 genes were downregulated to the same extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The transcriptomes also pointed to specific gene expression signatures by Epi and Acla, partly overlapping but not identical, both in unstimulated BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 2 and 3) and in the presence of LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). This could be due to different genomic location preferences between these drugs, as shown for Acla versus Daunorubicin (Dauno; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pang et al., 2015</xref>). As anticipated from the cytokine secretion results, repression of target genes by Acla was stronger than by Epi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, compare lanes 4 and 5). Functional enrichment analysis showed that both Epi and Acla repress cytokine production, among other effector functions of macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). The fact that both Epi and Acla regulate inflammatory gene expression also supports a DNA damage-independent mechanism. Quantitative RT-PCR corroborated the downregulation of <italic>Tnf</italic>, <italic>Il12</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, and <italic>Cxcl10</italic> by both Epi and Acla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and also of a broader subset of pro-inflammatory mediators, including <italic>Nfkbia</italic>, the gene encoding the RelA inhibitor IκBα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We then searched for promoter motifs in repressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang and Nevins, 2006</xref>) and, not surprisingly, we detected an NF-κB signature shared by genes mutually downregulated by Epi and Acla. We extended the RT-PCR analysis to other TLR4-induced transcriptional programs, namely IRF-dependent interferon transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kawai and Akira, 2007</xref>). IRF3-dependent <italic>Ifnb1</italic> transcription was strongly induced by <italic>E. coli</italic> as expected, but not downregulated by Epi or Acla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In agreement, IFNβ secretion was also not suppressed by the anthracyclines tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). <italic>Ifna1</italic> and <italic>Ifna4</italic> transcription, typically mediated by virally induced receptors such as TLRs7/9, was not induced, nor was the expression of these genes further downregulated by Epi or Acla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In combination, these results indicate that anthracyclines do not compromise the overall cellular transcription. Instead, the transcriptional profiles point to a negative effect of Epi and Acla specifically on NF-κB-regulated gene expression. This is compatible with previous observations that the anthracyclines Doxo and Dauno repress TNF-induced NF-κB transactivation in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ho et al., 2005</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Anthracyclines lower circulating TNF levels in an in vivo model of sepsis and downregulate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)-dependent transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TNF concentrations in serum 8 hr post <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge in mice treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, <italic>n</italic> = 7), Epirubicin (Epi, <italic>n</italic> = 9), or Aclarubicin (Acla, <italic>n</italic> = 8).

The effect of anthracyclines on NF-κB-dependent gene expression is therefore likely to be caused by changes in transcription and not due to regulation of mRNA stability.</p><p>To further address transcriptional regulation by anthracyclines, we used a κB luciferase reporter assay in HEK293 cells. We started by testing whether RelA is required for reporter induction in these cells following inflammatory stimulation and for that we decided to knock out RelA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Not surprisingly, RelA KO compromised cell viability and therefore these cells were only used immediately after CRISPR/Cas9 editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). As expected, reporter expression was induced several times in CRISPR control cells after stimulation with TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). However, the expression in RelA KO was very similar to the basal expression of the reporter without any stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>), which suggested that RelA is critical for luciferase expression. We also tested the requirement of RelA for endogenous gene expression and observed that, similar to the reporter, induction of the TNF gene is largely dependent on RelA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Our observations are compatible with RelA being the main factor required for NF-κB-mediated pro-inflammatory transcription and therefore we tested whether Epi, Doxo, and Acla were able to regulate reporter expression induced by RelA overexpression. We co-transfected the reporter together with a vector expressing full-length RelA and observed considerable induction of luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), which was markedly inhibited by the anthracyclines Epi, Doxo, and Acla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

We therefore asked whether the downregulation of NF-κB targets by anthracyclines was due to impaired RelA nuclear translocation. We observed that RelA nuclear levels in untreated BMDMs rapidly increased following inflammatory challenge and RelA slowly relocated overtime, being mostly cytoplasmic 4 h after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, control panel). In BMDMs exposed to Epi, RelA translocated to the nucleus upon <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge, but despite decreased NF-κB-dependent gene expression, RelA remained nuclear at all time points analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, Epi panel).

To test if increased proteasome-dependent degradation by anthracyclines also contributes to low IκBα levels, we examined IκBα degradation kinetics upon inhibition of the proteasome. While blockage of proteasome activity by MG-132 increased IκBα protein levels upon de novo synthesis following <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, upper panel), IκBαin cells pre-exposed to Epi never recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lower panel). It is therefore unlikely that IκBα regulation by Epi is due to any role for the anthracyclines in proteasomal activity. Our data suggest that anthracyclines are capable of breaking the critical negative feedback loop that maintains the cellular responsiveness to subsequent inflammatory stimuli due to their role in repressing <italic>NFKBIA</italic> mRNA expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Epirubicin and Aclarubicin regulate NF-κB binding to its targets</title><p>We further investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) how anthracyclines suppress NF-κB-dependent pro-inflammatory programs. Firstly, we established that the effects of anthracyclines in BMDMs could be replicated in HEK293 cells without affecting cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). ChIP was then performed at the promoter of selected NF-κB target genes in HEK293 cells. We observed that RelA binding following inflammatory activation was weakened by pre-treatment with Epi and Acla, ranging from a small reduction in binding to statistically significant impairments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <italic>TNF</italic> and <italic>NFKBIA</italic> promoters). In contrast, binding of RelA to the <italic>IFNB1</italic> promoter was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, right). Recruitment of RNA PolII to promoters of NF-κB target genes, including <italic>NFKBIA</italic>, was also compromised by Epi and in a more pronounced and statistically significant way, by Acla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results are consistent with previous observations that Doxo treatment strongly reduced the association between RelA and DNA, which was proposed to be a consequence of defective post-transcriptional modifications in NF-κB subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ho et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, Doxo is also responsible for the reduced recruitment of at least one other transcription factor, HIF-1α, to its targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>RelA consists of a REL-homology domain (RHD) and a transactivation domain (TAD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The RHD includes the DNA-binding domain (DBD), the dimerization domain (DD), and the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Toledano et al., 1993</xref>). We asked which RelA domain is targeted by Epi. For that, two different chimeric DNA constructs were tested: (1) RelA RHD fused to a TAD derived from the Herpes simplex virus VP16 protein (RelA (2-320)-VP16); and (2) DBD from the bacterial tetracycline repressor (TET) fused to the RelA TAD (TET-RelA (286-551)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anrather et al., 1999</xref>). As observed for full-length RelA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), Epi significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of RelA (2-320)-VP16, as quantified in HEK293 cells transiently co-transfected with the κB luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). However, Epi failed to inhibit the transcriptional activity of both TET-RelA (286-551) and TET fused to VP16 (TET-VP16) construct, as observed using a tetracycline operon luciferase (tet°-luc) reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These results suggest that Epi compromises RelA transcriptional activity by targeting the RHD. Since Epi does not affect the TAD, this result points to a mechanism of action different from NF-κB regulation by Doxo and Dauno in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Epirubicin and Aclarubicin bind to a κB-33 promoter sequence</title><p>To understand how anthracyclines affect binding of NF-κB to its targets, we used NMR and biophysical experiments.

Most of the anthracyclines have a preference for GC- or TG-rich sequences, with the aglycon chromophore of the anthracyclines intercalating at a pyrimidine–purine step, and the sugar part interacting with the DNA minor groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaires, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frederick et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Temperini et al., 2003</xref>).

Dimers of NF-κB factors, including RelA/p65, are known to activate a wide variety of genes by binding to (multi)-κB sites at the promoters of target genes (<italic>1</italic>). Our work shows for the first time that anthracyclines, including Epirubicin (Epi) and Aclarubicin (Acla), form complexes with the NF-κB factor RelA/p65 which may compromise activation of target genes by NF-κB (<italic>2</italic>). We also show that these effects of the anthracyclines are independent of their roles in DNA damage. Anthracyclines are DNA-binding drugs and our data suggest that κB sites also participate in the anthracycline–RelA/p65 complexes. More work, in particular structural studies as the ones we present here, are required to establish the order of formation of these DNA–Anthracycline–RelA/p65 complexes and the rules they obey. Importantly, anthracycline interactions with RelA/p65 are likely to limit the extent of pro-inflammatory responses, which may have beneficial consequences in conditions associated with exacerbated inflammation.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77443-fig5-figsupp4-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig5s5" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 5—figure supplement 5.</label><caption><title>Model of the effect of anthracyclines on RelA RHD binding to the κB-33 promoter DNA.</title><p>(Left) The RelA dimer binds tightly to DNA with a nM affinity.

Addition of anthracyclines to RelA titrated with DNA caused chemical shift perturbations and line-broadening beyond detection of some backbone resonances consistent with Epi and Acla perturbing the RelA–DNA complex but not disrupting it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, compare green and red spectra) as the final spectra (green) do not resemble the free RelA spectrum (black). The RelA residues affected by the addition of the anthracyclines largely coincide with the DNA-binding region. Amino acid residues in RelA–DNA complex particularly affected by Epi were 50R, 56K, 62K, 78T, 79K, 88H, 89E, 119Q, 129A, and 157V in the DBD and 192A, 245H, 250I, and 268V in the DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, left). Addition of Acla to RelA–DNA complexes caused precipitation of the protein, which made measurements difficult. Yet, residues 88H, 119Q, 129A, and 186N in the DBD and 245H in the DD could be analyzed and were altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right). Furthermore, addition of Epi to the RelA–DNA complex caused NMR chemical shift changes for some backbone amide signals in RelA (268V, 250I, and 50R) toward an unbound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, left zoom-in), an effect that was not observed upon Acla addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, right zoom-in). Because the final spectra are not identical (compare green spectra in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), Epi and Acla are expected to have different effects on the RelA–DNA complex. Differences in binding likely reflect the distinct chemical moieties involved, particularly because Acla contains three sugar rings while Epi contains one. In fact, studies showed that the sugar moieties of the anthracyclines bind to the minor groove of the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Temperini et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaires, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frederick et al., 1990</xref>). This may be compatible with the 3D structure of RelA-κB-33 (PDB code 1RAM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>), with the TG sequences at the end of the DNA duplex and with the accessible minor groove being able to accommodate the anthracycline sugars and in close vicinity of DD. Indeed, our results suggest that Epi and Acla bind to RelA through their sugar parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, addition of Epi to RelA followed by addition of DNA led to different spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>, compare red and green spectra), suggesting that the final complexes are slightly different. In the case of Acla spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>, compare red and green spectra), the interpretation is compromised because addition of Acla to RelA leads to protein precipitation, and the final spectrum obtained after DNA addition (green) is therefore much weaker than its counterpart (red).</p><p>To further explore how anthracyclines affect the RelA–DNA complex we performed ITC competition experiments. The binding affinities of DNA to a pre-formed complex of RelA with Epi (980 nM) or Acla (740 nM) were weaker than the binding affinities of the DNA to the protein alone (230 nM) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, the thermodynamic features of the interaction were different: binding of DNA to RelA is entropy driven and endothermic (positive Δ<italic>H</italic>), while binding of DNA to RelA incubated with anthracyclines is enthalpy driven and exothermic (negative Δ<italic>H</italic>). Surprisingly, when DNA with a twofold excess of Epi was titrated to the protein, the binding affinity decreased dramatically from a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 230 to 1900 nM but the reaction is similarly endothermic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that when the anthracyclines–DNA complex is formed, binding to RelA is mainly affected.</p><p>We also tested a potential direct binding between anthracyclines and RelA. We did not observe any binding by ITC, likely because this method is not suitable for very weak interactions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We did not observe significant RelA backbone amide changes after the addition of anthracyclines in 2D-TROSY NMR protein spectra, indicating that Epi and Acla bind very weakly to the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Binding to RelA, though weak, is mediated through the sugar part of the anthracyclines, as observed in saturation transfer difference (STD) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). In agreement, Doxo-none, which lacks the sugar moiety, did not bind to RelA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have studied the effect of anthracyclines on NF-κB controlled inflammatory responses. At very low concentrations, this anticancer family of drugs suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory signals in mouse macrophages. Using biophysical methods and NMR we found that anthracyclines directly inhibit the binding of the NF-κB family member RelA to the DNA in a manner that contributes to the resolution of inflammation. Taking advantage of a series of dedicated anthracycline variants with defined activities, we dissociated the DNA damaging from the histone eviction activities, therefore uncoupling the anti-inflammatory effect from the classical DDR.</p><p>Despite the general notion that anthracyclines induce NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic gene expression when used as chemotherapeutic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arlt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janssens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Van Antwerp et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 1996</xref>), Doxo and Dauno have also been described as repressors of NF-κB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ho et al., 2005</xref>). The outcomes of anthracycline treatments are likely dependent on cell- and tumor type. Using transcriptomics in macrophages, we found that only a very small proportion of inflammation-driven genes were upregulated by either Epi or Acla while none of the anti-apoptotic factors tested, including cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs), were affected. Instead, we detected downregulation of a broad range of NF-κB-induced genes in Epi- or Acla-treated macrophages. Even if the affinity of the binding to κB sites is not directly linked to transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mulero et al., 2017</xref>) our results showed that Epi- and Acla treatments reduced the binding of RelA and of PolII to κB sites upon pro-inflammatory stimulation, which implies a novel role for the anthracyclines in counteracting NF-κB activity.</p><p>Because Epi is protective in sepsis through ATM-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Figueiredo et al., 2013</xref>), and due to the genotoxicity of this class of drugs, we asked whether cytokine regulation by anthracyclines depended on the induction of DDRs. We observed that pro-inflammatory gene expression orchestrated by NF-κB was still downregulated by Acla, Doxo-none, and the newly developed diMe-Doxo, a group of anthracyclines that do not cause DNA damage in the concentrations used. Furthermore, cytokine suppression by anthracyclines was observed when we used an ATM inhibitor and <italic>Atm<sup>−/−</sup></italic> BMDMs, indicating independence from the DDR. Finally, other DNA damaging drugs such as Eto did not modulate cytokine production. Together, these observations suggested that regulation of NF-κB-dependent transcription by anthracyclines does not rely on the induction of DNA damage. Whereas anthracyclines are believed to work in cancer because of the induction of DNA double-strand breaks, anthracyclines that lack DNA damaging activity, such as Acla, are also effective in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qiao et al., 2020</xref>). Clearly, other activities, such as chromatin damage caused by histone eviction, contribute to the anti-tumor role of the anthracyclines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). It is likely that regulation of NF-κB also proves to be important for the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs.</p><p>But can we understand how anthracyclines control NF-κB? Both Epi and Acla interacted with DNA bases within the κB motif, probably intercalating between the TG bases, which disturbed the complexes between RelA and its DNA-binding sites (models of these interactions are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). The anthracyclines sugars also interact weakly with RelA, promoting the formation of a ternary complex between anthracyclines, DNA and RelA. The RelA residues targeted by Epi and Acla localized within the RHD, which corroborated the reporter assays. Whereas Epi and Acla perturbed the binding of RelA to DNA differently, the structural results did not explain why Acla is the strongest regulator of NF-κB-dependent transcription. The extra sugars in Acla may be responsible for the stronger interactions but it will be important to do a careful dissection of the structural features contributing to the efficient Acla-mediated NF-κB transcriptional suppression. Not surprisingly, Doxo-none – that lacks the sugar moiety – did not bind to RelA and was a weaker modulator of <italic>TNF</italic> transcription when compared with Epi, Doxo, and Acla. However, diMe-Doxo, with a sugar moiety that resembles both Epi (contains only one sugar) and Acla (the amine group is dimethylated), was also weaker than the classical anthracyclines at regulating the genes tested. We are currently investigating its RelA and DNA-binding properties to uncover potential new rules affecting complex formation. In cells, the engagement of RelA and other NF-κB factors with κB sites is highly dynamic and regulated by chromatin organization and other nuclear factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mulero et al., 2017</xref>). It will also be important to explore promoter-specific effects.</p><p>To conclude, we showed that the control of inflammatory responses by anthracyclines does not require their DNA damage effects. The novel role in NF-κB suppression, although with different efficacies, is common to all anthracyclines tested independently of DNA damage capabilities. We thus uncovered a new mechanism of action for the anthracycline class of anti-cancer drugs that can inform applications in situations of uncontrolled inflammatory responses, such as sepsis. Limiting pro-inflammatory gene expression through NF-κB modulation may have been an overlooked aspect of Epi, Doxo, and Acla with a fundamental role in the clinical success of these drugs. Future therapeutic strategies are expected to focus on anthracyclines without DNA damaging activities, in an attempt to overcome the severe side effects of these drugs. Indeed, diMe-Doxo and Acla, both lacking DNA damage activity, are not cardiotoxic and do not induce second tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qiao et al., 2020</xref>). These could therefore be more suitable for controlling sepsis and other inflammatory responses. Importantly, low doses seem to be sufficient to prompt this regulatory effect.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (male <italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">JAX:000664</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (male <italic>Mus musculus,</italic> background C57BL/6J)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Atm<sup>−/−</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borghesani et al., 2000</xref> doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.97.7.3336">10.1073/pnas.97.7.3336</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">From Frederick W.

The samples were run in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM DTT with a concentration of 2 mg/ml for the protein and at ratios of 1:2 protein:DNA and of 1:2:6 protein:DNA:anthracyclines at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The molecular masses of the samples were calculated from the refractive index and right-angle light-scattering signals using Omnisec (Malvern Instruments). The SLS detector was calibrated with a 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution with 66.4 kDa for the BSA monomer and a d<italic>n</italic>/d<italic>c</italic> value of 0.185 ml/g for all protein samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Isothermal titration calorimetry</title><p>ITC measurements were carried out at 25°C using a MicroCal PEAQ-ITC (Malvern Instruments Ltd). The titrations were performed in 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM mercaptoethanol and 1% DMSO. The calorimetric titration consisted of 19 injections of 1.5 μl of a 125 µM DNA sample, into the reaction cell containing 400 μl of 25 μM RelA or to 25 μM RelA with 200 μM Epirubicin/Aclarubicin, at a stirring speed of 1000 rpm. The heat of dilution was obtained by titrating DNA into the sample cell containing only buffer and this was subsequently subtracted from each experimental titration. For evaluating the effect of Epirubicin bound to DNA on binding to RelA, a calorimetric titration consisted of 19 injections of 1.5 μl of a 125 µM DNA with 250 µM Epirubicin mixture, into the reaction cell containing 400 μl of 25 μM RelA. For the determination of the binding affinity of the compounds to the DNA, a calorimetric titration was performed consisting of 19 injections of 1.5 μl of a 500 µM compound sample, into the reaction cell containing 400 μl of 50 μM DNA. The heat of dilution was obtained by titrating compound into the sample cell containing only buffer and this was subsequently subtracted from each experimental titration. For the determination of the binding affinity of the DNA to the protein, a calorimetric titration was performed consisting of 19 injections of 1.5 μl of a 125 µM DNA sample, into the reaction cell containing 400 μl of 25 μM RelA. The ITC data were analyzed using the MICROCAL PEAQ-ITC analysis software provided by Malvern.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional

All three reviewers agreed that the study has several important implications for anticancer therapy and can contribute to the future development of more efficacious anthracycline drugs with less side effects (DNA damage), therefore reducing their systemic toxicity to potentially improving their anticancer efficacy in patients. The reviewers also stressed that the impact of the findings can extend to other inflammation-associated pathologies, including sepsis, where the new mechanism described may help the development of low-toxicity therapies to suppress inflammation. In line with these observations by the reviewers, our group is a leading participant in a recently initiated clinical trial to assess the potential benefits of Epirubicin in the treatment of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05033808).</p><p>Whereas Reviewers #1 and #3 were perfectly satisfied with the depth of the results presented regarding the composition of the NF-κB complexes studied and have not suggested additional experimental work, Reviewer#2 requested more data addressing the possibility that other NF-κB family members may be differently targeted by anthracyclines. Despite being a highly studied transcription factor with well-described oncogenic roles, individual functions of NF-κB subunits, including the particular role of RelA/p65 homodimers, has received very limited attention. In addition, comprehensive cell-specific NF-κB inhibiting information is not available, so we were not able to favor a particular NF-κB family member in our study based on any evidence of possible prominent roles in macrophages. Instead, we chose to study RelA/p65 due to its ubiquity and because “p65 is the transcriptionally active component of the NF-κB species that is most abundant and has the broadest function”, as stated in a comprehensive review dedicated to the DNA binding specificities of each of the NF-κB family members (Wan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009). To address the concerns of Reviewer#2 we performed a vast series of new experiments, as detailed below. Whereas final and conclusive responses to these longstanding problems, some of which have been elusive for the past four decades, are beyond the scope of our original manuscript, we are confident that our work now allows for a better understanding of the contribution of the NF-κB family member RelA to the gene expression programs induced by inflammatory challenge and, consequently, of the effects of anthracyclines on NF-κB-regulated genes. As Reviewer#2 pointed out, our study opens new avenues for the understanding of the intricate physiological attributes of NF-κB.</p><p>Finally, the reviewers unanimously pointed out that the studies were well-conducted and that the interpretations and conclusions were supported by the data displayed; moreover, the reviewers considered that the main outcomes of the experiments performed help not only to explain prior results by others, but also add considerable novelty to the NF-κB field by exposing previously unknown molecular mechanisms.</p><p>Point by point:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The data are convincing as depicted by the in vivo and in vitro panels in the figures.</p><p>Introduction should be more focused on anti-tumoral drugs and the part related to TLRs and NFkB should be shorted.

Anthracycline-dependent, and DNA damage/ATM-independent, inhibition of inflammatory genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> or LPS stimulated BMDM is generally convincing from dose response studies with sufficient replicates and statistical analyses. However, whether this inhibition in BMDMs (e.g., all the genes shown in Figure 2B) is RelA-dependent or not was not investigated and thus remains unconvincing. LPS stimulation of BMDMs would activate p50/RelA heterodimers and cRel-containing NF-κB complexes but the authors focused only on RelA (RelA homodimer) in the remainder of the investigation. Experimental evidence needs to be provided, such as knockdown or knockout studies, to demonstrate the RelA requirement for anthracycline effects shown in Figure 2B. Moreover, luciferase reporter studies shown in Figure 2F needs to evaluate other NF-κB family members to demonstrate specificity, especially p50+RelA and cRel (+/-p50). If cRel is also affected by anthracycline, the relevance of the rest of the studies, especially NMR studies, focusing on RelA homodimer to the mechanism involved in BMDM becomes highly questionable.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer#2 pointed out that our work did not clearly establish that the anthracycline-dependent phenotype observed in mouse macrophages is specifically mediated by RelA/p65, namely in limiting cytokine production following pro-inflammatory stimuli. While it is known that Rel proteins are obligate dimers and that LPS is able to activate more than one NF-κB dimer, including RelA/p65 homodimers but also heterodimers formed with other NF-κB factors, the specific contribution of each NF-κB complex to cell responses is not known and has remained elusive for the past decades.</p><p>KO studies to test requirement of RelA/p65 for anthracycline effects</p><p>In our manuscript, we decided to focus on RelA/p65 because this is a very abundant subunit, ubiquitous, and the most well-studied NF-κB factor. The importance of RelA/p65 is evident in RelA−/− animals, which are embryonic lethal (Geisler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007). Reviewer#2 requested additional experiments to demonstrate RelA/p65 requirement for the anthracycline effects on transcriptional regulation of pro-inflammatory genes (“Experimental evidence needs to be provided, such as knockdown or knockout studies, to demonstrate the RelA requirement for anthracycline effects shown in Figure 2B.”), and so we decided to perform new experiments. We started by knocking out NF-κB subunits independently in HEK293 cells: RelA/p65, p50 and c-Rel. We did not attempt to perform KOs of these subunits in BMDMs, as we have observed in the past that transfection of these cells, as well as performing viral-mediated nucleic acid delivery, compromises their intrinsic properties, in particular the extent to which pro-inflammatory responses are activated following stimulation by external challenges. In the future we plan to use primary macrophages from KO mouse models instead, which will be the focus of a subsequent manuscript by our laboratory (discussed below). Here, and according to our revision plan, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the NF-κB factors in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), which also allowed us to perform reporter gene assays using the same reporter as before to complement the assay in Figure 2F of the manuscript. We did not select individual KO clones after CRISPR/Cas9 because knocking out these subunits is known to compromise cell viability. Therefore, we worked with populations composed of 63 to 75% of KO cells and we were only able to use them immediately after CRISPR/Cas9, as the KO cells tended to die and to be outnumbered by the healthy cells in the population over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The protocols and the CRISPR/Cas9 tools are described in the Methods section at the end of this response.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>CRISPR/Cas 9 mediated KOs of NF-κB, subunits in HEK293 cells as described in the methods section of this reply.</title><p>The resulting populations were tested, at week one post KO, for RNA levels and protein expression of the different subunits. For one round of deletions that we show as an example, we concluded from our and a quantifications that the KO cells in the population were 71% in the case of RelA/p65, 63% in the case of p50 and 75% in the case of c-Rel (A). The percentage of KO cells in the population tended to decrease overtime, as assessed by RNA (B), and for this were only cultured for short periods following gene editing. These KOs were corroborated at the protein level, as shown by WB (C), except for c-Rel, as the antibody that we had available was only able to detect overexpression of the protein (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>) and we were never able to detect the much lower levels of the endogenous c-Rel protein.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77443-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We then used the KO cell populations to test the effect of anthracyclines on NF-κB-regulated endogenous gene expression. As reported in Figure 2B of the manuscript for BMDMs, endogenous pro-inflammatory gene expression was also downregulated by Epi in CRISPR controls, as shown by TNF mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, compare the two blue arrows). In RelA/p65 KO cells, very low levels of TNF mRNA induction were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, red arrow), which strongly suggests that RelA/p65 is required for TNF expression and, therefore, for any modulatory effects on that expression, including the effects of anthracyclines. To further substantiate the RelA/p65 requirement for anthracycline effects, we did not detect any decrease in TNF mRNA expression levels in p50 KO or c-Rel KO cells upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, light gray arrows), strongly pointing to RelA/p65-containing NF-κB complexes being the main or sole drivers of TNF transcriptional induction, in our experimental conditions. It is likely that a previously described compensatory effect is responsible for the increased RelA/p65 activity in p50 KO and c-Rel KO cells, which leads to increased induction of TNF mRNA in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, light gray arrows). As a final evidence that RelA/p65 is the NF-κB factor mediating anthracycline effects, we observed that Epi was able to downregulate TNF mRNA expression both in p50 KO and in c-Rel KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, dark gray arrows).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Effects of epirubicin (Epi) on endogeneous TNF expression as assessed by nRNA levels.</title><p>CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO populations of HEK293 cells (rel/p65 KO, p50 KO, c-Rel KO, and CRISPR control) which generated as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> and were either treated with vehicle or with 2µM of Epi for 4 hours. TNF was added to the medium 1 hour after Epi or cells were left out without any stimulus. mRNA levels of TNF were quantified by qRT-PCR in two independent experiments. One representative experiment is shown with averages and standard deviations of technical replicates.

In RelA/p65-deficient cells, the kB-luciferase reporter was not substantially induced by TNF, compared with up to 6x induction of luciferase by TNF in CRISPR control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Because of the lack of reporter expression in RelA/p65 KO cells, it was not possible to test the effects of Epi on reporter gene expression in the RelA/p65 KO cell population. We consider this result to be a strong indication that the kB reporter gene inductions reported in the manuscript are largely due to RelA/p65 and therefore anthracyclines require RelA/p65 for their effects in the luciferase reporter assays. As discussed above, a RelA/p65 compensatory effect was detected in p50 KO cells, leading to luciferase levels slightly above control. On the contrary, in c-Rel KO cells the luciferase signal was not as high as in control cells, which suggests that c-Rel is responsible for a small part of reporter induction, although considerably less prominent than the induction by RelA/p65, the main regulator of TNF-induced luciferase expression in this system.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Effects of NF-κB subunits on reporter gene expression.</title><p>HEK293 KO cells (rel/p65 KO, p50 KO, c-Rel KO, and CRISPR control) were stimulated with TNF 4h or 8h and the induction of the luciferase reporter was assessed as fold change over empty vector control.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77443-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Specificity assessed by overexpression of NF-κB factors in luciferase reporter assays</p><p>The data showed above already started to address the next concern of Reviewer#2, in particular that “luciferase reporter studies shown in Figure 2F need to evaluate other NF-κB family members to demonstrate specificity”. To further investigate this, we co-transfected the NF-κB luciferase reporter (the same vector used in Figure 2F of the manuscript and already used above) together with expression vectors for each of the human full-length NF-κB family members: RelA/p65 (as before, in Figure 2F of the manuscript); p50, and c-Rel (see Methods section at the end of this response). After optimizing the overexpression conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref> A and B), we tested luciferase induction. We observed that both RelA/p65 alone or double overexpression of RelA/p65 and p50 strongly induced the reporter gene to comparable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4C</xref> and D). As expected, overexpression of p50 homodimers did not induce the luciferase reporter, as this subunit lacks the transactivation domain (TAD) and so it must partner with TAD-containing subunits, such as RelA/p65 or c-Rel, to activate transcription (Figure 4A and C, Hoffmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003). We observed that c-Rel overexpression induced transcription only marginally (less than 10x), both alone or in combination with p50 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4A</xref> and C). Double overexpression of RelA/p65 and c-Rel was less efficient at transcriptional activation than RelA/p65 overexpression alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4C</xref>). Our data seems to corroborate previous observations that c-Rel inhibits pro-inflammatory transcription by RelA/p65 (de Jesus <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020)<bold>.</bold> Because c-Rel homodimers are either weak transcriptional activators or repressors in our system, even without any anthracycline treatment, we excluded the possibility that c-Rel is required for the anthracycline effects reported in the manuscript. Levels of protein overexpression of the NF-κB subunits in the conditions used were assessed by WB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref> A-C). Importantly, when RelA/p65 was overexpressed simultaneously with p50, a condition that led to strong induction of the reporter gene as discussed above, we observed that both subunits maintained their overexpression at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5C</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>NF-κB subunits were overexpressed either alone or two subunits were simultaneously overexpressed and the induction of the luciferase reporter was assessed as fold change over empty vector control.</title><p>Transfection conditions for reporter and NF-κB subunits were optimised over time (A) and the total amount of transfected DNA was transfected (B) to find the optimal conditions for luciferase signal detection within non-saturating conditions. First, the reporter vector was transfected into HEK293 cells and 24h later the vectors for the overexpressions of the subunits were transacted. Luciferase was read at several time points (eventually we decided to read luciferase signals at 24 hours post transfection, A) and with different amounts of transfected DNA 150 ng of total DNA was chosen as the preferred DNA amount, (B). (C) Both single overexpressions and overexpressions of two subunits simultaneously were performed; overexpression of combinations of two NF-κB subunits aimed at promoting the formation of heterodimers – although we cannot exclude that only homodiners formed in these conditions. (D) We tested luciferase induction after overexpressing combinations of the subunits, D, luciferase induction after the combined overexpression of RelA/p65 and p50 was tested several times in addition to the experiment shown in C; luciferase induction following the double transactions was comparable to the induction by RelA/p65 alone, as shown in three independent experiments, in addition to the experiment in C.

Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that only RelA/p65 homodimers were inhibited by Epi and that the RelA/p65-p50 heterodimers formed did not suffer from Epi inhibition and were still able to activate transcription; in this case, and taking into consideration the strong effects of Epi towards inhibition of NF-κB targets that we report in the manuscript, RelA/p65-p50 heterodimers could not account for the majority of the NF-κB complexes in cells.</p><fig id="sa2fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>RelA/p65 was overexpressed either alone or simultaneously with p50 and the induction of the luciferase reporter was assessed as fold induction over empty vector control after incubation with several concentrations of AP from stock transactions were performed as described in the previous Author response images, Epi or vehicle were added 24h post transfection of the subunits and luciferase signal was read at 16h post Epi.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77443-sa2-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>RNA-seq analysis to further explore specificity</p><p>From our KO studies and reporter gene assays described above, we could not establish if Epi is able to regulate c-Rel targets or if p50 is also targeted by Epi when in a complex with RelA/p65. To definitely address the question of whether anthracyclines can also regulate targets of NF-κB independently of RelA, we decided to focus on those genes with expression strongly driven by c-Rel or p50 overexpressions, the most likely endogenous targets of c-Rel and p50-containing NF-κB transcriptional complexes. To identify such genes, we performed RNA-seq in HEK293 cells overexpressing the different subunits alone and also in cells with the combined overexpression of RelA/p65 and p50, as this condition also led to strong transcriptional induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4C</xref>).

This work in progress also aims to discriminate which genes are upregulated by these subunits but are not found to be targets of RelA/p65. A list of genes induced by p50 or by c-Rel but not by RelA/p65 is of particular interest to us, as we intend to thoroughly test whether these genes are also targeted by the anthracyclines. Our ongoing bioinformatics analysis is also exploring the effects of Epi-treatments on p50 and cRel targets, as Epi-treated conditions were included in the RNA-seq experiment. Future results from the genes selected will be similar to the analysis already performed for TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig10">Author response image 10</xref>): we will be able to compare the expression of each selected p50 and c-Rel target in conditions with and without Epi to see if anthracycline treatments also dowregulate the expression of those genes. Our analysis will then provide a more definitive picture of the extent to which anthracyclines regulate NF-κB targets. Our laboratory will dedicate considerable efforts to these studies, which will only be presented in the future because of the thorough analysis and validation that is required. The exhaustive identification and validation of the NF-κB genes regulated by Epi, with the possibility of recognizing the preferred composition of each NF-κB complex that is being targeted by the anthracyclines for each gene, will considerably expand our knowledge of NF-κB biology, but also of the particularities of locus-specific drug targeting, in particular in inflammation. We consider this to be a very relevant and poorly understood aspect, as anthracyclines are already known to target discrete chromosomal regions in cancer cells to induce histone eviction, and it would be fundamental to explore whether anthracycline recruitment to particular chromatin domains could eventually be related to the presence of distinct NF-κB dimers (references in the manuscript: Pang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013 and Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013).</p><fig id="sa2fig10" position="float"><label>Author response image 10.</label><caption><title>RNA-seq data for the expression of TNF in the different conditions tested, shown as an example of Epirubicin (Epi)-regulated NF-κB target gene.</title><p>The mRNA levels corresponding to TNF expression, as obtained by the RNA-seq.

Our results allowed us to establish that RelA/p65 is the main NF-κB factor responsible for the effects of the anthracyclines (Epi) in the cell models tested, both in the regulation of endogenous gene expression, as well as in regulating the kB reporter. For the relevance of these observations, we decided to include a new supplementary figure in the manuscript, Supp. Figure 4, that contains part of the information provided here. We only included data concerning RelA/p65 KO and no data related to p50 or c-Rel because RelA/p65 is the focus of our manuscript and the sole NF-κB factor that we studied structurally, by IF, and in reporter gene assays. Another change we introduced in the manuscript was in Figure 2: the former 2E part of the panel, which showed redundancy with 2F, was replaced by data stressing that TNF gene is regulated by Epi at the level of transcription and not at the level of stability of its mRNA, which to us further suggests that anthracyclines regulate transcription of NF-κB targets.</p><p>We are aware of the limitations of using a cell line such as HEK293 and reporter gene assays, and we acknowledge that we did not address the dispute in macrophages. Nevertheless, and because the experimental approaches used were chosen to mimic inflammatory stimulation and the induction of pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs, we believe that the findings shown here are relevant for the understanding of the effects of anthracyclines in inflammation. In the future, we plan to use genetically modified mouse models and isolate macrophages from those animals to do in vivo and <italic>ex-vivo</italic> studies. RelA/p65 deletion is embryonically lethal (Geisler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007) and therefore RelA/p65 KO cells can only be obtained in inducible systems. Adult RelA/p65 inactivation is possible in RelA/p65 flox/flox mice using Cre/loxP approaches, either for whole-body recombination and deletion, or using a Cre driver such as LysM-Cre to achieve deletion of RelA/p65 only in macrophages. In these KO animals we will also be able to test the protective in vivo effects by anthracyclines using the models of sepsis and septic shock which are well established in our laboratory, as we did in the past (reference in the manuscript: Figueiredo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013). The work presented in the manuscript and in this response explored anthracycline interactions with RelA/p65 and showed that these interactions are likely to limit the extent of pro-inflammatory responses, which may have beneficial consequences in conditions associated with exacerbated inflammation. A model of target gene regulation by Epi is shown in Supp. Figure 12 of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. A related significant concern is the use of the &quot;kB-33 promoter sequence&quot; (page 10 and thereafter) in the NMR study (Figures 4 and 5 and associated supplemental data). The description of this NF-κB binding sequence was insufficient in the manuscript. In fact, this sequence is not even a &quot;promoter&quot; sequence as stated. This is an artificial sequence derived from a duplication of the 3' half of the immunoglobulin kappa kB enhancer element (Thanos &amp; Maniatis, Mol. Cell. Biol. 15: 152-164, 1995), which was cited in the Chen et al. 1998 paper which was in turn cited by the authors. This sequence selectively binds RelA homodimers and not p50/RelA heterodimers or p50 homodimers. Given that the role of p65 homodimers in regulating inflammatory genes in BMDM is not established (in the current study or by others), the use of this artificial binding site in the NMR study and the relevance of the results obtained to the mechanism of action of anthracycline in repressing NF-κB dependent target genes in BMDM are highly questionable. If, on the other hand, the authors are able to demonstrate the requirement of RelA homodimers, but not p50/RelA, p50/cRel heterodimers, or cRel homodimers, for gene regulation shown in Figure 2B, this could help explain why certain other NF-κB target genes, such as IFN β or survival genes, are not affected by anthracyclines as these targets are known to be regulated by p50/RelA heterodimers (e.g., IFN β gene described in Thanos &amp; Maniatis cited above).</p></disp-quote><p>We confirm that we have specifically chosen a sequence that selectively binds RelA homodimers and not p50/RelA heterodimers or p50 homodimers because we only assessed direct transcriptional inhibition (luciferase assay) by RelA and not by the other NF-κB subunits in the original manuscript; while we think it would be of great interest to extend the NMR studies to other subunits, we believe that the NMR studies that we performed with RelA already provide considerable information regarding the possible molecular mechanisms that explain the inhibition of RelA homodimers that are capable of driving the transcription of luciferase with a kB promoter. Instead, we have decided to concentrate our efforts and resources on testing a wide variety of conditions affecting the binding that may prove relevant in physiological conditions. The conditions tested included a range of doses of the anthracyclines, different possible stoichiometries between the components, alternative orders of addition of the players of the system, and very importantly, three members of the anthracycline family that each have distinctive biological features. We agree that it will be helpful, in the future, to expand the structural analysis to other sequences, not only targeted by other NF-κB subunits, but also by other transcription factors with known roles in regulating inflammation, such as the IRFs and STATs families for example. However, that extends beyond the scope of this work and due to the nature of the experimental approaches required to generate reliable structural data, will only be possible in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. By demonstrating the significant reduction of serum TNF levels in mice exposed to <italic>E. coli</italic> + Epi or Acla relative to <italic>E. coli</italic> group alone, the authors concluded that &quot;our findings have in vivo physiological relevance&quot; (page 6). However, the difference of TNF levels is ~1250 pg/ml to ~800 pg/ml, only ~36% reduction. It is unclear whether this reduction would have &quot;physiological relevance&quot;. Thus, the authors should measure the physiological outcome of septic shock, such as death, to determine whether anthracyclines have significant physiological impact or not in vivo. This is important given the authors claim that the mechanism being studied have implications in cancer and sepsis therapies in patients.</p><p>The additional experiments suggested above are within the capacity of the authors, not very time consuming and not expensive relative to what have already being performed and therefore reasonable to make the study and the claim more conclusive and significant.</p></disp-quote><p>Because of the reduction of circulating TNF levels in the sepsis mouse model after anthracycline treatment, the reviewer suggested the measurement of a physiological outcome, more specifically the kinetics of death. Indeed, the physiological relevance of anthracyclines in sepsis was the central focus of a previous study conducted by our laboratory, published in Immunity in 2013 (reference in the manuscript: Figueiredo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013). In that publication, we compared the survival of WT animals subjected to sepsis (using the polymicrobial infection induced by cecal ligation and puncture model, CLP) and treated with control (PBS) or treated with anthracyclines. Figures 1A and 1B in that publication showed that the anthracyclines Epirubicin, Doxorubicin and Daunorubicin increased the survival of the mice subjected to CLP by up to 80%, without the use of antibiotics. We agree with the reviewer that the in vivo results have considerable impact for the development of future treatments targeting cancer and sepsis. The previously published observations that anthracyclines are protective in the mouse model of sepsis are a strong indication that anthracyclines will play critical roles in sepsis therapies in patients. This is being tested in a clinical trial conducted in Germany and with the participation of the authors (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05033808). More specifically, the trial will compare low doses of Epirubicin with placebo for the treatment of sepsis and septic shock. We see no need to repeat or extend the in vivo tests to additional anthracyclines, for which we would need a substantial number of animals and this would not be ethically appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. In addition to the insufficient/inaccurate description of the kB-33 promoter sequence above, the description of the kB-Luc reporter used in the method section [&quot;the NF-κB firefly luciferase reporter construct (kB-luc),.. were previously described (Anrather et al., 1999)&quot;] (page 22) require a better description. The cited paper (Anrather et al. 1999) does not have the direct information on the reporter construct and one has to look up a cite paper within the reference (i.e., Brostjan C et al. J. Immunol. 158: 3836-3844, 1997) to find the relevant reporter vector.</p></disp-quote><p>The description has been considerably expanded in the Methods section: we have now included the sequences of the two kB sites in the vector; in addition, other sequences in the vector such as the promoter and enhancer have been described.

We have now replaced a few of the mentions to “inflammation” by “induction of gene expression”, or “induction of pro-inflammatory gene expression” or “pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs” to specifically reflect our observations that RelA is capable of reducing the transcription of genes that take part in the inflammatory responses in macrophages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Although the data clearly shows that ATM is not required for the RelA-mediated reduction of gene expression of pro-inflammatory genes, we are aware that inflammation progresses differently in ATM-/- animals compared with WT animals (shown for example in Rodier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009), and therefore direct comparisons should be avoided (this is part of the reason why we favor the “fold change” analysis for cytokine induction results). In addition, because anthracyclines target DNA, and ATM-/- cells are considerably defective in DNA damage repair and are more prone to accumulate DNA breaks, we do not exclude that Epirubicin may interact differently with the ATM-/- chromatin when compared with the WT chromatin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

In fact, all graphs in the main figures display the results of those statistical analyses visually. However, for the supplementary figures, we did not thoroughly display the results of the statistical tests, which was rightfully pointed by the Reviewer. What we have now decided to do was to mention the statistical analysis in the figure legends of all supplementary figures and to reference the results of the tests. We believe that the figures are now more informative and we thank the reviewer for suggesting this improvement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>My comments/suggestions:</p><p>1.

Plasmid transfection was performed as described in the manuscript using the amounts of DNA suggested by Santa Cruz. We chose to use nickases because they generate single-strand rather than double-strand breaks, so when used with two adjacent gRNA, the probability of off-target editing is lower. The resulting population was tested (at week 1 of KO) for RNA levels and protein expression of the different subunits.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Tools for CRISPR/Cas9 in HEK293 cells.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Human Gene</th><th>Protein</th><th>Double Nickase Plasmid</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">RELA</td><td align="left" valign="top">p65 (RelA) subunit</td><td align="left" valign="top">sc-400004-NIC-2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">NFKB1</td><td align="left" valign="top">P50 subunit</td><td align="left" valign="top">sc-400087-NIC-2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">REL</td><td align="left" valign="top">c-Rel</td><td align="left" valign="top">sc-400478-NIC-2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Scrambled control RNA sequence</td><td align="left" valign="top">-</td><td align="left" valign="top">sc-437281</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>RNA</p><p>RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR were done as explained in the main Methods section of the manuscript.
