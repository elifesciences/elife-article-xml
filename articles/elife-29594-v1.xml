Rozellomycota is a clade comprising many such parasites and is related to the diverse, highly reduced, animal parasites, Microsporidia. We sequenced the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of <italic>Paramicrosporidium saccamoebae</italic> [Rozellomycota], an intranuclear parasite of amoebae. A canonical fungal mitochondrial genome was recovered from <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> that encodes genes necessary for the complete oxidative phosphorylation pathway including Complex I, differentiating it from most endoparasites including its sequenced relatives in Rozellomycota and Microsporidia. Comparative analysis revealed that <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> shares more gene content with distantly related Fungi than with its closest relatives, suggesting that genome evolution in Rozellomycota and Microsporidia has been affected by repeated and independent gene losses, possibly as a result of variation in parasitic strategies (e.g. host and subcellular localization) or due to multiple transitions to parasitism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>genome reduction</kwd><kwd>Rozella</kwd><kwd>Microsporidia</kwd><kwd>Fungi</kwd><kwd>Rozellomycota</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-1354625</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>James</surname><given-names>Timothy Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corradi</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003151</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Nature et Technologies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beaudet</surname><given-names>Denis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parasitic lineages of Rozellomycota are shaped by repeated and independent gene losses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Near the phylogenetic root of the Kingdom Fungi lies a branch that unites Microsporidia and a group variably known as Rozellomycota or Cryptomycota. This clade of intracellular parasites are considered energy thieves, because they import ATP from their hosts. The clade encompasses a great diversity of morphologies from the fungus-like <italic>Rozella</italic> spp. to the highly derived Microsporidia which are best known for the reductive nature of their cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hirt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Williams et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burri et al., 2006</xref>). The biology of Rozellomycota is unclear, being almost exclusively documented from diverse DNA sequences commonly found in environmental sequencing datasets from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Livermore and Mattes, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lazarus and James, 2015</xref>). They appear to be related to but distinct from another lineage, Aphelidea, a group comprised largely of parasites of algae for which genome-scale data is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karpov et al., 2014</xref>). Formal descriptions of new species in Rozellomycota are very rare, and the hosts are diverse, ranging from Fungi, slime molds, amoebae, crustaceans, to algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karling, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kagami et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corsaro et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ishida et al., 2015</xref>). These newly described species possess some characteristics similar to those of <italic>Rozella</italic> and others that more closely resemble Microsporidia.</p><p>All Rozellomycota described to date are intracellular parasites that can produce a chitinous cell wall, yet grow as naked protoplasts within their hosts. However, they range greatly in morphology from species that are fungal-like (<italic>Rozella</italic>) and infect using a zoosporic (flagellated) stage to those without flagella where infections occur from spores through a polar filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corsaro et al., 2014</xref>). This latter structure and phylogenomic analyses unite Rozellomycota with the Microsporidia as the earliest diverging lineage of Fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">James et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haag et al., 2014</xref>). The consideration of Rozellomycota and Microsporidia as members of the Fungi has been contentious due to the fact that they possess some, but not all, of the features characteristic of most Fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Richards et al., 2017</xref>). Some authors consider Rozellomycota to be outside of the Fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavalier-Smith, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karpov et al., 2014</xref>), because the genus <italic>Rozella</italic> and Aphelidea perform a form of phagocytosis of host cytoplasm making them appear to lack a defining feature of Fungi, osmoheterotrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Powell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Richards et al., 2017</xref>). Others have considered the clade as part of the Fungi, apparently accepting that the features of known species are sufficiently fungus-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hibbett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berbee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spatafora et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we show that all members of this clade are characterized by rampant gene loss, making it likely they are derived from a more fungus-like ancestor.</p><p>Microsporidians are represented by approximately 1700 species and are known to infect many animals, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Keeling, 2009</xref>). They possess a mitochondrial-derived, genome-less organelle called a mitosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hirt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Williams et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burri et al., 2006</xref>), which has degenerated presumably because they steal ATP directly from their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tsaousis et al., 2008</xref>). Their nuclear genomes have also attracted considerable attention for being some of the smallest known for eukaryotes, reaching at the extreme only 2.3 Mb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corradi et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To date, only one genome from the Rozellomycota lineage has been sequenced, that of <italic>Rozella allomycis</italic>, an obligate intracellular parasite of the water mold <italic>Allomyces</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">James et al., 2013</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of the genome of <italic>R. allomycis</italic> strongly supported the placement of <italic>Rozella</italic> with Microsporidia and revealed previously unsuspected similarities with representatives of the phylum, as it harbored genes previously thought to be Microsporidia-specific. These genes included a nucleotide transporter essential for the acquisition of energy via ATP theft from the host and other genes with obvious signatures of horizontal gene transfers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">James et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2016</xref>). Other biochemical similarities included the presence of a small mitochondrial genome lacking electron transport Complex I and a seemingly degenerate sequence that is extremely AT–rich. The presence of the nucleotide transporter, the degeneracy or loss of the mitochondrion, and the fact that both Microsporidia and <italic>Rozella</italic> associate in the cell with the host’s mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hacker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Powell et al., 2017</xref>), supported a hypothesis of direct uptake of ATP for nucleotide metabolism and energy from the host to parasite.</p><p>The <italic>Daphnia</italic> pathogen, <italic>Mitosporidium daphniae</italic>, is classified as an early diverging Microsporidia; however, it does not reside on the long branch with the rest of Microsporidia and genome drafts revealed that unlike those highly reduced parasites, it possesses a mitochondrial genome that lacks all genes involved in Complex I of oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haag et al., 2014</xref>), similar to <italic>R. allomycis</italic>. <italic>M. daphniae</italic> also lacks the ATP transporters that were suggested to facilitate mitochondrial degeneration in <italic>Rozella</italic> and Microsporidia. This pattern suggests that diverse strategies have evolved for parasitism that may be dependent on either host or the environment, as opposed to being lineage-specific. One common theme, however, is that the clade has evolved under repeated loss, going from a species with more genes than the free-living yeasts, for example <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>, which have approximately 5900 genes, to those with the smallest known eukaryotic genomes through the loss of function of genes involved in primary metabolism, presumably because the organism can acquire them from the host. The existence of a degenerate mitochondrial genome in <italic>R. allomycis</italic> and <italic>M. daphniae</italic> supported a model of step-wise degeneration of the respiratory chain in Rozellomycota (possibly following the acquisition of ATP transporters) that could have ultimately resulted in the emergence of genome-less mitosomes in Microsporidia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corradi, 2015</xref>).</p><p><italic>Paramicrosporidium saccamoebae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corsaro et al., 2014</xref>) was described as an intranuclear parasite of <italic>Saccamoeba</italic> [Amoebozoa]. Morphologically, it somewhat resembles <italic>M. daphniae</italic> and Microsporidia, as it produces small-sized spores (approximately 1 µm) with a polar filament that lack observable mitochondria. However, ribosomal DNA phylogenies place <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> within Rozellomycota, offering an opportunity to examine another member of Rozellomycota and ask questions about the evolution of this clade. Given the relationship between Rozellomycota and Microsporidia, and the fact that both lineages are known only from isolates which are obligate intracellular parasites, we sought to understand whether they are two distinct lineages with unifying changes such as gene loss and horizontal acquisition, or if the clade forms a gradient from fungus-like ancestors to highly reduced endoparasites through a series of nested reductions. Have reductions in gene content occurred many times independently throughout the evolution of these enigmatic, yet ubiquitous clades? Are there common strategies that Rozellomycota and Microsporidia share in drawing energy from their host? To address these questions, we sequenced the genome and transcriptome of <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic>. Our phylogenetic analyses and gene content comparisons revealed that this species is sister to Microsporidia (and not <italic>R. allomycis</italic>), and suggests that Rozellomycota is paraphyletic. Our genome investigations also uncovered a number of <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> gene losses related to life inside the host nucleus and revealed that it shares more genes with distant lineages of Fungi and presumably therefore to the ancestor of all Fungi than with its closest sequenced relatives. Our study also highlights independent losses and reductions of mitochondrial functions in the evolution of Rozellomycota.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To acquire the nuclear and mitochondrial genome of <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic>, the microbial community of the <italic>Saccamoeba</italic> host was sequenced and assembled via metagenomic techniques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, we sequenced RNA transcripts of <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> in order to improve genome annotation and to verify expression of genes of interest. Our approaches produced a target nuclear genome assembly of 7.3 Mb in size on 221 scaffolds and possesses 3750 predicted genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This size is intermediate between <italic>R. allomycis</italic> (11.8 Mb) and <italic>M. daphniae</italic> (5.6 Mb), while the number of genes is similar to that of <italic>M. daphniae</italic> (3331 genes). The GC content is 47%, which is within the upper range of sequenced Rozellomycota and Microsporidia [34–47%] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Katinka et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">James et al., 2013</xref>). Analysis of the core eukaryotic genes (CEGs) indicates that the assembly is fairly complete with identification of 89% of complete CEGs and 91% complete or partial CEGs. As an additional measure of assembly continuity, we found that 50% of the genome resides on only 29 scaffolds. Over 76% of the genome is covered by gene space, while repeated content covers only 0.53% of the genome, most of which are simple or low complexity repeats.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29594.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Metagenomic plots to decipher target <italic>P.saccamoebae</italic> contigs from metagenomic assembly using multiple lines of evidence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Emergent self-organizing map (ESOM) torroidal topology (topo map) with black outline representing the final area surrounding <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> contigs.

Further evidence that <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> possesses a functional mitochondrion derives from the mitochondrial genome phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and the presence and expression of genes for mitochondrial function (e.g. succinate dehydrogenase, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) in the nuclear genome.</p><p>It is unclear why the lifecycle and environment of <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> has led to maintenance of a mitochondrion capable of all links of the electron transport chain, whereas this ability has been reduced (via loss of the same complex) in the related endoparasites <italic>R. allomycis</italic> and <italic>M. daphniae</italic>. The independent reductions in Complex I suggests that there may have been multiple transitions to intracellular parasitism and that putative ‘epiphytic’ Rozellomycota are or were once occupying non-parasitic ecological niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ishida et al., 2015</xref>). One explanation for the maintenance of a fully functioning mitochondrion in <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> could be related to its subcellular location. Studies using light microscopy of <italic>R. allomycis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Powell et al., 2017</xref>) and Microsporidia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hacker et al., 2014</xref>) have found that these parasites are surrounded by host mitochondria, presumably to facilitate energy theft from the host. Therefore, it could be that <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic>, which is sequestered to the nucleus, is prevented from co-locating with the host mitochondria from which it could steal energy. There are, however, Microsporidia that are intranuclear parasites of fish and crustaceans, for example<italic> Nucleospora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freeman et al., 2013</xref>) and <italic>Enterospora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stentiford et al., 2007</xref>), and they have no mitochondrial genome. <italic>R. allomycis</italic> and many Microsporidia possess horizontally acquired ATP transporters by which they steal ATP from their host, and these were not found in <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic>. Potentially, a lack of these (and the ability to steal energy) has led to the maintenance of Complex I genes in its mitochondrion, although <italic>M. daphniae</italic> (which has lost Complex I) does not possess these ATP transporters as well. Alternatively, the mitochondrion in <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> could be maintained for use in a perhaps unobserved stage in its lifecycle (although our results have ruled out the possibility of a flagellated stage). This hypothesis is bolstered by the fact that a mitochondrion was not observed in the spores of <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> via microscopy. In any case, additional genome sequences from this phylum will hopefully clarify how often mitochondrial genomes have been affected by reductive processes (including its complete loss in Microsporidia), and if these reductions have coincided with transitions to parasitism of particular hosts, acquisition of particular transporters, or in specific environmental conditions.</p><p>Our results suggest that Rozellomycota is paraphyletic. Microsporidia, which do form a monophyletic clade including the earliest diverging species, <italic>M. daphniae</italic>, are clearly nested within Rozellomycota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Shared gene content is clearly not correlated with evolutionary relationships within the Rozellomycota, and there are not obvious genomic synapomorphies that can be used to link Rozellomycota and Microsporidia together. This, in combination with the reconstruction of gains and losses within Rozellomycota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and differential retention and loss of amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) provide evidence that this group of Fungi have been shaped by a series of independent and repeated losses, rather than nested losses toward more derived branches.</p><p>The loss of biosynthesis of nucleotides and multiple amino acids in <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> indicates that like <italic>R. allomycis</italic> and Microsporidia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dean et al., 2016</xref>), this species is highly dependent on its host for aspects of both protein synthesis and DNA replication. The highly expressed nucleoside transporter we identified likely facilitates import of nucleosides from the host amoeba, although the absence of any kinases to convert nucleosides to nucleotides is conspicuous. <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> also lacks a homolog of the nucleotide transporters (identified in <italic>R. allomycis</italic> and Microsporidia) which were horizontally acquired from Chlamydiae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tsaousis et al., 2008</xref>), but <italic>M. daphniae</italic> lacks these as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haag et al., 2014</xref>) suggesting these have either been missed in the genome assemblies, that this acquisition happened at least two independent times, or that the gene has been independently lost in both <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> and <italic>M. daphniae</italic> after horizontal transfer into the ancestor of Rozellomycota. Within this context, the cellular location during parasitism (inside the nucleus) of <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> may facilitate access to nucleotides from the host, and it may be that the mRNA of the host is phagocytized or translocated into the cell and then broken into essential components by the RNA degradation pathway. The same scenario is perhaps true of amino acids, that is, proteolysis of proteins following phagocytosis or translocation. Such a scenario would indicate an intermediate biology of these organisms which more closely resemble the eukaryotic ancestors from which they evolved, than the rest of the Fungi with chitinous-walled vegetative stages. The amino acid permeases in <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic>, <italic>R. allomycis</italic>, and <italic>M. daphniae</italic>, which are both absent in other Fungi and related to bacterial permeases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), suggest that these were present in the common ancestor of Rozellomycota. The permease gene has been duplicated in <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic>, possibly as a result of an increased necessity for amino acids from its amoeba host. In the gene-reduced budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, amino acid biosynthesis pathways are all complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kanehisa et al., 2014</xref>), which taken in combination with the reduction in these in Rozellomycota and Microsporidia (which are even further reduced) suggests that intracellular parasitism may be driving this trend.</p><p>The lack of multiple genes involved in flagellum production in the <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> genome was not unexpected given the microscopy-based observations of the life cycle, including spores possessing a polar filament. Thus, when or how many times the flagellum has been lost in this group of Fungi remains an open question in Rozellomycota evolution. Clearly, based on in situ hybridization studies and environmental DNA studies, disparate members of the phylum have zoospores with flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones et al., 2011</xref>), while others are more Microsporidia-like in their morphology without obvious flagellated stages and Microsporidia-sized spores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corsaro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2016</xref>). However, this study provides further support for the notion that where a polar filament is present, a flagellum is absent. In <italic>Rozella</italic> spp., the zoospores are the infective agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Held, 1973</xref>), and therefore the advent of the infective polar filament may have rendered the flagellum unnecessary. Whether the polar filament has a single origin is uncertain, but likely given its complexity. That searches for PFPs failed likely reflects the rapid rate of sequence evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Slamovits et al., 2004</xref>) and lack of conserved gene synteny rather than an independent origin of the polar filament.</p><p>Knowledge of the mode of reproduction of Rozellomycota is essential to fully understand their transmission and life cycle. Sexual reproduction has not been observed in Rozellomycota, while rare microscopy-based evidence for meiosis was reported for two unrelated Microsporidia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corradi, 2015</xref>). However, overwhelming genome data points toward the existence of cryptic sexual meiotic recombination in most microsporidians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2014</xref>), and we uncovered identical signatures in the genome of <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic>. Although this species harbors many genomic signatures of sexual reproduction (i.e. a complete set of meiosis genes and significant evidence of diploidy, a prerequisite for meiosis), deciphering the reproductive strategies of this obligate intracellular parasite and allied species will likely require population-based genetic approaches. In particular, these seem necessary to expose strain-specific divergent loci potentially involved in compatibility, or reveal evidence of intraspecific gene exchange and recombination.</p><p>This high-quality assembly (as evidenced by the CEGMA results, presence of meiosis genes, mitochondrial genome assembly, etc.), especially compared to other sequenced species in the clade, demonstrates the power of sequencing metagenomic samples when pure samples are not readily available. Overall, the genome sequence of <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> has provided crucial insights into the evolution and biology of this highly diverse but severely undersampled clade. In particular, this study revealed this intranuclear parasite has a mitochondrial genome possessing genes for all complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, and has a reduced capacity to produce nucleotides and amino acids, suggesting a dependence on the host for genetic building blocks and protein production but not energy. We also found evidence for independent reductions within the nuclear genomes of Rozellomycota, indicating there may have been multiple transitions to parasitism within the clade and that Microsporidia are a particularly highly derived and reduced lineage. Finally, these results provide further whole genome evidence for the paraphyly of Rozellomycota.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA isolation, sequencing, and assembly</title><p>Resting spores of <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> strain KSL3 were obtained from infected <italic>Saccamoeba</italic> sp. grown on bacteria-coated non-nutritive agar plates and cleaned by filtration through a 0.5-µm membrane filter as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corsaro et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Jeremy Wideman (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Quandt and collaborators describes the genome of the intracellular parasite <italic>Paramicrosporidium saccamoebae</italic> in the early fungal lineage Rozellomycota. The authors show that the <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> genome is not as reduced (in terms of gene content) as the genomes of previously sequenced Rozellomycota or of previously sequenced Microsporidia and also contains a full mitochondrial genome (again in contrast to previously sequenced genomes from this part of the tree of life). Combined with the placement of <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> on the fungal phylogeny (it appears to have diverged after the divergence of Rozella, another Rozellomycota genome), analysis of the gene content of this species suggests that the path toward adaptation to a intracellular lifestyle was not linear, but likely involved multiple rounds of gene losses and perhaps multiple transitions to parasitism.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Many microsporidia localize to the nucleus (e.g. Nucleospora and Enterospora see: PMC3606367 and pubmed id 17523545). This means that mitochondrial function does not correlate with nuclear localization. Therefore one of the major hypotheses that the authors put forth, namely that cellular localization correlates with retention of mitochondrial function is refuted. Furthermore, some misconceptions about mtDNAs seem to be held by the authors. Firstly, a &quot;complete and fully functional mitochondrial genome&quot; is a meaningless statement as many mitochondrial genomes contain very few genes but are fully functional (for example, dinoflagellates, and many apicomplexa encode very few mitochondrial proteins but still have aerobic fully functional mitochondria). Also, many mitochondrial genomes across the eukaryotes lack Complex I (including <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) and numerous other aerobic/facultative species (e.g. some algae like <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> see Kamikawa et al. (PMID 26833505). Thus, convergent simplification of the mitochondrial genome is extremely common, and is in fact the major mode of mitochondrial evolution. However, this does not mean that there is not an interesting mitochondrial story in these data. Specifically, even though the reduction of genes may not be that interesting, it may point towards a different hypothesis, namely that &quot;the cryptomycotan ancestor was a parasite with alternating lifecycle stages between an aerobic flagellate and an anaerobic intracellular non-flagellate&quot;. If mitochondria (with intact cristae) are not easily visible in the lifecycle stages that are being viewed, perhaps the mitochondrion is not functioning aerobically at this time. This would support a hypothesis that the intracellular phase is anaerobic. Perhaps the motile stage for Cryptomycota like <italic>Rozella</italic>, or infection/germination stage for Cryptomycota like <italic>Paramicrosporidium</italic>, requires oxidative phosphorylation for some reason. This would be a very attractive model for how ETC components (or the flagellum) could be readily (and convergently) lost. The authors are advised to rewrite the mitochondrial section(s) in a way that provides more information on comparisons between other holomycotan taxa and a reformulation (or omission) of the correlative hypothesis.</p><p>2) The authors consider the Rozellomycota belongs to the Fungi. This is not correct as 1) they are phagotrophic (not osmotrophic), 2) they do not have the chitinous cell wall at the vegetative stage. Otherwise, if they are included in the Fungi the diagnosis of the latter has to be cardinally changed, and in this case the other holomycots (amoebae <italic>Nuclearia, Parvularia, Fonticula</italic>) must be included in the Fungi. The authors are advised to discuss this point in the Introduction.</p><p>3) The overall presentation of the manuscript was below par; many of the figures were unclear, several terms were incorrectly used, and the manuscript contained several typos –. The authors are advised to carefully examine and address all of them and to carefully proof the revised manuscript for both science and style before resubmission.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The genome of an intranuclear parasite, <italic>Paramicrosporidium saccamoebae</italic>, reveals alternative adaptations to obligate intracellular parasitism&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

This means that mitochondrial function does not correlate with nuclear localization. Therefore one of the major hypotheses that the authors put forth, namely that cellular localization correlates with retention of mitochondrial function is refuted. Furthermore, some misconceptions about mtDNAs seem to be held by the authors. Firstly, a &quot;complete and fully functional mitochondrial genome&quot; is a meaningless statement as many mitochondrial genomes contain very few genes but are fully functional (for example, dinoflagellates, and many apicomplexa encode very few mitochondrial proteins but still have aerobic fully functional mitochondria). Also, many mitochondrial genomes across the eukaryotes lack Complex I (including S. cerevisiae) and numerous other aerobic/facultative species (e.g. some algae like Chlamydomonas see Kamikawa et al. (PMID 26833505). Thus, convergent simplification of the mitochondrial genome is extremely common, and is in fact the major mode of mitochondrial evolution. However, this does not mean that there is not an interesting mitochondrial story in these data. Specifically, even though the reduction of genes may not be that interesting, it may point towards a different hypothesis, namely that &quot;the cryptomycotan ancestor was a parasite with alternating lifecycle stages between an aerobic flagellate and an anaerobic intracellular non-flagellate&quot;. If mitochondria (with intact cristae) are not easily visible in the lifecycle stages that are being viewed, perhaps the mitochondrion is not functioning aerobically at this time. This would support a hypothesis that the intracellular phase is anaerobic. Perhaps the motile stage for Cryptomycota like Rozella, or infection/germination stage for Cryptomycota like Paramicrosporidium, requires oxidative phosphorylation for some reason. This would be a very attractive model for how ETC components (or the flagellum) could be readily (and convergently) lost. The authors are advised to rewrite the mitochondrial section(s) in a way that provides more information on comparisons between other holomycotan taxa and a reformulation (or omission) of the correlative hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising these interesting points. We agree with a number of them, while holding slightly different opinions about others. Firstly, our statement of &quot;complete and fully functional mitochondrial genome&quot; is indeed an inaccurate characterization, and the manuscript has now been revised to address this point.</p><p>The loss of genes involved in Complex I leads a reduction in the primary mitochondrial function of generating energy in the form of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. The point that this loss is common throughout eukaryotes and clearly not a barrier to aerobic growth in these organisms is well taken, and a point we observed when sequencing the first Rozellomycota genome (James et al. 2013). However, we developed the hypothesis, or rather expanded on the existing hypothesis (Tsaousis et al. 2008), that mitochondrial loss of function was related to acquisition of ATP transporters from Chlamydia by horizontal transfer. We have recently demonstrated that <italic>Rozella</italic> and Microsporidia both share the traits of genomes encoding ATP transporters and intimate association of host mitochondrial with the parasite membrane (Powell et al. 2017). This led to the hypothesis which we presented in this paper that the separation of <italic>Paramicrosporidium</italic> from the mitochondria by the host nuclear membrane would lower access to host ATP generated via oxidative phosphorylation and lead to differences in numerous aspects of energy metabolism. Indeed, the primary result of the mitochondrial data we obtained for <italic>Paramicrosporidium</italic> indeed does not show this loss of OXPHOS function, and that is the point that we are trying to make about the mitochondrion. Prior to our study, both <italic>Rozella</italic> and <italic>Mitosporidium</italic> were found to have mitochondrial genomes that were both reduced (compared to typical fungal mito genome and with <italic>Nuclearia</italic>) in that they lack all of Complex I of oxidative phosphorylation, and our hypothesis was that this loss corresponded to an ancient loss in the early evolution of this clade and potentially an ancient switch to intracellular parasitism. However, that is not what we found. We found all genes typically found in fungal oxidative phosphorylation, which suggests independent losses in both <italic>Rozella</italic> and <italic>Mitosporidium</italic>, and potentially suggests there have multiple transitions to a parasitic lifestyle within the clade. To further explain this gene composition to the reader, we have added <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> where we show genes present in target taxa, other exemplar fungi, and <italic>Nuclearia</italic>. Flagella use a lot of ATP, and yet <italic>Rozella</italic> spp. (the only Rozellomycota species possessing flagella) lack Complex I. In the paper, we clearly note that we searched for genes typically present in species with a flagellum, and <italic>Paramicrosporidium</italic> is missing these, providing further support that we have not “missed” a flagellated stage in its lifecycle. Several co-authors (including the species original descriptors) have spent a considerable amount of time looking at these organisms. We are aware that some Microsporidia are intranuclear parasites. However, we disagree that our hypothesis for the biology and evolution of <italic>Paramicrosporidium</italic> is necessarily invalidated by this. Specifically, the ancestor to “core Microsporidia” (those on the extremely long branch) lost their mitochondrial genomes in what appears to be a lineage-wide event. This would suggest that the ancestors to <italic>Paramicrosporidium</italic> (which had a mitochondrion capable of oxid. Phos.) and <italic>Nucleospora</italic> and <italic>Enterospora</italic> (which did <italic>not</italic> have a mitochondrion capable of oxid. Phos, but may have had ATP transporters by which to steal ATP) have evolved to exist in similar habitats with very different original molecular “toolkits”. Thus, there is no reason to say it is impossible that these parasites in the same niche cannot have evolved different mechanisms by which to tolerate the inter-nuclear environment.</p><p>We have removed the language in the Abstract hypothesizing that sub-cellular location of the parasite may have increased the selection pressure for a functioning mitochondrion. We have left this hypothesis in the Discussion, but have also added a caveat about intranuclear microsporidians <italic>Enterospora</italic> and <italic>Nucleospora</italic> along with a note that these species (and <italic>R. allomycis</italic>) likely have transporters by which to steal ATP from their hosts, while <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> does not. We have also added an alternative hypothesis as suggested by the reviewer that the mitochondrion could function in some other unseen part of the <italic>P. saccamoebae</italic> lifecycle – although not a flagellated stage, which our results refute.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors consider the Rozellomycota belongs to the Fungi. This is not correct as 1) they are phagotrophic (not osmotrophic), 2) they do not have the chitinous cell wall at the vegetative stage. Otherwise, if they are included in the Fungi the diagnosis of the latter has to be cardinally changed, and in this case the other holomycots (amoebae Nuclearia, Parvularia, Fonticula) must be included in the Fungi. The authors are advised to discuss this point in the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising these interesting points. This is an active area of current debate, namely whether or not to include the Rozellomycota/Microsporidia in the Fungi or to consider them as sister groups. Presently, there is no simple resolution as this is a debate fueled by a taxonomic passion of certain authors, including many on the author list (James and Berbee 2012; Karpov et al. 2014). On the whole, the mycological community has accepted that both Microsporidia and Rozella/Cryptomycota may be included in the Fungi (NCBI, Stajich et al.; Berbee et al. 2017) and this can also be witnessed in the myriad of fungal ecology studies which are uncovering Rozellomycota at a fast pace. Ironically, the biological community has readily accepted the Microsporidia as Fungi (Adl et al. 2012), but the finding of phagotrophy-like nutrition in <italic>Rozella</italic> has been an impediment to their full acceptance as Fungi. The discovery of Cryptomycota/Rozellomycota created a controversy through the discovery of taxa that seemed somewhat like Fungi and somewhat like protistan ancestors because they possessed symplesiomorphic traits not observed in other fungi (flagellation, possible phagotrophic nutrition, and lack of cell wall) (Jones et al. 2011). Further analysis shows that ultimately <italic>Rozella</italic> has a number of traits that align them with fungi, such as chitinous cell wall in both spore and cyst phase, polarized cell growth using myosin linked chitin synthases (which likely undergo growth through osmoheterotrophy), and development of chytrid like spores in a zoosporangium. The results we report here show that loss was widespread and radically changed the genomes of all extant Rozellomycota. Very likely the common ancestor to Fungi+Rozellomycota+Microsporidia possessed a set of traits that were lost. Ultimately if the definition of Fungi needs to be slightly amended so be it; there is no synapomorphy for the Fungi (Richards et al. 2017). If we can accept that corals with zooxanthellae are still animals, then we can accommodate Rozellomycota into Fungi. After all, the majority of members in the lineage do not undergo any form of phagocytosis, and even <italic>Rozella</italic> phagocytosis is very distinct from that of nucleariids phagocytosing whole cells with cell walls and digesting them.</p><p>To address these points, we have added a short discussion of this to the Introduction. Our intention here, though, is not one of where to draw nomenclatural lines outside of the Rozellomycota+Microsporidia clade. Our main systematics point is that more and more evidence (including ours presented) is mounting that Microsporidia are nested within Rozellomycota (Cryptomycota), rendering Rozellomycota a paraphyletic group. We contend that most of the mycological community (to which most of the authors belong) refer to both <italic>Rozella</italic>, Rozellomycota, and Microsporidia as fungi (James and Berbee 2012; Han and Weiss 2017; Spatafora et al. 2017; Stajich 2017), and therefore we refer to them as such in the paper. Finally, we have recently suggested that the simplest definition of the Fungi is the sister group to the Holozoa (Berbee et al. 2017). A definition that requires fungi to possess osmotrophic nutrition could exclude some early-diverging taxa in the fungal clade while failing to exclude osmotrophic members of the Holozoa. Ultimately the higher classification arguments are interesting fodder for discussion, but that lies beyond the scope of this manuscript, and more data on Aphelids are needed before we know how they are related to the other groups (Karpov et al. 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The overall presentation of the manuscript was below par; many of the figures were unclear, several terms were incorrectly used, and the manuscript contained several typos.
