rhythm disturbances. In this study, we comprehensively characterized these disruptions and evaluated the therapeutic potential of a circadian-based intervention in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (<italic>Fmr1</italic>) knockout (KO) mouse. The <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice exhibited fragmented sleep, impaired locomotor rhythmicity, and attenuated behavioral responses to light, linked to an abnormal retinal innervation and reduction of light-evoked neuronal activation in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Behavioral testing revealed significant deficits in social memory and increased repetitive behaviors in the mutants, which correlated with sleep fragmentation. Remarkably, a scheduled feeding paradigm (6 hr feeding/18 hr fasting) significantly enhanced circadian rhythmicity, consolidated sleep, and improved social deficits and repetitive behaviors in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. This intervention also normalized the elevated levels of some pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-12 and IFN-Î³, in the mutantsâ blood, suggesting that its benefits extend to inflammatory pathways. These findings highlight the interplay between circadian disruption, behavior and an inflammatory response in FXS, and provide compelling evidence that time-restricted feeding may serve as a promising non-pharmacological approach for improving core symptoms in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circadian rhythms</kwd><kwd>fragile X syndrome</kwd><kwd>scheduled feeding</kwd><kwd>inflammatory cytokines</kwd><kwd>neurodevelopmental disorders</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50HD103557</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colwell</surname><given-names>Christopher S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>These findings provide convincing evidence of the beneficial effects that restored biological rhythms may have on disease pathophysiology and symptoms.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a relatively common inherited cause of intellectual disability, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 4000 males and 1 in 8000 females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hersh et al., 2011</xref>). Males are typically more severely affected due to their single X chromosome. FXS is caused by an abnormal expansion of CGG trinucleotide repeats in the <italic>fragile X mental retardation 1</italic> (<italic>FMR1</italic>) gene, which results in the transcriptional silencing of <italic>FMR1</italic> gene and consequent reduction in the levels of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein essential for synaptic plasticity and neuronal cytoarchitecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zalfa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Soden and Chen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kute et al., 2019</xref>). There is currently no cure for FXS. Existing treatments are primarily symptomatic, targeting common manifestations such as social deficits, repetitive behaviors, and sleep disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Budimirovic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martinez et al., 2024</xref>). Given the essential role of sleep and circadian rhythms in neural recovery and plasticity, a compelling question is whether improving sleep/wake cycles might alleviate other core symptoms of this disease.</p><p>Animal models are invaluable for elucidating the mechanisms underlying circadian and sleep disturbances as well as developing interventions aimed at restoring healthy sleep/wake cycles. Among the available models for FXS, the <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) mouse has been extensively validated for investigating disease mechanisms and is widely used in preclinical drug development, including for sleep-related outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kazdoba et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kat et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">SarÃ© et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martinez et al., 2024</xref>). Early studies have shown disrupted rhythms in activity during the light/dark (LD) cycle in mice missing both the <italic>Fmr1</italic> gene and the paralog <italic>Fxr2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). More recent findings indicate impairments in both sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">SarÃ© et al., 2017</xref>) and activity rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonasera et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angelakos et al., 2019</xref>) in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, all consistent with the sleep/wake disturbances reported in FXS individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kronk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kronk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Budimirovic et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Despite these findings, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the precise nature of the sleep and circadian deficits in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, and whether targeted correction of these rhythms might mitigate behavioral symptoms. Furthermore, much of the behavioral research in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice has been conducted during the light phaseâwhen mice are typically asleepâpotentially confounding results due to sleep disruption.</p><p>In this study, we aimed at comprehensively characterizing sleep and circadian disturbances in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice and examining their association with behavioral alterations. To avoid disrupting natural sleep patterns, we employed non-invasive home-cage monitoring systems to assess sleep and activity rhythms and conducted behavioral testing during the active (dark) phase. Importantly, the same animals were evaluated for both sleep/wake cycles and behavioral phenotypes, enabling direct correlations. Finally, because of the above-mentioned evidence of circadian dysfunction, we tested the efficacy of a circadian-based interventionâscheduled feeding (6 hr feeding/18 hr fasting)âon improving sleep/wake rhythms, social behavior, and repetitive behaviors in these mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fragmented light-phase sleep in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice</title><p>To determine whether the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice exhibit deficits in immobility-defined sleep behavior, the animals were examined using a combination of video recording and mouse tracking system under a 12:12 hr LD condition.

For this assay, the level of locomotor activity between Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 14 and 15 (2 hr after lights off) was first measured under baseline LD conditions (i.e. the day before), and no differences were observed between genotypes (WT: 2229 Â± 162 revolutions per hour (rev/hr); KO: 2639 Â± 328 rev/hr; <italic>t</italic><sub>(18)</sub> = â1.123, p = 0.277). The next day, the mice were exposed to light for 1 hr at this same phase, and the levels of activity measured. The mutants exhibited a significantly reduced light-driven suppression of the locomotor activity as compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), with significant effects of both genotype (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 39)</sub> = 12.002; p = 0.001, two-way ANOVA) and light exposure (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 39)</sub> = 24.253; p &lt; 0.001, two-way ANOVA). Next, we determined the number of cycles needed by the mice to re-entrain to a 6-hr phase advance of the LD cycle. While the WT mice re-synchronized in 5.9 Â± 0.6 days to the new phase, the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice required 11.3 Â± 0.4 days to adjust to the new ZT 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). <underline>Third,</underline> we evaluated the ability of the mice to entrain to a skeleton photoperiod (SPP) in which the full 12 hr of light or dark are replaced by two 1-hr light exposures (ZT 0â1 and ZT 11â12) separated by 11 hr of dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Mice were first entrained to the standard LD cycle and then released into the SPP for 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The activity recordings showed that the WT stably entrained to this challenging environment and exhibited robust circadian rhythms with a period (tau) of 24.0 Â± 0.0 hr (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Conversely, the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO exhibited a tau of 23.7 Â± 0.2 hr with the shorter period driven by three mutants that failed to entrain to the SPP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Compared to the WT, the mutants also showed reduced power of the rhythms, increased light-phase activity, and a larger onset variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Finally, the direct light-induced phase shift of the circadian system of the mice was measured by exposing them to light (300 lx) for 15 min while in constant darkness at circadian time (CT) 16.

In the first stage of the three-chamber test, both genotypes showed more interest toward the stranger mouse when given the choice between an inert object and a mouse.

In this test, the first stranger mouse becomes the familiar mouse after four exposures to the testing mouse. When the second mouse is introduced in the fifth trial, the testing mouse typically shows a boosted interest in investigating the novel mouse.

Common issues include difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep and irregular sleep patterns, which significantly impair the quality of life of FXS individuals and their families/caretakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Budimirovic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Minhas et al., 2025</xref>). Notably, individuals exhibiting more severe behavioral symptoms often experience more pronounced sleep problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schreck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaufmann et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting that circadian and sleep dysfunction exacerbate core NDD features. These disturbances are detectable quite early, even in infants and toddlers carrying the FMR1 mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DâSouza et al., 2020</xref>), raising the possibility that disrupted sleep/wake cycles may be an initial and influential feature of disease expression. Mechanistically, such disruptions could stem from direct effects of FMR1 loss on sleep and circadian circuits, or indirectly from secondary symptoms such as anxiety, sensory hypersensitivity, and repetitive behaviors.</p><p>Animal models of FXS, such as the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse, are essential for dissecting the underlying mechanisms and testing interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sandoval et al., 2024</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrate that loss of <italic>Fmr1</italic> results in disrupted sleep and circadian rhythms, including higher fragmentation of the rest-phase sleep and abnormal diurnal activity patterns. These disruptions were associated with deficits in social memory and increased repetitive behaviors. Importantly, we found that a circadian-based intervention (TRF) not only improved rhythmicity and sleep consolidation but also ameliorated behavioral deficits and reduced peripheral inflammatory markers.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Circadian and sleep disturbances in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice</title><p>Our behavioral sleep assay revealed reduced sleep duration and increased fragmentation during the light/rest phase in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), consistent with a previous report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">SarÃ© et al., 2017</xref>. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Westmark et al., 2023</xref>, using EEG, did not observe baseline sleep differences between genotypes, possibly reflecting methodological differences or subtle phenotypic variability. A key gap in the field is the lack of studies probing sleep homeostasis in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice; future studies using sleep deprivation protocols may reveal underlying vulnerabilities. Notably, the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice exhibit neural oscillation abnormalities, including increased resting gamma power and enhanced auditory-evoked responses, paralleling the EEG signatures in FXS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jonak et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Assessment of circadian locomotor activity revealed weakened rhythmicity, elevated daytime activity, and a greater onset variability in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonasera et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angelakos et al., 2019</xref>). These deficits persisted in constant darkness (DD), indicating a compromised endogenous circadian clock. Differences in activity rhythms measured in LD conditions could be driven by the circadian clock or the direct effects of light and dark. Although earlier studies using Fmr1/Fxr2 double mutants reported severe rhythm loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), the present study demonstrates that the loss of <italic>Fmr1</italic> alone is sufficient to impair circadian regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Impaired light response and SCN connectivity in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice</title><p>To explore the basis of the observed dysregulations, we evaluated the photic input to the circadian system. <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice displayed impaired negative masking, delayed re-entrainment to phase shifts, blunted light-induced phase shifts, and poor entrainment to a skeleton photoperiod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). These behavioral deficits suggest a compromised signal transmission from the retina to the SCN via the ipRGCs. Such a hypothesis was confirmed by anatomical and functional assays; indeed, the ipRGC innervation of the SCN was lessened in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and the light-evoked c-Fos induction was substantially reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Given that the FMRP is expressed in the ipRGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), its loss may underline the deficient light response observed in the mutants. Interestingly, this reduced sensitivity to circadian light input contrasts with the general sensory hypersensitivity typical of FXS, highlighting a unique dissociation in sensory processing pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rais et al., 2018</xref>). Whether these circadian-specific photic impairments are present in FXS patients warrants further investigation.</p><p>Despite these light input abnormalities, the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice did not exhibit a shortened free-running period (tau) in DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angelakos et al., 2019</xref>), nor were the rhythmic expressions of the clock genes altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). These findings suggest that the core molecular clock remains intact, and the circadian dysfunction may arise from an altered excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance or impaired network synchronization within the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Olde Engberink et al., 2023</xref>). Hence, our present results reinforce that loss of <italic>Fmr1</italic> impairs the circadian system at the level of input and output regulation rather than at the core molecular oscillation.</p><sec id="s3-2-1"><title>Sleep and behavior correlate in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice</title><p>The <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO model reproduces core behavioral deficits of FXS, including impaired social recognition and increased repetitive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Melancia and Trezza, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kat et al., 2022</xref>). By analyzing sleep, circadian activity, and behavior in the same animals, we identified significant correlations: mice with more disrupted sleep and weaker circadian rhythms exhibited more severe social and repetitive behavior impairments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These findings parallel clinical studies showing that disrupted sleep predicts next-day behavioral difficulties in FXS and autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Robinson-Shelton and Malow, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schwichtenberg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Minhas et al., 2025</xref>).

Importantly, TRF reduced repetitive behavior and improved social memory and interactions in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), establishing proof-of-principle that circadian-based behavioral interventions can ameliorate core phenotypes of FXS.</p><p>Ketogenic diets have previously been shown to improve both sleep and seizure control in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, albeit with limited effects on other behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Westmark et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Westmark et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Westmark et al., 2024</xref>).

Hence, the possibility that interventions designed to reinforce circadian rhythms can hold therapeutic value for individuals with FXS and related neurodevelopmental conditions. Given that sleep and circadian dysfunction are detectable early in development and are predictive of more severe clinical phenotypes, circadian-based interventions may be particularly beneficial if applied during periods of heightened neural plasticity. Importantly, TRF represents a relatively low-cost, non-invasive strategy that could be feasibly implemented in real-world settings. Further translational work is needed to evaluate whether the mechanistic links identified hereâbetween circadian misalignment, immune dysregulation, and behavioral impairmentsâare conserved in humans, and similar approaches can be implemented for clinical use.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and TRF paradigm</title><p>All experimental procedures were approved by the UCLA Animal Research Committee and conformed to guidelines from the UCLA Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine (DLAM) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Fragmentation was determined by the number of activity bouts per day, with one bout counted when activity was separated by a gap of 21 min or more (maximum gap: 21 min; threshold 3 counts/min). Imprecision, a measure of cycle-to-cycle variability or onset variability, was determined by calculating the daily variability in the time of activity onset from a best-fit regression line drawn through 10 days of activity in both LD and DD conditions using the ClockLab program (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL, United States).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Photic regulation of circadian behavior</title><p>Cohorts of age-matched WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice were single housed in cages with running wheels under a 12:12 hr LD cycle (300 lx, 4500 K) for 2 weeks and, after stable entrainment, exposed to four behavioral assays to test the photic regulation of their circadian system.</p><list list-type="order" id="list1"><list-item><p><underline>Photic suppression on nocturnal activity</underline> (negative light masking): mice were exposed to 1 hr of white light (300 lx, 4500 K) at ZT 14 to determine their response to light exposure during the dark period (masking of nocturnal activity).

Prior to the injections, the animals received a drop of a local ophthalmic anesthetic (Proparacaine HCl, 0.5%, Sandoz, Holzkirchen Germany) and an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (Carprofen, Zoetis, Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ). The mice were then anesthetized with isoflurane, and a 30 G needle (BD PrecisionGlide Needle; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes NJ) was inserted at a 45Â° angle into the sclera and the vitreous chamber, toward the base of the retina to allow leakage of vitreous humor. The Cholera Toxin (2 Î¼g in 2 Î¼l of sterile PBS) was injected into the vitreous chamber using a 32 G Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, Reno NV). The needle was left in place for 10 s before being retracted. Seventy-two hours after the injection, the mice were euthanized with isoflurane (30â32%) and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4) containing 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma).

They began by monitoring daily home cage behaviors to identify disruptions in sleep and circadian patterns, then assessed the mice's adaptability to altered light conditions through photic suppression and skeleton photoperiod experiments. To uncover potential mechanisms, they examined the connectivity between the retina and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The study also included an analysis of social behavior deficits in the mutant mice and tested whether scheduled feeding could alleviate these issues. Notably, scheduled feeding not only improved sleep, circadian, and social behaviors but also normalized plasma cytokine levels. The manuscript is strengthened by its focus on a significant and underexplored area-sleep deficits in an FXS model-and by its robust experimental design, which integrates a variety of methodological approaches to provide a thorough understanding of the observed phenomena and potential therapeutic avenues.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104720.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In the present study, the authors, using a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome, explore the intriguing hypothesis that restricting food access over the daily schedule will improve sleep patterns and subsequently enhance behavioral capacities. By restricting food access from 12h to 6h over the nocturnal period (the active period for mice), they show, in these KO mice, an improvement in the sleep pattern accompanied by reduced systemic levels of inflammatory markers and improved behavior. These data, using a classical mouse model of neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD), suggest that modifying eating patterns might improve sleep quality, leading to reduced inflammation and enhanced cognitive/behavioral capacities in children with NDD.</p><p>Overall, the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The rationale of the study is generally well introduced. Data are globally sound. The interpretation is overall supported by the provided data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

Implicationsâ</p><p>The present findings support the view that circadian disruption is not merely a downstream consequence of disease processes but actively contributes to symptom expression. Hence, the possibility that interventions designed to reinforce circadian rhythms can hold therapeutic value for individuals with FXS and related neurodevelopmental conditions. Given that sleep and circadian dysfunction are detectable early in development and are predictive of more severe clinical phenotypes, circadian-based interventions may be particularly beneficial if applied during periods of heightened neural plasticity. Importantly, time-restricted feeding represents a relatively low-cost, non-invasive strategy that could be feasibly implemented in realworld settings. Further translational work is needed to evaluate whether the mechanistic links identified hereâbetween circadian misalignment, immune dysregulation, and behavioral impairmentsâare conserved in humans, and similar approaches can be implemented for clinical use.</p></body></sub-article></article>
