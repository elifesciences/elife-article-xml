Since calorie restriction may modulate genetic or metabolic switches implicated in longevity from yeast to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guarente, 2006</xref>), proper metabolic adaptation due to nutritional changes may be critical processes in the regulation of lifespan. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> utilizes different carbon sources and adapts to various nutritional environments by changing its metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broach, 2012</xref>). In yeast, glucose is the preferred carbon source for growth. When external glucose levels are sufficient, yeast cells utilize fermentation for energy production even if the oxygen concentration is high. When the levels of glucose and other fermentable carbon sources run low, they shift energy metabolism from fermentation to the mitochondrial respiration pathway. Multiple signaling pathways including PKA/RAS, TOR, Sch9 cooperate to regulate this metabolic transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galdieri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilson and Roach, 2002</xref>), which is accompanied by global changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeRisi et al., 1997</xref>). Many factors important for regulation of the metabolic transition are also involved in the process of cellular aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>). Downregulation of the TOR, Sch9, and PKA/RAS pathways leads to extension of CLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fabrizio et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Longo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Powers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wei et al., 2008</xref>), which measures the length of time that non-dividing yeast cells survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Longo et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Chromatin-modifying enzymes also play roles in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benayoun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sen et al., 2016</xref>). The sirtuin deacetylase Sir2 regulates replicative lifespan (RLS) by reducing histone acetylation levels at telomeres and rDNA regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Imai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaeberlein et al., 1999</xref>). Inactivation of a chromatin remodeling protein, Isw2, extends RLS by induction of genotoxic stress response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dang et al., 2014</xref>). However, direct connections between nutrition sensing pathways and chromatin regulation in the aging process are still unknown. Interestingly, pyruvate kinases in yeast and humans have been shown to phosphorylate H3 at T11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that H3pT11 mediates a connection between metabolism and chromatin. Several different kinases are responsible for H3pT11. In yeast, Mek1 directly regulates H3pT11 during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Govin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kniewel et al., 2017</xref>). In humans, protein kinase N1, PKN1, phosphorylates H3T11 at promoters of androgen receptor dependent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Metzger et al., 2008</xref>), and checkpoint kinase 1, Chk1, phosphorylates H3T11 in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shimada et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The casein kinase two complex, CK2, is a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase complex which plays roles in cell growth and proliferation. CK2 is a conserved protein complex from yeast to human. Yeast CK2 consists of two catalytic subunits (a1 and a2) and two regulatory subunits (b1 and b2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Litchfield, 2003</xref>). CK2 phosphorylates many kinds of substrates including histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basnet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franchin et al., 2017</xref>), and this pleiotropy implies a broad function for CK2 in various biological pathways including glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgo et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, deletion of a CK2 catalytic subunit, Cka2, extends CLS in yeast; however, the mechanism of how CK2 regulates CLS is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fabrizio et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Here, we found that upon nutritional stress in yeast, the level of H3pT11 is specifically increased at stress responsive genes and regulates transcription of genes involved in metabolic transition. We also found that Sch9 and Cka1, a catalytic subunit of CK2, are required for the phosphorylation of H3T11 under the stress. Importantly, loss of H3pT11 prolongs CLS by altering the stress response at an early CLS stage, suggesting that H3pT11 by CK2 and Sch9 links nutritional stress to chromatin during in the aging process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>H3T11 phosphorylation is increased upon the nutritional stress</title><p>Our previous study implied a connection between H3pT11 and glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2015</xref>), therefore, we examined the relationship between H3pT11 and external glucose levels using an antibody specific to H3pT11 (validated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Yeast cells contain genes for cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosome subunits. Under nutritional stress, the transcription of genes for cytoplasmic ribosome subunits was downregulated, while transcription of genes for mitochondrial ribosome subunits was upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> upper panel).

To address this hypothesis, we tracked H3pT11 levels during the CLS assay. Interestingly, global levels of H3pT11 were significantly increased at day one after inoculation and then reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). At this time point, media glucose has been consumed and depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), and yeast cells begin to change the utilization of its carbon source metabolism from fermentation to respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeRisi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galdieri et al., 2010</xref>). We observed that this process is regulated by H3pT11 in nutritional stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Supplying glucose at day one after inoculation suppressed the elevation of H3pT11 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These data suggest that the increase in H3pT11 levels at early stage of CLS is anti-correlated with glucose availability in the media, and H3T11 phosphorylation mediated by Sch9 and CK2 affects lifespan by regulating the metabolic transition at this time point.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>H3pT11 controls CLS by regulation of acetic acid stress response</title><p>Upon depletion of glucose, yeast cells encounter several stresses including media acidification. Media acidification, especially by acetic acid produced during the early stage of the CLS assay has been suggested as a pro-aging factor. The glucose sensing pathway via Sch9 is responsible for the acetic acid stress response. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burtner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fabrizio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Longo et al., 2012</xref>). To know whether impaired H3pT11 affects acidification or the levels of acetic acid in the media, we measured media acetate level and pH during CLS analysis. There were no significant differences in media pH levels between WT and H3T11A during the first few days of CLS, and the media acetate levels were slightly higher in H3T11A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). However, H3T11A, and <italic>cka1Δ</italic> mutants, as well as <italic>sch9Δ</italic> mutant displayed strong resistance against a high acetic acid concentration in the media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). In addition, the <italic>sch9Δcka1Δ</italic> mutant showed similar acetic acid resistance to <italic>sch9Δ</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), as in the case of CLS control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We thought that extended CLS in H3T11 phosphorylation defective mutants (H3T11A, <italic>cka1Δ</italic>, <italic>sch9Δ</italic>, and <italic>sch9Δcka1Δ</italic>) might be correlated to their resistance to acetic acid. Supporting this idea, buffering media to pH 6.0 abolished the extension of CLS in H3T11A or <italic>cka1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). High level of acetic acid in the media disrupts glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sousa et al., 2012</xref>). We observed that media glucose levels remained stable (i.e. glucose was not consumed) even after 24 hr of WT culture in 50 mM acetic acid containing SDC media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting impairment of glucose utilization after acetic acid treatment. By contrast, media glucose was consumed in the 10 mM acetic acid condition, similar to the physiological acetic acid concentration of the media during CLS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Longo et al., 2012</xref>). As H3pT11 responds to low glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we tested whether media acetic acid affects H3pT11 level. Indeed, H3pT11 was induced by 50 mM acetic acid treatment, but not by 10 mM acetic acid treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

H3pT11 regulates transcription upon nutritional stress and accelerates aging or cell death. The phosphorylation of H3T11 upon nutritional stress depends on the Sch9 and CK2 kinases (Summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Sch9 has been shown to be activated upon nutritious conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Urban et al., 2007</xref>). Phosphorylation of Sch9 by the Torc1 complex is required for its activity and rapidly disappears within a few minutes upon nutritional stress. We found that Sch9 activity is required for the increase of H3pT11 in nutritional stress conditions wherein Sch9 is thought to be inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). There is the possibility that phosphorylation of H3T11 by either of CK2 or Sch9 under glucose-rich conditions is required for further induction of H3pT11 during glucose starvation. Although the global level of H3pT11 is very low in nutritious YPD media, both Sch9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and CK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) are required for this level of H3pT11 in YPD conditions. We cannot exclude the possibility that different kinase(s) other than Sch9 and CK2 are involved in increased H3pT11 upon the stress. However, H3pT11 induction depends on pre-existing H3pT11 levels or cooperation of CK2 with Sch9. Another possibility is that Sch9 functions in the stress conditions. Previous studies suggest that Sch9 is required for the induction of stress response genes by a Torc1-independent manner, and Sch9 activates transcription in response to osmotic stress by its binding to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pascual-Ahuir and Proft, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smets et al., 2008</xref>). We also observed that increases in the levels of H3pT11 upon stress is Tor1 independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, H3pT11 by Sch9 may function in a Tor1-independent pathway, which is governed by the interaction between CK2 and Sch9. In addition, we found that both Cka1 and Sch9 are bound to chromatin during glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), implying that they have a role at chromatin in this stress condition.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36157.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary models of H3pT11 functions upon stress conditions.</title><p>Additional files.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-36157-fig7-v2"/></fig><p>Our data indicate that Sch9 and CK2 genetically interact with each other in the regulation of H3pT11, acetic acid resistance, and CLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>).

Akt1 also phosphorylates CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nguyen and Mitchell, 2013</xref>). In addition, Sch9 and CK2 commonly phosphorylate some transcription factors, including the transcription factors Maf1 and Bdp1 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graczyk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2015</xref>).

These data suggest an intimate relationship between Sch9 and CK2. However, how these two kinases coordinate H3T11 phosphorylation, and how Sch9 and CK2 cooperatively sense nutrient stress needs to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Transcription regulation by H3pT11</title><p>H3pT11 has been implicated in transcription activation. In a human prostate tumor cell line, H3T11 phosphorylation by PKN1 is required for androgen stimulated gene transcription by facilitating removal of the repressive H3K9 methylation mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Metzger et al., 2008</xref>). In mouse MEF cells, H3pT11 by Chk1 kinase is reduced for the DNA damage response. Decreased H3pT11 levels cause repression of gene transcription, and reduction of H3K9 acetylation by GCN5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shimada et al., 2008</xref>). We also showed the roles of H3pT11 in transcription regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, the mechanism by which H3pT11 regulates transcription in response to nutritional stress is still elusive. Yeast Gcn5 acetyltransferase has been shown to have higher affinity to peptides containing H3S10 phosphorylation (H3pS10) or H3pT11 than unmodified H3 peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shimada et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, the crystal structure of Tetrahymena Gcn5 suggests that H3pS10 may facilitate the interaction between H3pT11 and Gcn5. It has been shown that H3pT11 is required for optimal H3pS10-dependent gene transcription in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clements et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, H3pT11 may serve as the binding moiety of chromatin readers such as Gcn5.

As seen in strong resistance to acetic acid in H3pT11 defective mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>), Sch9 and CK2 dependent H3pT11 induction may facilitate apoptosis under severe stress condition such as aging or high acetic acid. These H3pT11 effects, however, can be overcome by the beneficial effect of calorie restriction or buffering media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). It is noteworthy that H3pT11 induction upon nutritional stress depends on Sch9 and CK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), which have pro-aging roles. To understand the role of H3pT11 in regulation of CLS, the contributions of Sch9 and CK2 to the glucose starvation response needs to be elucidated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Differential peaks of H3pT11 between glucose and glycerol were called using R package DiffBind (2.0.9). Genes closest to differential peaks were identified using bedtools closest (2.26.0) to identify the closest transcription start site. After removing any Pol III, tRNA, and rRNA genes, 366 peaks were found up in glycerol versus glucose, and 139 peaks were down in glycerol versus glucose. Gene ontology enrichment was performed using a hypergeometric test in R. Terms shown in the barplot had p-value&lt;0.05. The length of the bar represents the fold enrichment of the term’s frequency in the list given the frequency of the term in the genome. Metagene plots were generated in R using 101-base mean-smoothed windows ± 2000 bases around the TSS or ± 500 bases around the transcript region (start to end). Different length genes were accommodated using the approx() function, which uses linear interpolation to define the approximated data points.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Matt Kaeberlein as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher Burtner (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers all appreciated the novelty and importance of this work. A few significant concerns were raised during the review process that should be addressed in a revised manuscript. Much of this can be addressed through appropriate changes to the text and discussion, although a couple of key experiments were also suggested.</p><p>1) The study provides a fairly comprehensive analysis of H3pT11 in chronological aging of yeast cells, but the data for replicatively aged cells is rather limited and diffuse from the rest of the manuscript. Although the authors show changes in H3pT11 during replicative aging using the mother enrichment program, the functional consequences of these changes are unclear. The obvious question is whether H3pT11 influences replicative lifespan and it is surprising the authors would put in the MEP data without that experiment. As is, the current incomplete data will be more confusing than helpful, as some readers may not understand the differences between these two types of aging in yeast. If the authors do not wish to perform the RLS analysis, it would be acceptable to simply remove the data for replicatively aged cells. Related to this, the authors need to be much more careful about clearly indicating whether they are referring to RLS or CLS throughout the entire manuscript. The reviewers recommend never using the word &quot;lifespan&quot; alone and instead explicitly stating whether you are referring to RLS or CLS. This is important because some of the literature referred to in the introduction are relevant only for RLS while other results are relevant only for CLS and most readers will likely not have the background knowledge to differentiate between the two types of aging in yeast.</p><p>2) There are some aspects of the work and the model that are a bit counterintuitive and/or which could be developed more thoroughly. Why does H3pT11 occur upon glucose restriction? Presumably this response is selected for some reason. What is the purpose? It is also counterintuitive that Sch9 would become activated toward this substrate, since Sch9 activity is inhibited under glucose restriction. How does this work? The authors don't actually show that Sch9 is phosphorylating H3 in vivo, and although the genetic evidence and in vitro data are consistent with they are also both indirect. Can Sch9 or Cka2 be localized to chromatin during glucose starvation?</p><p>3) Related to #2, the gene expression and stress resistance relationship also seems counterintuitive. Under low glucose/nutritional stress, the authors show that H3T11 becomes hyper-phosphorylated and associated gene expression, including increased stress response and metabolic changes. These changes make perfect sense for CR. And they showed that H3pT11 is responsible for these transcriptional changes since H3T11A had the opposite effects. If so, how do the authors explain the enhanced stress resistance and lifespan extension of H3T11A, since it seems to be antagonizing the stress and metabolic response of CR?</p><p>4) Are the reported epigenetic responses really a response to &quot;nutritional stress&quot; or a normal part of the diauxic shift, similar to H3K79 methylation (see Young et al., 2017)? It would be useful to see a direct comparison the genes identified by H3pT11 ChIPseq and those involved in the diauxic shift. The authors hint at similarity in Figure 2C, but no statistical analysis is performed between these two subsets. Seems like overlap may be significant, and if so, this is likely an epigenetic mark of the metabolic shift than of any stress response or aging per se.</p><p>5) In Figure 1A, it is important to know when cell lysates were collected and how much glucose is present in the cultures at the time of collection. How long were cells cultured in 0.02%, 0.2% and 2% glucose prior to the Western blot? Glucose is quickly depleted by yeast cells as they enter log phase (your 0.02% glucose will be 0% in 2-3 hours meaning the cells will have already entered respiratory metabolism.) In the other conditions, cells may be cycling in the presence of glucose or not, depending on when the lysate was taken. This missing information may be important when considering whether this is an epigenetic mark of the diauxic shift, or something else, like a stress.</p><p>6) Figure 2A is particularly confusing and poorly described. What exactly is the 1355 referring to? What is the justification for selecting the 5 groups?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36157.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers all appreciated the novelty and importance of this work.

We think nutritional stress response and metabolic stress in aging employ H3pT11 as a signal. As the reviewer mentioned, there are still some unclear mechanisms upstream of H3pT11. For example, how Sch9 and CK2 coordinate the phosphorylation of H3T11. We discussed these points in the Discussion section of revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also counterintuitive that Sch9 would become activated toward this substrate, since Sch9 activity is inhibited under glucose restriction.

In this study, we showed Sch9 and CK2, which are important in proliferative growth, are required for H3T11 phosphorylation in nutritional stress conditions. In addition, the roles of Sch9 and CK2 in the regulation of H3T11 phosphorylation, chronological life span, and acetic acid resistance are mutually required although each kinase can independently phosphorylate H3T11 in vitro. As we described above, we hope to further address how Sch9 and CK2 cooperate to phosphorylate H3T11 and how nutrition status and these kinases regulate H3pT11. We discussed these points and described our insights in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript. To address the reviewer’s question, we analyzed chromatin bound proteins in cells cultured in YPD and YPglycerol condition. We found that both CK2 and Sch9 are bound to chromatin during glucose starvation (Figure 4D in the revised manuscript). These data suggest that CK2 and Sch9 phosphorylate H3T11 on chromatin during glucose starvation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to #2, the gene expression and stress resistance relationship also seems counterintuitive.

We have shown that the H3T11A mutant and other mutants defective in H3pT11 regulate CLS by increasing acetic acid resistance (Figure 6). In yeast, high levels of acetic acid can induce apoptotic cell death (Ludovico et al., 2001). The levels of H3pT11 increased in the presence of high levels of acetic acid (Figure 6D). Thus, we think that H3pT11 induction may facilitate apoptosis under severe stress conditions such as aging or high acetic acid in a Sch9 and CK2 dependent manner. However, the effects of H3pT11 can be overcome by beneficial influences of calorie restrictions or buffering media (Figure 6C and Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). We will study if Sch9 functions in the stress condition as described in comment #2. If Sch9 has a pro-aging effect in the stress condition as well as in the nutritious condition, a role of H3pT11 in the stress condition is not counterintuitive because H3pT11 may mimic <italic>sch9Δ</italic> in the stress situation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Are the reported epigenetic responses really a response to &quot;nutritional stress&quot; or a normal part of the diauxic shift, similar to H3K79 methylation (see Young et al., 2017)?

Seems like overlap may be significant, and if so, this is likely an epigenetic mark of the metabolic shift than of any stress response or aging per se.</p></disp-quote><p>Diauxic shift is characterized by a switching from rapid fermentative growth to slower aerobic respiration upon the depletion of required carbon sources (Galdieri et al., 2010). In this manuscript, we measured nutritional stress response in the low level of glucose. It has been shown that changes in the cells undergoing diauxic shift are similar to the changes in the cells under stress (Gray et al., 2004; Herman, 2002; Werner-Washburne et al., 1993,). Therefore, we think that diauxic shift is a part of the nutritional stress response in this condition. We showed that the levels of H3pT11 is significantly enriched at genes involved in various stress responses and aging processes in Figure 1E. Thus, H3pT11 functions for not only the transcription of the genes regulating metabolic shift, but also transcription of genes regulating stress response and aging. To make this point clear, we edited the text and added new figures showing that the transcriptions of genes regulating responses to heat, oxidative stress, and chronological aging are also modified by defects of H3T11 phosphorylation upon nutritional stress (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B).</p><p>H3K79 methylation during diauxic shift, described in Young et al., 2017, BMC genomics 18, 107, has many features, which differ from features of H3pT11. For instance, the global level of H3K79me3 is not changed during the diauxic shift. H3K79 mono- and di-methylation is abolished in quiescent cells; however, H3K79me2 levels are not changed during diauxic shift. In addition, H3K79me3 loci are not significantly changed between log phase cells and quiescent cells, and H3K79me3 is linked to transcription regulation during this stage. However, we observed that H3pT11 levels robustly increased during this stage (Figure 5D). H3pT11 is correlated with transcription regulation involved in metabolic shift and stress responses (Figure 1E and Figure 2). Thus, we think H3pT11 is not only a consequence of diauxic shift like H3K79 methylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 1A, it is important to know when cell lysates were collected and how much glucose is present in the cultures at the time of collection.

WT cultures at early mid-log phase (OD 0.4-0.6) were shifted from YPD to YP containing various concentration of glucose for 1 hour. We have also tested the glucose level after 1hr incubation in YP + 0.02% glucose media as below. We found 1hour incubation, in which we analyzed H3pT11 levels shown in Figure 1A, is not enough to consume all glucose in the media containing 0.02% glucose (Author Response Image 1). We can add this data to the manuscript if required.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36157.023</object-id><label>Author Response Image 1</label><caption><title>&lt;&gt;</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-36157-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 2A is particularly confusing and poorly described.

The groups are based on dividing the genes into equally sized quantiles based on the RPKM value in YPglycerol condition. We clarified this in revised figure legend 2A. As we arbitrarily divide groups into 5, we also divided groups into three (each group contains 2258 or 2259 genes). We found that group numbers do not lead to changing our conclusion that H3pT11 is positively correlated with mRNA expression levels in nutritional stress condition (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A).</p></body></sub-article></article>
