At this time, the embryo takes control of its development and transcription begins. How the onset of zygotic transcription is regulated remains unclear. Here, we show that a dynamic competition for DNA binding between nucleosome-forming histones and transcription factors regulates zebrafish genome activation. Taking a quantitative approach, we found that the concentration of non-DNA-bound core histones sets the time for the onset of transcription. The reduction in nuclear histone concentration that coincides with genome activation does not affect nucleosome density on DNA, but allows transcription factors to compete successfully for DNA binding. In agreement with this, transcription factor binding is sensitive to histone levels and the concentration of transcription factors also affects the time of transcription. Our results demonstrate that the relative levels of histones and transcription factors regulate the onset of transcription in the embryo.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23326.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23326.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23326.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The DNA in a fertilized egg contains all the information required to form an animal’s body. In order for the animal to develop properly, particular genes encoded in the DNA are only active at specific times. The DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones, which allows the DNA to be tightly packed inside the cell. However, histones can block other proteins called transcription factors from binding to the DNA to activate the genes. Young embryos initially develop with all of their genes switched off, relying on the nutrients and other molecules provided by their mother. After some time, the embryo starts to switch on its own genes to take control of its own development, but it was not clear how this happens.</p><p>Joseph et al. investigated how genes are activated in zebrafish embryos, which are often used as models to study how animals develop. The experiments show that competition between histones and transcription factors for binding to DNA controls when genes are switched on. In young fish embryos, there are so many histones present that transcription factors have no opportunity to bind to DNA. Over time, however, the numbers of histones decrease, allowing transcription factors to bind to DNA and switch on genes.</p><p>Histones and transcription factors regulate the activity of genes throughout the life of the animal. Therefore, competition between these two types of protein may also control gene activity in other situations. A better understanding of how gene activity is controlled could allow researchers to more easily grow different types of cell in the laboratory or to reprogram specific cells in the body. As such, these new findings may aid the development of therapies to regenerate organs or tissues that have been damaged by injury or disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23326.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23326.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ZGA</kwd><kwd>transcription regulation</kwd><kwd>histones</kwd><kwd>embryogenesis</kwd><kwd>competition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joseph</surname><given-names>Shai R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joseph</surname><given-names>Shai R</given-names></name><name><surname>Pálfy</surname><given-names>Máté</given-names></name><name><surname>Hilbert</surname><given-names>Lennart</given-names></name><name><surname>Karschau</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name><name><surname>Zaburdaev</surname><given-names>Vasily</given-names></name><name><surname>Shevchenko</surname><given-names>Andrej</given-names></name><name><surname>Vastenhouw</surname><given-names>Nadine L</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Mukesh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDA00060/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vastenhouw</surname><given-names>Nadine L</given-names></name><name><surname>Pálfy</surname><given-names>Máté</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The relative levels of histones and transcription factors in the nucleus determine transcriptional output in zebrafish embryos.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In many organisms, early embryonic development is directed exclusively by maternal products that are deposited into the female gamete during oogenesis. Following the clearance of a subset of these products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yartseva and Giraldez, 2015</xref>), transcription is initiated and the zygotic genome acquires developmental control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrison and Eisen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>). This handover is referred to as the maternal-to-zygotic transition and the onset of transcription is called zygotic genome activation (ZGA). The absolute time and number of cell cycles required before the first transcripts can be detected is species specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>). Additionally, from one gene to another the timing of transcriptional activation varies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aanes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heyn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Owens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pauli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sandler and Stathopoulos, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tan et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, for some genes the first zygotic transcripts can be detected several cell cycles before the stage that is traditionally defined as the time point of ZGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Renzis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heyn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Skirkanich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). In spite of the progress made, it remains unclear how the onset of transcription in embryos is temporally regulated.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that the absence of transcription during early embryonic development could be due to limited levels of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Almouzni and Wolffe, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Veenstra et al., 1999</xref>). In this scenario, transcriptional activation would occur once a threshold level of these factors is reached. For example, experiments that used the transcriptional activity of injected plasmids as a read-out revealed that an increase in the amount of the potent, heterologous, transcriptional activator GAL4-VP16 can overcome transcriptional repression of its target gene in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Almouzni and Wolffe, 1995</xref>). However, it remained unclear whether limited levels of transcription factors contribute to the absence of endogenous transcription in early embryos. Additional support for the limited machinery model came from work showing that an increase in the concentration of the general transcription factor TBP can cause premature transcription from an injected – and incompletely chromatinized – DNA template in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos. This effect was maintained only when non-specific DNA was added to titrate chromatin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Almouzni and Wolffe, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Veenstra et al., 1999</xref>). These results suggested that low TBP levels may play a role in the absence of transcription during the early stages of <italic>Xenopus</italic> development, but that increasing TBP alone is not sufficient to cause sustained premature transcription. During the cleavage stages of <italic>Xenopus</italic> development, TBP levels increase due to translation, which suggests that TBP levels might contribute to the timely activation of transcription during ZGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Veenstra et al., 1999</xref>). Transcription factors have recently been identified that are required for the activation of the first zygotically expressed genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Zelda) and zebrafish (Pou5f3, Sox19b, Nanog) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leichsenring et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nien et al., 2011</xref>). RNA for these factors is maternally provided and their levels increase due to translation during the early cell cycles. This suggests the possibility that an increase in the concentration of these transcription factors might contribute to the shift from transcriptional repression to transcriptional activity. Although transcription factors levels clearly influence transcriptional activity during early embryogenesis, there is evidence to show that the transcriptional machinery is operational prior to ZGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dekens et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Newport and Kirschner, 1982a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">1982b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Prioleau et al., 1994</xref>) (see below). Thus, the timing of ZGA cannot be solely explained by a requirement to reach a threshold level of transcriptional activators.</p><p>The finding that a premature increase in the number of nuclei or the amount of DNA resulted in premature transcription of injected plasmids in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos suggested that the transcriptional machinery is fully functional prior to genome activation and led to the excess repressor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Newport and Kirschner, 1982a</xref>). This model postulates that a transcriptional repressor is titrated by binding to the exponentially increasing amount of genomic DNA, until it is depleted first from the soluble fraction, and then from DNA, to allow for the onset of transcription. Related studies in zebrafish and <italic>Drosophila</italic> have provided further evidence for this model. Endogenous transcription is initiated earlier in zebrafish embryos that accumulate DNA due to a defect in chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dekens et al., 2003</xref>), and transcription is delayed in haploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos compared to diploid embryos, albeit not for all genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). The excess repressor model predicts that the repressor is present in large excess, at relatively stable levels while the genome is inactive, and can bind DNA with high affinity. Core histones fulfill these criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamson and Woodland, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Woodland and Adamson, 1977</xref>). Moreover, when bound to DNA in the form of nucleosomes, histones can affect DNA accessibility for DNA-binding proteins. To date, two key studies have investigated the role of core histones in the temporal regulation of zygotic transcription in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Almouzni and Wolffe, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amodeo et al., 2015</xref>). Experiments that used the transcriptional activity of injected plasmids as a read-out revealed that premature transcription caused by an excess of non-specific DNA can be negated by the addition of histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Almouzni and Wolffe, 1995</xref>). More recently, the level of histones H3/H4 was shown to regulate the level of transcription in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract and H3 was suggested to play a similar role in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amodeo et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, these results support the idea that histones play a role in regulating the timing of zygotic transcription.</p><p>If histones function as repressors according to the original excess repressor model, it would be predicted that a substantial reduction of the histone-density on DNA would cause the onset of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amodeo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Newport and Kirschner, 1982a</xref>). However, while such a scenario might be possible for typical sequence-specific repressors of transcription, it is unlikely for histones. Histones assemble into histone octamers on DNA to form nucleosomes, the basic building blocks of chromatin. Thus, random depletion of nucleosomes from DNA would severely compromise the integrity of chromatin structure. Taken together, there is support for the idea that histone levels play a role in regulating the timing of zygotic transcription, but it remains unclear how this would mechanistically work. Furthermore, the observation that both activator and histone levels play a role in shifting the balance between repression and activation at genome activation remains to be clarified.</p><p>Here, we analyze the onset of zygotic transcription in zebrafish embryos. With a quantitative approach, we show that the concentration of non-DNA-bound histones determines the timing of zygotic transcription and that all four core histones are required for this effect. The reduction in nuclear histone concentration that coincides with genome activation does not result in a significant change in nucleosome density, but rather allows transcription factors to successfully compete for DNA binding. In agreement with this, the association of transcription factors with the genome is sensitive to histone levels, and changing the concentration of transcription factors also affects the time of transcription. Our results show that transcription is regulated by a dynamic competition for DNA binding between histones and transcription factors. Transcription begins when the concentration of non-DNA-bound histones in the nucleus has sufficiently dropped so that the transcriptional machinery can outcompete histones for binding to DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In zebrafish, zygotic transcription starts ~3 hr post-fertilization, around the tenth cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aanes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heyn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kane and Kimmel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pauli et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To analyze the onset of transcription in the embryo in detail, we identified six genes that are not maternally provided and that have previously been shown to be activated at the onset of genome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aanes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pauli et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At the 1000-cell (1K) stage, transcripts can be detected, especially when choosing late stage embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, to clearly distinguish between transcription being off and on, we analyzed early 1K and (mid) high stage embryos. Using this approach, analysis by qPCR allowed us to detect consistent induction of these genes at high stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We will refer to the stages before and after induction as before and following genome activation. To relate the onset of transcription to the number of cells present in the embryo, we next counted the number of cells in embryos ranging from 1K to dome stage. We imaged DAPI-stained nuclei on a two-photon microscope and counted them using the software Imaris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Using nuclei as a proxy for cell number, we obtained counts that agreed with numbers of cells per embryo obtained by others for 1K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keller et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, our cell count for high stage, for example, was slightly higher (1900 vs 1800) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keller et al., 2008</xref>), which is consistent with the later high stage which we analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We conclude that the set of genes we selected is robustly induced at high stage, when embryos contain ~1900 cells, and thus represent a reliable system to analyze the onset of zygotic transcription during embryogenesis.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23326.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Assay to analyze the onset of transcription in zebrafish.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In zebrafish, transcription begins ~3 hr post-fertilization.

To analyze whether in zebrafish, histones are potential candidates to be excess repressors, we analyzed the relative levels of the core histones—H3, H4, H2A and H2B—by Western blot. We found that they are present at relatively stable amounts from 8-cell to 1K stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Assuming that at 1K stage there are sufficient histones to wrap all genomes into chromatin, this suggests that histones are in excess relative to the amount of DNA during the earlier stages. Thus, histones could function as excess repressors of the zygotic genome in zebrafish.</p><p>If histones function as excess repressors in zebrafish embryos, it would be predicted that their level would affect the onset of transcription. To test this, we analyzed the effect of increasing the amount of histones in the embryo on the timing of transcriptional activation. We injected a stoichiometric mixture of the four core histones (from here on referred to as histone cocktail, HC; see Materials and methods for more details) into embryos at the 1-cell stage and then analyzed the onset of transcription for the previously characterized set of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1B</xref>). An increase in the amount of histones delayed the onset of transcriptional activation: transcripts were detected at high stage in uninjected embryos, whereas in embryos injected with histone cocktail, transcription was only induced at oblong stage, a complete developmental stage later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Comparison of gene expression levels in uninjected and injected embryos at high stage (when transcripts can consistently be detected in uninjected embryos) revealed that the level of induction is reduced significantly upon injection of the histone cocktail but not upon injection of BSA as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, bar graphs). Extending the analysis further, a large set of genes in Nanostring analysis confirmed that the effect we observed is general, and not limited to six genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

The total protein content was kept constant by raising the level of the other three histones. Removing any histone from the histone cocktail impaired the ability of the histone cocktail to delay the onset of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results show that the injection of basic proteins into the embryo per se does not affect the onset of transcription. Moreover, these results argue that the effect of the histone cocktail relies on increasing the amount of all four histones and suggest that histones exert their repressive effect together.</p><p>Since the onset of zygotic transcription is known to be required for gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kane et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zamir et al., 1997</xref>), we analyzed the effect of injecting the histone cocktail on the onset of gastrulation. Embryos injected with the histone cocktail initiated gastrulation later than uninjected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Although there was a delay following injection of BSA, it was significantly shorter than that observed with the histone cocktail and appeared to be a non-specific effect of injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Following the onset of gastrulation, embryos appeared to develop normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, 24 hpf). Removing any histone from the histone cocktail reduced the developmental delay we observed upon injecting the histone cocktail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We note that the developmental delay in the minus-one histone experiments was not reduced to the level observed for BSA injections. We therefore expect that injecting histones has an additional effect on developmental progression that is independent of the delay in transcription. We conclude that the delay in transcription as a consequence of increased histone levels causes a delay in the onset of gastrulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Decreasing the pool of available histones causes premature transcription</title><p>If the level of histones regulates zygotic genome activation, it can also be predicted that a reduction in histone levels would result in the premature induction of transcription. A large fraction of the histones that is present at the onset of transcription is loaded in the egg already as protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Pentraxin three is a soluble pattern recognition molecule that has been shown to rapidly and irreversibly bind to the core histones H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bottazzi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daigo et al., 2014</xref>). We injected mRNA encoding PTX3 fused to RFP, to reduce the pool of available histones H3 and H4 in the zebrafish embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As expected, total levels of H3 and H4 were not affected upon injection of this fusion construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Next, we examined if H4 co-precipitated with RFP-tagged PTX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Indeed, this histone associates with PTX3 in vivo, suggesting that the injection of PTX3 results in a reduction of the soluble amount of histones H3 and H4 in zebrafish cells. A decrease in the soluble amount of histones caused premature transcription activation: transcripts were detected at early 1K stage, while in the uninjected embryos, transcripts were only detected at mid 1K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

To test this prediction, we determined the absolute (molar) content and, correspondingly, the number of molecules of core histones in embryos using a quantitative mass spectrometry approach we recently developed (Kumar et al., unpublished) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and Materials and methods for more details). We analyzed embryos ranging from 1-cell to shield stage, when gastrulation is well underway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). We observed an increase in the levels of histone protein until 1K stage, after which levels remained reasonably stable until sphere stage. Then, a rapid increase was observed, which is most likely the result of translation of zygotically produced histone mRNAs. Knowing the absolute numbers of histones per embryo as well as the calculated number of histones required to wrap a genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figre 4—source data 1</xref>), allowed us to derive the number of genomes worth of histones per embryo. From that, we derived the number of excess (non-DNA bound) histones per cell in genomes worth of histones, for embryos ranging from 1-cell to dome stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and Materials and methods for more details). For example, at the 1-cell stage, there are 3098 times more histones per cell than are required to wrap the genome into chromatin. Due to the exponential increase in cell number during cleavage divisions, this number has dropped dramatically at 1K stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, due to the large number of histones that is loaded in the oocyte, as well as the increase in histone level due to translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), there are still nine genomes worth of non-DNA-bound histones per cell. Moreover, because what matters for protein-binding kinetics is the concentration, we next calculated the concentration of non-DNA-bound histones. Because the cleavage divisions are not accompanied by significant growth (the total animal cap volume increases by 29% from 128-cell to 1K, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the decreasing number of histones per cell is accompanied by a decreasing cellular volume, and the concentration of non-DNA bound histones in the cell does not change substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Taken together, this shows that during transcription activation there is still a significant amount of non-DNA-bound histone and that the overall concentration of non-DNA-bound histones in the cell has not decreased by much.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23326.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Onset of transcription coincides with a reduction in nuclear histone concentration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Our quantitative mass spectrometry approach.

First, we analyzed the dynamics of histone localization by lightsheet microscopy of living embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). As expected, we found a close coordination between the formation of nuclei after cell division and the import of histones from the cytoplasm into the nucleus: during each cell cycle, non-DNA-bound histones are concentrated in the nucleus. A direct quantification of non-DNA-bound, endogenous histones in the nucleus is difficult, but by combining lightsheet microscopy measurements of both the nuclear volume fraction and the relative fluorescence intensity of histone H4 in cytoplasm and nucleus with the absolute amount of histone H4 as quantified by mass spectrometry, we were able to calculate the nuclear concentration of non-DNA-bound histones from 256-cell to oblong stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> and see Materials and methods for more details). Importantly, our calculations indicate a decrease in the nuclear concentration of non-DNA-bound histones at the onset of transcription. In combination with our finding that histone levels determine the timing of transcription, this suggests that a decrease in the concentration of non-DNA-bound histones in the nucleus causes the onset of transcription during embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Nucleosome density on DNA is unchanged during genome activation</title><p>We next analyzed whether the decreased concentration of non-DNA bound histones in the nucleus is accompanied by a reduced density of nucleosomes on chromatin. We quantified the amount of histone H2B in the chromatin fraction of embryos ranging from 256-cell to high stage. Comparing the amount of histone H2B between stages revealed that the level of H2B scales with the amount of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This is in agreement with a previous study in which we found that the density of nucleosomes does not significantly change during genome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).

To explain the effect of histone levels on zygotic genome activation, we hypothesized that the transcriptional machinery (for simplicity referred to as transcription factors) competes with nucleosome-forming histones for binding to only a minimal fraction of the total DNA, corresponding to transcription-factor-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In such a model, local substitution of nucleosomes by transcription factors allows for transcription to be activated, but will cause only localized changes in nucleosome positioning, and will barely affect the average nucleosome density. Transcription factors would lose the competition for DNA binding in the presence of an excess of histones (pre-ZGA), whereas a reduction of the concentration of non-DNA-bound histones in the nucleus would allow transcription factors to gain access to DNA (approaching ZGA) and initiate transcription (ZGA).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Decreasing transcription factor levels delays the onset of transcription</title><p>If competition between nucleosome-forming histones and the transcriptional machinery determines the onset of transcription, it would be predicted that the levels at which transcription factors are present could also affect the timing of zygotic transcription.

Endogenous gene regulation, however, is intrinsically complex, with multiple transcription factors providing input on the same gene, and often there is limited information on the number and strength of activator-binding sites. Because this might have affected the results we obtained with endogenous transcription factors and genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we decided to take advantage of a heterologous system to confirm our results. The integrated inducible transgene TRE:GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) contains seven binding sites for tTA–VP16 as well as a CMV promoter and is strictly dependent on tTA–VP16 for its expression (data not shown). tTA-VP16 was tagged with HA and a protein product was detected at the 1K stage following injection of mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Injection of 5 pg of mRNA encoding the heterologous transcription factor tTA-VP16 resulted in the detection of transcripts at high stage, in accordance with the onset of zygotic transcription of endogenous genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Next, we analyzed the transcriptional activity of this transgene upon injection of 300 pg of mRNA encoding tTA-VP16 and we observed that transcripts could be detected at early 1K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Comparison of gene expression levels at early 1K stage (one stage prior to when genes are first induced in embryos injected with 5 pg of mRNA) in embryos injected with 5 and 300 pg of mRNA revealed that the number of transcripts is increased significantly upon increasing the level of transcription factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, bar graph). Next, we tested whether an increase in histone levels would negate the effect of high levels of transcription factor. As predicted by the competition model, the increase in transcriptional activity that is observed upon the injection of 300 pg of tTA-VP16 mRNA is lost when the histone cocktail is co-injected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Finally, we determined whether the binding of tTA is affected by histone levels. We analyzed the binding of tTA-VP16 to the TRE sites in the transgene by ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We found that upon injecting 300 pg of tTA-VP16 mRNA, the binding of the transcription factor was readily detected at early 1K stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As expected, binding of the transcription factor was significantly reduced when the HC was co-injected.

Upon fertilization, there is a large excess of histones stockpiled in the embryo and transcription starts when the concentration of non-DNA-bound histones in the nucleus drops, and the transcriptional machinery gains access to DNA. Thus, the relative concentrations of both histones and transcription factors determine the timing of zygotic genome activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Our observations provide, to our knowledge, the first example of a developmental transition in which competition for DNA binding between histones and transcription factors plays an important role in transcriptional regulation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>All core histones are important for timing of transcription</title><p>Our observation that histone levels affect the time of transcription onset in zebrafish embryos is in agreement with previous studies that showed a role of histones in the regulation of transcription in early <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos and extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Almouzni and Wolffe, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amodeo et al., 2015</xref>). However, our finding that histones are neither completely depleted from the soluble fraction, nor generally depleted from chromatin, argues against a model in which a global loss of nucleosome density on chromatin causes the onset of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amodeo et al., 2015</xref>). Our work does not exclude the importance of other factors, such as the linker histone H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pérez-Montero et al., 2013</xref>), the embryonic form of which is stably present during zebrafish genome activation, but it establishes that core histones themselves function as actual repressors of transcription.</p><p>Our discovery that all core histones are required to regulate the onset of transcription suggests that the nucleosome is important for the repressor function of histones. In a previous study, premature transcription of injected plasmids caused by an excess of non-specific DNA was negated by the addition of the four core histones, but histones were not tested separately and it was not clear whether one or more histones were required for the observed effect on transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Almouzni and Wolffe, 1995</xref>). This left open the possibility that single histones could repress transcriptional activity in the embryo, for example by binding to a transcription factor and preventing it from binding to DNA. However, our observation that in the embryo all core histones are important for the regulation of transcription would then require all histones to independently take part in this mode of repression. Because this is a very unlikely scenario, we propose that repression takes place close to DNA, where histones are assembled into a histone octamer to form the nucleosome.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Changes in nuclear histone concentration during genome activation</title><p>We propose that genome activation follows a decrease in the concentration of non-DNA bound histones in the nucleus. One possible way to explain the reduction in nuclear histone concentration is the exponential increase in DNA content during the cleavage stages of zebrafish development. Because histones have a high affinity for DNA, an increase in the amount of DNA would titrate out non-DNA-bound histones. Several experiments have indeed shown that changes in DNA content can affect the time of transcription in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dekens et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Newport and Kirschner, 1982a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Prioleau et al., 1994</xref>). Our data suggest that these effects were the result of reducing the concentration of non-DNA-bound histones. In zebrafish embryos, the amount of histones is so large that the increase in DNA content leading up to genome activation may contribute only moderately to a decrease in the concentration of non-DNA-bound histones in the nucleus.</p><p>Another possible explanation for the decrease in nuclear histone concentration is the marked increase in the ratio of nuclear over cytoplasmic volume during the cleavage stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We suggest that this may limit the capacity of the nucleus to concentrate histones. The process of nuclear transport has been investigated in great detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim and Elbaum, 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kopito and Elbaum, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2009</xref>), and we can assume that the nuclear envelope can create a certain fold difference in concentrations between the nucleus and cytoplasm. During the initial stages of zebrafish development, the nucleus occupies only a very small fraction of the cell volume (1.1% at 128-cell stage, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As a result, when the nucleus concentrates histones up to the maximum fold difference between cytoplasm and nucleus, the cytoplasmic histone concentration is hardly altered. Later in development, when approaching the onset of zygotic transcription, the nucleus takes up a notably larger part of the total cell volume (7.1% at high stage, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Now, when histones are imported into the nucleus, the concentration of histones in the cytoplasm noticeably decreases. The nuclear envelope is still able to create approximately the same fold difference of concentrations, but due to the reduced cytoplasmic concentration, the achieved nuclear concentration is not as high as during the initial stages. Thus, in this scenario, the nuclear histone concentration decreases due to the increasing relative nuclear size, which alters the distribution of histones among cellular compartments. It may be expected that the relative increase in nuclear size affects the nuclear concentration of transcription factors as well, and it remains to be seen how the concentration of histones and transcription factors change with respect to each other in order to activate transcription. Experiments recently performed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> showed that changing the size of the nucleus affects the timing of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jevtić and Levy, 2015</xref>), providing further evidence for a role of nuclear size in regulating the onset of transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Competition for DNA binding determines transcription onset</title><p>Our finding that the onset of transcription depends on the concentration of histones, but also on the concentration of transcription factors, is consistent with previous studies that suggested an important role for transcriptional activators in the temporal regulation of zygotic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Almouzni and Wolffe, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Prioleau et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Veenstra et al., 1999</xref>). Because transcription can be induced prior to the onset of genome activation, both by adding DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dekens et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Newport and Kirschner, 1982a</xref>) or removing histones (this study), we suggest that transcription factors required for the onset of transcription are in principle present prior to genome activation. To shift the balance from repression to activation, the relative concentrations of histones and transcription factors need to be changed in favor of transcription factors. This would explain previous observations in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, where the addition of TBP (in combination with adding DNA) or GAL4-VP16 resulted in premature transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Almouzni and Wolffe, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Veenstra et al., 1999</xref>). Based on our findings, those experiments would have shifted the balance in favor of transcriptional activity, similar to the effect observed when we increased transcription factor levels or decreased histone levels.</p><p>Our model in which histones and transcription factors dynamically compete for DNA binding to regulate transcription in the embryo is consistent with the notion that most transcription factors cannot bind DNA when it is wrapped around a nucleosome and thus compete with nucleosomes for DNA access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Almouzni and Wolffe, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almouzni et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayes and Wolffe, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miller and Widom, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mirny, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ramachandran and Henikoff, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Raveh-Sadka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schild-Poulter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Svaren et al., 1994</xref>). Initially, there is a large excess of histones stockpiled in the embryo and transcription starts when the concentration of non-DNA-bound histones in the nucleus drops and the transcriptional machinery gains access to DNA. In contrast to a competition model that was previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Prioleau et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">1995</xref>), transcription factors do not need to be pre-bound to DNA in order to compete with histones, but rather, they dynamically compete with histones for DNA binding.</p><p>Our experiments did not address when competition takes place during the cell cycle. Competition for DNA binding might either occur immediately following replication, on temporarily naked DNA, or following chromatin assembly. Recent studies assessing the nucleosome landscape following replication have revealed that replication-coupled nucleosome assembly initially outcompetes transcription factors for binding to DNA but that chromatin remodeling and phasing of nucleosomes by remodelers and transcription factors occurs rapidly thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fennessy and Owen-Hughes, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ramachandran and Henikoff, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vasseur et al., 2016</xref>). Future experiments will determine the details of competition in the early embryo, with its rapid cell cycles and large pool of soluble histones.</p><p>To gain further insight in the molecular details of competition that lead up to genome activation, it will be important to determine which factors compete with histones for DNA binding. In theory, the binding of all factors that require access to DNA could be affected by histone levels, suggesting that competition might take place at many levels of transcription regulation: the formation of higher order chromatin structure, chromatin remodeling, the binding of transcription factors, and the assembly of the basal transcription complex. Our results show that the transcription factors that have been identified to regulate many genes during genome activation in zebrafish (Pou5f3 and Sox19b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leichsenring et al., 2013</xref>), as well as FoxH1 and the heterologous transcription factor tTA-VP16, compete with histones for binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). In this context, it is interesting to note that the transcription factors that have been identified to play a role in genome activation have either been suggested to be pioneer factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leichsenring et al., 2013</xref>), or there is indication for such a role because of their homology with mammalian pioneer factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leichsenring et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Soufi et al., 2012</xref>). Pioneer factors are able to interact with DNA that is nucleosome bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zaret and Carroll, 2011</xref>). In the context of the competition model, it will be interesting to see whether these factors also have pioneering activity in the early embryo, and how this affects their role in activating transcription in the embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>General relevance of competition in development</title><p>The applicability of the competition model might extend well beyond the onset of zygotic transcription in zebrafish. First, given the excess of histones in a large number of species including <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamson and Woodland, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marzluff and Duronio, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Osley, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vastenhouw et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Woodland and Adamson, 1977</xref>), it is likely that histone levels play a role in the timing of zygotic transcription across these species. As discussed, in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos there is indeed evidence for a role of histone levels in regulating transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Almouzni and Wolffe, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amodeo et al., 2015</xref>). Additional experiments will be required to determine whether the competition model we propose applies to these and other species. Second, the onset of zygotic transcription in the embryo takes place in the context of the mid-blastula transition and is accompanied by a lengthening of the cell cycle and changes in chromatin structure. Although it had previously been suggested that the rapid cell cycles lacking G1 and G2 phases might interfere with productive transcription during early developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Edgar and Schubiger, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kimelman et al., 1987</xref>), it was recently shown that the lengthening of the cell cycle might be a direct consequence of the onset of transcription in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2015b</xref>). This would suggest that what regulates the onset of zygotic transcription might also dictate the lengthening of the cell cycle. Finally, post-translational modification of histones often requires a chromatin-modifying enzyme to bind to DNA, much like transcription factors. Thus, competition is likely to affect the de novo modification of histones as well, explaining why many histone modifications are only observed around the onset of zygotic transcription in their temporal profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lindeman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vastenhouw et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, we observe an effect on the timing of transcription by adding unmodified histones. This suggests that post-translational modifications of histones are either downstream of the timing of transcriptional activation, or the enzymes that modify histones are not limiting in the embryo.</p><p>The competition model can explain why genome activation is gene specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aanes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heyn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Owens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pauli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sandler and Stathopoulos, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tan et al., 2013</xref>), and even why the first zygotic transcripts can be detected several cell cycles before the stage that is traditionally defined as the time point of ZGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Renzis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heyn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Skirkanich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). The sensitivity of genes for a given histone concentration logically depends on their enhancers and the affinity and concentration of the transcription factors that bind to them. In this context, it is interesting to note that many genes that are activated during zebrafish genome activation respond to the same set of transcription factors, which are also the most highly translated transcription factors before genome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leichsenring et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, the affinity of transcription factors and the number of transcription-factor-binding sites might provide a mechanism to explain why some genes overcome repression earlier than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heyn et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it has been shown that the number of transcription-factor-binding sites as well as the level of transcription factors can affect the timing of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Foo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Recent literature suggests that histone levels might play a role in the regulation of transcription during developmental transitions other than genome activation. In contrast to the situation in early embryos, where histone and DNA levels do not scale, it was generally believed that in somatic cells, histone production is tightly coupled to replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nurse, 1983</xref>). Recently, however, histone levels have been shown to change during ageing and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karnavas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">O'Sullivan et al., 2010</xref>) suggesting that histone levels might not be as tightly coupled to DNA replication as previously thought. Moreover, histone chaperones were identified as inhibitors of reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheloufi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishiuchi et al., 2015</xref>) and it was proposed that the lack of histone chaperones facilitates transcription factor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheloufi et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, these studies might suggest that the availability of histones could play a role in the regulation of transcription during differentiation and reprogramming.</p><p>We have shown that the onset of transcription is regulated by a dynamic competition for DNA binding between histones and transcription factors. This suggests that the relative levels of histones and transcription factors in the nucleus determine the time at which transcription begins in the embryo. Future studies will be required to improve our understanding of the molecular mechanism of competition, the regulation of repressor and activator concentrations in the nucleus, and the role of competition during other developmental transitions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>M<bold>aterials</bold> and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish husbandry and manipulation</title><p>Zebrafish were maintained and raised under standard conditions.

rid="bib93">Worboys et al., 2014</xref>) for each of the four histones: H3, H4, H2A and H2B. The peptides do not discriminate between known histone variants for H3 and H2A. A chimeric gene encoding these peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beynon et al., 2005</xref>) in addition to reference peptides from BSA and Glycjogen Phosphorylase B (PhosB) (five each), and flanked by Strep- and His-tags, was chemically synthesized (Gene Art, ThermoFisher Scientific). This gene was expressed in a Lys, Arg dual-auxotroph <italic>E. coli</italic> strain (BL21DE3pRARE) that was grown in media complemented with <sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N-Arg and <sup>13</sup>C-Lys (Silantes, Munich, Germany). In a separate LC-MS/MS experiment, we established that the full-length chimeric protein was correctly expressed and the rate of incorporation of isotopically labeled amino acids was ca. 99%. The gel band corresponding to the chimeric protein was co-digested with the gel slab containing the histones from the samples of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shevchenko et al., 2006</xref>) and with the band containing the exactly known amount of the reference protein (BSA). The recovered tryptic peptides were analysed by nanoLC-MS/MS on a LTQ Orbitrap Velos coupled with Dionex Ultimate 3000 nano-HPLC system (ThermoFisher Scientific). Three biological replicates were analyzed for each sample, with two technical replicates for each sample. The peptides were separated using C18 reversed phase column (Acclaim PepMap 100) over a linear gradient from 0 to 55% solvent B in a mixture of solvents A and B, delivered in 120 min (Solvent A 0.1% FA, Solvent B 60% ACN + 0.1% FA). The identification of peptides was performed using Mascot v2.2.04 (Matrix Science, London, United Kingdom) against a custom-made database composed of sequences from all histones, BSA, PhosB, affinity tag and the sequences of common contaminants such as human keratins and porcine trypsin. The raw abundances of extracted ion chromatograms (XIC) peaks of peptide precursors were reported by Progenesis LC-MS v4.1 software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, United Kingdom). First the chimeric protein was quantified by comparing the abundances of BSA peptides comprised in its sequence with the corresponding peptides obtained by co-digestion of a known amount of BSA protein standard. In turn, the molar content of target zebrafish histones was inferred from the content of the chimera protein and the ratio of relative abundances of XIC peaks of precursor ions of matching pairs of labeled (originating from chimera) and unlabeled (originating from histones) peptides. Note that all peptides were recovered from the same in-gel digest and quantified at the same LC-MS/MS run.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histone calculations</title><p>Absolute histone amounts were measured using mass spectrometry. The number of histones bound to a diploid zebrafish genome was calculated as 31,324,994 per genome for each histone. To arrive at this calculation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), we have previously shown that the average distance between the centers of neighboring nucleosomes in the zebrafish embryo around genome activation is 187 base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). The size of a zebrafish genome is 1.46 Gb (GRCz10). This was multiplied by two to reach the diploid genome size which was then divided by the nucleosome repeat length to arrive at the number of nucleosomes per genome. As each histone is represented twice in a nucleosome, this number was multiplied by two to arrive at 3.13 × 10<sup>7</sup> copies of each histone that are required to wrap one zebrafish genome into chromatin (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). To arrive at numbers of histones in ‘genomes worth of histones’, the actual number of histones was divided by the amount of histones required to wrap one diploid genome. For the excess of histones per cell calculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), the level of H2B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>) and the cell numbers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> were used. Because we have shown that all four core histones contribute to the repressor effect, we used the level of H2B for these calculations, as H2B is the lowest abundant histone and therefore may be limiting for the formation of nucleosomes. We subtracted the number of histones that are assumed to be bound to DNA, which amounts to one to two genomes worth of histones assuming replication (we used the average). The total concentration of non-DNA bound histones was calculated by dividing the total amount of non-DNA-bound histones by the volume of the animal cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Histone cocktail</title><p>Recombinant histones were of human origin and produced in <italic>E.

We used human histones because histones are highly conserved between species and these are readily available. To remove DTT, H3.1 was dialyzed in histone buffer (300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.0 at 25°C) using a Slide-A-Lyzer MINI dialysis device, 7K MWCO (ThermoFisher Scientific) at RT for 30 min or at 4°C overnight. Stoichiometric amounts of all four core histones were combined, spun for 5 min at 6600 rcf on a bench top centrifuge, supernatant was removed, and recovery of histones was measured via quantitative Western blot analysis and calculated using a standard.

First, we obtained volumetric data from live embryos, in which H4-sfGFP fusion protein was translated from injected mRNA to label animal cap and cell nuclei, at low- and high-intensity levels, respectively (see ‘Live embryo tracking of nuclei and animal cap volumes’ and ‘Automated image analysis’ below). Imaging live embryos prevented volume alterations due to fixation, permeabilization, and wash steps in immunofluorescence. Next, we determined relative histone distributions in cytoplasm and nucleus by immunofluorescence detection of endogenous histone H4, thus avoiding potential offsets or sub-cellular redistribution of the endogenous histone pool due to the addition of labeled fusion protein (see ‘Immunofluorescence’ and ‘Automated image analysis’ below). Then, we combined volumetric and nuclear-over-cytoplasmic intensity ratio data to allocate the total amount of histone H4 per embryo, as measured by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), to the cytoplasmic and the nuclear sub-compartment (see ‘Calculation of non-DNA-bound nuclear histone concentration’ below). Lastly, aiming to calculate the concentration of only non-DNA-bound histones, the histones bound on chromatin in a given nucleus were subtracted from the total nuclear concentration of histones.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Live embryo tracking of nuclei and animal cap volumes</title><p>To monitor the volumes of the animal cap and individual nuclei as well as nuclear import dynamics, histone H4 and PCNA were imaged in whole live embryos at a time resolution of 2 min or faster (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). H4 was introduced as a fusion with sfGFP by mRNA injection.

Wild-type TLAB embryos were transferred at a given stage by transfer from 0.3x Danieau’s into 2% formaldehyde in 0.3x Danieau’s with 0.2% Tween-20 and left to fix overnight at 4°C. On the next day, embryos were washed three times for 10 min in PBST (Dulbecco’s PBS with 0.1% Tween-20), then further permeabilized by washing twice in double-distilled water followed by 5 min waiting at room temperature, and then blocked with 4% BSA in PBST with 1% DMSO for at least 30 min. Primary antibodies against histone H4 and RNA polymerase II were diluted in 2% BSA in PBST with 1% DMSO and applied for incubation at 4°C for at least 48 hr. Embryos were washed three times for 10 min in PBST. Secondary antibodies were diluted in 2% BSA in PBST with 1% DMSO and applied overnight or longer at 4°C. Embryos were then washed three times for at least 10 min in PBST and stored at 4°C until imaging. Mounting for imaging was done in glass capillaries using 2% low-melting agarose dissolved in Dulbecco’s PBS. 3D stacks were acquired using a 20x water dipping objective (NA 1.0) for acquisition, a lightsheet thickness below 5 µm, and dual side illumination. The microscopy chamber was filled with Dulbecco’s PBS. Optical sectioning was 1 µm or less.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Automated image analysis</title><p>Microscopy data were analyzed with a custom MatLab code using the Open Microscopy Environment bioformats plugin for stack reading. Nuclei were segmented using iterative thresholding for individual nuclei to compensate for differing intensities across the sample. 3D segments representing nuclei were dilated in two steps, giving a once- and a twice-extended shell around any given nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stasevich et al., 2014</xref>). The once-extended shell was removed from the twice-extended shell, along with any other nuclei that happened to be covered by the twice-extended shell. The resulting 3D segment thus covered cytoplasm in the vicinity of a given nucleus. The nucleus and the cytoplasm 3D segments were then used as masks to extract the mean intensity of a given cell’s nucleus and cytoplasm. The animal cap was segmented in 3D based a single, global threshold determined from maximum intensity z-projections using Otsu’s method.

The volume fraction of the animal cap taken up by nuclei was calculated from the sum of volumes of all nuclei detected in a given stage, at their individual times of maximal extension in the respective cell cycle.

Nuclear and cytoplasmic intensities for both Pol II and H4 were then extracted based on the Pol II segmentation as described above. To remove nuclei that were not in interphase or suffered signal degradation due to excessive spherical aberration or out-of-focus light, only nuclei with a nuclear-over-cytoplasmic intensity ration of greater than two were included in the analysis. Intensity ratios were strongly affected by background staining, so that H4 intensity values were corrected by subtraction of background levels before calculating ratios. Background levels were obtained from control embryos incubated with secondary, but not primary antibodies, which were imaged in the same session and with the same settings as the fully stained samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Calculation of non-DNA-bound nuclear histone concentration</title><p>To obtain nuclear histone concentration values, one considers that the total number of histones must correspond to the contributions from all cells’ cytoplasm and nuclei,</p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> are the total, the nuclear, and the cytoplasmic concentration of endogenous histone H4, respectively. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> are the summed volumes of all cells’ nuclei and cytoplasm, respectively.

Elution buffer (50 mM NaHCO3, 1% SDS) was added to the beads, which were then vortexed and incubated for 15 min at RT on a rotator. Elutant was collected after centrifugation at 13,200 rcf, and beads were subjected to a repetition of the elution step. The same volume of elution buffer was added to the input sample, and 300 mM NaCl was added to all samples to reverse crosslink at 65°C overnight. Three volumes of 100% ethanol was added and samples were incubated for 1 hr at −80°C. Samples were spun at 13,200 rcf at 4°C for 10 min followed by supernatant removal and air drying. 100 µL water was added and samples were shaken at RT for 5 hr. A PCR purification kit (Qiagen) was used before qPCR analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Sample-size determination</title><p>A minimum of three biological replicates were used for each experiment, with most experiments having four or more biological replicates (see figure legends for sample size).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by MPI-CBG core funding, a Human Frontier Science Program Career Development Award (CDA00060/2012) to NLV, a fellowship of the Dresden International Graduate School for Biomedicine and Bioengineering (DIGS-BB) granted by the German Research Foundation (DFG) to SRJ, and an ELBE Postdoctoral Fellowship granted by the Center for Systems Biology Dresden to LH.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Histone level determines the timing of zygotic genome activation in zebrafish&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior Editor) and three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will see, the reviewers broadly agreed on several key weaknesses in this work:</p><p>1) The extensive overlap with previous work;</p><p>2) The absence of a clear demonstration that adding excess histones alters nucleosome levels on DNA (or that depletion of H2B reduces nucleosome occupancy);</p><p>3) Model that perhaps over-simplifies the scenario. Nothing in this manuscript or previous work pinpoints nucleosomes as the repressors. It remains entirely possible that it is a factor that binds nucleosomes – and not the octamer itself – that inhibits transcription.</p><p>However, all reviewers also saw the potential in this system and encourage the authors to delve deeper into this interesting question to shed new light on zygotic genome activation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Work described in this manuscript tests the idea that histone levels define the timing of zygotic genome activation, using zebrafish as a model system.</p><p>Background on the question: The idea that core histones repress zygotic transcription in the early embryo dates back to the early 90s (Prioleau et al., Cell 1994) and was explored in detail in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> and embryos (e.g. Almouzni and Wolffe, EMBO, 1995). These studies involved injection of excess DNA, core histones, TBP and the activator VP16, leading to the conclusion that transcriptional quiescence before zygotic genome activation was due to a general repressive effect of histones and a defect in transcription activation. Work from the Wolffe lab also noted that they had not established that core histones were directly responsible for repression, but that nucleosome-binding proteins such as linker histones could functionally carry out repression. This possibility was recently supported by work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Perez-Montero et al. Dev. Cell, 2013) which showed that a specific variant of linker histone H1 affected the timing of zygotic genome activation (see also nice preview entitled &quot;A histone timer for zygotic genome activation, by Tamkun and colleague, Dev Cell, 2013).</p><p>The current manuscript explores the role of histones in zebrafish genome activation. Quantitative mass spec nicely measures the histone levels across early development, confirming their gross excess over DNA. Injection of a cocktail of core histones is found to delay gastrulation and the onset of zygotic transcription (as measured by qPCR of 6 transcripts). All core histones were required for a maximal delay in genome activation, indicating that the formation of an entire nucleosome is essential for full repression. The reciprocal experiments were also performed, wherein the level of histone H2B is reduced to decrease the potential for nucleosome formation. These experiments show a modest premature activation of zygotic transcription. The model proposed is well in line with that from the Wolffe lab, involving both the titration of inhibitory nucleosomes and the involvement of an activator that can overcome such repression at selected sites.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written and the hypothesis being tested is clear. The experiments seem to be carefully performed and the results are generally convincing. I like the quantitative mass spec and the focus on activation of endogenous genes (previous work largely looked at activation of genes located on exogenous DNA). One caveat is that the effects of histone H2B depletion on gene activation appears small, and I would encourage the authors to consider trying to reduce more than one core histone to achieve stronger effects.</p><p>My primary concern is that the conclusions do not go much beyond the model established in the mid-90s in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, reducing the impact of this work. Further, the authors should acknowledge that their work does not define core histones as the repressors, only that repression requires nucleosome formation (as in earlier work). I see this as a missed opportunity, given the very nice system developed. Why not target linker histones, specific transcription activators or repressors? That would allow them to go beyond what has been shown in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> to define direct repressors and activators in their system.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript &quot;Histone level determines the timing of zygotic genome activation in the zebrafish&quot;, the authors demonstrate that excessive quantities of histone proteins repress transcription during the early stages of zebrafish development. When injected with even more excess quantities of histone proteins, development and onset of transcription is delayed. These findings show are exciting and suggest a clever mechanism for regulating the timing of transition from maternal to zygotic transcription. If the authors could address the following issues, the manuscript would be of interest to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The authors give a compelling argument for the role of excess nucleosomes in preventing zygotic transition, however some direct evidence of the excess nucleosomes actually interacting with DNA is necessary to support their data. Showing maintenance of nucleosomes on the tested loci upon overexpression of histones and loss of nucleosome occupancy when the H2B morpholino is used would provide some evidence of the effect of the excess nucleosomes. As well, using ChIP to assay binding of transcriptional machinery to show differences with excess or loss of histone proteins.</p><p>2) While the authors show a role for nucleosomes in the timing of transition, they do not address the idea that a repressive chromatin remodeling complex or some other factor may still contribute to the timing of transition as well. Hdac1 is a likely candidate for this role, but there are many repressors that could contribute. It would be helpful for the authors to test Hdac1 or other repressors or discuss the possibility that other repressors may exist.</p><p>3) Authors estimate that the entire genome is fully bound once every 170bp with histones, with no mention of possible variations. While this is obviously an estimate, it would be helpful to at least note that this is an estimate based on the expectation of full occupancy of the genome with histones during the entire course of experiments.</p><p>4) The histone calculations are a bit confusing, particularly with the phrase &quot;2x1011 copies of each per embryo&quot;. It would be helpful to state histone proteins rather than copies. Is this actually per embryo or per cell? If it is per embryo, then the calculations for excess amounts of histones added for later experiments are confusing, since the measurement is taken at the 8 cell stage, so 8 there would be genomes worth of histones. It seems like the 1.8x1011 histone proteins should be divided by 8x the number of histones in one genome rather than one single genome, giving an excess of 636 rather than 5049.</p><p>5) Calculations of the fold excess are slightly different using the numbers in the paper. Using the numbers from the paper, the fold excess at the 1000 cell stage calculates to 705 rather than 715. 1.8x1011 histone proteins divided by 35,425,427 comes out to 5081 rather than 5049.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The question of how a developing embryo controls the transition from reliance on maternally loaded mRNA to activation of zygotic expression is a central question in developmental biology. The current manuscript examines this phenomenon in the context of early zebrafish development.

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Robb Krumlauf (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The manuscript has been considerably improved, and would now be suitable for publication once several major concerns below are addressed.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>By utilizing efficient quantitative techniques, Joseph et al. present a very interesting study that supports a competitive interaction between histones and transcription factors to set the time for ZGA. They conclude that histones and critical transcription factors compete in binding to DNA, and eventually, the concentration of non-DNA bound core histone decides the timing of ZGA during zebrafish gastrulation. By injecting stoichiometric mixture of all four core histones they showed that increasing their levels delays the onset of zygotic transcription. On the other hand, decreasing levels of histones, by sequestering H4 with PTX3, shows an opposite effect. Using a quantitative mass spectrometry approach, the authors calculated the number of non-DNA bound histones per cell in genomes worth of histone, and showed that this parameter drops dramatically as embryos approach gastrulation. This provides opportunity for critical transcription factors (such as Pou5f3) to bind to DNA and initiate transcription. Following this argument, increasing and decreasing the level of Pou5f3 predates and delays the onset of ZGA, respectively. Finally, in the context of a TRE-GFP reporter construct, by injecting either a heterologous transcription factor (rTA-VP16) alone, or by co-injecting it with histone cocktails, a ChIP-PCR analysis provided further evidence for the competitive interaction between histones and transcription factors to bind to TRE elements in the GFP reporter. Altogether, this study provides a detailed mechanistic analysis to answer a few important issues related to a long-standing concept in the field. The quantitative techniques followed in this study highlights the usefulness of zebrafish to answer critical questions which could be otherwise difficult in other model systems. Such analyses would be beneficial for the zebrafish community as a whole. Taken together, this would be suitable for publication in &quot;<italic>eLife</italic>&quot; if the following concerns could be addressed or explained properly in an updated manuscript.</p><p>Major points that must be addressed in a revised manuscript:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors only tested Pou5f3 as an example transcription factor that is important for ZGA. The authors posit that 'specific' effects needed for ZGA are the result of competition with transcription factors, and suggest that only specific TFs could compete with histones (e.g. only those TF needed for activation of the first ZGA genes). It would be nice to see this idea better fleshed out. Did the authors try to knockdown other important developmental factors (like Pou5f1, <italic>Sox2</italic>, Nanog) to see the effect on ZGA? What about non-developmental factors? According to their model, the competition between ZGA-related transcription factors and histones should not be specific to Pou5f3 only. Rather, knockdown of any other pluripotency factor should have the same ZGA-related phenotype. The specificity/ generality of this phenomenon should be tested by knockdown of at least one additional TF.</p><p>2) The authors should clarify the nature of their competition model, through additional experiments, or clarifications in the text. At present (and as detailed below) it is not clear how the authors envision that excess histones are functioning, and the text and data are not consistent in this regard. For this work to have the desired impact, we encourage the authors to work towards clearly articulating and substantiating their model.</p><p>A) The reviewers were concerned about the absence of proof for a competition model in the data presented, and alternative interpretations for the data presented are plausible: for example, histone 'excess' may affect replication timing, thereby affecting timing of transcriptional activation at ZGA. While the integrated transgene and VP16 experiments is strong, one would like to see it 'working' in an endogenous target: at the very least, the same ChIP experiment performed in excess of histone should be done for the Apoeb gene for Pouf3t and Sox19 transcription factors. Otherwise, it is difficult to reconcile it with the specificity in competition program discussed by the authors in the subsection “Competition for DNA binding between histones and transcription factors regulates the onset of transcription”.</p><p>B) Perhaps an additional possibility to address whether the competition model is indeed occurring, would be to reduce histone chaperone activity at the 'early' 1K stage. This should increase non-DNA bound histones, and therefore should have the same effect as the injection cocktail.</p><p>C) If the effect on transcriptional activation is assumed to be due to non-DNA bound histones (subsection “Onset of transcription coincides with a reduction in nuclear histone concentration” and Summary) – why is the addition of Histone cocktail effective considering that the authors conclude that 'this led to efficient chromatin incorporation of the histones injected as determined using Cy5 labelling' (subsection “Increasing the levels of all core histones delays onset of transcription and gastrulation”)?</p><p>D) Along the same lines, in the Discussion, the authors state that, because the 4 core histones are necessary to see the effects of the injected cocktail on transcriptional activation, this suggests a role for the nucleosome for the repressor function of histones. This statement is not consistent with the interpretation that it is the 'non-DNA bound histones' that is effecting ZGA timing (e.g. nucleosome is composed by the histone octamer plus the DNA). Given the biochemical properties of the 4 histones, it is also unlikely that the histones injected remain as octamers in the cells.</p><p>E) Similarly, related to the PTX3 experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, subsection “Decreasing the level of histones causes premature transcription”), the authors conclude that 'total levels of H3 and H4 are not affected upon PTX3 expression', but three lines below, they conclude that effective levels of histone H3 and H4 are decreased. While 'effective' may indicate that they are not necessarily free to be incorporated into chromatin, this experiment is also at odds with the hypothesis that 'non-DNA-bound histones' regulate ZGA timing.</p><p>F) The authors conclude that histones are effectively incorporated by doing immunofluorescence with Cy5-labelled H4. However, nuclear localisation is not a proof for incorporation – did the authors try the same immunofluorescence with e.g. either pre-extraction with tritron or salt?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors check the occupancy of rTA-VP16 on TRE elements under histone cocktail (HC) overexpression. This experiment shows a decrease in rTA-VP16 level at TRE upon HC injection, but they did not comment if this leads to a concomitant increase in histone binding at TRE. It would be good to include a comment related to this issue in the respective Results section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23326.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>As you will see, the reviewers broadly agreed on several key weaknesses in this work:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The extensive overlap with previous work;</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that previous work using injected species of exogenous DNA had suggested that histones might play a role in transcription regulation in the embryo.

We first set up in an in vivo assay to analyze the onset of zygotic transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and show that all core histones are required to determine the timing of transcription in the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Then we directly analyze the mechanism. We first quantified the levels of histones in the embryo, nucleus and on chromatin. We found a reduction in nuclear histone concentration that coincides with genome activation but this is not accompanied by a loss of nucleosome density on DNA. This led us to propose a model in which a competition for DNA binding between transcription factors and non-DNA bound histones regulates the onset of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To test this model, we changed the levels of endogenous transcription factors and analyzed its effect on the timing of transcription. In agreement with our model, the levels of transcription factors also affect the timing of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We further test the competition model using a heterologous transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Using this strategy, we could confirm the importance of transcription factor levels for the timing of transcription and we were able to show that histone levels affect the binding of a transcription factor. Taken together, we show that the onset of transcription in the zebrafish embryo is regulated by a competition for DNA binding between histones and transcription factors. Our study provides, to our knowledge, the first example of a developmental transition in which competition for DNA binding between histones and transcription factors plays an important role in transcriptional regulation.</p><p><italic>2) The absence of a clear demonstration that adding excess histones alters nucleosome levels on DNA (or that depletion of H2B reduces nucleosome occupancy);</italic> </p><p>We show that histone levels regulate the time of zygotic transcription. Transcription starts when the nuclear concentration of histones drops, but this is not accompanied by a loss of nucleosome density on DNA. This suggests that the onset of transcription is regulated by the concentration of non-DNA bound histones in the nucleus. Based on this data, we propose that the onset of transcription in the embryo is regulated by a competition for DNA binding between non-DNA bound histones and transcription factors and we provide direct experimental evidence for this model. We therefore propose that the effect of changing histone levels experimentally is exerted through changes in the non-DNA bound concentration of histones and not by changes in global nucleosome density.</p><p><italic>3) Model that perhaps over-simplifies the scenario. Nothing in this manuscript or previous work pinpoints nucleosomes as the repressors. It remains entirely possible that it is a factor that binds nucleosomes – and not the octamer itself – that inhibits transcription.</italic> </p><p>This is where we have really expanded the manuscript. Our experiments show that the four core histones mediate the repressor effect. Moreover, our finding that histones are neither completely depleted from the soluble fraction, nor generally depleted from chromatin, argues against a model in which a global loss of nucleosome density on chromatin causes the onset of transcription. This strongly suggests that histones themselves function as the actual repressors of transcription and argues against a role for the depletion of proteins associated with core histones. Furthermore, the model presented in the earlier submission did indeed simplify the scenario. We now present data that the levels of activators are also important. We provide direct evidence for a model in which competition for DNA binding between histones and activators regulates the onset of transcription in the embryo.</p><p><italic>However, all reviewers also saw the potential in this system and encourage the authors to delve deeper into this interesting question to shed new light on zygotic genome activation.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Work described in this manuscript tests the idea that histone levels define the timing of zygotic genome activation, using zebrafish as a model system.</italic></p><p><italic>Background on the question: The idea that core histones repress zygotic transcription in the early embryo dates back to the early 90s (Prioleau et al., Cell 1994) and was explored in detail in Xenopus oocytes and embryos (e.g. Almouzni and Wolffe, EMBO, 1995). These studies involved injection of excess DNA, core histones, TBP and the activator VP16, leading to the conclusion that transcriptional quiescence before zygotic genome activation was due to a general repressive effect of histones and a defect in transcription activation. Work from the Wolffe lab also noted that they had not established that core histones were directly responsible for repression, but that nucleosome-binding proteins such as linker histones could functionally carry out repression. This possibility was recently supported by work in Drosophila (Perez-Montero et al. Dev. Cell, 2013) which showed that a specific variant of linker histone H1 affected the timing of zygotic genome activation (see also nice preview entitled &quot;A histone timer for zygotic genome activation, by Tamkun and colleague, Dev Cell, 2013).</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that in our previous manuscript, we did not do enough justice to the work that has previously shown a role for histones in repressing transcription in the early <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo. We apologize and now discuss existing work more clearly and identify the aspects which needed further work.</p><p><italic>The current manuscript explores the role of histones in zebrafish genome activation. Quantitative mass spec nicely measures the histone levels across early development, confirming their gross excess over DNA. Injection of a cocktail of core histones is found to delay gastrulation and the onset of zygotic transcription (as measured by qPCR of 6 transcripts). All core histones were required for a maximal delay in genome activation, indicating that the formation of an entire nucleosome is essential for full repression. The reciprocal experiments were also performed, wherein the level of histone H2B is reduced to decrease the potential for nucleosome formation. These experiments show a modest premature activation of zygotic transcription. The model proposed is well in line with that from the Wolffe lab, involving both the titration of inhibitory nucleosomes and the involvement of an activator that can overcome such repression at selected sites.</italic> </p><p><italic>Overall, the manuscript is well written and the hypothesis being tested is clear. The experiments seem to be carefully performed and the results are generally convincing. I like the quantitative mass spec and the focus on activation of endogenous genes (previous work largely looked at activation of genes located on exogenous DNA). One caveat is that the effects of histone H2B depletion on gene activation appears small, and I would encourage the authors to consider trying to reduce more than one core histone to achieve stronger effects.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we have changed our approach to reduce histones. Since we see by mass spectrometry that a large amount of histones is present as protein from fertilization on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), we decided to change our approach and target protein levels. Now we use PTX3 to target histone proteins. We show in vivo that PTX3 interacts with H4 protein, and the effect of PTX3 is greater than with the morpholino.</p><p>We also expand our Discussion, and indicate that due to a role of activator levels in our competition model, pushing genome activation back will always be harder than forward (with more histones). Activators might be limiting because they need to be translated (Pou5f3, Nanog, <italic>Sox2</italic> are highly translated during development) and because many of these activators might function cooperatively, they all need to be present at the right concentration at the right time.</p><p><italic>My primary concern is that the conclusions do not go much beyond the model established in the mid-90s in Xenopus, reducing the impact of this work. Further, the authors should acknowledge that their work does not define core histones as the repressors, only that repression requires nucleosome formation (as in earlier work). I see this as a missed opportunity, given the very nice system developed. Why not target linker histones, specific transcription activators or repressors? That would allow them to go beyond what has been shown in Xenopus and Drosophila to define direct repressors and activators in their system.</italic> </p><p>With respect to the novelty of our work, and the identity of the repressor, we refer to the key points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>In the manuscript &quot;Histone level determines the timing of zygotic genome activation in the zebrafish&quot;, the authors demonstrate that excessive quantities of histone proteins repress transcription during the early stages of zebrafish development. When injected with even more excess quantities of histone proteins, development and onset of transcription is delayed. These findings show are exciting and suggest a clever mechanism for regulating the timing of transition from maternal to zygotic transcription. If the authors could address the following issues, the manuscript would be of interest to the readers of eLife.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors give a compelling argument for the role of excess nucleosomes in preventing zygotic transition, however some direct evidence of the excess nucleosomes actually interacting with DNA is necessary to support their data. Showing maintenance of nucleosomes on the tested loci upon overexpression of histones and loss of nucleosome occupancy when the H2B morpholino is used would provide some evidence of the effect of the excess nucleosomes. As well, using ChIP to assay binding of transcriptional machinery to show differences with excess or loss of histone proteins.</italic> </p><p>To address these points, we did the following:</p><p>We have chemically tagged H4 and show that it incorporates into chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We have done chromatin fractionation and show that nucleosome density does not change globally at the time of genome activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In our competition model, local changes in nucleosome density (where RNA pol II or TF bind) result in transcription.</p><p>Exactly as suggested, we used ChIP-qPCR to assess the binding of a transcriptional activator in response to changing histone levels. Increasing histone levels causes a reduction of binding of the activator to its target site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In agreement with this, increasing activator levels leads to premature transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) While the authors show a role for nucleosomes in the timing of transition, they do not address the idea that a repressive chromatin remodeling complex or some other factor may still contribute to the timing of transition as well. Hdac1 is a likely candidate for this role, but there are many repressors that could contribute. It would be helpful for the authors to test Hdac1 or other repressors or discuss the possibility that other repressors may exist.</italic> </p><p>Here, we show that histone levels in combination with transcription factor levels are sufficient to change the timing of transcription. We agree with the reviewer, however, that chromatin remodeling complexes might also contribute to genome activation. We have now included a discussion on how the activity of chromatin remodelers might also be mediated by histone levels.</p><p><italic>3) Authors estimate that the entire genome is fully bound once every 170bp with histones, with no mention of possible variations. While this is obviously an estimate, it would be helpful to at least note that this is an estimate based on the expectation of full occupancy of the genome with histones during the entire course of experiments.</italic> </p><p>The number we used is based on MNase-Seq experiments and the average nucleosome repeat length derived from that (Zhang et al., 2014). We have clarified this in the text. Of note is that the nucleosome repeat length that we use is not critical for our model. Even variations of nucleosome occupancy from 160 to 200 do not substantially affect our calculations of the total nor nuclear histone concentration.</p><p><italic>4) The histone calculations are a bit confusing, particularly with the phrase &quot;2x1011 copies of each per embryo&quot;. It would be helpful to state histone proteins rather than copies. Is this actually per embryo or per cell? If it is per embryo, then the calculations for excess amounts of histones added for later experiments are confusing, since the measurement is taken at the 8 cell stage, so 8 there would be genomes worth of histones. It seems like the 1.8x1011 histone proteins should be divided by 8x the number of histones in one genome rather than one single genome, giving an excess of 636 rather than 5049.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the confusion and provide more clarity with our calculations in the new manuscript (Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) Calculations of the fold excess are slightly different using the numbers in the paper. Using the numbers from the paper, the fold excess at the 1000 cell stage calculates to 705 rather than 715. 1.8x1011 histone proteins divided by 35,425,427 comes out to 5081 rather than 5049.</italic> </p><p>This discrepancy was due to rounding our numbers. There is more clarity in our new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>The question of how a developing embryo controls the transition from reliance on maternally loaded mRNA to activation of zygotic expression is a central question in developmental biology.

Given the biochemical properties of the 4 histones, it is also unlikely that the histones injected remain as octamers in the cells.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the confusion. Our model is based on the knowledge that the four core histones are required to form a histone octamer (and nucleosome). Of course, the histones only form a histone octamer when associating with DNA and it is therefore expected that the concentration of soluble histones dictates how likely a nucleosome is formed on an available piece of DNA. Thus, we propose that the soluble histones compete with transcription factors for binding, but ultimately it is either the histone octamer or transcription factor that occupies DNA. We have clarified this in the text (throughout).</p><p><italic>E) Similarly, related to the PTX3 experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, subsection “Decreasing the level of histones causes premature transcription”), the authors conclude that 'total levels of H3 and H4 are not affected upon PTX3 expression', but three lines below, they conclude that effective levels of histone H3 and H4 are decreased. While 'effective' may indicate that they are not necessarily free to be incorporated into chromatin, this experiment is also at odds with the hypothesis that 'non-DNA-bound histones' regulate ZGA timing.</italic> </p><p>In order to compete for DNA binding, histones need to be available (see also above). Therefore, when histones are not available to bind to DNA (because they are bound by PTX3), this lowers their effective concentration. We have clarified this in the text (subsection “Decreasing the pool of available histones causes premature transcription”).</p><p><italic>F) The authors conclude that histones are effectively incorporated by doing immunofluorescence with Cy5-labelled H4. However, nuclear localisation is not a proof for incorporation – did the authors try the same immunofluorescence with e.g. either pre-extraction with tritron or salt?</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the confusion. The conclusion that histones are incorporated was not based on the nuclear localization of the labeled histone but rather on the fact that we see the label in chromatin during metaphase. We have now clarified this in the text (subsection “Increasing the levels of all core histones delays onset transcription and gastrulation”, second paragraph) and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors check the occupancy of rTA-VP16 on TRE elements under histone cocktail (HC) overexpression. This experiment shows a decrease in rTA-VP16 level at TRE upon HC injection, but they did not comment if this leads to a concomitant increase in histone binding at TRE. It would be good to include a comment related to this issue in the respective Results section.</italic> </p><p>We assume that there is an increase in histone binding but we have not looked at this. We have now clarified this in the text (subsection “Transcription factor binding is sensitive to histone levels”) in the section on Pou5f3 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), which is the first time we test the effect of histone levels on transcription factor binding in the revised version of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
