growing list of fish, reptile, and bird species. Despite the increasing interest in the phenomenon, the underlying mechanism and evolutionary implications have remained unclear. A common finding across many incidences of FP is either a high degree of homozygosity at microsatellite loci or low levels of heterozygosity detected in next-generation sequencing data. This has led to the proposal that second polar body fusion following the meiotic divisions restores diploidy and thereby mimics fertilization. Here, we show that FP occurring in the gonochoristic <italic>Aspidoscelis</italic> species <italic>A. marmoratus</italic> and <italic>A. arizonae</italic> results in genome-wide homozygosity, an observation inconsistent with polar body fusion as the underlying mechanism of restoration. Instead, a high-quality reference genome for <italic>A. marmoratus</italic> and analysis of whole-genome sequencing from multiple FP and control animals reveals that a post-meiotic mechanism gives rise to homozygous animals from haploid, unfertilized oocytes. Contrary to the widely held belief that females need to be isolated from males to undergo FP, females housed with conspecific and heterospecific males produced unfertilized eggs that underwent spontaneous development. In addition, offspring arising from both fertilized eggs and parthenogenetic development were observed to arise from a single clutch. Strikingly, our data support a mechanism for facultative parthenogenesis that removes all heterozygosity in a single generation. Complete homozygosity exposes the genetic load and explains the high rate of congenital malformations and embryonic mortality associated with FP in many species. Conversely, for animals that develop normally, FP could potentially exert strong purifying selection as all lethal recessive alleles are purged in a single generation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Aspidoscelis</kwd><kwd>mixoploidy</kwd><kwd>reproduction</kwd><kwd>unisexual</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007795</institution-id><institution>Stowers Institute for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tormey</surname><given-names>Duncan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baumann</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baumann</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK2526/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>David V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-1754350</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barley</surname><given-names>Anthony J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Facultative parthenogenesis in whiptail lizards produces genome-wide homozygosity in offspring.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Incidences of facultative parthenogenesis (FP) have been reported to occur in diverse vertebrate clades including bony fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lampert et al., 2007</xref>), sharks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chapman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chapman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feldheim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dudgeon et al., 2017</xref>), snakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dubach et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Groot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Booth and Schuett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Germano and Smith, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Booth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kinney et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Booth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Card et al., 2021</xref>), lizards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lenk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Watts et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kratochvíl et al., 2020</xref>), crocodilians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Booth et al., 2023</xref>), and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bartelmez and Riddle, 1924</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Olsen and Marsden, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sarvella, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schut et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ramachandran and McDaniel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Parker et al., 2010</xref>). The phenomenon was originally mistaken for long-term sperm storage occurring in zoo environments where females were housed without current or recent access to conspecific males. The most parsimonious explanation was, therefore, that the animal had previously been in contact with a male and that stored sperm was responsible for delayed fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Booth and Schuett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Holt and Lloyd, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sever and Hamlett, 2002</xref>). However, more recent studies involving microsatellite (MS) and/or amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses revealed no paternal contributions, as all alleles detected in the offspring were only found in the maternal ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Groot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Booth and Schuett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shibata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ryder et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Levine et al., 2024</xref>). Females with no access to males producing solely male (ZW systems) or female (XY systems) offspring that only harbor maternal genetic markers are now considered hallmarks of facultative parthenogenesis. Nevertheless, clear examples of long-term sperm storage have also been documented in the recent literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Levine et al., 2021</xref>), underscoring the need for molecular methods such as MS analysis or sequencing data to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Originally thought to only occur in captivity, more recent reports indicate that FP occurs in natural populations as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Booth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fields et al., 2015</xref>). Serious concerns have been raised by conservation biologists, as species with dwindling population densities, including the endangered species Komodo dragon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Watts et al., 2006</xref>), small tooth sawfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fields et al., 2015</xref>), California condor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ryder et al., 2021</xref>), and American crocodile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Booth et al., 2023</xref>) are overrepresented among reports of FP.</p><p>While overrepresentation could be a consequence of an increased likelihood of detection in species that are the subject of intense research and conservation efforts, the observations raise the question if FP is an adaptive trait aiding in the colonization of new areas and mitigating the effects of population bottlenecks or is simply a neutral trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fields et al., 2015</xref>). The adaptive trait hypothesis would of course require successful reproduction of FP animals either sexually or parthenogenetically, which to date has only been documented in a few cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kratochvíl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Straube et al., 2016</xref>). At the same time, the association of FP with increased homozygosity constitutes a concern for conservation biology, as an increase in FP within dwindling populations further accelerates the loss of genetic diversity, exposes deleterious alleles, and could compromise efforts to maintain the existing gene pool in selective breeding programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Groot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Booth and Schuett, 2016</xref>). FP is also being studied as a desirable outcome in the commercial production of poultry. However, examination of tens of thousands of unfertilized eggs from several different avian species and strains has not resulted in economically sustainable hatching rates thus far. One of the highest hatch rates for unfertilized eggs is seen in the Beltsville small white turkey with a rate of 0.88% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ramachandran and McDaniel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Olsen, 1975</xref>). A better understanding of the triggers and molecular mechanisms underlying FP and the fitness of the resulting offspring are, therefore, needed in a variety of contexts. These include: to understand a fundamental biological mechanism and its significance in vertebrate evolution, to aid in conservation efforts including captive breeding programs, and to possibly harness FP in an agricultural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ryder et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The high level of homozygosity observed in animals produced by FP has been interpreted as evidence for polar body fusion following meiosis II, also known as automixis, leading to the restoration of diploidy in unfertilized eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chapman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Card et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Booth et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Booth and Schuett, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Reynolds et al., 2012</xref>). If automixis involves the fusion of one of the meiotic products from the first polar body (central automixis), homozygosity will be concentrated near the chromosome ends and heterozygosity will be preferentially retained near the centromeres as premeiotic recombination strongly favors homologs over sister chromatids and homologs segregate during the first meiotic division. In contrast, a second polar body fusion (terminal automixis) would reunite sister chromatids, for which heterozygosity is preferentially seen near the chromosome termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In many cases, heterozygous and homozygous loci appeared to be inherited in FP offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Groot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Card et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kratochvíl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Booth et al., 2023</xref>), but information as to the genomic location of these loci has been lacking. Central and terminal automixis are also distinguished by the extent of heterozygosity, with lower levels observed in next-generation sequencing data in snakes and crocodiles suggesting terminal automixis as the likely mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Card et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Booth et al., 2023</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of canonical meiosis.

Whiptail lizards have an XX/XY sex determination system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cole et al., 1969</xref>) and all FP offspring are consequently female. The identification of multiple incidences of FP provided us with the opportunity to investigate the mechanism of FP in whiptail lizards through next-generation sequencing. The generation of a genome assembly, in addition to whole-genome sequencing, allowed us to distinguish between different mechanisms for restoring diploidy in FP animals. To address the question of whether FP is limited to animals in captivity, we examined reduced-representation sequencing (RAD-seq) data of 321 whiptail lizards from 15 gonochoristic species sampled in nature. In aggregate, a combination of MS analysis, next-generation sequencing, and cytological analysis allows us to report on both the evidence and mechanism of FP in whiptail lizards and suggest that a baseline incidence of FP may coexist alongside sexual reproduction in some species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of FP in <italic>A. marmoratus</italic></title><p>In the context of studying interspecific hybridization among gonochoristic species of whiptail lizards, three female <italic>A. marmoratus</italic> (ID 122, 4238, 4239) were housed with a male <italic>A. arizonae</italic> (ID 4272) and a male <italic>A. gularis</italic> (ID 302) for close to three years. During this period, seven hybrid offspring between <italic>A. marmoratus</italic> 122 and <italic>A. arizonae</italic> 4272 were produced and confirmed by MS analysis. These animals will be described in more detail in due course. Surprisingly, two female hatchlings emerged that resembled <italic>A. marmoratus</italic> rather than the expected products of hybridization with either <italic>A. arizonae</italic> or <italic>A. gularis</italic>. Genotyping revealed only a single allele for each of eight MS markers in the two offspring (ID 8449 and 8450, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and identified <italic>A. marmoratus</italic> (ID 122) as the mother (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The mother and the male <italic>A. arizonae</italic> were each heterozygous at five of the eight markers and the <italic>A. gularis</italic> male at six. Further supporting a uniparental origin of 8449 and 8450, all alleles found in the offspring were also present in the mother (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). For seven of the eight markers, neither male shared the allele found in the hatchling lizards, providing strong evidence that neither male fathered the offspring. For the remaining marker MS16, the <italic>A. marmoratus</italic> mother and the <italic>A. gularis</italic> male were homozygous for the same allele found in the two offspring, therefore, not allowing a conclusion to be based on this locus. It is important to note that for two of the markers (MS7 and MS15), the two offspring inherited different alleles from the mother, indicating that they are not genetically identical to each other, but have randomly inherited one of the maternal alleles at each locus.</p><p>Two additional eggs (ID 8394 and 9070) were recovered from the same enclosure and found to contain developing embryos. MS analysis also revealed <italic>A. marmoratus</italic> 122 as the mother and complete homozygosity at all loci.

The observed homozygosity at all MS loci further promised to aid in the generation of a high-quality genome assembly, as homozygosity circumvents the challenge of collapsing haplotypes into a consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kajitani et al., 2014</xref>).

The highly contiguous genome assembly now afforded us the opportunity to probe the mechanism of FP by searching for regions of heterozygosity and mapping their relative genomic locations. Towards this aim, we performed whole-genome sequencing for an additional nine animals: four of them produced by FP (ID 12512, 12513, 6993, 9177), two mothers (ID 122, 9721), and three unrelated control animals (ID 003, 001, S30700; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Each mother and the controls were heterozygous at several MS markers confirming their origin through sexual reproduction. Following alignment to the reference genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), we defined heterozygous sites as those covered by an even number of reads with two alleles supported by the same number of reads. Sites covered by an odd number of reads were filtered out for this initial analysis. This stringent requirement was chosen to limit the search to apparent heterozygous sites with strong support, decreasing the chance of false positives.</p><p>For all ten individuals, the average sequencing coverage ranged between 15.91 and 20.08 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). For FP animals, the number of heterozygous sites in a 10 Kb sliding window approaches zero for all sites with mean coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For positions with coverage greater than the average, an increase in apparent heterozygosity was observed, due to the collapse of repetitive sequences during the assembly process. Based on this observation, we limited further analysis to positions in the genome where the coverage is equal to the mean sequencing depth (as defined by rounding the mean sequencing coverage value to the next even integer). For example, for animal 003, the average sequencing coverage is 18.31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>) and we only considered sites with a coverage of 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A</xref>). This generated between 30,769 and 53,416 heterozygous sites for which two alleles were equally supported in the sexually produced mothers and control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A–E</xref>). Far fewer heterozygous sites (between 649 and 928) were observed in the FP animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6F–J</xref>). Plotting the heterozygous sites according to their position in the reference genome illustrates not only their sparsity in the genomes of FP animals, but also reveals their random distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). If FP genomes were the product of automixis, regions of homozygosity would be interspersed with regions of heterozygosity. The extent of heterozygosity within the latter would be the same as that observed in the respective mother. The few apparently heterozygous sites identified in FP animals are, therefore, not supporting either form of automixis but are most likely the result of over-assembly of repetitive regions (ie. collapsing paralogous loci into a single representative sequence) and a combination of biological (ie. somatic mutations) and technical errors (ie.

The most notable exception was a region around genomic coordinate 1.0 Gb, but even there the extent of apparent heterozygosity remained below 50% of what is observed in this region for each of the mothers.

Given that this genomic region harbors a large cluster of highly similar genes, the most parsimonious explanation for the elevated level of apparent heterozygosity is over-assembly. This conclusion is further supported by the increase in apparent heterozygosity in this region for the mothers and control animals. In aggregate, our analysis strongly supports genome-wide homozygosity for FP animals, inconsistent with either central or terminal automixis. Instead, the results favor a post-meiotic mechanism that restores diploidy by replicating the haploid genome residing in the oocyte following completion of the two meiotic divisions and thereby establishing genome-wide homozygosity in the offspring.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cryptic FP in <italic>A. arizonae</italic></title><p>Following the identification of several <italic>A. marmoratus</italic> generated by FP, we genotyped individuals from two other gonochoristic species housed in our laboratory.

Depending on the extent of this genetic load, one would expect a substantial fraction of oocytes to not develop at all or for defects to manifest at various stages of embryonic and post-embryonic development. Indeed, of the 23 incidences of FP examined here, only 14 hatched, while the remaining lizards died in ovum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). For these nine unhatched eggs, we isolated developed embryos shortly after the expected hatch date and confirmed FP origin by MS analysis. The clutches that produced the 23 confirmed cases of FP contained an additional 24 eggs. For these, development did not initiate or terminated at an earlier stage of development precluding MS analysis. Based on the uncertainty regarding how many of these eggs underwent partial FP development, the incidence of FP may be even higher than reported here.</p><p>The observation of various malformations in several of the FP embryos and hatchlings further supports that genome-wide homozygosity unmasks deleterious alleles. Notable developmental defects included craniofacial abnormalities such as misaligned jaws, agenesis of eyes, missing limbs, and failed abdominal closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Only six out of 16 FP animals (37.5%) hatched with no discernable developmental defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> <italic>A-B</italic>). This is in stark contrast to sexually produced animals, where over 98% of hatchlings (n=687) showed no abnormalities. Additionally, most of the defects noted in sexually produced animals were less severe than in FP animals including bulges in tails or truncated digits. While we have not recorded instances of FP animals producing offspring via FP, as described for the whitespotted bamboo shark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Straube et al., 2016</xref>), FP <italic>A. marmoratus</italic> 8450 did produce two eggs while housed in isolation, but these failed to hatch.

By sequencing and assembling a highly contiguous <italic>A. marmoratus</italic> genome, we were able to refute automixis as the underlying mechanism in whiptail lizards. Instead, genome-wide homozygosity raises a possibility of a post-meiotic mechanism involving the activation of embryonic development in unfertilized haploid oocytes. Even though FP whiptail lizards are largely comprised of homozygous diploid cells, a fraction of haploid cells persists through development and is readily detectable in young adults. Such mixoploidy and genome-wide homozygosity come at a price. In eight confirmed and 24 suspected cases of FP, development ceased prior to hatching and most FP animals that hatched showed congenital defects. Nevertheless, FP was observed at a rate of 1% and 5% in <italic>A. arizonae</italic> and <italic>A. marmoratus</italic>, respectively, and this occurred in the presence of mating partners. Interestingly, these rates are similar to what has been reported for wild populations of two North American pitviper species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Booth et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings indicate that FP is far more common in some vertebrate species than previously thought. The purifying selection associated with homozygosity may be an important force in generating additional resilience to counteract the effects of population bottlenecks and inbreeding depression. However, support for this hypothesis is predicated on the fitness and reproduction of FP offspring and, therefore, more long-term studies on seemingly healthy individuals of FP origin are needed.</p><p>The start of embryonic development is tightly coupled to fertilization in many vertebrates as the sperm entering the oocyte triggers a signaling cascade that is essential for the completion of female meiosis and initiation of cell division following karyogamy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sagata, 1996</xref>). This process has been mimicked in the laboratory by piercing frog oocytes with a needle to trigger the signal to complete meiosis and initiate replication and division in the haploid oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Le Peuch et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wolf, 1974</xref>). In zebrafish, homozygous embryos are routinely generated by fertilization of oocytes with UV-irradiated sperm, a treatment that destroys the paternal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Streisinger et al., 1981</xref>). An oocyte treated in this manner will replicate the intact maternal genome in the absence of karyogamy. If the haploid oocyte is then subjected to heat shock treatment, cytokinesis is prevented resulting in a pseudodiploid oocyte that undergoes a second round of DNA replication followed by mitosis. Thus an entirely homozygous diploid embryo starts to develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kroeger et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast to human intervention forcing two consecutive rounds of DNA replication to occur without intervening mitosis at the start of embryonic development, our data indicate that one or multiple rounds of DNA replication and mitosis take place in some haploid oocytes of whiptail lizards prior to a skipped mitosis yielding a homozygous diploid cell followed by mixoploid development. Initiation of development in a haploid state may be conserved in avian species as unfertilized turkey eggs can yield embryos that contain 40% of haploid cells at blastoderm followed by a reduction to 1.3% within the blood of hatched birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cassar et al., 1998</xref>). Depending on the tissue and ploidy distribution, the presence of haploid cells may contribute to abnormal development of specific tissues reported here and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ito et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tanaka et al., 2004</xref>). Successful embryonic development from haploid cells that restore the diploid state by duplication has also been observed in a stick insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pijnacker, 1969</xref>). In whiptail lizards, we have not been able to examine post-meiotic oocytes as locating the post-meiotic nucleus within a large yolked egg is inherently difficult. The difficulty is compounded by the unpredictability of which eggs will undergo FP development and the need to sacrifice animals to remove eggs.</p><p>In addition to mixoploidy, genome-wide homozygosity constitutes another obstacle to normal development as each recessive deleterious allele is exposed in either the hemizygous state (haploid cells) or homozygous state (diploid cells). Indeed, arrested development and abnormal phenotypes are observed in FP whiptails, as well as in FP animals across many other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Booth et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Booth and Schuett, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Olsen, 1973</xref>). It is important to note though that some whiptails of FP origin developed normally, much like their sexually produced counterparts. At the population level, FP leads to a precipitous reduction in genetic diversity as only one set of alleles is inherited in the next generation. While FP could be an adaptive trait to bridge population bottlenecks when mate encounters are infrequent, small populations already rely heavily on inbreeding and FP further reduces the size of the gene pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Watts et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ryder et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>While FP can be considered the most extreme example of inbreeding, it is also the most powerful example of genetic purging as it eliminates most deleterious alleles in a single generation. FP in whiptail lizards and other species could, therefore, be considered a reproductive strategy, akin to mixed-mating systems in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goodwillie et al., 2005</xref>). The ability to produce offspring via two different strategies provides a level of reproductive assurance in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Busch and Delph, 2012</xref>). Indeed, we see parallels to this in our own data in which female whiptails have produced offspring via both sexual reproduction and FP on separate occasions or simultaneously within a single clutch. Within plant species with mixed-mating, there are differences between the rates of selfing and outbreeding between populations, and hypotheses as to why these differences occur include limited pollinator visitation and resource availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Whitehead et al., 2018</xref>). To assess whether the co-occurrence of sexual and FP reproduction in vertebrates can indeed be considered a reproductive strategy rather than biological noise will require further studies to assess the reproductive competence and fecundity of offspring produced by either mode of reproduction. To gain a better understanding of the origin and outcomes of FP in whiptail lizards, it will also be important to identify the triggers. It has been proposed that lack of or limited mate encounters triggers FP, but our data in combination with many other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Booth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Booth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kratochvíl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ryder et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Booth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feldheim et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Larose et al., 2023</xref>) rejects the idea that this is the key trigger. Recent work identifying key cell cycle genes inducing FP in two species of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sperling et al., 2023</xref>) and selection resulting in higher incidences of parthenogenesis in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Parker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Olsen, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Olsen et al., 1968</xref>) suggest a genetic basis for the initiation of FP.</p><p>Our study adds two species of whiptail lizards to a growing list of vertebrates capable of FP and establishes that it occurs alongside sexual reproduction in the presence of males. Using whole-genome sequencing, we demonstrate that post-meiotic genome duplication is the underlying mechanism. One must now consider the possibility that FP is an adaptive trait and that low rates of successful FP could contribute significantly to genome purification. Sexually mature FP offspring will have a low genetic load and only pass on neutral or mildly deleterious alleles to the next generation. However, a role for FP as an adaptive trait hinges on further studies demonstrating the ability of parthenogens to reproduce themselves either through further FP or sexually. If successive reproduction occurs, FP may reduce the frequency of deleterious alleles within a population, as well as provide reproductive assurance when males are scarce. Additional whole-genome sequencing data for species with documented FP will be needed for a better understanding of the genetic basis, propensity, and evolutionary significance of FP.</p></sec><sec

General Statements</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the three reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive comments. The changes to the text and figures made in response to the questions raised have made this a clearer and stronger manuscript. The additional citations suggested by the reviewers helped to further anchor our study within the growing literature on facultative parthenogenesis. Below we have responded to each comment in blue. We have added new data to the manuscript (Figure 4C, Figure S10B and Figure S10D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point-by-point description of the revisions</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>1. Summary: Here Ho et al. provide strong molecular evidence for the production of facultatively parthenogenetic whiptail lizards, through a gametic duplication. As evidenced through multiple routes, including microsatellites, WGS, RADseq, and RBC ploidy, and lines of evidence from multiple specimens, this study is timely in furthering our understanding of the mechanisms underlying FP. The findings are conclusive.</p><p>That said, I have several comments that should be addressed prior to publication. The introduction which addresses FP in other systems fails to cite several key studies that provide strongly molecular support for terminal fusion automixis. Similarly, the study pushes the idea that this is an adaptive trait, however without proving that the parthenogens can themselves reproduce, this is a moot point at this stage.</p><p>That said, my comments are minor. I found this to be an excellent study, well written, comprehensive in methodology, and one that I strongly advocate for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 1 for referring to our manuscript as an excellent study and strongly advocating for its publication. We concur with his/her points that evidence for automixis in other systems was not sufficiently referenced and that the adaptive trait hypothesis for FP is somewhat speculative. The text has been modified accordingly (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments – None.</p><p>Minor Comments: Should be addressed.</p><p>Line 36 – However, data that supports terminal fusion are no longer restricted to microsat data. Studies utilizing RADseq and whole-genome sequencing in snakes and crocodiles have now provided further evidence supporting terminal fusion.</p><p>See:</p><p>Booth et al. 2023.

Sci. 5, 171901.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included that automixis in other systems is supported by both microsatellite and NGS data in the abstract of our manuscript. The references have been included in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 42 – Evidence suggesting that isolation from males was not a pre-requisite for FP has previously been reported in snakes.See:</p><p>Booth et al. 2011.

Biol J Linn Soc. 112, 461-468.</p></disp-quote><p>Despite the prior evidence to the contrary cited by the reviewer, it is still a commonly held belief among scientists and science journalists that isolation from males promotes or triggers FP. We have placed our findings in the context of other studies, including those mentioned above, that came to the same conclusion that isolation from mating partners is not a requirement for FP. We thank the reviewer for the additional citations, which are now included in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 48 – Is this really an argument. While an immediate transition to homozygosity will purge some deleterious alleles, given the genome-wide nature of this, there will also conversely have been strong selection for mildly deleterious alleles.</p></disp-quote><p>Even though many FP animals have congenital defects, our data, combined with that of others, show that seemingly healthy animals arise as well. Even if these healthy animals harbor slightly deleterious alleles, the most detrimental alleles would have therefore been purged especially for subsequent generations. We have modified the abstract to be clearer: “Conversely, for animals that develop normally, FP exerts strong purifying selection as all lethal recessive alleles are purged in one generation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 56 – I would recommend the inclusion of both Allen et al. 2018. R. Soc. Open Sci, and Card et al. 2021. Sci Reports, here, as they are members of the elapids, not represented in the other examples.</p></disp-quote><p>These two citations have been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 60 – Recent studies have highlighted the significance of sperm storage in reptiles. For example, Levine et al. 2021. Exceptional long-term sperm storage by a female vertebrate. PLos ONE. 16(6).e0252049, describe the storage of sperm by a female rattlesnake for ~70 months, with two instances of its utilization to produce healthy offspring during that period. Clearly, molecular tools are providing both support for long-term sperm storage, and an understanding of its utilization.</p></disp-quote><p>Recent work has indeed provided new evidence for instances of long-term sperm storage and the two mechanisms are no longer competing hypotheses, but it is clear that both mechanisms exist in nature. We have modified the text accordingly to include “Nevertheless, clear examples of long-term sperm storage have also been documented in the recent literature (29), underscoring the need for molecular methods such as MS analysis or sequencing data to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 68 – American Crocodile would also be suitable to include here.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been included in the list of examples of endangered species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln71 – The problem with this hypothesis is that parthenogens produced through FP tend to have very low viability. For example, Adams et al. 2023. Endangered Species Research, follow a cohort of sharks produced through FP and all survive. Similarly low levels of survival are reported across other systems for which FP was reported. More likely, FP is simply a neutral trait. The mother is not negatively impacted through producing parthenogens and can go on to produce sexual offspring. Few instances report successful reproduction of a parthenogen. See pers. Comm in Card et al. 2021. And Straube et al. 2016.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment and agree that more data on the successful reproduction of parthenotes are needed to claim that FP is an adaptive trait. We have modified the text to include that studies on “the successful reproduction by FP offspring” are needed to support this hypothesis and have included the Straube et al. 2016 citation. We decided to omit the Card et al. 2021 citation as the reports of second-generation FP was through personal communication mentioned in this study and the results themselves have not yet been published.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 79 – I doubt that there is a desperate need for this for conservation. However, I think there is a need to simply further our understanding of basic biological function, given that it is not uncommon, and is phylogenetically widespread in species lacking genomic imprinting.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that understanding FP as a basic biological function is important in light of the realization that it occurs more commonly than previously thought. We have added this aspect to the text: “A better understanding of the triggers and molecular mechanisms underlying FP and the fitness of the resulting offspring are therefore needed in a variety of contexts. These include: to understand a fundamental biological mechanism and its significance in vertebrate evolution, to aid in conservation efforts including captive breeding programs, and to possibly harness FP in an agricultural context (28).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 85 – It would be worth citing Card et al. 2021., here given that they used genome-wide ddRAD markers to show support for terminal fusion.</p></disp-quote><p>The citation has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 91 – Better citations here are Card et al. 2021. Allen et al. 2018, and Booth et al. 2023, which all utilize either RADseq or WGS.</p></disp-quote><p>These citations have been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 95 – The conclusion of genome duplication here was supported only by a small number of microsatellite loci. As such, given that terminal fusion has been supported through genome-wide markers in other species of snakes and crocodiles, the conclusion of genome duplication is likely incorrect.</p></disp-quote><p>In light of the other examples that show terminal fusion in snakes, we have removed this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 96 – I would strongly disagree with this statement. Allen et al. 2018, Card et al. 2021, Booth et al. 2023, all provide evidence of heterozygous loci and thus support terminal fusion. While no species-specific chromosome level reference genome is available for any of these species, the fact that levels of heterozygosity are below 33% percent supports terminal fusion. Rates over 33% support central fusion, but have not been reported in any vertebrate to date.

Significance:</p><p>While reports of parthenogenesis have been reported as far back as the early 1900's, it has only been over the last decade that reports are become common. Such that facultative parthenogenesis is no longer considered a rarity, but is recognized now as being relatively common and phylogenetically widespread in species that lack genomic imprinting – particularly reptiles, birds, and sharks. Reasons for this are both an increased understanding that the trait can occur, hence recognizing it as an alternative mechanism to long-term sperm storage, and the ease of using molecular approaches.</p><p>The fundamental questions of recent times have been understanding the mechanisms driving FP. Recent papers utilizing whole genome sequencing and ddRADseq have provided support for terminal fusion automixis in snakes and sharks. Here, this study provides evidence of gametic duplication in whiptails, a mechanism with an alternative outcome in regards to the levels of retained heterozygosity. As such, this study compares to the recent work of Card et al. 2021 (Scientific Reports), and Booth et al. 2023 (Biology Letters), in providing substantive advances in the field.</p><p>The audience for this will be broad. Parthenogenesis is a fascinating topic that attracts significant media attention. See the Altmetric score of recent papers on the topic, particularly Booth et al. 2023 (Altmetric score – ~3100). As such, the study will be of interest to both a broad readership, but will also be of great significance to a specialized group working on parthenogenesis. All round, an excellent paper that has promise to advance the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 1 for this positive assessment and for putting our work into context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):Summary: The researchers bring together microsatellite and whole-genome sequencing data from long-term laboratory cultures of lizards to discover occasional production of parthenogenetic offspring by several species of otherwise sexually producing whiptail lizards (&quot;facultative parthenogenesis, &quot;FP&quot;) and to show that these FP-produced lizards have patterns of genomic homozygosity that are incompatible with currently held assumptions about mechanisms of FP. Instead, the FP lizards seem to have been produced by a mechanism that results in almost complete homozygosity, likely a consequence of post-meiotic duplication of genomes from haploid unfertilized oocytes. They also show that FP offspring were produced by females housed with males and along with sexually produced offspring, counter to prevailing assumptions that FP offspring are only produced in situations where mates are not available. Many of the FP-produced offspring did not survive to hatching or had major abnormalities, consistent with a situation where this high homozygosity exposes harmful alleles. Finally, the authors used reduced-representation sequencing (RAD-seq) to survey heterozygosity in 321 wild-collected whiptail lizards from 15 species, showing evidence for strikingly low homozygosity in at least one individual and perhaps up to 5, consistent with the potential for FP in nature. These data are of broad interest in demonstrating several exciting new possibilities. Most importantly, the data hint at a different mechanism of FP than previously assumed, and one that causes immediate near-complete homozygosity. This scenario would likely lead to immediate purging of harmful recessive alleles. If the selective load of this purging wasn't insurmountably high, a lineage with a history of purging could produce FP offspring of relatively high fitness. Other exciting possibilities suggested by the data include the existence of FP even in a setting where mating occurs and in natural populations, versus just captivity.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>I found it difficult to impossible to sort out exactly what the researchers did and with what lizards. For example, in line 107, they refer to a &quot;systematic MS analysis&quot; for all individuals of gonochoristic species in their laboratory, but where are these data? Indeed, at this early spot in the paper, the introduction from here on out suddenly reads like a discussion. What would be better here would be to summarize what was known and wasn't known about the system and questions involved, why gaps in knowledge were important, and what the researchers actually did for this paper. In my opinion, the paper would be a much easier read if the researchers left the results and interpretation for later in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>As a consequence of the reviewers’ comments, the text of the manuscript has undergone major revision, and we trust that reviewer 2 will find this new version far more accessible. The MS data collection of more than 1000 individuals is the subject of another ongoing study and was only mentioned peripherally here to put the identification of FP into context. As most of the MS data relates to gonochoristic reproduction and interspecific hybridization, we are only presenting the data that are directly relevant to this manuscript as part of this study. To our knowledge, there is no common repository to upload raw MS data, but we have provided the data for the FP animals and controls discussed in this paper in the Github repository (see section “Data availability”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Even with this suggested fix, however, the data are still too inaccessible and analyses too opaque. For example, in line 202, a critical definition is laid out regarding heterozygous sites as those having &quot;equal support&quot; for two alleles. What do the researchers mean by &quot;equal support&quot;? My presumption is that this is something about equal or close to equal numbers of reads, but this definition needs to be spelled out and justified because it underpins much of the downstream analyses. A similar problem occurs in line 208-209, where the authors make a statement about limiting further analysis to positions in the genome where the coverage is &quot;equal&quot; to the mean sequencing depth.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the text to “we defined heterozygous sites as those having two alleles supported by an equal number of reads. This stringent requirement was chosen to limit the search to apparent heterozygous sites with strong support, decreasing the chance of false positives.”. We further look at only sites where the coverage is equal to the average sequencing depth to exclude regions where over-assembly and collapse of repetitive elements would artificially increase the coverage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another data/analysis issue emerges with the components of the manuscript that deal with mixoploidy. As far as I can tell, these data come from one sexually produced lizard, one FP A. marmoratus, and one FP A. arizonae. While the reports of bimodality of nuclear size are certainly interesting, the data and discussion are no more than an anecdotal case study in the absence of careful replication across multiple FP lizards and comparison to sexually produced lizards. Without these data, the conclusion that “Animals produced by facultative parthenogenesis are characterized by mixoploidy” (Figure 4 caption; also see lines 324-331) is far too strong.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added animal IDs to figure legends 4 and S10 to clarify that these erythrocyte staining come from two FP <italic>A. marmoratus</italic>, and one FP <italic>A. arizonae</italic>. In addition, imaging from two sexually produced control animals (1 <italic>A. marmoratus and</italic> 1 <italic>A. arizonae</italic>) have now been included in S10 (as S10B and S10D). We also have included an extra panel of flow cytometry data (new Figure 4C) as a complementary methodology for ploidy determination. Both imaging and flow cytometry support similar amounts of haploid cells. With the additional data and clarification, we hope that the reviewer agrees that the observations of mixoploidy are well beyond “anecdotal”. Nevertheless, we have changed the title for Figure 4 to “Detection of mixoploidy associated with facultative parthenogenesis.” We hope that our observations here will indeed inspire future studies to see if mixoploidy is a widespread phenomenon in FP outside of whiptails as indicated by earlier work in birds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I had a similar reaction to the discussion of developmental abnormalities and embryonic lethality of embryos of FP origin presented in lines 263-281 (also lines 307-309). What is the baseline level of such abnormalities and the frequency of lethality in sexually produced eggs/embryos/hatchlings, and especially those produced via inbreeding? These comparisons are needed to interpret the significance of the patterns observed in the FP eggs/embryos/hatchings. Analogously, the comparison of the ovaries and germinal vesicles from one FP individual relative to one sexual individual do not tell us anything nearly so definitive as the text in lines 279-281 (also see Figure S12 title, which is too broad of a conclusion for N = 1). This overly ambitious conclusion also underpins the discussion regarding the potentially adaptive nature of FP with respect to genome purification (lines 341-363; also see lines 47-50). If FP does not actually increase the rate of purging in FP lizards relative to inbred sexual counterparts (sounds like inbreeding is common from line 339), it seems less likely that we can view FP as adaptive at least from this perspective.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a comparison between defects seen in sexually produced animals vs FP animals: “six out of 16 FP animals (37.5%) hatched with no discernable developmental defects (Figure S11A-B). This is in stark contrast to sexually produced animals, where over 98% of hatchlings showed no abnormalities. Additionally, most of the defects noted in sexually produced animals were less severe than in FP animals including bulges in tails or truncated digits.”</p><p>We agree that our statement on the lack of differences between sexually produced and FP animals was too general. We have modified the title of Figure S12 from “No differences between ovaries and germinal vesicles of <italic>Aspidoscelis marmoratus</italic> produced by facultative parthenogenesis or fertilization” to &quot;Ovaries of Aspidoscelis marmoratus FP animal 8450 and germinal vesicles of FP sister 8449 revealed no differences in structure and anatomy compared to fertile sexually reproducing animals.” Due to instant complete homozygosity, FP would indeed have a higher rate of purging than inbreeding. While one hypothesis is that FP is adaptive (in large enough populations), our intentions were to highlight the alternative that FP could be detrimental in smaller populations (that already would likely experience high inbreeding rates). We would expect inbreeding to not be common in whiptails relative to other lizards given that they tend to have large population sizes and actively range across generalist habitats.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A final data concern is with the use of liver tissue for whole-genome sequencing and reference genome assembly (lines 389-390) and then using these data and the reference genome to make conclusions about ploidy/coverage. Liver tissue is very commonly endopolyploid, meaning that coverage could be artificially high for animals for which liver (vs. tail) tissue was used for DNA extraction. In particular, it would be helpful if the researchers consider whether endopolyploidy could have affected their ability to make accurate estimation of coverage and thus, heterozygosity, when libraries generated from diploid (tail) tissues are aligned to a reference genome generated from a polyploid tissue as was done here.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point and indeed hepatic cells in various organisms have been documented to be polyploid. The proportion of polyploid cells though vary and as far as we are aware, all published studies on polyploid hepatocytes are in mammals (DOI: 10.1016/j.tcb.2013.06.002). Reference genomes have been generated from a variety of tissue sources and liver is commonly used. As most assemblies are for haploid genomes, polyploidy (unlike aneuploidy) does not impact the assembly quality. The reference genome was also from an animal of FP origin and therefore has genome-wide homozygosity that aids in a more contiguous genome assembly by eliminating the phasing problem. For the 10 animals sequenced, genomic DNA was derived from liver for three animals and the rest from tail tissue. The sequencing data generated from either liver or tail resulted in similar coverage levels (Figure S6) and similar levels of heterozygosity (Figure 2A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Line 410: Please explain why the BLAST cutoff was changed from the default.</p></disp-quote><p>The BLAST cutoff was changed from the default 1e-03 to 1e-06 to be more stringent and thereby increase confidence in the BUSCO results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 441-443: Please explain why this dataset was seemingly larger than expected.</p></disp-quote><p>Animal 122 was sequenced on one flow cell without any multiplexing with other samples and therefore yielded more reads than other animals sequenced.

We did show that the animal with the lowest calculated level of heterozygosity (<italic>deppii</italic> LDOR30) was a statistical outlier when compared to other individuals of the same species though.

Here, Ho &amp; Tormey et al. provide a detailed analysis of facultative parthenogenesis in gonochoristic species of the lizard genus Aspidoscelis. They show that parthenogenesis leads to a complete loss of heterozygosity (LOH) within a single generation. They attribute the LOH to diploidization through duplication of the oocytes haploid genome after completion of meiosis. This mechanism is consistent with their finding of mixoploidy in erythrocytes of asexually produced offspring. Based on LOH the authors additionally show that facultative parthenogenesis in Aspidoscelis is not condition dependent (no developmental switch): it can occur in the presence of males, alongside with sexual reproduction in the same clutch, and both in captivity and the wild. Finally, the authors show that facultative parthenogenesis is associated with developmental aberrations, likely caused by expression of homozygous recessive deleterious mutations.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>In my opinion, this study presents a very comprehensive, careful documentation of mechanistic aspects and consequences of facultative parthenogenesis in a vertebrate. The genomic and microsatellite results leave little to no doubt that facultative parthenogenesis has led to complete LOH in Aspidoscelis. I am particularly impressed by the meticulous analysis of genomic coverage to exclude e.g. false positive heterozygosity due to merged paralogs in the assembly. I also follow the authors conclusion that a post-meiotic &quot;gamete duplication&quot;-like mechanism is likely causative for the LOH (and the mixoploidy of erythrocytes; but I am no expert on that). I was wondering if terminal fusion automixis together with a complete absence of recombination would be worth mentioning as an (probably very unlikely) alternative in the discussion. It would be exciting to corroborate the conclusion of diploidization by genome duplication in the future, e.g. via early embryonic DNA stainings to show the duplication &quot;in action&quot; (if that is practically possible)…? As for this manuscript, I suggest emphasizing the indirect nature of the evidence for the mechanism of parthenogenesis a little bit more.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the effort that went into the genomic analysis that led us to our conclusions. In terms of terminal fusion without recombination, we argue that this is not an obvious alternative explanation as a large body of work has established that at least one crossover per homologous chromosome pair is required to advance into meiosis I in many organisms (e.g. see https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.681123) and therefore the absence of recombination would likely not produce the polar bodies necessary for automixis.</p><p>We have added to the text: “In whiptail lizards, we have not been able to examine post-meiotic oocytes as locating the post-meiotic nucleus within a large yolked egg is inherently difficult. The difficulty is compounded by the unpredictability of which eggs will undergo FP development and the need to sacrifice animals to remove eggs.”</p><p>While the genome duplication mechanism we propose is indeed indirect because we are unable to visualize developing FP embryos, the most parsimonious explanation from the whole-genome sequencing analysis is genome duplication because of the lack of heterozygous regions associated with automixis. In the text, we have made sure to state genome-wide homozygosity as the basis for our conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I agree that facultative parthenogenesis in the presence of males hints at a baseline rate of parthenogenesis without requiring a developmental switch. However, this makes it difficult to rule out that sperm played a role in activation of embryonal development (gynogenesis; however I am only aware of gynogenesis in fishes and amphibians)… maybe, the authors want to take this up in the discussion. Were the five parthenogenetic individuals for whole genome sequencing actually produced in the presence of males, too?</p></disp-quote><p>FP has been reported to occur in isolated females for other reptile and bird species, suggesting that sperm activation is at least not a general requirement in FP of amniotes. (Watts, et al. 2006, W. W. Olsen, S. J. Marsden 1954). In all cases in this study, the female mothers were housed with conspecific or heterospecific males. While we cannot completely rule out a non-genetic contribution of sperm in these cases, it would seem to be an unlikely explanation in light of the sperm-independent reproduction by obligate parthenogenesis in other species of whiptail lizards (unlike the sperm-dependence of all unisexual reproduction in amphibians and fish). We decided to not include speculation on sperm-dependence in this manuscript as we have no evidence in favor of it, nor is there any evidence for this in the literature relating to other amniotes. In fact, most examples of FP were reported from isolated females, most likely because offspring were not expected in those cases and prompted further analysis as to their origin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I agree with the interpretation of the LOH in the RADseq data as a likely case of facultative parthenogenesis in the wild. However, when looking at figure S13 I noticed some bimodal looking distributions (e.g. in A. guttatus). It may be interesting for future studies to look into what factors influence heterozygosity in natural populations of Aspidoscelis (e.g. inbreeding vs parthenogenesis). Could there be different mechanisms of facultative parthenogenesis in different Aspidoscelis species explaining different LOH intensities?</p></disp-quote><p>The continuous nature of the data may reflect natural variation between individuals and collection at various locations with possibly different effective population sizes and levels of hybridization. Low levels of heterozygosity could be indicative of inbreeding or FP in some cases. This is important to note in future studies and we have added this to the manuscript (“Further fieldwork and analysis will be required to assess the level of FP in natural populations of gonochoristic <italic>Aspidoscelis</italic> species (and other factors that could influence the observed heterozygosity such as population size, levels of hybridization, and inbreeding) …”).

The discussion might benefit from going a bit more generally into the occurrence and mechanism of obligate asexuality in Aspidoscelis. One might e.g. speculate on whether the ability for facultative parthenogenesis in gonochoristic species has facilitated the transitions to obligate parthenogenesis in the hybrid lineages and what peculiarities might predispose Aspidoscelis to parthenogenesis (e.g. are centrioles contributed by sperm required?). In addition, I think the occurrence of LOH due to gamete duplication (facultative and obligate) in invertebrates (e.g. due to Wolbachia) is worth mentioning in the discussion: e.g. there is a similar case in facultative asexual Bacillus rossius stick insects, where the early dividing cells are haploid. Some of them diploidize via duplication later and form the embryo.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for complimenting each section of the manuscript and referring to it as well-written.

While it is interesting that both obligate and facultative parthenogenesis occur alongside each other in this genus, the mechanisms appear to be fundamentally different, and we would like to focus the discussion on FP in a variety of systems and its potential implications in conservation and evolution. Parthenogenesis in general is a fascinating topic for a broad audience and not discussing another form of parthenogenesis (obligate in this case), the focus remains on FP and keeps the manuscript more accessible for non-specialists.

There is just one lingering area of concern in lines 209-219. First, the authors refer to defining heterozygous sites as having two alleles supported by the &quot;same&quot; number of reads (changed from &quot;equal&quot;), but what does &quot;same&quot; mean? Presumably it's not the exact same number of reads, because this would exclude all sites with an odd number of reads. So how is &quot;same&quot; defined? An analogous issue applies to the &quot;coverage equal to the mean sequencing depth&quot;. What &quot;equal&quot; needs in this context needs to be precisely defined.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the remaining comment from reviewer #2 in the text as follows:</p><p>“…we defined heterozygous sites as those covered by an even number of reads with two alleles supported by the same number of reads. Sites covered by an odd number of reads were filtered out for this initial analysis…” (lines 205-107).</p><p>Furthermore, we provide an example of “coverage equal to the mean sequencing depth” to further enhance clarity: “Based on this observation, we limited further analysis to positions in the genome where the coverage is equal to the mean sequencing depth (as defined by rounding the mean sequencing coverage value to the next even integer). For example, for animal 003, the average sequencing coverage is 18.31 (Figure 2-supplement 5A) and we only considered sites with a coverage of 20 (Figure 2-supplement 6A)” (lines 213-216). We hope this will sufficiently clarify the approach for reviewer 2 and other readers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
