Most genes have multiple temporally and spatially distinct roles in different cells and can regulate both circuit development and function. Thus, to dissect the links between genes, computation, and behavior in the adult brain, gene activity must be manipulated selectively in mature, differentiated neurons in a cell type-specific manner. Here we describe a generalizable approach for completely disrupting target genes in cell populations of interest and demonstrate how this method can be used to illuminate the molecular basis of neural computation.</p><p>The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is a prominent model system in which to explore neural circuit development and function. Studies in this animal have provided crucial insights into cell fate determination, wiring specificity, and the circuit bases of sensory processing and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Evans and Bashaw, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaneko and Ye, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guven-Ozkan and Davis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Silies et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wilson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> is well suited for studies of gene function in the nervous system, as its stereotyped circuit architecture allows repeated access to defined circuit components. In addition, many key neural genes are either uniquely encoded in the genome or have a small number of paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Littleton and Ganetzky, 2000</xref>). As a result, these genes are less likely to be functionally redundant, creating a unique opportunity for defining their contributions. Finally, large collections of genetic tools place heterologous transcription factors like Gal4 under the control of genomic enhancers, enabling access to many specific cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Venken et al., 2011b</xref>).</p><p>Understanding how specific genes determine the synaptic and intrinsic processes that implement neural computation is a critical goal. Every neuron synthesizes a specific complement of neurotransmitters and receptors that shapes synaptic communication, enabling diverse computations. For instance, in both mammals and insects, inhibitory GABAergic signaling implements signal transformations such as gain control and normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carandini and Heeger, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Root et al., 2008</xref>). During neuronal computation, these extrinsic signals interact with the intrinsic membrane properties of each neuron, which are governed by the complement of ion channels the neuron expresses. For example, a suite of voltage-gated calcium channels with different kinetics and activation thresholds mediate neuronal excitability, presynaptic vesicle release, and activity-dependent changes in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Catterall, 2011</xref>). The subcellular distribution and biophysical properties of such ion channels have profound impacts on the dynamics of synaptic transmission and on the integration of synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Regehr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Migliore and Shepherd, 2002</xref>). However, how these active conductances contribute to the encoding of information in vivo is not fully understood. The functions of voltage-gated channels have been studied extensively at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction. There, the calcium channel encoded by the gene <italic>cacophony</italic> is required for evoked transmission, suggesting that it mediates the influx of calcium that drives synaptic vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kawasaki and Zou, 2004</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> has two additional voltage-gated calcium channels, <italic>CaAlpha1D</italic> and <italic>CaAlpha1T</italic>, which have been suggested to also play roles in neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Iniguez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Worrell and Levine, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ryglewski et al., 2012</xref>). However, it is incompletely understood how these channels contribute to signaling and computation in the central nervous system.</p><p>Since each of these genes has widespread functions in the brain, the ability to manipulate them in individual classes of neurons is essential. Current techniques for cell type-specific gene manipulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are RNA interference (RNAi), targeted degradation of GFP-tagged proteins (deGradFP), recombinase-mediated exon deletion, induction of somatic mutations with CRISPR/Cas9, and clonal analyses using approaches such as Mosaic Analysis with a Repressible Cell Marker (MARCM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dietzl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hakeda-Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xue et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee and Luo, 1999</xref>). While powerful, these methods have limitations that restrict their utility. RNAi uses a short hairpin RNA to trigger sequence-specific gene knock down; expression of these hairpins with the Gal4 system confers cell type-specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fire et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kennerdell and Carthew, 2000</xref>). Large RNAi libraries targeting most genes in the genome are publically available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dietzl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ni et al., 2009</xref>). However, these hairpins can have off-target effects, interfering with genes other than the gene of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ma et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, knock down of gene expression is rarely complete and varies depending on the level of Gal4 expression. deGradFP uses cell type-specific expression of an anti-GFP nanobody to target GFP-tagged proteins for proteosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caussinus et al., 2012</xref>). However, this approach requires that GFP-tagging preserves protein function, and, similar to RNAi, the extent of gene knock down also depends on the level of Gal4 expression. Flanking critical exons of a gene with recombinase sites produces conditional alleles such that cell type-specific expression of the recombinase enables targeted gene disruption; however, this approach has seen only limited application in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hakeda-Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2009</xref>). CRISPR/Cas9 uses a small guide RNA and the Cas9 nuclease to produce small insertion and deletion mutations in the targeted gene; Gal4-driven expression of Cas9 confers cell type-specificity. However, somatic expression of Cas9 produces different mutations in each cell and has not been shown to work in fly neurons. Critically, RNAi, recombinase-mediated deletion, and somatic CRISPR/Cas9 all lack a cell-by-cell indicator of gene disruption, an essential feature for cell type-specific manipulations. In contrast, methods such as MARCM use mitotic recombination to create labeled homozygous mutant cells within an otherwise heterozygous animal. However, by design, MARCM is incompatible with Gal4 driver lines that are only expressed postmitotically, precluding selective manipulation of all cells of a single type in the adult fly.</p><p>Here we report FlpStop, a tool that can be used in differentiated and undifferentiated cells to produce either complete gene disruption or rescue. By design, FlpStop is specific for both the target gene and cell type and provides a cell-by-cell readout of the manipulation. FlpStop uses insertional mutagenesis to create conditional null alleles and reports gene manipulation through positive labeling of targeted cells. We tested this approach in eight different genes that are involved in development, neuronal signaling, and intrinsic excitability—<italic>apterous</italic> (<italic>ap</italic>), <italic>cacophony</italic> (<italic>cac</italic>), <italic>Choline acetyltransferase</italic> (<italic>ChAT</italic>), <italic>Glutamic acid decarboxylase 1</italic> (<italic>Gad1</italic>), <italic>paralytic</italic> (<italic>para</italic>), <italic>Resistant to dieldrin</italic> (<italic>Rdl</italic>), <italic>Shaker cognate l</italic> (<italic>Shal</italic>), and <italic>Vesicular glutamate transporter</italic> (<italic>VGlut</italic>)—and generated five conditional null alleles and two conditional hypomorphs. We demonstrate that FlpStop can efficiently impair gene function within genetically targeted populations of interest and at specific times during development. Finally, we used FlpStop in combination with in vivo calcium imaging to investigate the role of the voltage-gated calcium channel Cac in a visual interneuron. Strikingly, cell type-specific removal of Cac selectively altered visually evoked calcium signals in individual neuronal compartments in unexpected ways. While the loss of Cac reduced responses in some but not all axonal compartments, it also dramatically increased responses in a specific dendritic region. Thus, FlpStop is a powerful tool for investigating how individual genes contribute to neuronal function in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FlpStop: a new tool for conditional gene disruption</title><p>We designed a generalizable transgenic tool that allows conditional, cell type-specific disruption of gene function. The Gene Disruption Project has produced a publically available collection of genomic insertions that can be exchanged for other DNA sequences using ϕC31 integrase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). These MiMIC cassettes target 2854 coding introns within 1862 distinct genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Venken et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015b</xref>). We reasoned that a strategy that uses intronic insertions to conditionally disrupt gene function would be broadly useful. Therefore, we designed FlpStop, a small construct for conditional gene disruption capable of integrating into MiMIC insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Our approach incorporated two parallel strategies to disrupt gene expression. First, the construct acts on transcription using the SV40 and Tubα1 transcriptional terminators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stockinger et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Second, the construct acts on translation by incorporating the MHC intron 18 splice acceptor followed by stop codons in all three reading frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Venken et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hodges and Bernstein, 1992</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Similar constructs have been used previously in flies to produce strong loss-of-function alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lukacsovich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schuldiner et al., 2008</xref>). These disruptive elements, hereafter designated SA-STOP for brevity, are flanked by two pairs of Flp recombinase target (FRT) sites that form a FLEx-switch, making this DNA region invertible and thus conditional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schnütgen et al., 2003</xref>). The FRT sites are arranged such that in the presence of Flp recombinase, the construct can be inverted and then stably locked in the opposite orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schnütgen et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Therefore, in one orientation, the splice acceptor and the transcriptional terminators of the SA-STOP cassette lie on the non-transcribed DNA strand and do not interfere with the expression (non-disrupting, ND); after inversion, the SA-STOP cassette is relocated to the transcribed DNA strand, enabling it to interfere with gene activity (disrupting locked orientation, D lock) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). A conceptually similar construct was sufficient to conditionally disrupt a mitochondrial RNA helicase in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ni et al., 2012</xref>). Using the FlpStop approach, homozygous mutant cells can be induced in otherwise heterozygous animals by placing the conditional FlpStop allele in trans to an existing null allele and expressing Flp recombinase within target cells of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b,c</xref>). Use of an independent null allele avoids the potential effects of off-target mutations in a genetic background, as is standard practice in the field. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, precise control of Flp expression can be easily achieved by expressing Flp under either the direct control of a specific promoter or the indirect control of a driver (e.g. the Gal4 system).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22279.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FlpStop is a generalizable tool for cell type-specific disruption of endogenous gene function.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the internal elements of the FlpStop cassette and of how FlpStop transgenic alleles are created. An intronic MiMIC cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Venken et al., 2011a</xref>) is replaced with the FlpStop cassette using ϕC31. The FlpStop cassette contains the following disruptive elements: two transcriptional terminators, a MHC splice acceptor, and stop codons in all three reading frames. These disruptive elements are flanked by a series of Flp recombinase sites (FRT and F3). An upstream activation sequence (UAS) is located outside of the FRT sites and a tdTomato is encoded internal to the FRT sites. (<bold>b</bold>) Pipeline to create FlpStop alleles. First, a MiMIC line is identified that contains an insertion within a coding intron of a gene of interest. The MiMIC cassette is replaced with the FlpStop cassette by ϕC31-mediated cassette exchange. Insertion events are identified by the loss of the MiMIC cassette’s <italic>yellow</italic> rescue marker from the progeny of the injected embryos (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Venken et al., 2011a</xref> for details). PCR is used to obtain the orientation of the insertion, and stable stocks with the FlpStop insertion in the Disrupting (D) and Non-Disrupting (ND) orientations are established. (<bold>c</bold>) Schematic of the FlpStop logic for conditional disruption of an endogenous gene. The cassette sits dormant within an intron of the gene of interest. While it is in the non-disrupting orientation, the splice acceptor and stop signals (stop codons and transcriptional terminators) are inverted and thus ignored (and removed during RNA splicing). In the presence of Flp recombinase, the disruptive elements are inverted and then locked in place by the FLEx switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schnütgen et al., 2003</xref>). In this disrupting locked (D lock) orientation, the splice acceptor and stop signals are revealed and disrupt expression of the gene by targeting both transcription and translation. (<bold>d</bold>) Schematic of how tdTomato labels mutant cells. Flies bearing one copy of a null allele and one copy of the FlpStop non-disrupting allele will be heterozygous (+/−) throughout the whole animal (left). However, in cells that express Flp recombinase, the cassette will be inverted, making it disrupting (D lock), and the tdTomato will be brought into proximity to the UAS sequence that resides outside of the FLEx switch, enabling Gal4 to drive the production of tdTomato. TdTomato therefore labels the homozygous mutant cells (−/−) (right).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22279.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22279.002</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-22279-fig1-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22279.003</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>FlpStop construct and example experimental crossing schemes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Map of the FlpStop plasmid pFlpStop-attB-UAS-2.1-tdTom. attB denotes the ϕC31 target sites.

DsRed encodes a red fluorescent protein and is downstream of the 3XP3 promoter to allow for positive selection of CRISPR transformants through DsRed expression in the eyes. The 3XP3::DsRed reporter is flanked by loxP sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gratz et al., 2014</xref>).

In addition, the attP sites that flank the cassette can be used to replace the FlpStop cassette with a donor construct containing attB sites through ϕC31-mediated cassette exchange.

As a result, FlpStop reagents for both conditional disruption (non-disrupting to disrupting locked) and rescue (disrupting to non-disrupting locked) can be produced in a single round of transgenesis.

The developmental role of <italic>apterous</italic> has been extensively characterized, and its disruption produces an easily quantifiable wing phenotype, making it a good candidate for proof-of-concept experiments.

To invert the cassette, we expressed Flp recombinase under the control of the heat-shock promoter (<italic>hsFlp</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Golic and Lindquist, 1989</xref>). Flies that were <italic>ap<sup>FlpStop ND</sup></italic>/<italic>ap<sup>UG035</sup></italic> or <italic>ap<sup>FlpStop D</sup></italic>/<italic>ap<sup>UG035</sup></italic> and carried the <italic>hsFlp</italic> transgene were heat-shocked for 1 hr at 37°C to induce recombinase expression at different time points during development, and the phenotype of adult wings was scored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). We predicted that early manipulation of <italic>apterous</italic> function would have strong wing phenotypes because Apterous is essential for the development of the wing imaginal disc during larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen et al., 1992</xref>). We first tested the non-disrupting allele, whose inversion should disrupt <italic>apterous</italic> function. Control flies that were not heat-shocked had wild-type wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Experimental flies heat-shocked early in development (days 1–3) exhibited severe wing phenotypes, with many flies completely lacking one or both wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). When cassette inversion was induced later in development, flies exhibited less severe wing phenotypes, consistent with the established role of <italic>apterous</italic> in wing development during late larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wilson, 1981</xref>). Next, we performed the converse experiment in which the disrupting allele was used to rescue <italic>apterous</italic> function at different developmental time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). We observed a rescue of the <italic>apterous</italic> wing phenotype when the <italic>ap<sup>FlpStop D</sup></italic> cassette was inverted early; more than half of the wings from flies heat-shocked on day 1 were wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Restoration of <italic>apterous</italic> later in development (days 4–7) was unable to rescue the no-wings phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Interestingly, the time window during which <italic>apterous</italic> is necessary for wing development differs from the time window during which its rescue is sufficient to enable wing development: heat-shock on day 4 substantially altered the phenotype of <italic>ap<sup>FlpStop ND</sup></italic>/<italic>ap<sup>UG035</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), yet had little effect on <italic>ap<sup>FlpStop D</sup></italic>/<italic>ap<sup>UG035</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). This difference may reflect the early requirement of <italic>apterous</italic> in cell fate specification; rescue of <italic>apterous</italic> function following misspecification of cells within the wing disc cannot restore normal wing formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diaz-Benjumea and Cohen, 1993</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that FlpStop enables temporally precise gene disruption as well as gene rescue, thereby facilitating the investigation of gene function during development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Tissue-specific disruption of <italic>apterous</italic> using FlpStop</title><p>We next sought to test the efficacy of FlpStop for conditional gene disruption within a somatic mosaic clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>).

Thus, direct complementation tests using null alleles of these genes were not feasible. FlpStop cassette insertions in the disrupting orientation in these two genes were also hemizygous and homozygous lethal, consistent with them being null alleles, while insertions in the non-disrupting orientation were viable (data not shown). Temperature-sensitive alleles of <italic>para</italic> and <italic>cac</italic> exist that display prominent paralysis upon heating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Suzuki et al., 1971</xref>). To further test the function of the FlpStop alleles of <italic>para</italic> and <italic>cac</italic>, we performed complementation tests with these temperature sensitive alleles and measured heat-induced paralysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>). Under our culture conditions, flies homozygous for <italic>para<sup>ts1</sup></italic> were sometimes immobilized when exposed to 33°C for 2 min and almost always paralyzed at 35°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). When the cassette in the non-disrupting orientation was combined with the <italic>para<sup>ts1</sup></italic> mutation (<italic>para<sup>FlpStop ND</sup>/para<sup>ts1</sup>)</italic>, flies did not become paralyzed at either temperature, results that were comparable to control flies that were heterozygous for <italic>para<sup>ts1</sup></italic> (<italic>para<sup>ts1</sup>/+</italic>). Thus, the <italic>para<sup>FlpStop ND</sup></italic> allele did not impair gene function. Conversely, flies in which the <italic>para<sup>FlpStop D</sup></italic> allele was combined with <italic>para<sup>ts1</sup></italic> (<italic>para<sup>FlpStop D</sup>/para<sup>ts1</sup></italic>) exhibited a fully penetrant paralysis phenotype at both temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). As this phenotype was more severe than that observed for <italic>para<sup>ts1</sup></italic> homozygous mutant flies, we infer that <italic>para<sup>FlpStop D</sup></italic> caused complete or nearly complete disruption of <italic>para</italic> function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Analogous complementation tests were performed for the <italic>cac<sup>FlpStop</sup></italic> alleles using the temperature-sensitive mutation <italic>cac<sup>TS2</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). When <italic>cac<sup>FlpStop</sup></italic> alleles were complemented against <italic>cac<sup>TS2</sup></italic>, the non-disrupting allele displayed little paralysis at either of two restrictive temperatures. Conversely, flies carrying the cassette in the disrupting orientation displayed a highly penetrant paralysis phenotype that was more severe than that observed in <italic>cac<sup>TS2</sup></italic> homozygous animals. Thus, the <italic>cac<sup>FlpStop D lock</sup></italic> allele also severely impaired gene function.</p><p>Next, to test whether FlpStop alleles affect mRNA transcript levels as designed, we extracted RNA from adult brains and used quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to measure expression of each target gene. To capture the combined mutagenic effects of both the transcriptional terminators and the splice acceptor in the cassette, qRT-PCR primers were designed to amplify mRNA transcripts from the exons that flanked the FlpStop insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Thus, either termination of transcription or hijacking of the splicing pattern would reduce the level of the qRT-PCR product. Complete loss of function of <italic>Shal</italic> is homozygous viable and has no easily scorable phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergquist et al., 2010</xref>); thus, we performed qRT-PCR on flies homozygous for the FlpStop insertions to test their ability to disrupt gene function. <italic>Shal<sup>FlpStop D</sup>/ Shal<sup>FlpStop D</sup></italic> flies displayed an approximately 50% reduction in <italic>Shal</italic> transcript relative to <italic>Shal<sup>FlpStop ND</sup>/ Shal<sup>FlpStop ND</sup></italic> flies, consistent with the <italic>Shal<sup>FlpStop D</sup></italic> allele functioning as a hypomorph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We also wanted to confirm that the alleles that were lethal by complementation testing (<italic>cac</italic>, <italic>Gad1</italic>, <italic>para</italic>, and <italic>Rdl</italic>) fully reduced mRNA transcript levels. As the disrupting alleles of these genes were homozygous lethal, we measured gene expression in heterozygous animals bearing one copy of either the non-disrupting or disrupting allele. Under these conditions, if the disrupting allele were behaving as a null, heterozygous <italic>D/+</italic> flies should express half as much intact target gene mRNA as heterozygous ND/+ flies. Consistent with our complementation tests, transcripts in heterozygous flies bearing the disrupting allele were reduced approximately 50% relative to heterozygous flies bearing the non-disrupting allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f–i</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we created a set of FlpStop transgenic strains targeting seven genes that play central roles in neuronal communication. For all seven genes, as predicted, the non-disrupting alleles had no phenotypic effect (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). For four of the seven genes, <italic>cac, Gad1, para,</italic> and <italic>Rdl</italic>, the disrupting orientations were genetically null (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). For two of the seven genes, <italic>VGlut</italic> and <italic>Shal,</italic> the disrupting alleles were hypomorphic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). A single locus, <italic>ChAT</italic>, showed no evidence of gene disruption. Taken together, these genetic and molecular tests of the FlpStop alleles demonstrate that non-disrupting alleles have no negative effect on gene activity and that disrupting alleles often behave as genetic null or hypomorphic alleles (six of seven genes). Thus, the FlpStop approach can produce conditional loss-of-function mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Labeling by the fluorescent reporter indicates efficient, cell type-specific cassette inversion</title><p>In the FlpStop approach, only cells that have both undergone cassette inversion and express Gal4 protein will be labeled by tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

Given Tm3’s complex morphology and striking pattern of calcium signals, we tested the role of the voltage-gated calcium channel <italic>cac</italic> in producing its visually evoked calcium responses. To do this, we performed two-photon imaging of the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f expressed in Tm3 and measured impulse responses to brief flashes of light.</p><p>We first examined whether the <italic>cac<sup>FlpStop ND</sup></italic> allele was inverted efficiently by the Tm3 driver line. As our Tm3 driver is expressed in other cells during larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>), removal of <italic>cac</italic> under these conditions was developmentally lethal. Thus, we incorporated a <italic>tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> transgene, a ubiquitously expressed temperature-sensitive repressor of Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McGuire et al., 2003</xref>), to restrict Gal4 activity to late pupal and adult stages. We compared experimental males hemizygous for <italic>cac<sup>FlpStop ND</sup></italic> and carrying <italic>UAS-Flp</italic>, <italic>UAS-GCaMP6f</italic>, <italic>tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic>, and <italic>Tm3-Gal4</italic> to two separate controls: males lacking <italic>UAS-Flp</italic> (no-Flp control) and heterozygous females carrying one copy of <italic>cac<sup>FlpStop ND</sup></italic> and one wild-type <italic>cac</italic> allele (heterozygous control). The no-Flp control should neither disrupt <italic>cac</italic> nor express tdTomato but otherwise contains all other transgenes, thereby controlling for their presence. The heterozygous control should invert <italic>cac<sup>FlpStop ND</sup></italic> and express tdTomato; however, as it carries one wild-type <italic>cac</italic> allele, <italic>cac</italic> function in Tm3 likely remains largely intact. This controls for any potential effects of Flp and tdTomato on Tm3. Experimental males and heterozygous controls expressed tdTomato in nearly all Tm3 cells while no-Flp controls expressed no detectable tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b–e</xref> and data not shown). In one-day old adults, nearly all of Tm3 neurons expressed tdTomato and therefore carried the inverted FlpStop cassette (data not shown). To provide sufficient time for the FlpStop manipulation to overcome possible protein perdurance given estimated ion channel half-lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Passafaro et al., 1992</xref>), we performed all subsequent experiments in 10–12 day old adult flies.</p><p>In larval motor neurons, loss of <italic>cac</italic> function substantially reduces axon branching and synaptic bouton number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rieckhof et al., 2003</xref>). We therefore examined whether FlpStop-induced loss of Cac altered the morphology of Tm3. However, confocal imaging revealed no structural changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f–k</xref>). Thus, any observed changes in calcium signals following <italic>cac</italic> disruption are not the result of gross anatomical disruptions in Tm3 morphology. We also quantified cassette inversion efficiency in these flies: 91% of cells were both tdTomato- and GCaMP6f-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6l</xref>). We restricted all calcium imaging analysis to Tm3 arbors that were positively labeled by tdTomato, a signal that was easily visible during in vivo imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b–e</xref>).</p><p>To measure visual stimulus-evoked Tm3 calcium signals, we presented 25 ms light flashes off of a gray background and used two-photon microscopy to image changes in GCaMP6f fluorescence in each of the Tm3 arbors as well as the cell body. Across the cell, Tm3 responded to this stimulus with a transient increase in calcium concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Compared with both no-Flp and heterozygous controls, Tm3 cells lacking Cac displayed significantly reduced responses in the cell body as well as in the arbors in layers Lo1 and Lo4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a,f,g</xref>). This suggests that in these cellular compartments, Cac is required for a substantial portion, but not all, of the visually evoked calcium response. Strikingly, calcium signals in the layer M5 arbor became dramatically larger when Cac was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). We speculate that removal of Cac from this compartment leads to replacement of Cac channels with one or more other channel types, resulting in increased calcium influx. Interestingly, loss of <italic>cac</italic> function did not affect responses in the arbors of layers M1, M8, and M10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b,d,e</xref>), demonstrating that calcium signals in these compartments can be mediated by other channel types. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Cac is a critical regulator of Tm3’s calcium responses to visual stimuli and has differential effects across cellular compartments.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22279.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Loss of Cac from Tm3 alters visually evoked calcium signals in a compartment-specific manner.</title><p>(<bold>a–g</bold>) Left: Schematic of Tm3.

Here we describe FlpStop, a generalizable strategy for producing cell type-specific disruption or rescue of gene function that is reported with fluorescent protein expression. We demonstrate that insertion of the FlpStop cassette into coding introns using the MiMIC collection enables straightforward production of conditional null alleles of many genes. Conditional gene disruption with FlpStop can be easily targeted to cell populations of interest through expression of Flp recombinase using the Gal4 system. The fluorescent reporter provides a readout of cassette orientation and is compatible with in vivo and fixed-tissue imaging. To make a broadly useful toolkit for dissecting neural circuit function, we created and validated FlpStop alleles of genes involved in GABAergic inhibition (<italic>Rdl</italic> and <italic>Gad1</italic>) as well as voltage-gated conductances (<italic>para</italic> and <italic>cac</italic>). In a proof-of-principle experiment, we used this tool to disrupt <italic>cac</italic> within Tm3 neurons. Strikingly, this experiment uncovered a novel role for <italic>cac</italic> in select subcellular compartments, demonstrating not only the complexity of calcium signaling but also the utility of the FlpStop approach. Thus, FlpStop is a powerful tool for targeted gene manipulation to address questions exploring the interactions between genes, circuits, and behavior.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The current FlpStop tool kit</title><p>We generated FlpStop alleles of eight genes and extensively tested their ability to disrupt gene function. Of these eight, six were successful. The disrupting alleles of <italic>ap</italic>, <italic>cac</italic>, <italic>Gad1</italic>, <italic>para</italic>, and <italic>Rdl</italic> were molecular nulls, and the disrupting allele of <italic>VGlut</italic> was a hypomorph, as predicted from previous analysis of mutations in the <italic>VGlut</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daniels et al., 2006</xref>). Two genes targeted by FlpStop were not completely successful in creating the desired conditional null alleles: the insert into <italic>Shal</italic> produced a hypomorph, and the insert into <italic>ChAT</italic> showed no evidence of gene disruption. Interestingly, <italic>ChAT</italic> is a complex genetic locus where the coding region of <italic>VAChT</italic> is nested within the first intron of the <italic>ChAT</italic> gene, and it has been proposed that both transcripts arise from a common transcript by differential RNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kitamoto et al., 1998</xref>). Perhaps this complex, locus-specific regulation makes it insensitive to the mutagenic signals embedded within the FlpStop cassette.</p><p>Furthermore, we tested that FlpStop alleles in the non-disrupting orientation were indeed inert, a critical feature that enables conditional manipulation of the genes. For all eight genes, we found that the non-disrupting alleles did not interfere with gene function. Finally, we also demonstrated that these FlpStop alleles all inverted efficiently in the presence of Flp recombinase and expressed tdTomato. Taken together, our data suggest that incorporation of the FlpStop cassette will produce a successful conditional allele for many genes of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Targeting additional genetic loci using FlpStop</title><p>FlpStop can be readily generalized to many genes of interest. At present, MiMIC insertions allow access to the coding introns of approximately 24% of neuronal genes (as annotated by flybase.org; see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015b</xref>). For genes that lack a suitable MiMIC site, the FlpStop construct can be targeted to desired genomic loci using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (CRISPR-HDR). To facilitate this approach, we have created a plasmid for integration of the FlpStop construct through CRISPR-HDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gratz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mali et al., 2013</xref>) (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This plasmid contains a multiple cloning site on either side of the FlpStop cassette to enable inclusion of the homology arms and a Cre recombinase-excisable <italic>3xP3-dsRed</italic> reporter to enable scoring of successful incorporation of the cassette into the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gratz et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Given the flexible access to almost all genetic loci provided by CRISPR-HDR, the FlpStop cassette can be targeted to essentially any gene of interest that contains a coding intron. While more time consuming because of the need to clone new homology arms for each genetic locus, CRISPR-HDR-mediated insertion of FlpStop is more flexible than MiMIC-based insertion and could be used to target specific introns for more efficient gene disruption. The CRISPR-HDR approach can be further adapted to target genomic regions containing a Gal4 transgene using Homology Assisted CRISPR Knock-in, opening up additional loci without the need for gene-specific homology arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gratz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin and Potter, 2016</xref>). As the FlpStop tool kit is expanded to more loci, more information about the failures and successes of insertions will be obtained. Incorporating this new information into the choice of intron for the targeting of new genes could further increase the already high success rate of the FlpStop approach.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>FlpStop enables a diversity of applications</title><p>Notably, the FlpStop cassette can initially be integrated into the gene in either the non-disrupting or the disrupting orientation such that Flp-mediated inversion then creates locked disrupting and non-disrupting alleles, respectively. Each of these inverted alleles would express tdTomato under Gal4 control. In this work, we demonstrate that the transformation from non-disrupting to disrupting provides a powerful approach for exploring the functions of essential genes. For non-essential genes, the transformation from disrupting to non-disrupting allows for cell type-specific genetic rescue by the endogenous locus, as demonstrated by the rescue of <italic>apterous</italic> function at specific time points during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For this application, one should combine the disrupting allele with a null allele so that the entire animal lacks gene activity but the Flp-targeted cell population becomes heterozygous. This approach offers advantages over rescue experiments using the Gal4 system to express cDNAs as the genes are expressed in their native regulatory contexts. Therefore, it will be particularly useful for studies of gene function during development and circuit studies of genes involved in, for example, sensory transduction.</p><p>Expression of Flp recombinase provides the FlpStop approach both spatial and temporal control. For example, as we demonstrate with <italic>ap<sup>FlpStop</sup></italic>, use of the heat-shock promoter to express Flp restricts inversion of the FlpStop construct to a brief time window, a manipulation that is well suited to developmental studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Flp recombinase can also be expressed under Gal4 control, and additional temporal specificity can be achieved by incorporating Gal80<sup>ts</sup>, as we demonstrate with Tm3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). These approaches enable the inversion of the FlpStop construct to be restricted to a time period of hours to days. In addition, combining the FlpStop approach with temperature-sensitive alleles enables control of gene activity on the scale of seconds to minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Siddiqi and Benzer, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Suzuki et al., 1971</xref>). As we demonstrated with <italic>para</italic> and <italic>cac</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), one can place a temperature-sensitive allele in trans to the FlpStop allele of the same gene and use a temperature shift to disrupt gene function. Extending this approach, when the disrupting orientation is induced within a cell type of interest, those cells will only produce proteins containing the temperature-sensitive mutation while all other cells will express both wild-type and mutant protein. Upon temperature shift, the cell type of interest will lack functional protein while the rest of the animal will have a 50% reduction in gene activity, becoming effectively heterozygous. This strategy could be applied to any gene where a temperature-sensitive mutation exists, thereby enabling highly precise spatial and temporal control of gene activity.</p><p>FlpStop complements and extends existing techniques for cell type-specific gene manipulation. First, our validated FlpStop disrupting alleles are nulls, and the non-disrupting alleles have wild-type function, reducing the experimental variability that can emerge when performing gene knock down using RNAi or deGradFP. That is, in these two approaches, differences in the strength of the Gal4 driver result in differences in the extent of gene knock down in each cell. In contrast, because of the binary nature of FlpStop, differences in the strength of the driver change the frequency of cassette inversion, producing different proportions of mutant cells; the extent of gene disruption across mutant cells is constant. However, RNAi requires fewer genetic elements than FlpStop, and collections targeting most genes are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dietzl et al., 2007</xref>). RNAi therefore may be more suitable for large-scale screens and experiments that contain genetic complexity in addition to gene knock down, while FlpStop would be more suitable for targeted interrogations where complete removal or rescue of gene function is required. Second, unlike recombinase-mediated deletion of exons, RNAi, deGradFP, and CRISPR/Cas9, FlpStop positively labels affected cells with a fluorescent reporter of gene manipulation and enables gene rescue in addition to gene disruption. Third, unlike MARCM, which also positively labels manipulated cells, FlpStop can be used to target all the cells of a single differentiated type in the adult brain. However, like MARCM, FlpStop requires a null allele of the gene of interest, though for FlpStop, this issue can be avoided for genes on the X chromosome by the use of hemizygous males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). For autosomal genes, a rich history of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics has produced null alleles of many genes. When choosing a null for FlpStop analysis of an autosomal gene, we recommend avoiding alleles that contain an FRT site, as these could recombine with the FlpStop cassette and generate unwanted DNA rearrangements. This includes the disrupting FlpStop allele of the same gene and some deficiencies. If an established null does not already exist for a gene of interest, MiMIC insertions in the disrupting orientation can often provide a null allele, and CRISPR-Cas9 technology enables the straightforward production of null alleles by creating targeted mutations within an essential exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Venken et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassett et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, FlpStop opens a number of new experimental avenues.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Cac differentially regulates calcium signals across a neuron</title><p>To demonstrate the utility of the FlpStop approach to studying neuronal function in vivo, we removed Cac specifically from the visual interneuron Tm3. We found that Cac is a critical regulator of light-evoked calcium responses in specific subcellular compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In motor neurons, Cac is the voltage-gated calcium channel required presynaptically for evoked neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kawasaki and Zou, 2004</xref>). However, recent studies in olfactory projection neurons (PNs) demonstrate that Cac may have a more complex role in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gu et al., 2009</xref>). We measured visually evoked calcium signals in all of the arbors of Tm3, comprising four predominately axonal regions and two predominately dendritic regions, as well as the cell body. As expected from its role in synaptic vesicle release in motor neurons, we show that in Tm3, <italic>cac</italic> is required for normal light-evoked calcium responses in the axon terminals in layers Lo1 and Lo4. However, unexpectedly, the effects of Cac removal were substantially different across the other compartments of Tm3. In particular, Cac is not required in the axon terminals in layers M8 and M10. Thus, unlike in motor neurons where Cac is required at all synaptic boutons, in Tm3, some, but not all, output regions require this channel. Given that these arbors synapse onto distinct downstream partners, these molecular differences may be computationally significant. Additionally, we observed that loss of Cac reduces calcium responses in the cell body, an observation that also diverges from its role in motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Worrell and Levine, 2008</xref>). As the cell body neither makes nor receives synapses, Cac perhaps contributes to other processes such as calcium-mediated regulation of transcription or enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Catterall, 2011</xref>). Finally, we were surprised to find that removal of Cac increased calcium responses to light specifically in the layer M5 arbor. The removal of a voltage-gated calcium channel from a compartment would not be expected to directly increase calcium signals. One explanation for this observed increase is that Cac was locally replaced with another voltage-gated calcium channel that perhaps has a lower activation threshold or slower inactivation, allowing more calcium to enter the layer M5 arbor upon stimulation. Indeed, wild-type calcium responses in the layer M5 arbor are much smaller than would be expected from the corresponding voltage signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Perhaps Cac normally mediates this small response, but the channel that replaces it in <italic>cac</italic> mutant cells has different properties. Alternatively, loss of Cac throughout Tm3 may cause global changes in calcium channel regulation or expression and thus the phenotypes we observe may also be influenced by compensation. If this were the case, the compartment-specific effects of <italic>cac</italic> disruption on calcium signaling would reflect differential effects of compensation across subcellular compartments. Taken together, the effects of disrupting <italic>cac</italic> in Tm3 illustrate the complexity of neuronal calcium signaling and the diverse roles Cac plays in a central nervous system neuron.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Outlook</title><p>FlpStop is a powerful tool for addressing questions of how specific genes establish the rich complement of neuronal responses that support computation. Importantly, because this approach manipulates the endogenous mechanisms that confer a neuron’s response properties, it is fundamentally different from methods that activate or silence neurons through the expression of exogenous effectors. Thus, FlpStop will provide complementary and novel insights into nervous system function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning of the FlpStop construct pFlpStop-attB-UAS-2.1-tdTom</title><p>First, the backbone of the construct containing the MHC splice acceptor, the stop codons, the SV40 terminator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stockinger et al., 2005</xref>), and the series of F3 and wild-type FRT sites was synthesized by GenScript (New Jersey, USA) and delivered in the pUC57 vector flanked by EcoRI and HindIII sites.

Brains were microdissected out of the flies’ heads in PBS. Brains were then homogenized in a solution containing beta-mercaptoethanol, and RNA was extracting using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). All of the RNA samples were checked for quality by bioanalysis to confirm the presence of both 18S and 28S ribosomal peaks and the lack of evidence of RNA degradation (RNA integrity number &gt; 5). QC Bioanalysis was performed by the Stanford PAM facility using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. cDNA was made from the RNA samples using the SuperScript VILO Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and this cDNA solution was used directly in subsequent qRT-PCR reactions. Four technical replicates were run for each of the biological replicates of each genotype, and the mean of those four readings was used to estimate transcript levels for each individual biological replicate. For all of the qRT-PCR experiments, <italic>Gapdh2</italic> was used as a reference for normalization. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were obtained from the Eppendorf software. The Delta-Delta Ct method was used to calculate relative transcript levels: % Transcript difference = 2<sup>∧</sup>((Ct ND target gene – Ct ND reference gene) - (Ct D target gene – Ct D reference gene)). An unpaired, two-tailed, two-sample Student’s t-test was applied to the delta Ct values obtained for the biological replicates to assess significance.

In the 3D ‘Surpass’ visualization mode, we manually placed ‘spots’ on the middle of each GFP-positive cell body (GCaMP6f in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 and 6</xref>, mCD8::GFP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Spots labeling GFP-positive cells were placed while blinded to the tdTomato channel. Next, ‘spots’ marking the center of tdTomato positive cell bodies were placed while blinded to the GFP channel. Colocalization between GFP and tdTomato spots was then obtained using the ‘Colocalize Spots’ function. For experiments labeling Mi1, Tm1, and Tm3, a threshold distance of less than 3.5 µm between the two spots was used as the cutoff for colocalization. For the T4 analysis this threshold was lowered to 2.5 µm since the T4 cell bodies were more closely clustered together. After running the colocalization function, the analysis was checked by eye and any obvious false positive or false negative errors were corrected by changing either the location of a spot, removing a spot, or adding a spot.

The brain was exposed by removing the overlying cuticle and fat bodies with fine forceps, and an oxygenated saline-sugar solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>) was perfused over the fly. The saline composition was as follows: 103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM TES, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM trehalose, 10 mM glucose, 7 mM sucrose, and 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. The pH of the saline equilibrated near 7.3 when bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Neurons were imaged with a Leica TCS SP5 II microscope with a Leica HCX APO 20X/1.0-NA water immersion objective (Leica). For two-photon imaging, a pre-compensated Chameleon Vision II femtosecond laser (Coherent, Inc.) tuned to a wavelength of 920 nm was used to excite the sample (5–15 mW of power at the stage). Emitted photons from GCaMP6f were collected with a 525/50 nm filter. Visually evoked calcium responses were acquired at a constant frame rate of 38.9 Hz using a frame size of 200 × 20 pixels, 15X digital zoom, a line scan rate of 1400 Hz, and bidirectional scanning. Imaging time per fly never exceeded 1.5 hr. Tm3 calcium signals were imaged in adult flies 10 to 12 days after eclosion. For one-photon imaging, a 488 nm diode laser was used to excite GCaMP6f, and emitted photons with wavelengths between 496 nm and 537 nm were collected. A 543 nm diode laser was used to excite tdTomato, and emitted photons with wavelengths between 557 nm and 661 nm were collected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Visual stimulation</title><p>Visual stimuli were generated with custom-written software using C++ and OpenGL (available on GitHub at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ClandininLab/2pstim">https://github.com/ClandininLab/2pstim</ext-link>) and presented using a digital light projector as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clark et al., 2011</xref>). The visual stimulus was projected onto a coherent fiber optic bundle that then re-projected onto a rear-projection screen positioned approximately 4 cm anterior to the fly that spanned 80° of the fly’s visual field horizontally and 50° vertically. Immediately prior to being projected onto the screen, the stimulus was filtered with a 482/18 nm bandpass filter as well as an ND 0.5 neutral density filter so that it could not be detected by the microscope PMTs. The stimulus was refreshed at 240 Hz and had a radiance of approximately 30 mW·sr<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>. The imaging and the visual stimulus presentation were synchronized as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Freifeld et al. (2013)</xref>. Following this procedure, the time of stimulus onset relative to the start of imaging varied within one stimulus frame (8.33 ms). To compensate for this, the average delay was measured (6.25 ms), and all imaging data was shifted in time by this delay.</p><p>The visual stimuli used were:</p><p><italic>2 s flash search stimulus:</italic> alternating full contrast light and dark flashes, each 2 s in duration, were presented within the central region of the screen while the remainder of the screen was kept dark.

This stimulus was presented for 2400 imaging frames (62 s) per field of view.</p><p><italic>25 ms light and dark flashes:</italic> 25 ms light and dark flashes, with 1500 ms of gray between the flashes, were presented over the entire screen. The light and dark flashes alternated with each presentation. The Michelson contrast of the flashes relative to the gray was 0.5. This stimulus was presented for 6600 imaging frames (170 s) per field of view. Tm3’s initial calcium response to dark flashes was minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yang et al., 2016</xref>) and was not altered by Cac removal (data not shown). Therefore, only responses to light flashes were further analyzed.</p><p>Both stimuli were presented to all cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>In vivo imaging data analysis</title><p>Raw images in each time series were aligned in x and y coordinates in ImageJ (NIH) using a macro based on the plugin Turboreg (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/turboreg/">http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/turboreg/</ext-link>) and then further processed in MATLAB (Mathworks, MA). Regions of interest (ROIs) around individual arbors or cell bodies were manually selected in the time series-averaged image. For each imaging frame within the time series, intensity values for the pixels within each ROI were averaged and the mean background value (the average intensity in a region of the image without cells) was subtracted. To correct for bleaching, the time series for each ROI was fit with the sum of two exponentials, and in the calculation of ΔF/F = (F(t) – F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>, the fitted value at each time t was used as F<sub>0</sub>. For the 2 s flash search stimulus, all imaging frames were used to compute the fit, thereby placing ΔF/F = 0 at the mean response after correction for bleaching. For the 25 ms light and dark flashes off of gray stimulus, only imaging frames that fell in the last 25% of the gray period were used to fit the bleaching curve; this places ΔF/F = 0 at the mean baseline the cell returns to after responding to the flash instead of at the mean of the entire trace. The stimulus-locked average was computed for each ROI by reassigning the timing of each imaging frame to be relative to the stimulus transitions (dark to light or light to dark for the 2 s flash search stimulus, gray to light or gray to dark for the flashes off of gray) and then computing a simple moving average with a 25 ms averaging window and a shift of 8.33 ms. This effectively resampled our data from 38.9 Hz to 120 Hz with 3-point boxcar smoothing but did not otherwise distort the fluorescence signal. As the screen on which the stimulus was presented did not span the fly’s entire visual field, only a subset of imaged ROIs actually observed the stimulus. Both the 2 s flash search stimulus and the 25 ms light and dark flashes stimulus were presented to each ROI. Responding ROIs were identified as those responding to the 2 s flash search stimulus. All of the responses also were examined manually. All traces are presented as the mean ±1 SEM across all of the responding ROIs of the moving average response to all trials of each ROI.</p><p>Peak ΔF/F for each ROI was computed as follows:</p><p>For the responses to the 25 ms light and dark flashes off of gray stimulus, the peak response to the light flash (peak ΔF/F) was the ΔF/F value farthest from zero in the expected direction of the initial response (calcium increase). Each ROI’s peak ΔF/F was then normalized to the mean peak ΔF/F of the no-Flp control and presented as mean ±1 SEM. One-way ANOVAs comparing the experimental and two control genotypes were performed. Post-hoc Student’s two-sample t-tests between the experimental and each of the two control genotypes were performed and Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Quantification of the percentage of neuronal genes with a MiMIC site in a coding intron</title><p>A list of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> neuronal genes was obtained by using FlyBase's QueryBuilder tool to search for genes expressed in the nervous system.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;FlpStop: a tool for conditional gene control in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Fisher et al. presents a new method (&quot;FLP-Stop&quot;) that uses FLP-mediated recombination to accomplish post-mitotic disruption of targeted genes in cell types of interest in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The authors generate a FRT-stop-FRT cassette with a red reporter that integrates into existing MiMIC sites in the genome to allow FLP-mediated gene disruption (or rescue) and labeling of mutant cells. The manuscript assesses the effectiveness of this approach and performs a number of critical validation experiments.</p><p>The manuscript is well-written and generally easy to read. The method is ingenious, and has the potential to be a very useful technique for scientists working in <italic>Drosophila</italic> – particularly in the neurosciences. One area in which the manuscript could be improved is by providing a more systematic assessment of the efficiency of Flp-mediated conversion and discussion of FlpStop's disadvantages as well as its advantages.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Why do the three of the seven genes targeted not generate null alleles? This is an important point for expanded discussion and hints at limitations of the approach. Is there anything in the insert location in <italic>ChAt</italic> that may suggest why disruption did not work? Was the insert incapable of flipping (testable by expression of tdTomato) or simply skipped? A better understanding of why the approach did not work in some cases may allow one to produce better reagents for new genes of interest.</p><p>2) Quantitative assessment of the efficiency of Flp for the examples of FlpStop usage discussed in the manuscript would be useful and this data should be included either in the text or in a table. The &quot;flipping&quot; frequency across loci is not well documented and seems variable (Figure 5). The authors report ~80% of red-green cells using <italic>cac<sup>FLPstop</sup></italic> and M1-Gal4, is this number a function of the locus or of the GAL4/FLP combination? What is the frequency for other loci using the same Gal4/FLP combo and for the same locus using different Gal4s? (There is a hint of this answer in the legend of Figure 5—figure supplement 1; this should be addressed head on and quantified). Moreover, Figure 5 panel B seems to show quite a good number of cells that are green but not red and possibly a number of cells that are red but not green (e.g. in the calyx). How is this second population explained? This figure will benefit from higher resolution images and better quantification.</p><p>3) The advantages and disadvantages of FlpStop should be thoroughly discussed. With regard to the utility of the FlpStop toolkit to a potential end-user: a clear constraint is its dependence on the MiMIC insertion lines. The authors assert that MiMIC insertions &quot;allow access to the coding introns of approximately 46% of neuronal genes&quot; (subsection “FlpStop enables a diversity of applications”, first paragraph) and that &quot;FlpStop alleles can be created that target any desired genomic locus using CRISPR/Cas9.&quot; The first statement seems likely to be a serious overestimate (using the authors methodology, I come up with MIMIC insertions into 23% of &quot;neuronal genes&quot;). While the second assertion is true, it would be more compelling if the manuscript presented and validated a FlpStop construct that was CRISPR/Cas ready if such a reagent has been made. The need for a null allele for all non-X-linked genes should also be addressed. The general possibility of using the FlpStopD insertion itself is not discussed, but has the obvious disadvantage of unveiling second site mutations on the same chromosome. What other general strategies (e.g. deficiencies) exist, and how useful might they be?</p><p>4) Subsection “FlpStop can produce conditional null alleles”. This section demonstrates at length that the FlpStop cassettes can do what MiMIC cassettes have already been shown to do – namely disrupt gene expression. While it is necessary to show that FlpStop works, this information would be of greater interest if it compared the efficacy of gene disruption using FlpStop with that of a MiMIC insertion in the disrupting orientation. One design difference between the MiMIC and FlpStop constructs is that the latter has transcriptional terminators, and it would be interesting to know if they are actually useful (i.e. do FlpStopDs reduce transcript levels more than the original MiMICs, when the latter are in a disrupting orientation?)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22279.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Why do the three of the seven genes targeted not generate null alleles?

Was the insert incapable of flipping (testable by expression of tdTomato) or simply skipped? A better understanding of why the approach did not work in some cases may allow one to produce better reagents for new genes of interest.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is an important topic. Therefore, we have expanded on this in the Results and Discussion sections and have added a supplemental figure to address this issue more directly.</p><p>All of the alleles are capable of efficient flipping, as revealed by tdTomato expression. This tdTomato inversion data is now included in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1, even for the alleles that were not nulls when in the disrupting orientation.</p><p>Of the eight targeted genes, the disrupting alleles of five were null, two were hypomorphs, and one did not disrupt gene function. We have some ideas about why these three alleles did not completely disrupt gene function:</p><p><italic>VGlut: VGlut<sup>FlpStop D</sup></italic> (the disrupting allele) was a hypomorph, as complementation testing revealed reduced viability but not the full lethality expected for a null allele. The <italic>VGlut</italic> FlpStop insertion lies between exons 3 and 4, and consistent with our observation, a previously characterized deletion of exons 1-3 of <italic>VGlut</italic> creates a viable allele that only partially reduces <italic>VGlut</italic> function (Daniels et al. 2006). Thus, in this case, we feel that the FlpStop cassette worked as it should have, but the location of insertion precluded the generation of a null allele. This data is now included in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and discussed in both the Results and Discussion sections (subsections “FlpStop can produce conditional null alleles”, first paragraph and “The current FlpStop tool kit”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>Shal</italic>: Null alleles of <italic>Shal</italic> are homozygous viable, so qRT-PCR was used to assess gene disruption. This data revealed that the disrupting allele produced a 50% reduction in <italic>Shal</italic> mRNA but did not eliminate it. We speculate that the SA-STOP may be less efficient at blocking transcription and splicing when it occurs very early in the coding region of a gene of interest; however, we do not know with certainty why this allele was hypomorphic. This qRT-PCR data has been added to the paper (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) and is discussed in the Results and Discussion sections (subsections “FlpStop can produce conditional null alleles”, third paragraph and “The current FlpStop tool kit”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>ChAT</italic>: The <italic>ChAT</italic> FlpStop allele was the only one that failed to show evidence of gene disruption. Complementation testing revealed that <italic>ChAT<sup>FlpStop D</sup></italic> was completely viable. <italic>ChAT</italic> is imbedded in a complex genetic locus where the coding region of <italic>VAChT</italic> is actually nested within the first intron of <italic>ChAT</italic>, and it has been proposed that both transcripts arise from a common transcript by differential RNA processing (Kitamoto et al., 1998). We speculate that complex, locus-specific regulation may make this gene it insensitive to the mutagenic signals imbedded within the FlpStop cassette. The complementation testing data has been included in Figure 3—figure supplement 2, and <italic>ChAT</italic> is further discussed in the Results and Discussion sections (subsections “FlpStop can produce conditional null alleles”, first paragraph and “The current FlpStop tool kit”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) Quantitative assessment of the efficiency of Flp for the examples of FlpStop usage discussed in the manuscript would be useful and this data should be included either in the text or in a table. The &quot;flipping&quot; frequency across loci is not well documented and seems variable (Figure 5). The authors report ~80% of red-green cells using cac<sup>FLPstop</sup> and M1-Gal4, is this number a function of the locus or of the GAL4/FLP combination? What is the frequency for other loci using the same Gal4/FLP combo and for the same locus using different Gal4s? (There is a hint of this answer in the legend of Figure 5</italic>—<italic>figure supplement 1; this should be addressed head on and quantified). Moreover, Figure 5 panel B seems to show quite a good number of cells that are green but not red and possibly a number of cells that are red but not green (e.g. in the calyx). How is this second population explained? This figure will benefit from higher resolution images and better quantification.</italic> </p><p>To address this point, we have collected a number of new data sets that enabled us to quantitatively analyze the flipping efficiency of the FlpStop cassette 1) with different Gal4 lines (Figures 4 and 6) and 2) across different insertion loci (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1) and have rewritten the Results section accordingly (subsection “Labeling by the fluorescent reporter indicates efficient, cell type-specific cassette inversion”).</p><p>Flipping using different Gal4 lines:</p><p>We analyzed the flipping efficiency of the <italic>cac<sup>FlpStop</sup></italic> allele using Gal4 lines that label the visual neurons Mi1, Tm1, T4 (Figure 4), and Tm3 (Figure 6) to drive Flp as well as GCaMP6f, which we used as a marker of the cells in the Gal4 pattern. These driver lines were chosen because they labeled many neurons within a single brain and because the cell bodies were spaced out enough from one another to enable quantification on a large scale in a confocal volume (Materials and methods). We quantified the fraction of GCaMP6f-positive cells that were also tdTomato-positive. These experiments strongly support our claim that the flipping efficiency is very high and will be suitable for many experimental goals. For Mi1, Tm1, and Tm3 greater than 90% of GCaMP6f-positive cells are also labeled by tdTomato. The T4 driver line is an extremely weak driver line (Fisher et al. 2015a), but we still observed 70% flipping.</p><p>Flipping efficiency across loci:</p><p>We have also examined the flipping efficiency of each of the FlpStop alleles. We used the Mi1 driver line to express Flp and the marker mCD8::GFP and quantified the proportion of GFP-positive cells that were also tdTomato-positive (Figure 5). Inversion efficiency was very high across many alleles: ~95% for <italic>cac, ChAT, para, Rdl</italic>, and <italic>Shal</italic>, and 75% for <italic>ap</italic>. We did not observe tdTomato-positive Mi1 cells using the <italic>Gad1</italic> and <italic>VGlut</italic> FlpStop alleles. However, using the pan-neuronal driver <italic>nsyb-Gal4</italic>, these alleles express tdTomato in a number of different cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We believe that as previously reported, genome position effects on the expression of <italic>UAS</italic> transgenes (Markstein et al. 2008) resulted in the lack of tdTomato in Mi1. As demonstrated by tdTomato expression with <italic>nsyb-Gal4</italic>, the <italic>Gad1</italic> and <italic>VGlut</italic> FlpStop alleles invert well.</p><p>Are cells ever tdTomato-positive but not GFP-positive? The quantification we have now performed allowed us to address, across a number of Gal4 lines and FlpStop alleles, whether “red but not green cells” exist. The proportion of tdTomato-positive neurons with no detectable GFP staining was less than 0.01% for every genotype analyzed. Differences in the relative intensity of the tdTomato and GFP signals account for the appearance of a much larger fraction in images overlaying these channels.</p><p><italic>3) The advantages and disadvantages of FlpStop should be thoroughly discussed. With regard to the utility of the FlpStop toolkit to a potential end-user: a clear constraint is its dependence on the MiMIC insertion lines. The authors assert that MiMIC insertions &quot;allow access to the coding introns of approximately 46% of neuronal genes&quot; (subsection “FlpStop enables a diversity of applications”, first paragraph) and that &quot;FlpStop alleles can be created that target any desired genomic locus using CRISPR/Cas9.&quot; The first statement seems likely to be a serious overestimate (using the authors methodology, I come up with MIMIC insertions into 23% of &quot;neuronal genes&quot;).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for their careful attention. We have reassessed our analysis and discovered that there was in fact an error in the code that led to an overestimation of the number of neuronal genes with MiMIC insertions in coding introns. We have redone the analysis and now find a number in line with that stated by the reviewers: 24% of neuronal genes. We have corrected this in the Discussion section (subsection “Targeting additional genetic loci using FlpStop”).</p><p><italic>While the second assertion is true, it would be more compelling if the manuscript presented and validated a FlpStop construct that was CRISPR/Cas ready if such a reagent has been made.</italic> </p><p>We now describe a CRISPR-HDR-compatible FlpStop construct in the manuscript (Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and subsection “Targeting additional genetic loci using FlpStop”) and will deposit the plasmid at Addgene along with the MiMIC-compatible version.</p><p><italic>The need for a null allele for all non-X-linked genes should also be addressed. The general possibility of using the FlpStopD insertion itself is not discussed, but has the obvious disadvantage of unveiling second site mutations on the same chromosome. What other general strategies (e.g. deficiencies) exist, and how useful might they be?</italic> </p><p>We have revised the Discussion section to explicitly address the requirement for a null allele for non-X-chromosome genes. This section reads:</p><p>“However, like MARCM, FlpStop requires a null allele of the gene of interest, though for FlpStop, this issue can be avoided for genes on the X chromosome by use of hemizygous males (Figures 6 and 7). […] This includes the disrupting FlpStop allele of the same gene and some deficiencies. If an established null does not already exist for a gene of interest, MiMIC insertions in the disrupting orientation can often provide a null allele and CRISPR-Cas9 technology enables the straightforward production of null alleles by creating targeted mutations within an essential exon (Venken et al. 2011; Bassett et al. 2013).”</p><p><italic>4) Subsection “FlpStop can produce conditional null alleles”. This section demonstrates at length that the FlpStop cassettes can do what MiMIC cassettes have already been shown to do – namely disrupt gene expression. While it is necessary to show that FlpStop works, this information would be of greater interest if it compared the efficacy of gene disruption using FlpStop with that of a MiMIC insertion in the disrupting orientation. One design difference between the MiMIC and FlpStop constructs is that the latter has transcriptional terminators, and it would be interesting to know if they are actually useful (i.e. do FlpStopDs reduce transcript levels more than the original MiMICs, when the latter are in a disrupting orientation?)</italic> </p><p>The extent to which transcriptional terminators contribute to the mutagenicity of the FlpStop cassette is an interesting question, and one we have explored to some extent. In particular, when testing an older version of FlpStop, we inserted into <italic>Rdl<sup>MI02620</sup></italic> two different cassettes that were identical, other than the presence of 1 terminator (SV40) or 2 terminators (SV40 and Tubα1). The second cassette was more mutagenic, as assessed using complementation testing and scoring for lethality. Thus, the terminators do contribute to disruption efficiency. However, the comparison between the MiMIC and FlpStop cassettes cannot be used to further address the role of transcriptional terminators. The MiMIC cassette contains the SV40 terminator following the EGFP as well as the terminator signals that follow the <italic>yellow</italic> marker in the same orientation as the gene trap (i.e. the splice acceptor and stop codons) (Venken et al. 2011). The FlpStop cassette contains an SV40 terminator and a Tubα1 terminator. When the direct comparison can be made between FlpStop disrupting alleles and MiMIC inserts in the disrupting orientation (<italic>Rdl</italic>, for example) both function as null alleles. As both cassettes contain multiple transcriptional terminators, interpreting their relative disruption efficacy is challenging.</p><p>We believe strongly that the more critical point of the data in this section (complementation testing) is that it serves to demonstrate that the non-disrupting orientation of the FlpStop cassette is inert. We have rephrased our writing to make this clearer (subsections “FlpStop can produce conditional null alleles”, first paragraph and “The current FlpStop tool kit”, last paragraph). In fact, an earlier generation of the FlpStop cassette had to be modified to exclude <italic>mini-white</italic> as it had mutagenic effects independent of the orientation of the SA-STOP. We speculate that this may have been due to the transitional terminator present within the <italic>mini-white</italic> gene.</p></body></sub-article></article>
