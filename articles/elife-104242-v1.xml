In the auditory cortex (AC), repeated presentations of the same sound activate differing ensembles, indicating high trial-by-trial variability in activity even though the sounds activate the same percept. Efficient processing of complex acoustic signals requires that these sparsely distributed neuronal ensembles actively interact in order to provide a constant percept. Thus, the differing ensembles might interact to process the incoming sound inputs. Here, we probe interactions within and across ensembles by combining in vivo two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and holographic optogenetic stimulation in awake mice to study how increased activity of single cells affects the cortical network. We stimulated a small number of neurons sharing the same frequency preference alongside the presentation of a target pure tone, further increasing their tone-evoked activity. We found that other non-stimulated co-tuned neurons decreased their tone-evoked activity when the frequency of the presented pure tone matched their tuning property, while non-co-tuned neurons were unaffected. Activity decrease was greater for non-stimulated co-tuned neurons with higher frequency selectivity. Co-tuned and non-co-tuned neurons were spatially intermingled. Our results show that co-tuned ensembles communicated and balanced their total activity across the larger network. The rebalanced network activity due to external stimulation remained constant. These effects suggest that co-tuned ensembles in AC interact and rapidly rebalance their activity to maintain encoding network dynamics, and that the rebalanced network is persistent.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>holography</kwd><kwd>circuit</kwd><kwd>auditory cortex</kwd><kwd>balance</kwd><kwd>network</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01s5ya894</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19NS107464</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanold</surname><given-names>Patrick O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04mhx6838</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC017785</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanold</surname><given-names>Patrick O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04mhx6838</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32DC019842</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Babola</surname><given-names>Travis A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Holographic neuronal stimulation shows that auditory cortex neurons with shared functional properties rapidly adjust their responses during sensory processing, revealing a circuit-level mechanism that regulates overall network activity balance.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory perception requires fast encoding of relevant stimuli from a mixture of complex signals. Sensory cortices play a vital role in such sensory processing. In the auditory domain, for example, small neuronal ensembles in the auditory cortex (AC) are actively engaged to efficiently perceive relevant acoustic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Read et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schnupp et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fritz et al., 2003</xref>). The AC contains multiple ensembles of neurons that can be functionally identified, for example, those formed by subsets of neurons preferring the same frequency also referred to as co-tuned neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rothschild et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Panzeri et al., 2015</xref>). Repeated presentation of the same acoustic stimulus such as a tone of the same frequency leads to a stable percept. But in the AC, different ensembles of neurons are activated together at each repeat indicating a high trial-by-trial variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Francis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Francis et al., 2022</xref>). Activation of these different subsets of co-tuned neurons at each presentation of a stimulus reflects a sparse encoding of sound stimuli. Such sparse representation of co-activated neurons enables efficient coding with reduced metabolic energy to process complex information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hromádka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hromádka and Zador, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu and Yu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jadi and Sejnowski, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grabner et al., 2006</xref>). The sparse neuronal representation raises key questions of how activation of different ensembles leads to the same percept and how the overall activity within the cortical network is balanced across ensembles of co-tuned neurons. In particular, when a specific sound is present, a subset of co-tuned neurons will be activated, but not all co-tuned neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowen et al., 2019</xref>). Given that the percept of a repeating stimulus is constant, we speculated that neural activity is balanced across co-tuned as well as non-co-tuned ensembles.</p><p>While neuronal ensembles constantly update their activities based on incoming information, how the activation of a particular sparse neuronal ensemble affects other neurons within the network to maintain the overall network balance for processing specific sensory information in vivo is largely unknown. In vivo optogenetic stimulation studies in the visual cortex (VC) suggested that inhibitory processes play a role in balancing network activity. In particular, in vivo single-cell holographic stimulation on a group of target cells, which induced increased response amplitude, resulted in changes in the response amplitudes of neighboring non-target neurons in the primary VC (V1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chettih and Harvey, 2019</xref>), with similarly tuned neurons’ activity being suppressed. Moreover, in vivo holographic optogenetic stimulation showed that visually suppressed neurons had attenuated response amplitudes when holographic stimulation was given along with the visual stimulus presentation, which was not observed in visually activated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LaFosse et al., 2024</xref>). This suggested that neurons exhibit supralinear-to-linear input–output (IO) functions in vivo, rather than threshold-linear IO functions observed in vitro. These studies indicate that inhibitory influence from additional neuronal activation in the VC seems to play a major role during in vivo sensory processing, likely to maintain the activity balance of the network by modulating activities of neighboring neurons that share a similar tuning property.</p><p>One major difference between VC and AC is that the frequency tuning of neurons in the AC is less spatially localized, especially in a superficial layer (layer 2/3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Winkowski and Kanold, 2013</xref>). The local frequency preferences in the AC are diverse, thus neighboring neurons can show widely differing tuning properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010</xref>). To test how activity in specific AC cells among an intermingled and spatially distributed co-tuned and non-co-tuned cell population is balanced during auditory processing, we stimulated a small group of AC cells using in vivo holographic optogenetic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik and Abdeladim, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang and Yuste, 2021</xref>) while imaging AC population activity using two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in awake mice. We further tested whether any activity changes induced by holographic stimulation persist, as recurrent cortical networks engage homeostatic plasticity to stabilize overall network activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karmarkar and Buonomano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). Stimulating small ensembles of co-tuned neurons together with the presentation of a pure tone in their preferred frequency increased their tone-evoked activity. Furthermore, we observed that non-stimulated co-tuned neurons decreased their tone-evoked activity. Non-co-tuned ensembles did not exhibit such changes in tone-evoked responses, regardless of the pure tone frequency. Thus, the increased activity in the stimulation-targeted ensemble had caused a decrease in activity in the non-stimulated co-tuned ensembles, specifically when the stimulation-paired pure tone was their preferred frequency. Non-target co-tuned neurons exhibiting such effects were not necessarily neighboring the targeted cells, suggesting specific interactions between co-tuned but not co-located neurons. Lastly, the decreased activity in the non-stimulated co-tuned ensembles persisted in the subsequent imaging session, even in the absence of holographic stimulation. These results suggest that co-tuned ensembles form interacting overall networks that balance their activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optogenetic holographic stimulation increases activity in small ensembles in vivo</title><p>To sparsely manipulate neuronal ensembles, we used in vivo holographic stimulation. To achieve reliable and selective in vivo holographic optogenetic stimulation of small ensembles of neurons with single-cell precision, we generated an AAV co-expressing the red-shifted opsin rsChRmine and GCaMP8s (AAV9-hSyn-GCaMP8s-T2A-rsChRmine), as rsChRmine minimizes the optical cross-talk reducing a possible activation from the imaging laser (940 nm excitation wavelength) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kishi et al., 2022</xref>). Injecting AAV9-hSyn-GCaMP8s-T2A-rsChRmine into AC yielded cells expressing both GCaMP and opsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We first tested the efficiency and reliability of holographic stimulation by targeting either a single cell or a small ensemble of five cells. For single-cell stimulation, we varied the stimulation point from the target cell position by 10, 20, and 30 μm along either the x-axis or y-axis of the fields of view (FOV; n=15 cells, three animals). This resulted in a rapid decay of response amplitudes to stimulation by the distance shift from the original cell position, confirming reliable holographic stimulation at the single-cell level (~15 μm diameter) (mixed-effect model, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, the stimulation effect of target cells was specific to the targeted z-plane, showing no stimulation effect when the stimulation z-plane was off by 20 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). For five-cell stimulation, a majority of cells reliably responded to photo-stimulated in vivo (5 mW/cell, 15 μm spiral, 30 revolutions, 6 s inter-stimulus interval [ISI], 5 trials) and exhibited robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; permutation test, all p&lt;0.05), comparable with responses to other opsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">LaFosse et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sridharan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mardinly et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daie et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, in vivo holographic stimulation enables precise targeting and activation of groups of single neurons in AC.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Holographic optogenetic stimulation in auditory cortex (AC) and experimental procedure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An example brain slice showing cells in AC expressing both GCaMP and opsin (AAV9-hSyn-GC8s-T2A-rsChRmine).

We thus next sought to investigate how increased neural activity in small co-tuned ensembles during sound presentation affected sound-evoked responses in targeted and non-target co-tuned and non-co-tuned ensembles. To achieve this, we first needed to identify the tuning properties of single neurons and then target a subset of co-tuned neurons for stimulation. To study how the increased activity of a small number of neurons influences the activity of other neurons according to their frequency tuning properties, we designed an experimental paradigm comprising four sequential imaging sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>First, in the cell selection session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), we identified tuned ensembles in primary AC (A1) layer 2/3 (L2/3) by assessing frequency tuning properties of neurons within the FOVs covering 550 μm<sup>2</sup> (total cells = 7344, sound-responsive cells = 1331, FOVs = 23; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We presented pure tones of three different frequencies spanning the hearing range of the mouse (4, 16, and 54 kHz, 100 ms duration, 2 s ISIs, 10 repeats for each frequency). We chose 16 kHz and 54 kHz as the representative target ensemble tone frequencies, as 16 kHz is within the most sensitive frequency range of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kane et al., 2012</xref>) and 54 kHz is within the range of mouse ultrasonic vocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Branchi et al., 2001</xref>). By selecting target ensembles in two different frequencies, we ensured that effects of stimulation were not specific to one particular population. For each condition (16 or 54 kHz target ensemble for stimulation), we selected five target cells to stimulate. To ensure that all cells in the ensemble were selective for the target tone, we chose the most responsive cells in each condition. Thus, for the 16 kHz target ensemble condition, we selected five cells (<italic>target cells</italic>) among the top 30% most responsive cells to the 16 kHz tone. Similarly, for the 54 kHz target ensemble condition, we selected five of the top 30% most 54 kHz tone responsive cells. By selecting target cells sharing the same frequency preference, we aimed at investigating how activity changes from co-tuned neuronal ensembles alter the processing of the target frequency in other co-tuned and non-co-tuned cells.</p><p>Second, in the baseline session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), we determined the sound-evoked responses of all imaged cells by presenting a series of 16 and 54 kHz pure tones in a random order (100ms duration, 5.8–6.5 sc ISI; baseline session, 30 repeats for each frequency). Exemplar responses of cells from a 16 and 54 kHz ensemble are shown as black traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Targeted cells and non-target cells show response changes due to stimulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (top) An example field of view (FOV) showing the stimulation effect (ΔF/F<sub>stim</sub> – ΔF/F<sub>baseline</sub>) of sound-responsive cells for 16 kHz target cell stimulation (filled squares).

We presented the same tones (16 and 54 kHz in a random order), in tandem with the optogenetic stimulation of five target cells (stimulation session, 100 ms stimulation duration). We performed different sessions for the 16 and 54 kHz target ensembles, varying FOVs for each session (18 FOVs for 16 kHz target ensemble condition and 15 FOVs for 54 kHz target ensemble condition). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref> show two example FOVs with targeted neurons for a 16 and 54 kHz ensemble, respectively.</p><p>Since both imaging and optogenetic stimulation involve optomechanical components, we wanted to ensure that effects were not due to artifacts caused by our stimulation or imaging setup. Moreover, cells can adapt their responses to repeated sound presentation. Thus, to confirm any response changes observed from the stimulation session are due to the optogenetic stimulation rather than simple response change due to acoustic sound presentation, we added an additional control condition. For this control condition, we performed the ‘stimulation’ session with five target cells but with 0 mW laser power (i.e., no stimulation) to verify that any response changes occurring in the stimulation session compared to the baseline session were not simply due to the eventual response adaptation of neurons to the tuned frequency (control condition; 13 FOVs).

During holographic optogenetic stimulation of the targeted cells, the non-target, but sound-responsive cells (n=995 cells for 16 kHz target ensemble condition and n=675 cells for 54 kHz target ensemble condition), also changed their activity, showing either increased or decreased response amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> bottom and C bottom).</p><p>If cortical networks rebalance their activity, we speculated that the increased tone-evoked activity in the targeted ensemble would lead to a decrease in tone-evoked activity in coupled ensembles. Such rebalancing would keep the activity within the cortical network stable. Moreover, given that we increased the activity to the preferred sound frequency, if this rebalancing happens, it should occur only for the distinct sound frequency related to the cell’s tuning property. For example, stimulation of a 16 kHz ensemble should cause a greater reduction in the 16 kHz tone response of non-targeted 16 kHz cells compared to their response to the 54 kHz tone.</p><p>To address these questions, we investigated whether increased activity in the targeted cells influenced the activity of non-target cells and how these changes were related to the tuning properties of the cells.

Neighboring cells within 20 μm from the target stimulation point were removed from the analysis since they could have been directly affected by the stimulation.</p><p>We compared the stimulation effect between non-target co-tuned and non-co-tuned cells across conditions (16 and 54 kHz target ensembles as well as control conditions) for different pure tone presentations. Since our primary interest was how non-target cells respond to increased activity in target ensembles, we focused on conditions where the pure tone frequency matched or did not match the tuning properties of the non-target cells. Since we stimulated during tone presentation the effects of the holographic stimulation and stimulus-specific adaptation co-occurred. To isolate these components, we used a linear mixed-effect model with cell group, condition, and pure tone frequency as fixed factors, and FOVs as a random factor. We then performed analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the model to assess the main effects and interactions.</p><p>A marginally significant main effect of the condition (<italic>F</italic>(2,37.1)=2.983, p=0.0628) on the response change in the stimulation session relative to the baseline session (i.e., stimulation effect) was observed, indicating that these changes may depend on the stimulation condition. We further analyzed the data to better understand how the different factors interacted in the response amplitude changes. A significant interaction between the pure tone frequency and cell group (<italic>F</italic>(1,4397.6)=186.967, p&lt;0.0001) suggests that each cell group responded differently to the two pure tone frequencies. Specifically, the response amplitude decreases in the stimulation session relative to the baseline session were more pronounced for each cell group when the played pure tone matched to their tuning property. This interaction between pure tone frequency and cell group highlights the importance of frequency tuning in modulating response amplitudes. Such response amplitude decreases of non-target cells to their preferred pure tone presentation further align with the stimulus-specific adaptation due to repeatedly presented pure tones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ulanovsky et al., 2004</xref>). Additionally, a significant three-way interaction across condition, cell groups, and pure tone frequency (<italic>F</italic>(2,4397.6)=3.517, p=0.0298) suggests the combined effects of the stimulation condition and the cell group on response amplitude depend on the pure tone frequency. The stimulation effect is not uniform across cell groups and depends heavily on the frequency, highlighting a complex interplay between the tuning property of cells, stimulation condition, and presented pure tone frequency.</p><p>Consequently, we analyzed post hoc comparisons estimated marginal means with contrasts, as our focus was how co-tuned cells change their responses due to the increased activity in the target cells along with the frequency of the presented pure tone.</p><p>For the 16 kHz preferring cell group (n=537), we observed a greater stimulation effect (i.e., decrease in response amplitude) for 16 kHz tone presentation when the 16 kHz target ensemble was stimulated compared to the control condition (<italic>t</italic>(124) = 3.114, p=0.0064). For all other pairs, no significant stimulation effect was observed. This suggests that non-target 16 kHz co-tuned cells reduce their response amplitudes when target ensembles share the same tuning property. Furthermore, such response change occurs only when they process their preferred frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, left).</p><p>We repeated the experiments and the analysis with 54 kHz cells as the target group. In general, we observed similar results. The stimulation effect was significantly more pronounced for 54 kHz tone presentation when 54 kHz target ensemble (n=359) was stimulated compared to the control condition (<italic>t</italic>(168) = 3.074, p=0.0069; all p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Tukey method). All other pairs did not show any stimulation effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right).</p><p>To further explore whether the stimulation effect could be explained by activity rebalancing within the co-tuned network, we implemented a simple model in which a suppression term was applied either to all non-target cells, randomly selected non-target cells, or specifically to non-target co-tuned cells. By comparing three different model outcomes and the real data, we observed a significant effect of the model type (<italic>F</italic>(3, 3343)=56.243, p&lt;0.0001). Moreover, an interaction between the model type and cell groups was observed (<italic>F</italic>(3, 3343)=49.635, p&lt;0.0001). Applying suppression to only non-target co-tuned cells during the stimulation session yielded a significant response amplitude decrease for co-tuned cells compared to non-co-tuned cells (<italic>F</italic>(1, 3343)=48.68, p&lt;0.0001), which resembles the real data. In contrast, applying suppression to all non-target cells and random non-target cells led to similar amplitude changes in both co-tuned and non-co-tuned neurons (<italic>F</italic>(1, 3343)=0.01, p=0.925 for all suppression; <italic>F</italic>(1, 3343)=0.05, p=1), which was not observed in either the real data or the simulated data restricted to co-tuned cell suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results suggest that the target cell stimulation induces a selective activity suppression within the co-tuned network for processing their preferred frequency.</p><p>Together, these results indicate that the effect of holographic optogenetic stimulation depends not on the specific tuning of cells, but on the co-tuning between stimulated and non-stimulated neurons. Also, this effect is not driven solely by a few non-target cells with large response changes. Rather, the overall population of cells shows relative response changes due to the stimulation when synchronized with their preferred frequency.</p><p>Overall, these results further suggest that when neural activity is increased in a subset of target cells due to photostimulation in addition to the target sound presentation, other co-tuned cells selectively reduce their tone-evoked responses to their preferred tone presentation, indicating that the network rebalances to maintain network activity within a certain range.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Rebalanced network responses are stable</title><p>We then questioned whether such response amplitude changes due to stimulation within the local network are persistent.

Thus, this marginal stimulation effect could be attributed to cells grouped as 54 kHz preferring cells, yet still showing sound-evoked responses to 16 kHz, particularly given that 16 kHz is within the sensitive frequency range in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kane et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Building on our findings of a rebalanced cortical network, we next aimed to identify whether frequency tuning selectivity influences response amplitude changes in the non-targeted co-tuned neurons.

We removed cells with extreme frequency preference values, where the index values exceed ±4 standard deviations (SDs) from the median, prior to dividing them into three categories. This removed about 1% of cells from the dataset for further analyses. This grouping was based on the 33% quartile ranges, with each category representing one-third of the data distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Values closer to 0 indicate more broadly tuned cells across frequencies while extreme positive and negative values indicate sharply tuned cells to either frequency.</p><p>We then tested whether cells with higher frequency selectivity to one frequency exhibited greater response amplitude changes. We performed a three-way ANOVA to examine the effect of frequency selectivity (low, mid, high selectivity), stimulation condition (control, 16 kHz target stim, 54 kHz target stim), and cell groups (16 kHz vs. 54 kHz preferring cells) on the response amplitude change. There were significant main effects of frequency selectivity (<italic>F</italic>(2, 2183)=23.52, p&lt;0.0001) and stimulation condition (<italic>F</italic>(2, 2183)=11.03, p&lt;0.0001). No significant main effect of cell group was observed (<italic>F</italic>(1, 2183)=0.77, p=0.379). Thus, neither the interaction between frequency selectivity and cell group (<italic>F</italic>(2, 2183)=0.69, p=0.503), nor the interaction between condition and cell group (<italic>F</italic>(2, 2183)=2.64, p=0.072) was significant. The three-way interaction between frequency selectivity, stimulation condition, and cell group was also not significant (<italic>F</italic>(4, 2183)=0.86, p=0.487).</p><p>However, the interaction between frequency selectivity and stimulation condition was significant (<italic>F</italic>(4, 2183)=2.82, p=0.0238), indicating that the effect of frequency selectivity depended on the condition. These results suggest that the response amplitude changes across conditions were more prominent for cells with higher frequency selectivity.</p><p>To identify where the significant response difference occurred across conditions, we further performed post hoc pairwise comparisons between conditions within each frequency selectivity category for each cell group. For 16 kHz preferring cells, we observed a significant difference in the response change between control and 16 kHz stim conditions only from the high-frequency selectivity category (p&lt;0.027, Holm–Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). In parallel, for 54 kHz preferring cells, the significant effect was observed between control and 54 kHz stim conditions (p=0.033, Holm–Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These results indicate that non-targeted cells with higher frequency selectivity exhibit the greatest response amplitude changes only when the target-stimulated cells were co-tuned with them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results also suggest that frequency-selective neurons form co-tuned networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Sparsely distributed non-target co-tuned ensembles immediately rebalance their activities to maintain the network balance</title><p>Network balance can be achieved by multiple mechanisms operating on different timescales.

To identify whether co-tuned ensembles that changed their activities are locally or widely distributed, we computed the center of mass distance between each non-target cell to any of the target cells. For the stimulation condition, we excluded non-target cells that were within 20 μm distance of the target cells to ensure that any effects from those neighboring cells with their increased response amplitudes could have been not, even partially, due to photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>).

How sensory-evoked activity is distributed and coordinated across sparsely distributed co-tuned networks has been unknown. Here, we leveraged the capability for selective in vivo stimulation via holographic optogenetics to investigate how functionally related neuronal ensembles in AC coordinate activity. Our results show that manipulating a small subset of target co-tuned neurons alters the auditory-evoked responses of other non-target co-tuned neurons. Increased activity in one subset of neurons is balanced by decreased activity in the rest of the co-tuned population of neurons.</p><p>Importantly, such network rebalancing occurs only for processing acoustic features specific to their tuning. Our analysis shows that the most selective non-targeted neurons show the strongest effect after stimulation, suggesting that selective neurons form functionally interacting sub-networks consistent with in vivo correlation analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rupasinghe et al., 2021</xref>) and in vitro studies in VC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ko et al., 2014</xref>). Functionally related cells might form these subnetworks during development likely due to lineage relationships and Hebbian processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Katz and Shatz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohtsuki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Together, our findings suggest that neuronal ensembles with strengthened connectivity across neuronal ensembles sharing similar functional tuning properties actively interact and update their status to maintain the overall network, enabling energy-efficient sensory processing.</p><p>The present work applied holographic optogenetic stimulation to manipulate neuronal activity at a single-cell resolution in the AC for the first time. Similar to previous findings in VC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chettih and Harvey, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LaFosse et al., 2024</xref>), our study further supports the idea that extra activation within the network exerts an inhibitory influence on a subset of neurons. In the VC, single-cell stimulation resulted in suppression of neighboring co-tuned neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chettih and Harvey, 2019</xref>). Our results here show that feature-specific suppression occurs in spatially dispersed ensembles of non-target co-tuned neurons. The widely distributed response amplitude decreases in those neurons suggest that this phenomenon is not limited to local neighboring cells but involves widespread networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowen et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the effect is not solely due to inhibition caused by neighboring interneurons from the optogenetic stimulation. Instead, neurons with similar functional characteristics, sparsely distributed throughout the AC, actively interact with more sharply tuned neurons to modulate their activity the most.</p><p>Cortical networks are shaped by dynamic changes in neural activity driven by various factors. Neurons rapidly modulate their responses based on their functional roles in sensory processing. Recurrent cortical networks are thought to update their activity based on incoming information to maintain homeostatic balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karmarkar and Buonomano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). Concurrently, co-activated neurons processing similar acoustic properties strengthen their connectivity by Hebbian learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hebb, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malenka and Nicoll, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 1990</xref>). Thus, cortical networks are shaped by an active interplay of synaptic plasticity, homeostasis, and Hebbian learning, rather than by a single dominant mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vitureira and Goda, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fox and Stryker, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Toyoizumi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2000</xref>). Rebalancing of network activity is often attributed to homeostatic rebalancing of individual cell’s activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yin and Yuan, 2014</xref>) or an E/I balance: increased activity of inhibitory neurons resulting in reduced activity of excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Froemke, 2015</xref>). Our results suggest that rebalancing is tuning-specific.</p><p>Given that inhibitory neurons in A1 are generally less frequency selective than excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maor et al., 2016</xref>), changes in inhibition are unlikely to be the only contributor to the observed effect. While our AAV was not cell-type specific, it is also unlikely that many selected target neurons would be inhibitory interneurons as a greater proportion of neurons in sensory cortices are excitatory (about 80% compared to 20% inhibitory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wonders and Anderson, 2006</xref>; AAV-hSyn is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in similar proportions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nathanson et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, our primary cell selection criterion for stimulation yielded a subgroup of strong specific frequency-responsive cells (top 30% of cells that show the biggest evoked responses to the target tone after excluding cells that show responses to multiple tones). This criterion likely selected more excitatory neurons, as they generally show greater stimulus-selective responses than inhibitory neurons in sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kerlin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>It is noteworthy that not all target neurons showed clear activation in response to holographic stimulation. Although we attempted to pre-select cells responsive to stimulation, some of them seemed to exhibit reduced activation during the experiment, potentially due to motion artifacts, response adaptation, network suppression, or trial-by-trial variability. Nevertheless, the frequency-specific suppression on co-tuned neurons observed in this study suggests that this effect can be driven by activation of a very small number of neurons. One caveat is that, while we presume most target cells were likely excitatory, inhibitory neurons may have been included in the target cell group. Inhibitory neurons could show a reliable, strong response to the optogenetics compared to more variable responses that excitatory neurons could show (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mateo et al., 2011</xref>), thus may have been included in the target cell group. However, if more inhibitory cells were included, this would have reduced trial-by-trial variability from the stimulation yielding higher probability of target cell activation, which is different from what we observed. Additionally, reoccurring sounds evoke activity changes in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the same direction, leaving the E/I balance unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wehr and Zador, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, the fraction of inhibitory cells is 10–20% of all cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tasaka et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Markram et al., 2004</xref>), thus the chance of stimulating them is small. Together, these considerations suggest that our results are unlikely to be the effect of the activation of inhibitory neurons. Rather, other balancing mechanisms such as short-term depression at thalamocortical synapses may play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li and Glickfeld, 2023</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to slow changes of homeostatic plasticity related to the E/I balance, plasticity in cortical cellular responses can occur quickly and is cell-specific, thereby tuned to their functional response properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tien et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maffei and Fontanini, 2009</xref>). Based on this, we speculate that the decrease in response amplitudes of non-target neurons likely reflects rapid activity-dependent synaptic changes in excitatory cells. Future work using Cre-dependent virus expression or a cell type-specific labeling approach will be required to confirm cell-type-specific roles in this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Lastly, no additional response changes were observed in the post-stimulation session, indicating that the rebalanced network status remained constant. Indeed, constant amplitudes were observed regardless of conditions, subgroups, and frequencies, suggesting that the network persistence was achieved through repeated acoustic stimuli presentation and photostimulation. The persistence after the stimulation condition further suggests that once the newly learned rebalanced network status is achieved, the network response stabilizes and remains persistent. The mechanisms behind this stabilization are unclear but may involve an active interplay of homeostasis and Hebbian learning to form co-active networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barak and Tsodyks, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the present study reveals how neuronal ensembles in the AC rebalance to maintain a homeostatic processing equilibrium for a given sensory input, and that rebalanced networks remain persistent. Moreover, our results show that network activity can be controlled by even a small subset of neurons, and the network changes are closely tied to the functional tuning properties of neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>A total of 14 mice over 8 weeks old (8–30 weeks, 6 males and 8 females) were used in the experiments.

We injected dexamethasone (1 mg/kg, VetOne) subcutaneously (s.c.) to minimize brain swelling prior to surgery. 4% isoflurane (Fluriso, VetOne) with a calibrated vaporizer (Matrix VIP 3000) was used to induce anesthesia, which was then reduced down to 1.5–2% for maintenance.

All sound stimuli were driven by TDT RX6 multiprocessor and we imaged GCaMP8s responses with a resonant scanning two-photon microscope (Bruker Ultima 2Pplus; 940 nm excitation wavelength) at A1 L2/3 (160–200 μm). A1 was identified by its tonotopy gradient using widefield imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). During two-photon imaging sessions, we first conducted a short imaging session (about 1 min) presenting 100 ms pure tones at three different frequencies (4, 16, 54 kHz) at 70 dB sound pressure level (SPL), covering the mouse hearing range, for 10 times each in a randomized order (ISI: 2 s). This was to identify initial tuning properties of sound-responsive cells (cell selection session; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The acquired imaging data was immediately processed using ‘suite2p’ and if the mean trace during tone presentation exceeded 2 SDs of the mean trace during the 300 ms period before sound onset as a baseline. We continued only when at least 50% of cells within the FOV showed sound-evoked responses. We took 16 or 54 kHz as our target functional properties. Target frequency was randomly assigned. We manually tested the response changes to stimulation of the top 30% of target frequency responsive cells (~20 cells) selected from the cell selection session by using a stimulation laser (Light Conversion Carbide; 1040 nm excitation wavelength). Stimulation laser power was set around 5 mW per cell. We selected five representative cells (target cells) that showed visible fluorescence changes to the stimulation.</p><p>Prior to the main experimental session, we ran a short (~1 min) stimulation session without any sound presentation that comprised five trials of 100 ms stimulation with 6 s ISIs for a rapid check of the stimulation effect. This session was restricted to five trials of stimulation given the limited time of the imaging session, leading to larger variability of the observed stimulation effect. We further verified the stimulation effect from the experimental stimulation session where 30 trials were given.</p><p>For the main experiment, three consecutive imaging sessions were followed by the presentation of either 16 or 54 kHz 100 ms pure tones with random ISIs between 5.8 and 6.5 s for 30 trials each, as baseline session, stimulation session, and post-stimulation session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

The default mechanical setup (Bruker PrairieView version 5.7) of the microscope opens and closes the uncaging shutter to enable the stimulation laser path for every single stimulation time point, which causes an external mechanic sound that can trigger neural activation of the AC. To minimize any effect of external mechanic sounds to cells in the AC, we kept the uncaging shutter open during the imaging session. The number of imaging sessions per animal varied depending on the virus expression. Regardless, all animals were used for control and at least one stimulation condition with a minimum of 2 days apart by varying FOVs to avoid imaging the same cells multiple times.

To compare response changes due to stimulation for each group of cells, average sound-evoked activity of sound-responsive cells from the baseline session was subtracted from the stimulation session <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft9">\begin{document}$\left({\rm stimulation\, effect}:\, \Delta F/F_{\left (stimulation\, session\right)}-\, \Delta F/F_{\left (baseline\, session\right)}\right) $\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> for each condition.

To quantify the stimulation effect based on functional properties for conditions and groups, we applied a mixed-effect model by taking amplitude changes as dependent variables, frequency, conditions, and cell groups as independent variables, and FOVs as random factor. We then computed type III ANOVA to examine whether the effect of functional property (frequency) to the amplitude changes was specific to the target frequency presentation synchronized with the stimulation (i.e., 16 for 16 kHz target cell stimulation or 54 for 54 kHz target cell stimulation). To quantify whether the response amplitude changes due to stimulation differ across trials, we fitted a dataset of average stimulation effect across each trial per each condition (stimulation or control), each cell group (16 kHz preferring or 54 kHz preferring cells), and each tone presentation (16 or 54 kHz) to the three-parameter model and computed the extra sum-of-squares <italic>F</italic>-test to compare whether response amplitude changes across trials were different from a constant line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Motulsky and Christopoulos, 2004</xref>). To quantify a relationship between response amplitude changes of non-target cells and their distances to target cells, we computed a center of mass distance of each cell position relative to target cells and fitted the dataset of the response amplitude changes across distance to the three-parameter model to compute the extra sum-of-squares <italic>F</italic>-test, per each condition (16 kHz target stimulation, 54 kHz target stimulation, or control), each cell group (16 kHz preferring or 54 kHz preferring cells), and each tone presentation (16 or 54 kHz). For the control condition, as there were no stimulated target cells, we chose the top five most tone-responsive cells from the baseline session as ‘target’ cells.</p><p>We then generated a simple model in which a suppression term was applied either to all neurons or specifically to non-target co-tuned cells to test our results from the data. We took a similar range of number of neurons and FOVs to closely simulate the model to the real dataset structure.

Using holographic optogenetic stimulation in a small subset of target cells selective for a given pure tone (PTsel), while optically monitoring calcium activity in surrounding non-target cells, they discovered a subtle rebalancing process: co-tuned neurons that are not optogenetically stimulated tend to reduce their activity. The cortical network reacts as if an increased response to PTsel in some tuned assemblies is immediately offset by a reduction in activity in the rest of the PTsel-tuned assemblies, leaving the overall response to PTsel unchanged. The authors show that this rebalancing process affects only the responses of neurons to PTsel, not to other pure tones. They also show that assemblies of neurons that are not selective for PTsel don't participate in the rebalancing process. They conclude that assemblies of neurons with similar pure-tone selectivity must interact in some way to organize this rebalancing process, and they suggest that mechanisms based on homeostatic signaling may play a role.</p><p>The authors have successfully controlled for potential artefacts resulting from their optogenetic stimulation. This study is therefore pioneering in the field of the auditory cortex (AC), as it is the first to use single-cell optogenetic stimulation to explore the functional organization of AC circuits in vivo. The conclusions of this paper are very interesting. They raise new questions about the mechanisms that could underlie such a rebalancing process.</p><p>(1) This study uses an all-optical approach to excite a restricted group of neurons chosen for their functional characteristics (their frequency tuning), and simultaneously record from the entire network observable in the FOV. As stated by the authors, this approach is applied for the first time to the auditory cortex, which is a tour de force. However, such approach is complex and requires precise controls to be convincing. The authors provide important controls to demonstrate the precise ability of their optogenetic methods. In particular, holographic patterns used to excite 5 cells simultaneously may be associated with out-of-focus laser hot spots. Cells located outside of the FOV could be activated, therefore engaging other cells than the targeted ones in the stimulation. This would be problematic in this study as their tuning may be unrelated to the tuning of the targeted cells. To control for such effect, the authors have decoupled the imaging and the excitation planes, and checked for the absence of out-of-focus unwanted excitation (Suppl Fig1).</p><p>(2) In the auditory cortex, assemblies of cells with similar pure-tone selectivity are linked together not only by their ability to respond to the same sound, but also by other factors.

This study clearly shows that such assemblies are structured in a way that maintains a stable global response through a rebalancing process. If a group of cells within an assembly increases its response, the rest of the assembly must be inhibited to maintain the total response.</p><p>One surprising result is the clear boundary between assemblies: a rebalancing process occurring in one assembly does not affect the response in another assembly comprising cells tuned to a different frequency. However, this is slightly challenged by the data shown in Figure 3.</p><p>Figure 3B-left, for example, shows that, compared to controls, non-target 16 kHzpreferring neurons only decrease their response to a 16 kHz pure tone when the cells targeted by the opto stimulation also prefer 16 kHz, but not when the targeted cells prefer 54 kHz. However, the inverse is not entirely true. Again compared to controls, Figure 3B (right) shows that non-target 54 kHz-preferring neurons decrease their response to a 54 kHz pure tone when the targeted cells also prefer 54 kHz; however, they also tend to be inhibited when the targeted cells prefer 16 kHz.</p><p>The authors suggest this may be due to the partial activation of 54 kHz-preferring cells by 16 kHz tones and propose examining the response of highly selective neurons. The results are shown in Figure 3F. It would have been more logical to show the same results as in Figure 3B, but with the left part restricted to highly 16 kHz-selective cells and the right part to highly 54 kHz-selective cells. However, the authors chose to pool all responses to 16 kHz and 54 kHz tones in every triplet of conditions (control, opto stimulation on 16 kHz-preferring cells and opto stimulation on 54 kHz-preferring cells), which blurs the result of the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers for highlighting the strengths of our work and providing valuable feedback. We further developed our manuscript mainly from Reviewer 2’s point on the overall effect explained as the main result. One of the main reasons why we chose to pool all tone preferring cells instead of highly selective cells was to ensure that the observed effect not necessarily driven by only a small group of neurons but rather that the effect was driven at the population level, especially at a subject level for Figure 3B. While Figure 3F represents how highly selective cells to each frequency play a major role in the effect, we now have added additional results with only highly selective neurons as Supplementary Figure 3. The left panel shows restricting the population to highly selective neurons to 16 kHz and the right panel restricting the population to highly selective neurons to 54 kHz at cell population level to emphasize the result (Supplementary Figure 3).</p><p>We appreciate an additional raised point by Reviewer 1 regarding the stimulation effect on population coding. Our primary focus in this manuscript was to establish single cell level effects of holographic stimulation, and we believe that population coding analyses would benefit from a more cell-type-specific approach. We plan to pursue such analyses in follow-up studies where cell types can be better identified and linked to network dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The authors have appropriately addressed my concerns.</p><p>As this dataset will be of general interest, it would be helpful to include a doi/link to their data repository in the data availability section.</p></disp-quote><p>Updating the data repository to the institution server is currently in progress.

How are the calcium traces simulated? It is difficult to ascertain whether the result shown in Figure 3C is merely a trivial consequence of the hypothesis that suppression is applied to co-tuned neurons or to all neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for the lack of important details in the explanation of the model. We simulated time-varying sound-evoked calcium transient especially by applying different decay time constant (faster decay for co-tuned neurons and slower decay for non co-tuned neurons) to closely match the real data. More detailed explanation on this is now included in the manuscript (lines 644 – 650). Since our data do not currently allow us to identify specific cell types, we focused on modelling the stronger suppression observed in co-tuned neurons, especially by adapting the stimulation effect of target cells from the real data. In this revision, we now added data showing that ‘Randomly selected cells’ from the two groups (co-tuned or non co-tuned cell groups) did not exhibit any stimulation effect (added column in Figure 3D) to further indicate that suppression specific to co-tuned neurons is the key factor underlying the observed effects in the real data. We hope to build on this work in future studies to identify cell-type-specific effects and their computational roles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the rebuttal clearly states that experiments are carried out on awake animals, this information is still missing from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We now stated ‘Fully awake animals’ in the experimental procedures.</p></body></sub-article></article>
