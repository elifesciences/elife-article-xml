Photostimulation of parafacial (pF) neuromedin B (NMB) or gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), or preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) NMBR or GRPR neurons elicited ectopic sighs with latency inversely related to time from preceding endogenous sigh. Of particular note, ectopic sighs could be produced without involvement of these peptides or their receptors in preBötC. Moreover, chemogenetic or optogenetic activation of preBötC SST neurons induced sighing, even in the presence of NMBR and/or GRPR antagonists.

Two largely parallel medullary pathways from the pF to preBötC appear critical for the generation of these physiological sighs: pF neurons expressing NMB or GRP project to preBötC neurons expressing their cognate receptors, NMBR and GRPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2016</xref>). These pathways also appear to mediate confinement-induced claustrophobic sighing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2020</xref>), and by extension, other forms of sighing associated with emotional states such as during sadness, anxiety, depression, relief, or happiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ramirez, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li and Yackle, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In rodents, the preBötC receives inputs from NMB and GRP pF neurons, and genetic deletion of NMBRs or GRPRs or local antagonism of NMBRs or GRPRs in preBötC significantly reduces endogenous sighing, while local injection into preBötC of bombesin, NMB or GRP significantly increases spontaneous sighing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2016</xref>). In order to determine whether NMB and GRP are obligatory for sighs, and to better understand the mechanisms within the preBötC underlying sigh generation, we investigated whether activation of pF NMB or GRP neurons can generate sufficient input to preBötC to induce sighs and whether activation of preBötC GRPRs or NMBRs is necessary for generation of sighs.</p><p>Using transgenic mice that express Cre- or Flp-recombinase in <italic>Nmb</italic>-, <italic>Grp</italic>-, <italic>Nmbr</italic>-, or <italic>Grpr</italic>-expressing neurons, we investigated the effects on sighing and other aspects of breathing pattern in vivo: (i) of optogenetic activation of ChR2-transfected pF GRP or NMB neurons; (ii) of optogenetic or chemogenetic activation of ChR2-transfected preBötC GRPR or NMBR neurons, including in the presence of their antagonists, and; (iii) determined whether activating preBötC SST neurons, presumptive preBötC output neurons, can generate sighs. Moreover, by using electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging, we investigated the activity profiles of <italic>Grpr</italic>- or <italic>Nmbr</italic>-expressing preBötC neurons in vitro.</p><p>We conclude that: (i) activation of either pF NMB or GRP neurons generates sufficient input to preBötC to generate ectopic sighs; (ii) sighs can be generated by activation of preBötC GRPR and NMBR neurons even after blockade of NMBR and GRPR receptors; (iii) preBötC GRPR or NMBR neurons act via partially overlapping pathways to produce sighs via preBötC SST neurons; (iv) preBötC NMBR neurons are not rhythmogenic, and; (v) activation of preBötC SST neurons can generate sighs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A sigh is an inspiratory effort that results in significantly increased tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>), typically two to five times larger compared to normal breaths with a range of airflow profiles.

The signals producing these large periodic inspiratory efforts originate within the preBötC, a heterogeneous medullary population that is the kernel for generation of breathing rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>). Molecularly defined preBötC subpopulations underlie different functions during breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>). Ablation, genetic deletion, or pharmacological excitation or inhibition of preBötC neurons expressing receptors (NMBR and GRPR) for bombesin-related peptides (NMB and GRP) significantly affects rhythmic (~25–40/hr) sighing in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we further explored the mechanisms of sigh generation.</p><p>Sighs exhibit various shapes, i.e., augmented single inspiratory effort, partial doublets, and full doublets, that have two unifying characteristics: (i) significant transient increase in V<sub>T</sub> and; (ii) occur at a much lower frequency compared to eupneic breaths; often these augmented inspiratory efforts are followed by a lengthened interburst interval, i.e., postsigh apnea. We use these criteria as a definition of sighs, which unifies observations and conclusions in this and previous in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ramirez, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carnevali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sherman et al., 2015</xref> and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lieske et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feldman and Gray, 2000</xref>) studies that used various, often incongruent definitions of sighs.</p><p>Here, we investigated two novel properties of sigh generation: sigh phase and postsigh refractory period. By using the same approach that we employed for differentiating the effects of optogenetic stimulation on various preBötC subpopulations on the eupneic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sherman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Sousa Abreu et al., 2022</xref>), we found that sighs evoked by optogenetic stimulation of various subpopulations reset the sigh cycle and delayed the onset of the next endogenous sigh. Also, similar to a postinspiratory refractory period in the respiratory cycle, during which ectopic breaths cannot be evoked immediately following termination of an inspiratory effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cui et al., 2016</xref>), we similarly observed a postsigh refractory period following an endogenous sigh, during which ectopic sighs could not be evoked. We suggest that these subpopulations have intrinsic ‘sigh-generating’ properties, e.g., unique signaling pathways or connectivity that affects excitability of these subpopulations. Although vagotomy transiently abolishes eupneic sighs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cherniack et al., 1981</xref>), they can be evoked in the absence of sensory feedback in vivo after vagotomy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Janczewski et al., 2012</xref> or in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lieske et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feldman and Gray, 2000</xref>), suggesting that sensory inputs by themselves are not necessary, but likely modulate activity of these subpopulations to affect frequency of sighs. The mechanisms that underlie the slow sigh rhythm (~minutes) remains to be discovered, and might involve intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Borrus et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>In mice, sigh-like movements appear in utero between E17 and E18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chapuis et al., 2014</xref>), when at least two types of inspiratory-modulated neurons can be differentiated in rhythmic slices: neurons that fire in sync with regular ‘eupneic’ XII bursts, and those that fire only during sigh-like bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chapuis et al., 2014</xref>). This could result from increased activity in a single population with a distribution of activation thresholds or from recruitment of a distinct high-threshold population. In vitro, the majority of NMBR preBötC neurons recorded were active in both eupneic and sigh bursts, a few GRPR preBötC neurons recorded were active in eupnea, but none were active exclusively during sighs, q.v., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chapuis et al., 2014</xref>). Rhythmic preBötC NMBR neurons in neonatal mice were active during both eupneic and sigh bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), but not during burstlets or the pre-I period. These results suggest that NMBR preBötC neurons are Type II neurons that participate in generation of the burst patterns of sighs and eupneic breaths, but are not rhythmogenic.</p><p>Sighs can be induced by activation of various subpopulations within two structures: NMB or GRP in pF and NMBR, GRPR, or SST in preBötC. We previously reported a microcircuit capable of generating sighs involving pF neurons producing bombesin-related peptides that project to preBötC neurons expressing cognate NMBRs and GRPRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2016</xref>), and that activation of these preBötC neurons via their peptide receptors was sufficient to generate sighs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Here, in significantly extending this work, we show that sighs can be evoked by direct photoexcitation of GRP, NMBR, or GRPR neurons, bypassing activation of these receptors. Photostimulation of preBötC GRPR or NMBR neurons can elicit ectopic sighs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and c</xref>), even in the presence of GRPR and NMBR antagonists at sufficient concentration to block the effect of exogenous application of peptides that increase sigh rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, sighs can be induced by increasing the excitability of these subpopulations, without obligatory participation of pathways activated by bombesin-related peptides. In other words, while it can provide sufficient external input to trigger sighs, activation of preBötC NMBRs and/or GRPRs is not necessary for sigh production. This suggests that sighs are not the unique product of a preBötC bombesin-peptide signaling pathway.</p><p>We studied photoactivation of pF <italic>Nmb</italic>- and <italic>Grp</italic>-expressing neurons in transgenic mice. Could our protocol have also activated GRP or NMB-containing presynaptic terminals originating from brainstem neurons outside pF, such as found in the parabrachial nuclei and NTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2016</xref>)? This is unlikely in the case of NMB, since <italic>Nmb</italic>-expressing neurons are limited to pF in the medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Also, unlikely the case of GRP, as there is no evidence that pF neurons express GRPRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kamichi et al., 2005</xref>). However, our protocol would result in the expression of ChR2 in neurons that expressed <italic>Nmb</italic>- or <italic>Grp</italic>-expressing neurons at any point since conception, even transiently. Thus, we cannot rule out that; in our adult mice there were neurons in pF that once expressed these peptides but no longer did so, and that these vestigial NMB or GRP neurons could have been perturbed in our protocol. Such determination requires additional studies outside the scope of the work reported here.</p><p>preBötC neurons expressing <italic>Sst</italic>, mostly distinct from <italic>Nmbr</italic> and <italic>Grpr</italic> populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), receive input from rhythmogenic preBötC neurons, many have an inspiratory firing pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashhad and Feldman, 2020</xref>), that appear to serve a premotor role to shape inspiratory motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cui et al., 2016</xref>). Photostimulation of preBötC SST neurons increases peak inspiratory amplitude in both anesthetized and awake mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Sousa Abreu et al., 2022</xref>). Here, DREADD-mediated excitation of SST neurons significantly increased sigh rate, with the effect much larger than DREADD-mediated excitation of NMBR neurons (16- vs threefold increase). Additionally, unlike the significant 1–5 s latency to induce an ectopic sigh when photostimulating GRPR or NMBR preBötC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), photostimulating preBötC SST neurons during inspiration induced a second augmented inspiration immediately following the eupneic burst to convert it into a sigh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Importantly, the effects of such photostimulation were unaffected by blockade of both NMBR and GRPR receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>), and sighs evoked by microinjection of peptides NMB and GRP into preBötC were completely eliminated by inhibition of SST neurons that expressed an inhibitory DREADD PSAM4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g and h</xref>). We conclude that activation of preBötC SST neurons is also sufficient to induce sighs and further suggest they can induce sighs, downstream from NMBR and GRPR preBötC neurons, and may be necessary to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of sigh generating parafacial (pF)-preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) microcircuit.</title><p>NMB and GRP neurons in pF project to preBötC neurons expressing cognate receptors NMBR and GRPR.

Our data here, consistent with a previous report of effects from intravenous administration of bombesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaczyńska and Szereda-Przestaszewska, 2009</xref>), suggests that this microcircuit is tightly integrated within the eupneic CPG with NMBR, GRPR, and SST populations having distinct though overlapping roles in modulation of the eupneic breathing pattern as well as in the generation of sighs. The majority of preBötC neurons expressing NMBR, GRPR (or both) receptors are glutamatergic and excitatory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In vitro, no NMBR preBötC neurons were active during burstlets or the pre-I period, suggesting that NMBR preBötC neurons are Type II neurons that participate in generation of breathing pattern but not rhythm generation (similar to the properties of preBötC SST neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashhad and Feldman, 2020</xref>). In vivo, we observed distinctly different effects from activation of preBötC GRPR and NMBR neurons: photoactivation of GRPR neurons increased breathing frequency, whereas photo- or chemo-activation of NMBR neurons decreased breathing frequency and increased amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and c</xref>); otherwise, their effects on sighing appeared similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Notably, some neurons express both NMBR and GRPR receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). When the overlapping subpopulation of preBötC neurons expressing both GRPRs and NMBRs was excluded, we could activate the two discrete pathways independently. Photostimulating GRPR-only neurons had no effect on inspiratory burst amplitude, whereas photostimulating NMBR-only neurons increased amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Additionally, DREADD-mediated excitation of the SST population increased both the sigh rate and the inspiratory burst amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>). Microinjection of peptides NMB and GRP into preBötC increased sigh rate and inspiratory burst amplitude; subsequent ultrapotent chemogenetic inhibition of preBötC SST neurons selectively abolished sighs, but not an increase in inspiratory amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g and h</xref>), suggesting that modulation of breathing pattern by NMBR and GRPR neurons is independent of SST neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Sighing is a relatively straightforward behavior that appears to result from a delineable microcircuit that could only be discovered because of the close relationship between the essential, readily localizable, compact circuitry with a definitive precisely measurable functional physiologically relevant output.

Injections were made using micropipettes (~40 µm tip), placed bilaterally into the preBötC. Injections targeted to the center of the preBötC were placed 0.15 mm caudal to the hypoglossal canal, 1.2 mm lateral to the midline, and 0.24 mm dorsal to the ventral medullary surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cui et al., 2016</xref>). Small corrections were made to avoid puncturing of blood vessels on the surface of the medulla. All injections were made using a series of pressure pulses (Picospritzer, Parker-Hannifin; or Micro4, World Precision Instruments). For activation of hM3Dq receptors, 50 µL of CNO solution was applied to the ventral surface of the brainstem. CNO (Tocris Biosciences) was dissolved in saline at a concentration of 1 mg/ml with 0.5% dimethylsulfoxide. Solution was prepared fresh daily. For activation of PSAM4-GlyR receptors, 30 µL of uPSEM817 tartrate solution (10 mM) was applied to the ventral surface of the brainstem. In chemogenetic experiments CNO or uPSEM817 were applied to the ventral surface of the brainstem instead of microinjection in order to avoid preBötC damage from multiple microinjections; in control experiments application of the same dose of CNO or uPSEM817 does not produce responses in any breathing parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In situ hybridization and immunostaining</title><p><italic>Nmbr</italic><sup>Cre</sup>, <italic>Sst</italic><sup>Cre</sup>, or wild-type mice (10–14 wk) were euthanized with isoflurane overdose, their brainstems were rapidly removed and flash-frozen in dry ice. Fresh frozen brainstems were sectioned sagittally on a cryostat (CryoStar NX70, Thermo Scientific), mounted on SuperFrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific) and stored at –80 °C for at least 1 d. They were then processed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (RNAscope version 1, Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Briefly, tissue samples were postfixed in 10% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde, washed, and dehydrated in sequential concentrations of ethanol (50, 70, and 100%). Samples were treated with protease IV and incubated for 2 hr at 40 °C in the HybEZ Hybridization Oven (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) in the presence of target probes. We used combinations of the following probes for hybridization: <italic>Mm-ChAT</italic>, <italic>Mm-Grpr, Mm-Nmbr, Mm-Sst</italic>, <italic>Mm-Slc17a6 (VGluT2), Mm-Aldh1l1, Cre,</italic> and <italic>Flp</italic>. A probe for <italic>Mm-ChAT</italic> was used in all probe combinations to mark the location of nucleus ambiguus, which is necessary for determining the location of preBötC. After a 4-step amplification process, samples were counterstained with DAPI and coverslipped with ProLong Gold (Invitrogen) used as a mounting agent. Images were acquired on a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM710 META, Zeiss). High-resolution z-stack confocal images were taken at 1 µm intervals and then merged using ImageJ software.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry was performed according to the following protocol. Free-floating sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated with 10% normal donkey antiserum (NDS) and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 60 min to reduce nonspecific staining and increase antibody penetration. Sections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 1% NDS and 0.2% Triton X-100. The following day, sections were washed in PBS, incubated with the specific secondary antibodies conjugated to the fluorescent probes diluted in PBS for 2 hr. Sections were further washed in PBS, mounted, and coverslipped with Fluorsave mounting medium (Millipore). The primary antibodies used for this study were as follows: rabbit polyclonal anti-somatostatin-14 (1:500; Peninsula Laboratories), mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN (1:500; Millipore; MAB377), goat anti-ChaT (1:500, Chemicon), and chicken polyclonal anti-GFP (1:500; Aves Labs). DyLight488 donkey anti-chicken, Rhodamine Red-X donkey anti-rabbit, and Cy5 donkey anti-mouse conjugated secondary antibodies (1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used to detect primary antibodies. Slides were observed under an AxioCam2 Zeiss fluorescent microscope connected with AxioVision acquisition software or under a LSM510 Zeiss confocal microscope with Zen software (Carl Zeiss). Images were acquired, exported in TIFF files, and arranged to prepare final figures in Zen software (Carl Zeiss) and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In vitro electrophysiology</title><p>Neonatal mice (P0-5) of either sex were anesthetized with isoflurane.

Inspiratory-related motor output was recorded from the hypoglossal nerve (XII) using a suction electrode and a differential AC amplifier (AM systems), filtered at 2–4 kHz, integrated, and digitized at 10 kHz. Whole-cell recordings were made using a MultiClamp 700 A (Molecular Devices), filtered at 2–4 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz. Borosilicate glass recording electrodes (G150-4, Warner Instruments) had tip resistances of 4–8 MΩ and were filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM): 140 potassium gluconate, 10 HEPES, 5 NaCl, 1.1 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, and 0.1 CaCl<sub>2</sub> (~305 mOsm; pH 7.3). In two-photon imaging experiments, field potentials were recorded from the contralateral preBötC, using an extracellular electrode and a differential AC amplifier (AM systems), filtered at 2–4 kHz, integrated, and digitized at 10 kHz. Digitized data were analyzed offline using custom procedures written for IgorPro (Wavemetrics). Agonists were bath applied at the specified concentrations while monitoring field potentials and XII output.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Two-photon calcium imaging</title><p>Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was imaged using a multi-photon resonant scanner (3i) and a microscope equipped with a water immersion 20 x, 1.0 objective.

For one-way RM ANOVAs, post hoc significance for pairwise comparisons was analyzed using the Holm-Sidak method. Significance was set at p&lt;0.05.

A sigh is a spontaneous inspiratory effort that results in significantly increased inspiratory tidal volume, typically two to five times compared to normal breaths. Under anesthesia in mice, sighs in vivo can take multiple shapes. The most common shape is partial doublet, a biphasic double-sized breath with an initial phase that is identical to a normal breath (eupnea) and a later high-amplitude inspiration, coincident with a biphasic genioglossus<sub>EMG</sub> (GG<sub>EMG</sub>) event (left). An in vivo sigh in mice can also present as one large breath, a monophasic augmented inspiration that has two to five times the volume of a normal breath, coincident with a monophasic GG<sub>EMG</sub> event (middle); or a double-peaked breath (doublets) with the first breath immediately followed by a similar amplitude second breath (right). (<bold>b</bold>) Raw and expanded traces show three types of shape observed in one mouse. (<bold>c</bold>) Sigh shapes are related to basal breathing frequency (45 spontaneous sighs from 3 mice). Different sigh shapes represent a continuum from ‘augmented breath’ on one side of the spectrum to ‘doublet’ on the other. Exact shape appears to be related to basal breathing frequency, with augmented breaths and occasional partial doublets exhibited during conditions with high basal respiratory rate/low amplitude; while doublets and partial doublets occur mostly with low basal respiratory rate/high amplitude. The latter is similar to conditions of vagotomy and in vitro, where breathing <italic>f</italic> is substantially reduced, and during which sighs often appeared as doublets.

The authors generate multiple transgenic lines that enable selective targeting of these various sub-populations of cells and demonstrate the sufficiency of each type in generating a sigh breath. Additionally, they show that NMBR and GPRP preBötC neurons are glutamatergic, have overlapping and distinct expression, and do not express SST. Beyond this validation, the authors show that ectopic stimulation of SST neurons is sufficient to evoke sighs and that they are necessary for NMB/GRP induced sighing. This data is the first time that preBötC neurons downstream of NMBR/GRPR neurons have been identified that transform a eupneic breath into a sign breath. The five conclusions stated at the end of the introduction are supported by the data.</p><p>Summary of a primary weakness: A strong emphasis throughout the manuscript is the identification of an unsubstantiated slow sigh rhythm that is produced by NMBR/GRPR neurons. It is even suggested that this is an intrinsic property of these neurons. However, to make such a novel (and quite surprising) claim requires many more studies and the conclusion is dependent on how the authors have defined a sigh. Moreover, some data within the paper conflicts with this idea. The resubmitted manuscript does not contain any revisions and the rebuttal does not sufficiently address the critiques.</p><p>In summary, the optogenetic and chemogenetic characterization of the neuropeptide pathway transgenic lines nicely aligns with and provides important validation of the previous study by Li et. al., 2016 and the SST neuron studies provide a new mechanism for the transformation of NMBR/GRPR neuropeptide activation into a sigh. These are important findings, and they should be the points emphasized. The proposal of a slow sigh rhythm should be more rigorously established with new experiments and analysis or should be more carefully described and discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100192.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This study investigates in mice neural mechanisms generating sighs, which are periodic large-amplitude breaths occurring during normal breathing that subserve physiological pulmonary functions and are associated with emotional states such as relief, stress, and anxiety. Sighs are generated by a structure called the preBötzinger complex (preBötC) in the medulla oblongata that generates various forms of inspiratory activity including sighs. The authors have previously described a circuit involving neurons producing bombesin-related peptides Neuromedin B (NMB) and gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) that project to preBötC neurons expressing receptors for NMB (NMBRs) and GRP (GRPRs) and that activation of these preBötC neurons via these peptide receptors generates sighs. In this study the authors further investigated mechanisms of sigh generation by applying optogenetic and chemogenetic strategies to selectively activate the subpopulations of preBötC neurons expressing NMBRs and/or GRPRs, and a separate subpopulation of neurons expressing somatostatin (SST) but not NMBRs and GRPRs. The authors present convincing evidence that sigh-like inspirations can be evoked by photostimulation of the preBötC neurons expressing NMBRs or GRPRs. Photostimulation of SST neurons can independently evoke sighs, and chemogenetic inhibition of these neurons can abolish sighs. The results presented support the authors' conclusion that the preBötC neurons expressing NMBRs or GRPRs produce sighs via pathways to downstream SST neurons. Thus, these studies have identified some of the preBötC cellular elements likely involved in generating sighs.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) This study employs an effective combination of electrophysiological, transgenic, optogenetic, chemogenetic, pharmacological, and neuron activity imaging techniques to investigate sigh generation by distinct subpopulations of preBötC neurons in mice.</p><p>(2) The authors extend previous studies indicating that there is a peptidergic circuit consisting of NMB and GRP expressing neurons that project from the parafacial (pF) nucleus region to the preBötC and provides sufficient input to generate sighs, since photoactivation of either pF NMB or GRP neurons evoke ectopic sighs in this study.</p><p>(3) Solid evidence is presented that sighs can be evoked by direct photostimulation of preBötC neurons expressing NMBRs and/or GRPRs, and also a separate subpopulation of neurons expressing somatostatin (SST) but not NMBRs and GRPRs.</p><p>(4) The mRNA-expression data presented from in situ hybridization indicates that most preBötC neurons expressing NMBR, GRPR (or both) are glutamatergic and excitatory.</p><p>(5) Measurements in slices in vitro indicate that only the NMBR expressing neurons are normally rhythmically active during normal inspiratory activity and endogenous sigh activity.</p><p>(6) Evidence is presented that activation of preBötC NMBRs and/or GRPRs is not necessary for sigh production, suggesting that sighs are not the unique product of the preBötC bombesin-peptide signaling pathway.</p><p>(7) The novel conclusion is presented that the preBötC neurons expressing NMBRs and/or GRPRs produce sighs via the separate downstream population of preBötC SST neurons, which the authors demonstrate can independently generate sighs, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of preBötC SST neurons selectively abolishes sighs generated by activating NMBRs and GRPRs.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) While these studies have identified subpopulations of preBötC neurons capable of episodically evoking sigh-like inspiratory activity, mechanisms producing the normal slow sigh rhythm were not investigated and remain unknown.</p><p>(2) The authors have addressed some of the reviewers' main technical concerns and issues relating to interpretation of the results in their rebuttal letter, but have minimally revised the manuscript.

This is an important and interesting topic, as sighing maintains normal pulmonary function and is associated with various emotional conditions. However, the mechanisms of its generation remain not fully understood. The authors employed different approaches, including optogenetics, chemogenetics, intersectional genetic approach, and slice electrophysiology and calcium imaging, to address the question, and found several neuronal populations are sufficient to induce sighing when activated. Furthermore, ectopic sighs can be triggered without the involvement of neuromedin B (NMB) or gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) or their receptors in the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) region of the brainstem. Additionally, activating SST neurons in the preBötC region induces sighing, even when other receptors are blocked. Based on these results, the authors concluded that increased excitability in certain neurons (NMBR or GRPR neurons) activates pathways leading to sigh generation, with SST neurons serving as a downstream component in converting regular breaths into sighs.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors employed a combination of various sophisticated approaches, including optogenetics, chemogenetics, intersectional genetic approach, and slice electrophysiology and calcium imaging, to precisely pinpoint the mechanism responsible for sigh generation. They utilized multiple genetically modified mouse lines, enabling them to selectively manipulate and observe specific neuronal populations involved in sighing.</p><p>Using genetics and calcium imaging, the authors record the neuronal activity of NMBR and GRPR neurons, respectively, and identified their difference in activity pattern. Furthermore, by applying the intersectional approach, the authors were able to genetically target and manipulate several distinct neuronal populations, such as NMBR+, GRPR- neurons and GRPR+, NMBR- neurons, and conducted a detailed characterization of their functions in influencing sighing.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The authors employed two conditions for optogenetic activation: long pulse photostimulation (LPP) and short pulse photostimulation (SPP), with durations ranging from 4-10s for LPP and 100-500 ms for SPP. These could generate huge variability in the experiments. The rationale behind the selection of these conditions in each experiment remains unclear in the manuscript. Additionally, it is not explained why these specific durations were chosen. Furthermore, the interpretation for the varied responses observed under these conditions is not provided. Clarification on the rationale and interpretation of these experimental parameters would enhance the understanding of the results. The description of the experiment conditions should be consistent throughout the manuscript.</p><p>(2) Regarding the fiber optics, my understanding is that they are placed outside of the brainstem from the ventral side. Given the locations of the pF and preBötC neurons, could the differences in responses be attributed to the varying distances of each population from the ventral surface? In fact, in Figure 8, NMBR is illustrated as being closer to the ventral surface. Does it represent the actual location of these neurons?</p><p>(3) The results of recording on NMBR neurons in Figure 4 were compelling. However, I'm curious why the recording of GRPR neurons and their response to the neuropeptide were not presented or examined. Additionally, considering the known cross-reaction between peptides and their receptors, it might be worthwhile to investigate how GRP modulates NMBR neurons and how NMB modulates GRPR neurons.</p><p>(4) The authors found that activation of several preBötC populations, including NMBR, GRPR, and SST neurons, despite pharmacological inhibition of NMBR and GRPR, can still induce sighing, and concluded that &quot;activation of preBötC NMBRs and/or GRPRs is not necessary for sigh production&quot;. I disagree with this conclusion. Even when the receptors are silenced, artificial (optogenetic or chemogenetic) activation could still activate the same downstream pathways. This cannot be used as evidence to claim that the receptors are not required for sighing in vivo, because it is possible that the receptors are still necessary for the activation of these neurons under natural conditions. For instance, while diaphragm activation induces breathing, it does not negate the crucial role of the nervous system in regulating this process in physiological conditions.</p><p>(5) The authors noted varied responses upon activating specific subpopulations of the preBötC neurons, namely NMBR, GRPR, and SST neurons. Could these differences be attributed to variations in viral labeling efficiency among different mouse genetic lines? Are there discrepancies in the number of labeled neurons across the lines? Additionally, the authors did not thoroughly characterize the specificities of AAV targeting in their Cre and Flp lines. It's uncertain whether the AAV-labeled neurons are strictly restricted to the designated population without notable leakage into other populations. This is particularly crucial for the experiments manipulating SST neurons. If there's substantial labeling of NMBR or GRPR neurons, it could undermine the conclusions drawn. Further examination of the precision and selectivity of the labeling techniques is necessary to ensure the accurate interpretation of the experimental findings.</p><p>(6) The authors have addressed some of the reviewers' concerns in the revision; however, many important issues remain unaddressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100192.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Chengdu Medical College</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bondarenko</surname><given-names>Evgeny</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Los Angeles</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Los Angeles</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Thörn Perez</surname><given-names>Carolina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Salk Institute for Biological Studies</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Diego</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chiu</surname><given-names>Delia N</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>European Neuroscience Institute Göttingen</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Göttingen</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Feldman</surname><given-names>Jack L</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Los Angeles</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Los Angeles</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) Reviewer 3: Moreover, the conclusion that preBötC NMBR and GRPR activations are unnecessary for sighing is not fully supported by the current experimental design. While the study shows that sighing can still be induced despite pharmacological inhibition of NMBR and GRPR, this does not conclusively prove that these receptors are not required under natural conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We concluded that “NMBR and GRPR receptors are not necessary for sigh generation”. We acknowledge that under normal conditions these receptors almost certainly play a role; in fact, microinjection of saporin conjugated to bombesin, which presumably ablates NMBR<sup>+</sup> and GRPR<sup>+</sup> preBötC neurons, completely eliminated endogenous sighing activity in awake mice (Li et al., Nature, 2015). However, that study did not establish that the receptors <italic>per se</italic> are essential in this context, since the protocol ablated not just the receptors but also the preBötC neurons that happened to express these receptors. Here, we show that we could evoke sighs AFTER complete pharmacological blockade of NMBRs <italic>and</italic> GRPRs. Also, we show that sighs can be elicited by stimulation of a distinct subpopulation of preBötC neurons expressing the peptide somatostatin (SST<sup>+</sup>). These results demonstrate that sighs can be evoked in absence of activation of NMBRs and/or GRPRs, leading to the conclusion that NMBRs and/or GRPRs are not required for sighs but rather contribute to periodic sigh generation under normal conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Reviewer 1: To make such a novel (and quite surprising) claim requires many more studies and the conclusion is dependent on how the authors have defined a sigh. Moreover, some data within the paper conflicts with this idea.</p></disp-quote><p>Our definition of sighs was carefully chosen so that it applied across different experimental conditions, including in vitro slices, anesthetized or awake in vivo. We defined sighs as transient changes in minute ventilation on a time scale slower than eupneic breathing period, to avoid classifying breathing after vagotomy or under isoflurane anesthesia as “all-sigh breathing”. This is why induction of persistent large amplitude breaths (such as in Figures 5-6) were not counted as sighs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Reviewer 2: Several key technical aspects of the study require further clarification to aid in interpreting the experimental results, including issues relating to the validation of the transgenic mouse lines and virally transduced expressions of proteins utilized for optogenetic and chemogenetic experiments, as well as justifying the optogenetic photostimulation paradigms used to evoke sighs.</p></disp-quote><p>The rationale for using SPP and LPP stems from our published observations of the effects of optogenetic stimulation of various preBötC neuronal subpopulations. Thus, SPP and LPP evoke the same responses in GlyT2 (Sherman et al., 2015) and Dbx1 (Cui et al., 2016) neurons, while for other subpopulations, e.g., SST (Cui et al., 2015), the effects of SPP are markedly different from LPP. Hence, in this study we examined both. As effects of SPP and LPP of SST neurons were examined previously (Cui et al., 2016), these protocols were not repeated except for evoking sighs after blockade of NMBR/GRPRs. SPP of pF NMB or GRP did not evoke any respiratory responses and hence were not presented in any figures (see Results, section “Activation of Nmb- or Grp-expressing pF neurons induces sighs”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Reviewer 3: however, the rationale and experimental details require further explanation, and their impacts on the conclusion require clarification. For instance, how and why the variability in optogenetic activation conditions could impact the experimental outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>Refractory periods reported here for pF NMB, pF GRP, preBötC NMBR and preBötC GRPR were all obtained using the same intensity LPP. We acknowledge the possibility, even the likelihood that higher intensity LPP would shorten refractory periods. In line with this, we observed that ectopic sighs were evoked earlier during the LPP as the sigh phase progressed. As described in RESULTS, such effects were observed for pF NMB, pF GRP, preBötC NMBR and preBötC GRPR only and not for preBötC SST, which might suggest that timing of intrinsically generated sighs depends on the NMB-GRP signaling pathway, yet sigh production depends on the SST pathway.</p></body></sub-article></article>
