pathologies like cerebral amyloid angiopathy and dementia. Despite their relevance for disease progression, microinfarcts often remain undetected and the smallest scale of blood flow disturbance has not yet been identified. We employed blood flow simulations in realistic microvascular networks from the mouse cortex to quantify the impact of single-capillary occlusions. Our simulations reveal that the severity of a microstroke is strongly affected by the local vascular topology and the baseline flow rate in the occluded capillary. The largest changes in perfusion are observed in capillaries with two inflows and two outflows. This specific topological configuration only occurs with a frequency of 8%. The majority of capillaries have one inflow and one outflow and is likely designed to efficiently supply oxygen and nutrients. Taken together, microstrokes bear potential to induce a cascade of local disturbances in the surrounding tissue, which might accumulate and impair energy supply locally.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>A blockage in one of the tiny blood vessels or capillaries of the brain causes a ‘microstroke’. Microstrokes do not cause the same level of damage as a major stroke, which is caused by a blockage in a larger blood vessel that completely cuts off oxygen to a part of the brain for a period. But microstrokes do increase the risk of developing conditions like dementia – including Alzheimer’s disease – later in life.</p><p>People with these neurodegenerative conditions have fewer capillaries in their brains. The capillaries make up a mesh-like network of millions of vessels that supply most of the energy and oxygen to the brain. Repeated microstrokes may contribute to progressive loss of capillaries over time. Reduced numbers of capillaries may increase memory loss and other brain difficulties.</p><p>To better understand how microstrokes affect blood flow in the brain, Schmid et al. created a computer model to simulate blood flow in capillaries in the mouse brain. Then, they modeled what happens to the blood flow when one capillary is blocked. The experiments showed that the configuration of the blocked capillary determines how much blood flow in neighboring capillaries changes. Blockages in capillaries with two vessels feeding in and two vessels feeding out caused the greatest blood flow disturbances. But these 2-in-2-out vessels only make up about 8% of all brain capillaries. Blockages in capillaries with different configurations with respect to feeding vessels had less effect.</p><p>The experiments suggest that most microstrokes have limited effects on blood flow on the scale of the entire brain because of redundancies in the capillary network in the brain. However, the ability of the capillary network to adapt and reroute blood flow in response to small blockages may decrease with aging. Over time, ministrokes in a single capillary may set off a chain reaction of disturbed blood flow and more blockages. This may decrease energy and oxygen supplies explaining age- and disease-related brain decline. Better understanding the effects of microstrokes on blood flow may help scientists develop new ways to prevent such declines.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stroke</kwd><kwd>blood flow</kwd><kwd>capillary</kwd><kwd>microvasculature</kwd><kwd>occlusion</kwd><kwd>energy supply</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006447</institution-id><institution>University of Zurich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FK-19-045</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmid</surname><given-names>Franca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 - Research and Innovation Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>720270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmid</surname><given-names>Franca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 - Research and Innovation Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>785907</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmid</surname><given-names>Franca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_182703</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weber</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SNF CR23I2_166707</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jenny</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name><name><surname>Weber</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The number of inflows and outflows at the occluded capillary governs the local flow reduction, and the different topological configurations are probably designed for distinct functional tasks.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As the brain’s energy storage is limited, a sustained supply of oxygen and nutrients is crucial to avoid local tissue damage. Accordingly, flow disturbances even at the level of individual vessels can result in cortical tissue lesions, so called microinfarcts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nishimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shih et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Summers et al., 2017</xref>). In recent decades, it has become evident that such microinfarcts are linked to various pathologies, for example cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Veluw et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shih et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pétrault et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Veluw et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). Depending on the severity of flow disturbance, the dimension of documented microinfarcts ranges between 50 µm to a few millimeters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shih et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Summers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shih et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Veluw et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brundel et al., 2012</xref>). This small size renders the quantification of the brain’s microinfarct burden challenging and makes it difficult to gain insights on their role for local blood supply.</p><p>Animal models allow a more refined study of the etiology of microinfarcts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shih et al., 2018</xref>). By occluding vessels via photothrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nishimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shih et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Summers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Underly et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishimura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nishimura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Enright et al., 2007</xref>) or by injecting microemboli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nozari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Silasi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lam et al., 2010</xref>), microstrokes can be induced and their impact on blood flow and on the surrounding tissue can be studied. Here, most studies focus on the occlusion of penetrating vessels, which because of their one-dimensional topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmid et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duvernoy et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blinder et al., 2013</xref>) have been identified as the ‘bottleneck of perfusion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nishimura et al., 2007</xref>). Less attention has been given to occlusions of descending arteriole (DA) offshoots and capillaries.</p><p>While the occlusion of DA offshoots causes a maximal infarct volume of 0.8 nl (275 times smaller than for DA occlusions), no tissue damage could be detected for the occlusion of capillaries &gt; 2 branches apart from the DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shih et al., 2013</xref>). However, the effect of anesthesia on these results remains unknown. This is because anesthesia can act as a vasodilator and tends to increase red blood cell (RBC) flux and tissue oxygenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roche et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, it has also been shown that single-capillary occlusion causes flow reversals and RBC speed reductions of up to 90% in the vessels downstream of the occluded capillary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishimura et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, singlecapillary occlusion can induce the formation and alter the morphology of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), which are related to AD and CAA. Taken together, even if single-capillary occlusion might not directly cause local tissue damage, it disturbs blood flow locally and might impair tissue clearance. As such, single-capillary occlusions could play an important role in the development and progression of larger disturbances and pathologies.</p><p>Further studies have investigated the effect of simultaneously occluding multiple capillaries or multiple microvessels of larger caliber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Underly et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lam et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Underly et al., 2017</xref> showed that the occlusion of ~10 proximal capillaries via photothrombosis leads to deterioration of the blood brain barrier (BBB). The accumulation of occluded capillaries can also influence the total perfusion of the cortical vasculature. In a simulation study related to in vivo investigations in an AD mouse model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cruz Hernández et al., 2019</xref> showed that with 2% of capillaries stalled, cortical cerebral blood flow is reduced by ~5%. Capillary stalls have also been identified as an important factor for incomplete reperfusion after stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El Amki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erdener et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>These aspects underline the need for an in-depth quantification of blood flow changes in response to single-capillary occlusion, which will allow us to better understand the role of these small disturbances on local tissue perfusion. We will identify factors influencing the severity of micro-occlusions and quantify the area of impact. Additionally, by looking at the smallest possible scale of occlusion, valuable insights on the robustness of perfusion within the capillary bed can be gained and our knowledge of topological characteristics of cortical capillary beds can be extended. In this context, we will also analyze the arrangement of arteriole- and venule-sided capillaries. Moreover, identifying the smallest scale of disturbance is a prerequisite for the correct interpretation of disturbances and changes observed on a larger scale.</p><p>To address these questions, we employed blood flow simulations in realistic microvascular networks (MVNs) from the mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blinder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmid et al., 2019b</xref>), in which individual capillaries have been occluded. Using an in silico approach comes with several advantages. First of all, it is challenging to monitor blood flow changes in vivo with single vessel resolution in multiple vessels or even entire vascular networks simultaneously. This problem is even more pronounced, if the focus is on blood flow changes in the capillary bed, which is highly interconnected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmid et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blinder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lauwers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hirsch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith et al., 2019</xref>) and in which the flow field is highly heterogeneous and fluctuating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmid et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kleinfeld et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Villringer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guibert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parpaleix et al., 2013</xref>). Secondly, in silico studies allow us to investigate the impact of single-capillary occlusions in an isolated manner. This is in contrast to in vivo analyses, where a capillary occlusion will always be accompanied by a response from directly neighboring cells (e.g. endothelial cells, mural cells, microglia).</p><p>By studying flow changes in response to the occlusion of 167 different capillaries, we reveal that the severity of a microstroke strongly depends on the local vascular topology and the baseline flow rate in the occluded capillary. More precisely, in the worst-case scenario, the flow rate dropped by as much as 70% in the direct vicinity of the occluded capillary. As well as this, a microstroke locally reduces the number of available flow paths between DAs and ascending venules (AVs). This aspect might play an important role for the upregulation of blood flow during neural activation, since the ability of the microvasculature to adapt to local changes in energy demand might be impaired in the disturbed flow field. The fact that the worst-case scenario only occurs with a frequency of 8% across all capillaries and the re-routing of blood to neighboring vessels suggests that the capillary bed offers an inherent robustness toward single-capillary occlusions. These aspects as well as compensatory oxygen supply from neighboring capillaries likely help to avoid severe hypoxic conditions in response to single-capillary occlusion. Our results further indicate that the different vascular topologies are not only relevant for the severity of the microstroke, but that they might in fact fulfill distinct functional tasks. We postulate that there is a topological difference between capillaries responsible for the distribution of blood and capillaries responsible for supplying oxygen and nutrients to the cortical tissue.</p><p>In summary, our work provides an in-depth quantification of flow changes in response to single-capillary occlusions and reveals novel topological characteristics of the cortical microvasculature. Our results give valuable insights into the role of microinfarcts, which are relevant for future in vivo studies on the robustness of oxygen and nutrient supply and on pathological flow disturbances.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The following results are based on time-averaged blood flow simulations in realistic MVNs embedded in a tissue volume of 1.6 mm<sup>3</sup> (MVN1) and 2.2 mm<sup>3</sup> (MVN2).

In contrast for the <italic>best-case scenario</italic>, that is MSCs with a divergent bifurcation upstream and convergent bifurcation downstream (<italic>1-in-1-out</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,h</xref>), the median relative change is ~15% at generation ±2 (p&lt;0.001 at generation ±2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). The differences between <italic>2-in-2-out</italic> and <italic>1-in-1-out</italic> are even more pronounced for vessels of generation ±1.

This is plausible because from a fluid dynamical point of view, there are only two possible outcomes for a <italic>2-in-2-out</italic> occlusion. The first is the observed flow reversal at generation ±1. The second would be the complete cessation of flow in generation ±1, which would lead to a larger infarct volume and thus would increase the severity of the microstroke. The cessation of flow in generation ±1 has only been observed for a small number of MSCs of type <italic>2-in-2-out</italic>, <italic>2-in-1-out</italic> or <italic>1-in-2-out</italic>. For some of these scenarios, a very specific topology was identified at generation ±1, where the two generation ±1 vessels are connected to the same generation ±2 vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). We conclude that the cessation of flow in vessels adjacent to the MSC is rare and that the less severe flow reversal is more common.

Here, for all volume factors, the median inflow difference is smaller than 2.5%.</p><p>Importantly, the resulting inflow reduction in the analysis box is also affected by the topological connectivity around the MSC and the redistribution of flow in response to a microstroke. These aspects become apparent if we compare the relative flow changes in vessels with different topological positions with respect to the MSC. We discern three topological positions: (1) vessels that are directly upstream and downstream of the MSC, (2) vessels that run parallel to the MSC, and (3) vessels that do not belong to the first two categories, that is distant vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>, Materials and methods).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref> shows that for up to a volume factor of 2, more than 50% of the vessels in the analysis box are directly upstream or downstream of the MSC. In these vessels, we had a significant flow reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). In contrast, in the vessels that run parallel to the MSC, we observed an increase in flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). This clearly indicates that during a microstroke the flow is redistributed to pathways parallel to the MSC. However, only ~15–20% of all capillaries in the analysis box are parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>), and consequently, we still observed an overall flow reduction in the analysis box. In the third vessel category, the distant vessels, the median relative flow difference is &lt;2% for all volume factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). This result confirms that the impact of a microstroke is most pronounced in vessels that are directly connected to the MSC.</p><p>Worthy of note is that for a tissue volume of 0.4 nl (i.e. volume factor = 2) ~50% of vessels in the analysis box are distant and parallel capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–d</xref>). This topological configuration might be beneficial for the robustness of perfusion of the tissue volume around the MSC. Because even if the total inflow decreases in the tissue volume around the MSC, there is always a fraction of vessels within the analysis box that are not significantly affected by the microstroke (distant vessels) or that experience an increase in flow in response to the microstroke (parallel vessels). Therewith, an even larger drop in overall perfusion can be avoided and a minimum remaining perfusion can be ensured. This likely is beneficial to avoid a significant drop in oxygen partial pressure (pO2) in the tissue around the MSC.</p><p>The most relevant hemodynamic quantity for local pO2 is the RBC flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lücker et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, in addition to investigating changes in flow, we repeated our analyses for changes in RBC flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). As RBC flux and flow rate are related the general trends are comparable for both quantities. Interestingly, the reduction in RBC flux in the analysis box around the MSC is larger than for the flow rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c,d</xref>). This indicates that a single-capillary occlusion also affects the distribution of RBCs, which might further increase the risk of local tissue hypoxia. As our study is limited to changes in perfusion within the vasculature, further investigations resolving oxygen transport within the tissue are necessary to answer the question if a single-capillary occlusion significantly affects local tissue pO2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The baseline MSC flow rate increases the area of impact of a microstroke</title><p>Our results demonstrate that the local vascular topology plays a crucial role in the severity of a microstroke. To identify further structural and functional characteristics relevant to the level of flow change in response to microstroke, we repeated our analysis for eight additional cases.

However, no significant two-way interaction between baseline flow rate category and generation and no main effect of the baseline flow rate could be detected (likely because the relative changes do not differ at generations ±1 and ±2). The impact of the baseline flow rate on the changes in the vicinity of the MSC is further supported by the analysis of the total inflow change into the analysis box around the MSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3c–d</xref>), where we found a significant main effect of the baseline flow rate on the relative inflow change (F(1,45) = 13.97, p&lt;0.001, two-way mixed ANOVA).

Regarding the analysis over cortical depth, it is important to note that the baseline flow rate of the chosen MSC has to be between 0.1 and 7.0 µm<sup>3</sup>/ms. This selection criterion might cancel out the potential effects of the decrease in flow rate over depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guibert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">El-Bouri and Payne, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2019</xref>). We observed a significant effect of the position of the MSC along the capillary path for inflow changes in the analysis box around the MSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5c–d</xref>). We hypothesize that these differences are affected by the relative frequency of upstream and downstream, parallel, and distant capillaries in the analysis box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1g–h</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Multi-capillary occlusions</title><p>Our results show that single-capillary occlusion affects the flow rate in multiple capillaries in the direct vicinity of the MSC.

To investigate the impact of an accumulation of capillary occlusions around the MSC, we performed simulations in which three, five, seven, and nine capillaries have been occluded in the analysis box around the MSC with a volume of 0.3 nl (volume factor = 1.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

While the two-way interaction between number of occluded capillaries and volume factor is not significant (F(4.92,30.7) = 1.06, p=0.4), there is a statistical significant main effect of the number of occluded capillaries and the volume factor on the relative flow difference (number of occluded capillaries: F(4,25) = 3.52, p=0.021, volume factor: F(1.23,30.7) = 100.3, p&lt;0.001, two-way mixed ANOVA).

This is most apparent for the occlusion of nine capillaries, where we observed a flow decrease of ~20% in an analysis box 1.6 nl (volume factor = 8). To further analyze the perfusion changes within the analysis box, we counted the number of vessels with a flow decrease within the analysis box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The number of vessels with a flow decrease increased with the volume factor, which underlines that the capillary occlusions also affect the perfusion in neighboring vessels. Interestingly, the number of vessels with flow decrease is smaller if more capillaries are occluded. This indicates that single-capillary occlusion causes a small flow reduction in a larger number of capillaries. In contrast, if multiple proximal capillaries are occluded a re-routing of flow occurred and a smaller number of vessels experienced a flow decrease. This is consistent with the observations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g–i</xref>, where we describe a flow increase in vessels parallel to the MSC and shows how the perfusion in the capillary bed adapts to local disturbances of increasing severity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The minimum distance between an arteriole-sided and a venule-sided capillary point is on average 44 µm</title><p>It is well established that pO2 in capillaries shortly downstream of DAs is higher than in capillaries just upstream of AVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>).

While <italic>2-in-2-out</italic> capillaries might be more relevant for distributing blood in the cortical microvasculature, <italic>1-in-1-out</italic> capillaries are likely designed to robustly deliver oxygen and nutrients to the cortical tissue. This hypothesis is strengthened by the number of unique paths going from DA to AV through the different MSC types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5j–k</xref>, Materials and methods). While for <italic>1-in-1-out</italic> we only have 37 (MVN1) and 15 (MVN2) unique paths connecting DA and AV, for <italic>2-in-2-out</italic>, we have 297 (MVN1) and 115 (MVN2) unique paths. Generally, the described trends are consistent for MVN1 and MVN2. However, it is noteworthy that the overall average flow rate is larger in MVN2 and the number of paths per vessel is larger in MVN1. The latter is likely caused by a higher density of penetrating vessels in MVN2, which reduces the number of highly interconnected flow paths through the capillary bed.</p><p>Subsequently, we asked whether the frequency of MSC types varied over cortical depth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>) or along the pathway between DA and AV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d–k</xref>). The latter investigation was performed by analyzing the frequency of occurrence of the four MSC types for different <italic>AV-factors</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).

This is plausible because at the arterial end blood is distributed to the capillary bed, while it is re-collected close to the AVs. No significant differences could be observed for the distribution of <italic>1-in-1-out</italic> and <italic>2-in-2-out</italic> capillaries along the capillary path. Notably, 93% (MVN1) and 64% (MVN2) of all paths between DA and AV contain each MSC type at least once.

Our results show that in response to a microstroke new <italic>DA-AV-endpoint-pairs</italic> have been connected and existing <italic>DA-AV-endpoint-pairs</italic> have been lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). However, with respect to the total number of <italic>DA-AV-endpoint-pairs,</italic> these changes are small (~0.2%). As such, our results suggest that single-capillary occlusion and the occlusion of up to nine proximal capillaries do not reduce the overall number of flow paths and the number of unique <italic>DA-AV-endpoint-pairs</italic> in MVN1.</p><p>To investigate changes in flow paths in the vicinity of the MSC, we count the number of paths going through a predefined capillary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>) and analyzed the change in the number of unique flow paths going through: (1) capillaries upstream and downstream of the MSC (up to generation 3), (2) parallel to the MSC, and (3) distant to the MSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, Materials and methods). Based on the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g–i</xref>, where we detected an increased flow in the parallel vessels, we expected to see an increase in the number of paths going through the parallel vessels. However, no consistent trend could be observed for the three different vessel categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d</xref>). This suggests that an increase in flow does not necessarily cause an increase in the number of flow paths through the respective capillary.</p><p>In our last analysis, we examined the number of possible flow paths between given <italic>DA-AV-endpoint-pairs</italic>. Therefore, the <italic>DA-AV-endpoint-pair</italic>s are assigned to two categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, Materials and methods): (1) before stroke there is at least one path that leads from the DA to the AV end point through the MSC and (2) none of the paths between the given <italic>DA-AV-endpoint-pair</italic> go through the MSC. For <italic>DA-AV-endpoint-pairs</italic> of category 1, we note a decrease in the number of available flow paths between the respective <italic>DA-AV-endpoint-pairs</italic> for all MSC types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). The mean ratio of unique flow paths before and after microstroke at the respective <italic>DA-AV-endpoint-pair</italic> is between 0.67 and 0.75. If more than five capillaries are occluded in the vicinity of the MSC, the relative frequency of <italic>DA-AV-endpoint-pairs</italic> with a decrease in available flow paths rises (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). Interestingly, the ratio of unique flow paths before and after microstroke is not affected by the number of occluded capillaries and remains at ~0.7. For the majority <italic>of DA-AV-endpoint-pairs</italic> of category 2, we do not observe a change in the number of unique flow path in response to single- or multi-capillary occlusion. Nonetheless, ~10% of <italic>DA-AV-endpoint-pairs</italic> of category 2 experience an increase or decrease in the number of connecting pathways, which underlines that the impact of capillary occlusion goes beyond directly connected vessels.</p><p>Taken together, the decrease in the number of pathways between <italic>DA-AV-endpoint-pairs</italic> of category 1 shows that a microstroke locally reduces the number of available paths. Based on the results shown in the preceding sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>), we suggest that the average flow rate likely increases along some of the remaining paths.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>By performing blood flow simulations in realistic MVNs for 167 of single-capillary occlusions, we show that the severity of a microstroke depends on the local vascular topology and on the baseline flow rate in the occluded capillary. The largest impact is observed if capillaries with two inflows and two outflows (<italic>2-in-2-out</italic>) are occluded. Here, a drop in flow rate &gt; 30% is still observed two generations away from the MSC. In contrast, flow rate changes remain below 25% for all capillaries at a MSC with a divergent bifurcation upstream and a convergent bifurcation downstream (<italic>1-in-1-out</italic>). In accordance, the occlusion of a <italic>2-in-2-out</italic> capillary reduces perfusion by 14% in a tissue volume of 0.2 nl. For the occlusion of a capillary with a more than three times higher baseline flow rate, a 14% drop in perfusion can still be observed for a tissue volume of 0.55 nl. Besides a local decrease in perfusion, single-capillary occlusion also causes a decrease in the number of available flow paths in the vicinity of the MSC.</p><p>Our observation that the severity of a microstroke is affected by the baseline flow rate of the occluded vessels is in agreement with previous in vivo and in silico observations for the occlusion of penetrating vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shih et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishimura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blinder et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishimura et al., 2006</xref> report an RBC velocity reduction in response to single-capillary occlusion of 93% and 55% in downstream vessels of generation 1–2 and 3–4, respectively. Although the in vivo velocity reductions are slightly higher, they generally compare well with our results for the occlusion of a <italic>2-in-2-out</italic> and a <italic>1-in-2-out</italic> MSC. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishimura et al., 2006</xref> do not observe flow reversals and velocity reductions in upstream and parallel vessels. These differences are likely due to the fact that many of the occluded vessels in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishimura et al., 2006</xref> are direct offshoots of the DA main branch. Due to significantly larger flow velocities in the DA main branch, velocity reductions and reversals upstream of the site of occlusion are not to be expected.</p><p>To be highlighted is that for all MSC types the effects of single-capillary occlusions are spatially constrained. To be more precise, no significant reduction in flow rate is visible five generations away from the MSC and in a tissue volume of 0.3 nl around the MSC the perfusion drops maximally by 10% for all MSC types. This is in contrast with the occlusion of DAs where the flow rate does not fully recover until the 10th downstream vessel and where the infarct volume is as large as 220 nl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nishimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shih et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blinder et al., 2013</xref>). For scenarios in which multiple proximal capillaries are occluded, the volume of the affected area increases and the local drop in perfusion is more severe.</p><p>As the supplied tissue volume of a <italic>1-in-1-out</italic> MSC is 0.055 nl, which is approximately 15 times smaller than the infarct volume observed for the occlusion of a DA offshoot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shih et al., 2013</xref>), we postulate that the occlusion of single-capillaries does not directly cause tissue damage. This hypothesis is in line with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shih et al., 2013</xref>. Nonetheless, our results show that single-capillary occlusion has a strong impact on the local flow field. As such, it seems plausible that the altered flow field is a possible mechanism by which to affect Aβ deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) or solute clearance via the perivascular space in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arbel-Ornath et al., 2013</xref>). The local disturbances in the flow field might increase the susceptibility for vessel ruptures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Veluw et al., 2021</xref>) or additional occlusions, which subsequently might further impede clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hawkes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carare et al., 2008</xref>) as well as oxygen and nutrient supply in an increasing area around the MSC.</p><p>For the occlusion of larger caliber vessels, it has been shown that proximal microinfarcts are likely to coalesce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shih et al., 2013</xref>) and that BBB leakage and intravascular platelet aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>), as well as deficits in neuronal activity and functional vasodynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Summers et al., 2017</xref>), are also observed beyond the microinfarct border. However, whether comparable effects can be triggered by the occlusion of a single-capillary remains unknown. Likewise, we do not know whether single-capillary occlusion induces local tissue hypoxia or if proximal vessels and increased gradients in tissue pO2 compensate for the lack of perfusion in the occluded capillary. Due to the dense capillary bed and the redistribution of flow to neighboring vessels, a single-capillary occlusion likely only causes hypoxic conditions if tissue pO2 is already low during baseline and if the oxygen saturation in proximal capillaries is too low to compensate for the drop in perfusion. Nonetheless, because of the significant impact on the flow field, single-capillary occlusions might lead to a local drop in tissue oxygenation and oxygen saturation within RBCs, which might provoke a cascade of consecutive responses in the affected tissue around the MSC or downstream of the occluded area.</p><p>Furthermore, the impact of a microstroke on tissue oxygenation can be affected by the level of oxygen within the occluded capillary and by the local arrangement of arteriole- and venule-side capillaries with respect to each other. We hypothesize that arteriole-sided capillaries with a high oxygen content might be distributed in a convenient fashion throughout the vasculature to enhance the robustness of oxygen delivery throughout the tissue. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nishimura et al., 2010</xref> provided supporting evidence for this hypothesis by showing that capillaries with varying topological distances to the DA can be in spatial proximity. However, further studies resolving oxygen partial pressure within capillaries in MVNs are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>The remaining unknowns clearly underline the need for an in-depth in vivo quantification of the impact of single-capillary occlusion. Based on our results, we suggest that the focus of future in vivo microstroke studies should be on tissue oxygenation, Aβ deposition and long-term changes in the vicinity of the MSC. In these investigations, it is important to keep in mind that the severity of the microstroke is affected by the local vascular topology and the baseline perfusion of the MSC. Consequently, care should be taken that effects are analyzed in an MSC-type-specific manner. In addition to in vivo approaches, in silico studies resolving oxygen discharge from individual RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lücker et al., 2015</xref>) are a convenient tool to improve our understanding of the impact of single-capillary occlusions on tissue oxygenation.</p><p>As previously stated, the severity of a microstroke depends on the local vascular topology. Worthy of note, we observe significant differences in the frequency and the characteristics of the local vascular topologies (MSC types). <italic>1-in-1-out</italic> is by far the most frequent MSC type and supplies the largest tissue volume. At the same time, it is characterized by having the smallest average flow rate and by containing the smallest number of unique paths connecting DAs and AVs. In contrast, <italic>2-in-2-out</italic> is the rarest MSC type and contains the largest number of flow paths connecting DAs and AVs. We postulate that MSC-type <italic>2-in-2-out</italic> is responsible for distributing blood within the capillary bed and that MSC-type <italic>1-in-1-out</italic> is designed to enable efficient oxygen and nutrient discharge to the tissue. In vivo evidence supporting this hypothesis is not yet available. Here, the first step would be to confirm the characteristics of the different MSC types in vivo and to subsequently study the role of these differences on oxygen and nutrient supply.</p><p>The frequency of <italic>2-in-2-out</italic> MSCs is low, and in a volume of 0.2 nl around the MSC, 27% of vessels show no flow decrease after a microstroke. These two features suggest that the capillary bed offers an inherent level of robustness toward single-capillary occlusion and they agree well with the reported highly interconnected nature of the capillary bed that allows efficient re-routing of blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmid et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blinder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lauwers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hirsch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cassot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lorthois and Cassot, 2010</xref>). Nonetheless, the significant differences between the characteristics of the MSC types raise further questions regarding the origin and the severity of microstrokes.</p><p>First of all, due to the larger supplied tissue volume, might the occlusion of a <italic>1-in-1-out</italic> MSC be more severe for oxygen and nutrient supply, while the occlusion of a <italic>2-in-2-out</italic> MSC has a larger impact on the flow field? Here, in vivo studies monitoring tissue oxygenation in response to capillary occlusion or combined blood flow and oxygen transport simulations could provide insights into the most critical MSC type for oxygen and nutrient supply. Secondly, Would a microstroke be more probable in a <italic>1-in-1-out</italic> MSC? This idea is based on the lower average flow rate in <italic>1-in-1-out</italic> MSCs, which implies that the vessel might be blocked more easily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erdener et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hartmann et al., 2021</xref>). However, to answer this question, we need to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that cause capillary occlusions. In healthy mice, stalls occur with a frequency &lt; 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cruz Hernández et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El Amki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erdener et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reeson et al., 2018</xref>). This number increases to 1.8% in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cruz Hernández et al., 2019</xref>) and to 30% in the core of the stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El Amki et al., 2020</xref>). For both pathological conditions, the majority of stalls are caused by neutrophils adhering to the vessel wall and occurred across all capillary diameters (~4–10 µm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cruz Hernández et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El Amki et al., 2020</xref>). Besides this aspect, no capillary phenotype could be identified in which stalls are more prominent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erdener et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reeson et al., 2018</xref>). Next to the phenotype of individual capillaries, the type of bifurcation might be an important factor for the likelihood of occlusion. For example, convergent bifurcations are likely more susceptible to blood particles getting stuck, which might cause an occlusion in capillaries up- and downstream of the bifurcation. However, if the origin of occlusions does not come from blocked particles but from plaque deposits or mural cell activity, then the situation is less clear and all MSC types are likely affected to similar extent.</p><p>Studying the effect of single-capillary occlusions in an isolated manner in our in silico model is advantageous on the one hand, but limitated on the other hand. For example, our simulation model does not account for dynamic responses of the vasculature. It has been shown that single DA occlusion induces a heterogeneous response in the capillary bed comprising capillary dilations and constrictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nishimura et al., 2010</xref>). Nonetheless, the in silico approach enables us to perform an in-depth study of fluid dynamical changes in response to single-capillary occlusion detached from external and internal influences. Moreover, our observations can be conveniently linked to the surrounding vascular topology. These insights can subsequently be used to distinguish changes observed in in vivo studies.</p><p>Taken together, we show that for 57% of all capillaries an occlusion significantly reduces the flow rate in the directly neighboring capillaries. Consequently, we conjecture that a single-capillary occlusion can be the starting point of a cascade of small consecutive disturbances, which might be relevant for the development of larger microinfarcts and for the progression of pathologies. In addition, we reveal novel features of the capillary bed, which are relevant for the robustness of perfusion and for advancing our understanding of topological characteristics of this highly interconnected network. Importantly, resolving the smallest scale of disturbance is not only essential to improve our understanding of microinfarct development, but might eventually offer novel possibilities for therapeutic treatment and prevention.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The presented results are based on a computational model to simulate blood flow in realistic MVNs.

For the penetrating vessels, that is DAs and AVs, we additionally differ between the main branch and the offshoot vessels. The vessel type is assigned by following the vessels from the cortical surface and by applying a diameter criterion which requests that two subsequent vessels have a diameter smaller than 6 µm in order to change the vessel type from DA to C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>). The equivalent criterion is applied on the venule side. To differentiate between the main branch of the penetrating vessels and the offshoots, we use a criterion that is based on the branching angle and the length of the resulting main branches. This approach ensures that short offshoots are not labeled as main branch.</p><p>To compute the pressure field and the blood flow rates in the realistic MVN, we employ the continuity equation at every node and Poiseuille’s law along the vessels. This approach is valid due to the small Reynolds numbers in the cortical microvasculature (Re &lt; 1.0 for all vessels).

In vessels with a diameter &lt; 10 µm, single file flow can be assumed, and consequently, we postulate that the RBC follows the path of the largest pressure force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmid et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fung, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yen and Fung, 1978</xref>). The unequal partitioning of RBCs at divergent bifurcations and their impact on the vessel resistance cause a fluctuating flow and pressure field. In the current study, we focus on the analysis of the time-averaged flow field of the statistical steady state. Our average is computed over 10 turnover times (15.4 s), where one turnover time is defined as the time until 85% of all vessels have been completely perfused at least once.</p><p>The pressure boundary conditions are assigned as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>. In brief, at the pial vessels, we make use of existing experimental data and assign a diameter-dependent pressure value. The pressure values at capillary in- and outlets are set based on the simulation results of the hierarchical boundary conditions approach. Here, the realistic MVN is implanted into a large artificial MVN. Subsequently, the flow and pressure field for a constant hematocrit is computed and the resulting pressure values are assigned as boundary conditions. The pressure boundary conditions are kept constant for each microstroke scenario.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Microstroke simulations</title><p>The microstroke simulations are performed in MVN1.

First for each venule-sided capillary, we computed the shortest distance to any vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) and to the closest arteriole-sided capillary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). For this analysis, each vessel is split into multiple discretization points, which are on average 1.3 µm apart and which are used to compute the shortest distance. Note that the <italic>AV-factor</italic> can only be assigned to capillaries along a flow path from DA to AV. Due to the finite size of our simulation domain, the <italic>AV-factor</italic> is only assigned to 60% and 63% of all capillaries in MVN1 and MVN2, respectively. In consequence, the calculated shortest distance to an arteriole-sided capillary might be slightly overestimated.</p><p>In the second investigation, an analysis sphere with a radius of 50 µm is moved along the discretization points of every venule-sided capillary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). All capillary points within these analysis spheres are identified and used to calculate the average <italic>AV-factor</italic> within the analysis spheres of the venule-sided capillary. To guarantee a representative analysis, only venule-sided capillaries are considered if at least 50% of all capillary points within the analysis spheres have been assigned an <italic>AV-factor</italic>.</p><p>For the third study on the distribution of <italic>AV-factors</italic> within the vascular network, we employ analysis cubes of varying size (side length 30–120 µm). For each cube size, the vascular network is discretized by the analysis cubes and the average <italic>AV-factor</italic> per analysis cube is computed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Here, an overlap of half the cube side length is used between neighboring analysis cubes. The analysis cube is only considered if it contains at least four capillaries with <italic>AV-factor</italic> and if at least 50% of the capillaries within the analysis cube could be assigned an <italic>AV-factor</italic>. The analysis cube with a side length of 30 µm contains on average 4.6 ± 0.9 (MVN1) and 4.7 ± 1.0 (MVN2) capillaries with <italic>AV-factor</italic>. For the analysis cube with a side length of 120 µm, we find 35.7 ± 8.9 (MVN1) and 51.0 ± 11.6 (MVN2) capillaries with <italic>AV-factor</italic> within the cube. This results in 7336 (MVN1) and 17,915 (MVN2) analysis cubes with a side length of 30 µm and in 1316 (MVN1) and 1700 (MVN2) analysis cubes for a side length of 120 µm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Computation of the topological supplied tissue volume</title><p>To comment on the infarct volume of a microstroke and for further topological studies, we compute the supplied tissue volume for each vessel. To do this, the tissue is discretized on a Cartesian grid, in which the realistic MVNs are embedded. One grid cell spans 4 × 4 × 4 µm<sup>3</sup>, which results in ~11.6 million grid cells for MVN1 and ~15.3 million grid cells for MVN2. Each cell center is assigned to the closest vessel. By summing over all cells assigned to one vessel, we obtain the topological supplied tissue volume per vessel. It is important to note that the topological and the effective supplied tissue volume can differ significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lücker et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lücker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lücker et al., 2018b</xref>). This is because of different oxygen levels along the capillary path. Consequently, for vessels with high oxygen levels, the effective supplied tissue volume is likely larger than the topological supplied tissue volume and vice versa. Nonetheless, we believe that the topological supplied tissue volume is a representative characteristic for the study of topology and perfusion-related aspects of the cortical microvasculature. Please note that for simplicity the topological supplied tissue volume is called supplied tissue volume throughout this manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Flow paths between DAs and AVs</title><p>Flow paths between the penetrating vessels are computed by following the flow from the DA to the AV.

The authors noted four different possible arrangements of flow into and out of a capillary segment and showed that there were differing impacts on flow in up and downstream vessels for capillary occlusions with these four different arrangements. The authors then calculated the prevalence of these different arrangements in the capillary network, and later interpret these arrangements as having functionally distinct roles of blood flow redistribution vs. oxygen/nutrient exchange. The authors further calculated perfusion changes in tissue volumes due to single capillary occlusions for these different arrangements. They then examined the impact of the baseline flow rate, the depth into the cortex, and the distance from large penetrating vessels for the topological arrangement where an occlusion had the most severe impact on perfusion. The authors concluded that obstruction of capillaries that had two vessels flowing in and two flowing out had the largest impact on perfusion and that only baseline flow rate was predictive of the volume that saw reduced perfusion after occlusion of a single capillary with this two in and two out arrangement. The degree of perfusion impact suggest that single capillary occlusions do not likely lead to significant local tissue hypoxia. Finally, the authors examine how the location of a single capillary occlusion impacts the number of arteriole to venule paths through the capillary network.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>General: There was a general consensus that to broaden the manuscripts appeal the authors should include a section on multiple micro-infarcts and transient stalls. The results, are somewhat narrow in scope, focusing on details of local flow rearrangements after single capillary occlusions and lacking a broader biological context or analysis of the impact of multiple occlusions (which is more relevant for disease states) that could make these findings of value to a broader scientific readership.</p><p>1. The number of cases tested for each condition is surprisingly small (eg 8 capillaries/type) and the variance in the results are calling for a much larger survey. This is similar across all the results presented. One would expect to see tens if not hundreds of cases tested for each type, across all simulations. Clearly, the data limits the amount of AD-to-AV cases but there are certainly enough capillaries to test for all the other experiments.</p><p>2a. Given the proximity of other vessels in the vicinity of the occluded capillary (some unaffected as shown by the authors, &quot;Distant&quot; class, Figure 2) what is the net impact of a capillary occlusion on tissue pO2? It is possible that the flow rearrangement observed by the authors (lines 231-233) counterbalance the loos of flow at the MSC keeping tissue pO2 constant (or close to) thus rendering MSC insignificant from this key physiological point of view. Therefore, this is the most crucial metric to compute as it will determine whether or not the MSC of different types do indeed lead to local ischemia; at least this should be shown for the &quot;worst-case&quot; scenario of 2-in-2-out. Further, it is plausible that the flow reduction in the vicinity of the MSC can allow for a larger fraction of oxygen to diffuse out of the nearby capillaries given the increased negative tissue-vessel gradient that will be generated. Combined with flow reorganization in non-affected vessels, this can lead to a net stable tissue pO2. Under such scenario, the statement in line 181-182 can be substantiated. Moreover, the relevance of MSCs is down-tuned by the reported 5% median inflow in the larger volume factor (lines 205-206).</p><p>2b. Related to the above, it is clear that this manuscript will be a cornerstone when it comes to interpreting future in vivo results. As such, the computation of tissue p02 will be extremely useful to guide such experiments.</p><p>3. With respect to the shortest distance used, the euclidean distance is of interest but the analysis should be done in terms of a &quot;weighted&quot; graph where resistance along the path is used. A comparison between the two is of much interest and might likely shed some interesting insight. Nevertheless, If opting for presenting one case, then the weighted one is the more relevant one.</p><p>4a. The authors have here the unique opportunity to increase the appeal of their work by including multiple-MSCs or multiple &quot;stalls&quot; scenarios. It is very intriguing to see in this manuscript how the presence of single MSC (and the subsequent reduction in flow in several other capillaries) increases the chances of subsequent MSC occurrence given the postulated link between initial decrease in flow (postulated as a potential mechanism for increasing the chances of MSC formation). The authors could titrate the concentration of such events based on recently published works that estimated &quot;stall&quot; occurrence in vivo.</p><p>4b. Is it possible for the authors to use published in vivo data to investigate what types of capillary topologies are reported with more &quot;stalls&quot;? Having such a comparison in this paper would be also very useful (on the same line as 2b comment).</p><p>5. There is a very interesting point made by the authors about the role of each topology (lines 544-547). This view calls for a balanced organization of the different topologies along the DA-AV flow paths. Is this indeed the case? The authors should plot the relative frequency of each type along flow paths; naively expected to be kept conserved. The opposite will weaken this view and likely point to a developmental epiphenomenon that results in a more or less random distribution of the different topologies.</p><p>6. The introduction to this manuscript is far too broad and sets up a larger problem to solve (with a focus on lack of ability to detect microstrokes in humans) for what was actually accomplished by the performed experiments. While it is good to introduce the larger picture, it is a bit misleading in terms of what the reader comes to expect after such an introduction. We recommend not only shortening it in length but also focusing it more on issues the study of flow networks are specifically able to speak to or help clarify in the field, rather than discussing uncertain implications for Alzheimer's disease pathology, for example. Perhaps emphasize the importance of investigating a single occlusion and the finding that a single occlusion is not enough to generate hypoxia likely to trigger pathology.</p><p>7. In terms of presentation of results, there was a general lack of statistical validation of trends or differences. There are several cases with large variability in simulation outcomes (e.g. the dark blue points in Figure 2f) that are not addressed. This variability and lack of statistical analysis of the results also calls into question whether the number of simulations used to generate this data was sufficient (a power analysis could prove useful here).</p><p>8. From a visual standpoint, we felt that while the results were clearly written for Figure 1, the figure itself (e to h) does not clearly show that there is a decrease in flow due to it being expressed as a relative change in flow. Figure 2 may benefit from showing a schematic representation of the volume factor, and removing the excessive horizontal gridlines (f to h). Figure 3 averages together two networks with quite different topological arrangements. It would make more sense to show the properties of these two networks independently (as in Supplementary Figure 7) in the main text. Figure 4 panel D is confusing: How can a flow path still go through the part of the vessel where a microstroke has been induced? The relevance of the decreased number of arteriole to venule flow paths after a capillary occlusion, as described in Figure 4, is also unclear. It would seem that the more biologically meaningful assay would be to explore how multiple occlusions impacted the number of flow paths and thus impacted regional perfusion. Finally, in section 3.5 a figure may be helpful to represent the finding about the geometric mixing of capillaries with different topological distances to arterioles and venules (defined as the AV-factor). It seems that this analysis could also be extended to explore how the variability of the average AV-factor of capillaries in a tissue volume varied with the size of the volume – a kind of 'smallest homogenous unit' analysis for the cortical capillary network.</p><p>9. The simulated area is small and the flow rates used also quite low. It's not clear why this was.</p><p>10. The information/data on the frequency and distribution of the different MSC-types in a realistic microvascular network is used on page 7. Where were these data obtained from?</p><p>11. The speculation that different capillary network configurations might confer distribution of blood flow and another to deliver oxygen and nutrients is interesting but not supported, yet, by data. Are there additional configurations that might be considered?</p><p>12. The authors appropriately used pressure values from Schmid that took them from published studies, however, some of those studies (Bohlen for example) used hypertensive rats. Did the authors consider normotensive or hypertensive conditions?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60208.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>General: There was a general consensus that to broaden the manuscripts appeal the authors should include a section on multiple micro-infarcts and transient stalls.

Consequently, we extended our manuscript by analysing multi-microinfarcts simulations (see Response to Q4a). The reason why we put our focus on single capillary occlusions is that we are convinced that a rigorous quantification of changes in response to single capillary occlusion is a prerequisite for understanding the role of multiple micro-infarcts, both in vivo and <italic>in silico</italic>. We believe that single capillary occlusions might be the starting point for accumulated flow disturbances, which likely are relevant for early disease stages and disease progression. Moreover, we want to highlight that even if microstrokes are at the heart of our manuscript our results are not limited to microstroke scenarios, but reveal novel topological and functional characteristics of the capillary bed (characteristics of different MSC-types, arrangement of arteriole and venule sided capillaries). We hope that by adding the study on multicapillary occlusions and by addressing the additional comments we were able to broaden the scope of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

For all other cases we increased the number of MSCs to &gt;= 12. Additionally, we perform statistical tests to compare the different cases (see response to Q7), which confirm that our observations are significant.</p><p>Two additional aspects should be noted.</p><p>1. Tracking of individual red blood cells (RBCs) is computationally expensive. More precisely, one microstroke simulation takes ~15 h (single core). Therewith, the computation time for all presented results on single capillary occlusion (167 different MSCs) is 2839 h = 118 days. As such, the tested number of cases is a compromise between computational cost and significance of results. Please also not that various post-processing analyses are also computationally expensive (e.g. computation of <italic>AVfactors</italic> or all flow paths, shortest distance and average <italic>AV-factor</italic> computations) and thus limit the number of cases that can be tested.</p><p>2. We apply a set of selection criteria to chose MSCs that are representative and comparable (see Materials and methods-Microstroke Simulations and Supplementary File 1a). We believe that these selection criteria are beneficial for comparing the different cases. However, at the same time they limit the number of capillaries available for analyses.</p><p>This is most pronounced for MSC-type <italic>2-in-2-out</italic>, which only occurs with a frequency of 8%. Consequently, for various cases (case 5-6 and case 8-9) some selection criteria had to be relaxed to increase the number of possible MSCs (Supplementary File 1a). For example, for case 5 we had to lower the threshold for the flow rate from 7.0 µm<sup>3</sup>/ms to 6.6 µm<sup>3</sup>/ms to increase the number of capillaries fulfilling the selection criteria from 18 to 21.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2a.

Combined with flow reorganization in non-affected vessels, this can lead to a net stable tissue pO2. Under such scenario, the statement in line 181-182 can be substantiated. Moreover, the relevance of MSCs is down-tuned by the reported 5% median inflow in the larger volume factor (lines 205-206).</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that the most important metric is tissue pO2 and that our study only provides indirect evidence for changes in tissue pO2 in response to a microstroke. Both arguments provided by the reviewers (re-routing of flow and larger PO2 gradients) are mechanism, which likely are beneficial to avoid hypoxic conditions. Consequently, a simulation study accounting for tissue pO2 would be highly relevant extension of our work. However, we believe that adding a simulation study on tissue pO2 to the current manuscript is not feasible for the following reasons:</p><p>As we are interested in local effects in tissue pO2 simplified oxygen transport models,</p><p>e.g. Krogh cylinder [1], are not sufficient and an oxygen transport model resolving the vasculature and individual RBCs is necessary [2, 3]. While such models are available and have been developed and used in our lab, they are computationally expensive, e.g. simulating oxygen transport in a network of 60 capillaries for 10s takes ~40 h on 24 cores. Moreover, due to the relatively small computational domain boundary conditions (inflow haematocrits, oxygen saturation of individual RBCs, oxygen consumption of the tissue, boundary conditions of tissue domain) may affect the simulation results. Thus, in order to perform robust predictions on the effect of single capillary occlusions extensive sensitivity studies are necessary. As such, albeit its relevance, we believe that adding a study on tissue pO2 is unfortunately out of scope for the current manuscript.</p><p>Nonetheless, our study is a valuable contribution to facilitate future studies on tissue pO2. First, it provides a quantitative value for the domain size in which flow changes are to be expected. This domain size is relevant both for future in vivo and <italic>in silico</italic> studies. Second, the <italic>AV-factor</italic> (see Results 3.5) is an important aspect for local tissue oxygenation and our analysis revealed that the distribution of low and highly oxygenated capillaries might contribute to the overall robustness of oxygen supply. As such, the <italic>AV-factor</italic> should be considered in future analyses.</p><p>To shed more light on the role of microstrokes for tissue oxygenation, we additionally study changes in RBC flux for <italic>2-in-2-out</italic> capillaries. While we do not see significant differences between the relative flow and RBC flux change in the vessels up- and downstream of the MSC (Figure 2-figure supplement 2 a-b), there is a larger drop in perfusion in the analysis box around the MSC for the RBC flux (Figure 2-figure supplement2 c-d). This suggests that the single capillary occlusion also affects the distribution of</p><p>RBCs (see also lines 249-257). To highlight the relevance of tissue pO2 we altered and added various descriptions and points of discussion to the manuscript (lines 95-100, 246-247, 598-603).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2b. Related to the above, it is clear that this manuscript will be a cornerstone when it comes to interpreting future in vivo results. As such, the computation of tissue p02 will be extremely useful to guide such experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the computation of tissue pO2 is a key factor to understand the consequences from single capillary occlusions. However, as stated in response to Q2a we believe that such studies should be performed thoroughly. As such, our current study is a first step in quantifying the changes in response to a microstroke, which will also provide the basis for subsequent studies on tissue oxygenation. We also want to highlight, that we believe that the presented findings are already relevant for in vivo experiments. The knowledge that the occlusion of <italic>2-in-2-out</italic> capillaries and of high flow capillaries causes a more severe drop in perfusion can directly be employed in in vivo experiments. Moreover, the characteristics of the different MSC-types and the arrangement of arteriole- and venule-sided capillaries are aspects, which likely are of relevance for in vivo studies focusing on perfusion characteristics of the capillary bed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. With respect to the shortest distance used, the euclidean distance is of interest but the analysis should be done in terms of a &quot;weighted&quot; graph where resistance along the path is used. A comparison between the two is of much interest and might likely shed some interesting insight. Nevertheless, If opting for presenting one case, then the weighted one is the more relevant one.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that the reviewer refers to Section 3.5 where we investigated the distribution of arteriole-sided and venule-sided capillaries. Here, we used the Euclidean distance to compute the shortest distance between venule- and arteriole-sided capillary. From what we understood, the reviewer suggests to not compute the Euclidean distance between these two points but to compute the topological distance based on a weighted graph.</p><p>However, in section 3.5 our focus is on understanding the distribution of arteriole- and venule-sided capillaries from the “tissue’s perspective”. The question we ask is for example: if a venule-sided capillary is occluded, is there an arteriole-sided capillary in its proximity to delivery oxygen and nutrient to the area originally fed by the occluded capillary. For this question the Euclidean distance to the closest arteriole-sided capillary is the most relevant metric. The topological connectivity/path between the venule- and arteriole-sided capillary is in our opinion not relevant to answer this question. In fact, arteriole- and venule-sided capillary, which are close in space, might not be directly connected.</p><p>To further clarify the goal of this analysis and in response to Q8 we added a novel figure to the manuscript (Figure 4) and improved the description of this study (e.g. lines 340, 350-372, 887-914).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4a. The authors have here the unique opportunity to increase the appeal of their work by including multiple-MSCs or multiple &quot;stalls&quot; scenarios. It is very intriguing to see in this manuscript how the presence of single MSC (and the subsequent reduction in flow in several other capillaries) increases the chances of subsequent MSC occurrence given the postulated link between initial decrease in flow (postulated as a potential mechanism for increasing the chances of MSC formation). The authors could titrate the concentration of such events based on recently published works that estimated &quot;stall&quot; occurrence in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>In line, with the reviewers’ suggestions and with our hypothesis that a single microstroke might cause an accumulation of microstrokes, we added a study on multicapillary occlusions, where we occlude low flow capillaries in the vicinity of the MSC (Methods and Results 3.4). The additional results show that increasing the number of occlusions does not only increase the drop in perfusion around the MSC but also increases the area of impact of the occlusion (Figure 3b). Interestingly, the number of vessels with a flow decrease in the analysis box around the MSC is smaller if more capillaries are occluded. This underlines the potential of the capillary bed to re-route blood to neighbouring vessel if local flow paths are blocked by accumulated occlusions.</p><p>We agree that our microstroke simulations are closely related to recently published work on capillary stalls. In fact, the changes for long-lasting stalls (&gt;20s) and “permanent” microstrokes are equivalent for the observation period of 20s used in our manuscript. To highlight these similarities we extended some descriptions in the manuscript (lines 63-64, lines 132-134, lines 657-663, see also response to Q4b).</p><p>Please note that, while we do speculate that low flow capillaries are potential locations for microstrokes, our study did not focus on investigating the precise distribution of low flow capillaries within the vascular network. Moreover, for investigating the impact of single capillary occlusions we did not limit our study to low flow capillaries, but intentionally chose capillaries with an average perfusion rate. We agree that understanding the origin of capillary stalls and occlusions is an important aspect for future work. However, based on the current state of knowledge we believe that it is not possible to provide reasonable estimates for the number of capillaries prone to stalling based on our simulation results. To attain this goal, we believe the numerical model should account for the presence of neutrophils and maybe also vessel distensibility. Moreover, flow fluctuations are likely an important aspect to be considered in such an analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4b. Is it possible for the authors to use published in vivo data to investigate what types of capillary topologies are reported with more &quot;stalls&quot;? Having such a comparison in this paper would be also very useful (on the same line as 2b comment).</p></disp-quote><p>We closely inspected the published in vivo work on capillary stalls to identify possible overlaps between the MSC-types as defined in our study and the locations of capillary stalls. More precisely, we looked at the work of Erdener et al. [4, 5], El Amki et al. [6], Cruz Hernandez et al. [7], Reeson et al. [8] and Santisakultarm et al. [9]. While there is some evidence that stalls are more frequent in capillaries with a lower flow rate [5], no specific vascular topology has yet been identified that increases stall prevalence and capillary stalls seem to occur across all capillary diameters, lengths and tortuosities.</p><p>Within our study we tried to investigate if the “appearance” of a capillary together with the four neighbouring capillary allows the identification the MSC-type. However, we could not identify distinct differences between the four MSC-types (see Lines 127-129), which implies that it is necessary to know the flow direction in all five vessels to accurately define the MSC-type. Thus, even if in some works the stalls are mapped to a centreline reconstruction of the local microvascular network [6, 7], without flow measurements it is impossible to identify the local MSC type.</p><p>To strengthen the link between our work and published in vivo data on capillary stalls, we extended several descriptions in the manuscript and also comment in more detail on causes and characteristics of stalling capillaries (lines 63-64, lines 132-134, lines 657663). However, further studies are necessary to answer the questions if stroke/stall prevalence varies for the different MSC-types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There is a very interesting point made by the authors about the role of each topology (lines 544-547). This view calls for a balanced organization of the different topologies along the DA-AV flow paths. Is this indeed the case? The authors should plot the relative frequency of each type along flow paths; naively expected to be kept conserved. The opposite will weaken this view and likely point to a developmental epiphenomenon that results in a more or less random distribution of the different topologies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion and added a novel figure to the manuscript (Figure 5c). Here, we plot the frequency of occurrence of the four MSC-types over the <italic>AV-factor</italic>. As to be expected there is a tendency that <italic>2-in-1-out</italic> capillaries are more frequent towards the venule side of the capillary bed, because here blood is collected to be drained via the ascending venules. The opposite trend is observed for <italic>1-in-2-out</italic> capillaries. <italic>1-in-1-out</italic> capillaries occur with the same frequency along the capillary bed, which fits well to our hypothesis that <italic>1-in-1-out</italic> capillaries are relevant for discharging nutrients, which needs to occur along the entire capillary path. <italic>2-in-2-out</italic> capillaries occur with approximately the same frequency along the capillary path (they might be slightly more frequent in the centre of the capillary bed). As such, this result is in line with out hypothesis that <italic>2-in-2-out</italic> capillaries might be key vessels for distributing flow.</p><p>To describe and discuss this result the manuscript has been adapted at Lines 439-447. Note that in the original manuscript we addressed this question in Supplementary Figure 5-1 d-k and Supplementary Table 3. However, we believe that the analysis via the <italic>AV-factor</italic> is more intuitive and provides more information on the distribution of the MSC-types along the capillary path. We kept Supplementary Figure 5-1 d-k but removed its detailed description within the manuscript to avoid duplicate results. We also removed Supplementary Table 3 from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The introduction to this manuscript is far too broad and sets up a larger problem to solve (with a focus on lack of ability to detect microstrokes in humans) for what was actually accomplished by the performed experiments. While it is good to introduce the larger picture, it is a bit misleading in terms of what the reader comes to expect after such an introduction. We recommend not only shortening it in length but also focusing it more on issues the study of flow networks are specifically able to speak to or help clarify in the field, rather than discussing uncertain implications for Alzheimer's disease pathology, for example. Perhaps emphasize the importance of investigating a single occlusion and the finding that a single occlusion is not enough to generate hypoxia likely to trigger pathology.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that our introduction was too broad and lacked focus. We shortened the introduction by removing details on the challenges in the detection of microstrokes and by reducing details on only weakly related literature. Moreover, we try provide a more refined picture of the questions we will address and state more clearly that single capillary occlusion likely does not trigger tissue hypoxia.</p><p>Nonetheless, as single capillary occlusion is not, yet, a highly studied topic we believe it is important to provide the “bigger picture”. This includes in our opinion a brief overview on literature on the occlusion of different vessel types and more specifically on the role of capillary occlusions. We also want to point out that even though our work focuses on flow disturbances in response to single capillary occlusions alternative disturbances in response to single capillary occlusion (e.g. in tissue clearance) are possible. Here, the work by Zhang et al. [10] in an AD mouse model is a very nice example on disturbances that can be triggered by single capillary occlusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In terms of presentation of results, there was a general lack of statistical validation of trends or differences. There are several cases with large variability in simulation outcomes (e.g. the dark blue points in Figure 2f) that are not addressed. This variability and lack of statistical analysis of the results also calls into question whether the number of simulations used to generate this data was sufficient (a power analysis could prove useful here).</p></disp-quote><p>We performed statistical validations for all main results. Details on the statistical tests employed are found in the Materials and methods – 5.11 Statistics. The key results of the statistical tests are summarized in the Figure legends and in Supplementary File 1c-e. Note that the large variability is characteristic for the perfusion in the capillary bed and is a direct consequence of the high interconnectivity and heterogeneity within the capillary bed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. From a visual standpoint, we felt that while the results were clearly written for Figure 1, the figure itself (e to h) does not clearly show that there is a decrease in flow due to it being expressed as a relative change in flow. Figure 2 may benefit from showing a schematic representation of the volume factor, and removing the excessive horizontal gridlines (f to h). Figure 3 averages together two networks with quite different topological arrangements. It would make more sense to show the properties of these two networks independently (as in Supplementary Figure 7) in the main text. Figure 4 panel D is confusing: How can a flow path still go through the part of the vessel where a microstroke has been induced? The relevance of the decreased number of arteriole to venule flow paths after a capillary occlusion, as described in Figure 4, is also unclear. It would seem that the more biologically meaningful assay would be to explore how multiple occlusions impacted the number of flow paths and thus impacted regional perfusion. Finally, in section 3.5 a figure may be helpful to represent the finding about the geometric mixing of capillaries with different topological distances to arterioles and venules (defined as the AV-factor). It seems that this analysis could also be extended to explore how the variability of the average AV-factor of capillaries in a tissue volume varied with the size of the volume – a kind of 'smallest homogenous unit' analysis for the cortical capillary network.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their suggestions on how to improve the figures of the manuscript and performed the following changes:</p><p>Figure 1: In Figure 1 we now only show capillaries that experience a flow decrease (&gt;80% of all capillaries in the vicinity of the MSC). The exact frequency of capillaries that experience a flow decrease is available from the new Figure 1-figure supplement 1 e-h. Here, we also provide the absolute relative change if increases and decreases in flow are depicted jointly (as in the original submission). We agree with the reviewers’ that the decrease in flow was not intuitively recognizable in the original version of Figure 1. Focusing on the flow decreases highlights that this is the most common change in the vicinity of the MSC and thus underlines this result. We changed the description in the text accordingly (Lines 137-139).</p><p>Figure 2: As suggested by the reviewers we added a schematic representation of the volume factor and reduced the number of horizontal grid lines.</p><p>Figure 3 (new Figure): This is a novel figure to show the results of the multi-capillary occlusions study.</p><p>Figure 4 (new Figure): We added a novel figure to the manuscript in which we schematically introduce the concept of the <italic>AV-factor</italic> and show some data for the results that previously have only been described within the text. As suggested by the reviewers we also performed a ‘smallest homogenous unit’ analysis. For all analysis cube sizes the variability of the mean <italic>AV-factor</italic> is large and no significant impact of the cube size could be detected. The figure has been added as (Figure 4-figure supplement 1) and the results are briefly described in the text (Lines 368-372).</p><p>Figure 5 (previously Figure 3): As suggested by the reviewers we replaced Figure 5 (previously 3) with Supplementary Figure 7 of the original submission, which shows the results for both MVN independently. We agree that showing the data for the two MVNs separately provides more detailed insights. Nonetheless, we want to point out that the described trends are consistent across both networks and that differences only persist with respect to absolute values. In line with this suggestion we also adapted Figure 5-figure supplement 1 and Figure 5-figure supplement 2.</p><p>Figure 6 (previously Figure 4): We agree that our analyses on flow paths going through the MSC were confusing and did not provide very relevant insights on the flow redistribution in response to a microstroke. This is because the flow rate in the MSC is close to 0 and as such these flow paths can be neglected. Note, that we set the diameter of the MSC to 0.1 µm and consequently also for the simulation with occlusion there is a residual flow rate in the MSC (&lt;10<sup>-10</sup> 𝜇𝑚<sup>3</sup>𝑚𝑠<sup>-1</sup>), which explains why there are still flow paths going through the MSC during occlusion.</p><p>As previously, mentioned we agree that due to the flow rate close to 0 these flow paths should be neglected and removed all analyses on flow paths through the MSC from the manuscript. Instead, we now focus on the total number of unique flow paths and unique flow paths between <italic>DA-AV-endpoint-pairs</italic>. Moreover, we extended these analyses to the multi-capillary occlusions simulations. In line with these changes, we elaborate more clearly why we believe that the analysis of flow paths from DA to AV is relevant for understanding the distribution of flow during baseline and during stroke.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The simulated area is small and the flow rates used also quite low. It's not clear why this was.</p></disp-quote><p>Each microvascular network is embedded in a tissue volume of &gt;1.5 µm<sup>3</sup> (Lines 114 and 700). These microvascular networks (acquired by Blinder et al. [11]) are amongst the largest realistic microvascular network reconstructions that have been used successfully for simulating blood flow. Recent advances in sample preparation, imaging and network reconstruction allow acquiring whole brain microvascular networks of the mouse [1214]. However, these networks have not yet been used for blood flow simulations and it is still unknown if the accuracy of these reconstructions (mostly with respect to connectivity and diameter estimates) is sufficient for blood flow simulations. Moreover, our manuscript focuses on local changes in response to single capillary occlusion. As the area of impact of these changes is limited to a few 100 micros, it is not necessary to perform the current analysis in whole brain microvascular networks.</p><p>We are not entirely sure which flow rates the reviewer is referring to. For the blood flow simulations we do not apply any flow boundary conditions, i.e. only pressure boundary conditions are used (Lines 735-740 and response to Q12). The resulting flow field has been validated by comparison against in vivo data (see Table 3 in [15], copied in <xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable1">Author response table 1</xref>) and agrees well with in vivo data. The lower and upper threshold for selecting microstroke capillaries (Supplementary File 1a) has been chosen such that a large fraction of capillaries is included. In MVN1 70.3% of all capillaries have a flow rate between 0.1-4.0 µm<sup>3</sup>/ms and the median flow rate in the capillary bed is 1.94 µm<sup>3</sup>/ms. As the flow selection criterion only excludes 30% of all capillaries we are confident that the defined threshold are suitable to select characteristic capillaries.</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Validation of the simulation results with literature data.</title><p>Table from: [15].</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>DA: qRBCin[nl s<sup>-1</sup>]</th><th>DA+A: vRBC [mm s<sup>-1</sup>]</th><th>C: vRBC[mm s<sup>-1</sup>]</th><th>C: qRBC [RBCs s<sup>-1</sup>]</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Literature</td><td>0.1 - 10.0[50]</td><td>2.0 – 30.0[50]</td><td>mean: 0.4 – 2.0 [4, 10, 11, 13, 14, 51, 52]</td><td>mean: 38.6 – 62.0 [13, 14, 53]</td></tr><tr><td>MVN 1</td><td>0.88 ± 1.87</td><td>2.44 ± 4.56</td><td>0.82 ± 1.31</td><td>59.1 ± 237.6</td></tr><tr><td>MVN 2</td><td>5.15 ± 8.57</td><td>5.28 ± 7.61</td><td>1.38 ± 1.96</td><td>88.4 ± 574.0</td></tr><tr><td>MVN 3</td><td>0.96 ± 1.00</td><td>2.73 ± 4.97</td><td>0.59 ± 0.93</td><td>29.8 ± 219.0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>qRBCin: RBC flow rate in the first segments of the DA, vRBC: RBC velocity in the DA+A, qRBC: RBC flux.

The microvascular networks have been acquired and described in detail in a previous study by Blinder et al. [11]. We provide a brief description of the computational method (originally published in [15]) and the realistic microvascular networks in the Methods. We clarified this aspect in the manuscript (Lines 397-400).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The speculation that different capillary network configurations might confer distribution of blood flow and another to deliver oxygen and nutrients is interesting but not supported, yet, by data. Are there additional configurations that might be considered?</p></disp-quote><p>On the local scale, i.e. on the scale of a single capillary, no other configurations than the four described in the manuscript are possible if trifurcations are excluded. This assumption is legit, because trifurcations only occur with a frequency ~5% (MVN1). Moreover, even though we don’t look at trifurcations, it seems likely that our observations could be extended to trifurcations, e.g. the occlusion of a <italic>3-in-2-out</italic> capillary would be comparable to the occlusion of a <italic>2-in-2-out</italic> capillary.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there is not yet any in vivo evidence for the role of different topological configurations for the distribution of blood/for oxygen and nutrient supply (see changes line 623-626). Nonetheless, even though this conclusion remains a hypothesis for now, the fluid dynamical characteristics of the different microvascular configurations support this (speculative) conclusion. It is also important to note, that the role of the different topological configurations is not trivial to study in vivo. Already, identifying the different MSC-types of one capillary in vivo requires five velocity measurements. To study oxygen discharge at the different MSC-types oxygen partial pressure needs to be measured in addition to the RBC velocities.</p><p>On the network scale there might be additional configurations, which might fulfil distinct functional tasks. However, we did not perform investigations on this aspect. Here, the challenge arises from the high interconnectivity of the capillary bed, which makes it difficult to identify well-defined network configurations. The arrangement of arteriole- and venule-sided capillaries (see Results – 3.5) could be considered as a configuration on the network scale that contributes to the robustness of oxygen and nutrient supply within the capillary bed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12.
