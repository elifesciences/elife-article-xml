is essential. In this report, we demonstrate that actomyosin contractility and planar cell polarity (PCP) interact in post-mitotic <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord cells to self-assemble and reposition actomyosin rings, which play an essential role for cell elongation. Intriguingly, rings always form at the cells′ anterior edge before migrating towards the center as contractility increases, reflecting a novel dynamical property of the cortex. Our drug and genetic manipulations uncover a tug-of-war between contractility, which localizes cortical flows toward the equator and PCP, which tries to reposition them. We develop a simple model of the physical forces underlying this tug-of-war, which quantitatively reproduces our results. We thus propose a quantitative framework for dissecting the relative contribution of contractility and PCP to the self-assembly and repositioning of cytoskeletal structures, which should be applicable to other morphogenetic events.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09206.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09206.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09206.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animal cells can move, and cell movements are particularly important during the early stages of development, when the developing embryo rapidly changes shape. These movements depend on a network of fibers made up of a protein called actin. Just like an animal's skeleton, this network provides an internal scaffold for the cell and supports the cell's movements. Another protein called myosin works closely with actin and acts as a motor that drives these movements.</p><p>To study how cellular movements contribute to development, scientists often turn to simple, tube-like sea animals called sea squirts. These strange-looking creatures are distant relatives of humans and other animals with a spinal cord. All of these related creatures develop a long, rod-shaped structure called the notochord during the earliest stages of their development that is critical for forming the nervous system. Studying the development of the notochord is easier in sea squirts than other animals because the sea squirt's notochord is made up of just 40 cells arranged in a single file.</p><p>Now, Sehring et al. provide new details about the forces that shape the notochord cells in sea squirts. The experiments used microscopes and fluorescent markers to see what happens as the cells elongate to form the rod-like notochord, which stretches from the front to the back of the animal. This revealed that a ring made of actin and myosin forms near the front end of each cell and then migrates to the middle of the cell, stretching it along the way.</p><p>Sehring et al. then treated the cells with a drug that blocks myosin's motor-like ability. In these cells, the actin–myosin ring remains stuck in the front of the cell. Treating the cells at a later stage, that is, when the rings had already arrived at the center, led to the central rings moving back to the front end of the cell. Furthermore, when a mutant sea squirt that had cells without a distinct front or back was treated with the myosin-blocking drug, the ring ended up at random places in the cells. Together, these results suggest that the placement of the actin–myosin ring is determined by a tug-of-war between the pull of the front end of the cell and the myosin-driven force of the ring itself.</p><p>These findings reveal a general rule that can determine the position of cell's inner skeleton. Future studies will ask how the front end of the cell attracts and pulls the ring, and what this means for tissue growth and organ formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09206.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09206.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>actomyosin ring</kwd><kwd>contractility</kwd><kwd>PCP</kwd><kwd>notochord</kwd><kwd>self-organization/active gels</kwd><kwd><italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Norges Forskningsråd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>133335/V40 and 183302/S10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Di</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM088997</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kourakis</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF) of Shandong province and China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZR2015DM003 and 31572352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Contractility wins over the polarity pathway in a tug-of-war to position a cytokinesis-like actomyosin ring at the equator of notochord cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In many developmental and cellular contexts, actin filaments construct complex and highly dynamic structures to accomplish cell shape changes such as in migration and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Munjal and Lecuit, 2014</xref>). Correct positioning of the actin filaments is essential. In polarized migrating cells, actin flows posteriorly and becomes associated with myosin II at the trailing edge to propel the cell forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cramer, 2010</xref>). In cytokinesis of vertebrate cells, the equatorial ring is established in many incidences by a cortical flow of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bray and White, 1988</xref>) driven by myosin contractility and is concentrated at the equator to ensure correct cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao and Wang, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeBiasio et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mayer et al., 2010</xref>). Despite the importance of the proper positioning of the actin cytoskeleton, our understanding of how cell polarity contributes to the organization of the cytoskeleton, and vice versa, is still incomplete. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> early embryogenesis, a flow of cortical myosin and F-actin towards the anterior pole carries PAR polarity proteins, which in turn modulate the actomyosin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Munro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mayer et al., 2010</xref>). Emerging evidence also point to a role for the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway in modulating cytoskeleton dynamics through its key mediators, Rho GTPases, which exert effects on actin polymerization and myosin contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schlessinger et al., 2009</xref>), although the mechanisms underlying this cross-talk remain obscure. On the other hand, in vitro experiments on reconstituted cytoskeletal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Surrey et al., 2001</xref>), as well as recent mathematical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kruse et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hannezo et al., 2015</xref>) suggest that actomyosin gels could have the properties to self-assemble, but the applicability of these findings to in vivo situations is not yet clear. Therefore, the interplay between self-assembly and polarity signals that organize the cytoskeleton remains largely unexplored.</p><p>The <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord is a transient embryonic structure, which is composed of 40 post-mitotic cells that are arranged in a single file after convergent/extension (C/E). Following C/E, the coin-shaped cells undergo continuous elongation along the anterior–posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cloney, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miyamoto and Crowther, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang and Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2009</xref>), acquiring a drum shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our previous studies show that an actomyosin contractile ring is present in the basal equator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dong et al., 2011</xref>) and produces a circumferential constriction. The force generated by the constriction is transmitted three dimensionally from the basal cortex towards anterior and posterior lateral domains through an incompressible cytoplasm, driving notochord cell elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sehring et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The actomyosin ring is maintained by a bi-directional cortical flow and is under constant turnover in a manner remarkably similar to that of the cytokinetic ring during cell division. The position of contractile rings influences notochord cell shape and elongation. For example, in α-actinin mutants, the ring cannot maintain its position at the equator, and consequently, the cells fail to elongate but acquire an asymmetric shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sehring et al., 2014</xref>). However, the mechanism of positioning the contractile ring in the equator of the notochord cells is unknown. This question is also of crucial relevance to our understanding of cytokinesis, where the position of the actomyosin ring is critical for the cells to divide properly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52a">Sedzinski et al., 2011</xref>) and to direct the distribution of cell-fate determinants correctly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clevers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gómez-López et al., 2014</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09206.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Establishment and relocation of anterior basal cortical actin filaments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Ciona</italic> embryos at 16.5 and 23.5 hr post fertilization (hpf).

Whether the PCP pathway contributes to the process of cell elongation and whether and how PCP components affect contractile ring formation and positioning remains mysterious.

Both Lifeact-mEGFP and mCherry-UtrCH bind to endogenous actin without interfering with its dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Riedl et al., 2008</xref>) and were shown previously to have the same localization pattern as the endogenous protein in <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sehring et al., 2014</xref>). Before C/E (11.5 hpf, hours post fertilization), actin was uniformly localized in the basal cortex, with high concentration at notochord cell–cell contacts (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). During cell intercalation (16.5 hpf), when the cells start to align into a column, the low and evenly distributed actin in the basal cortex was replaced by patches of cortical actin accumulations close to the anterior pole (white arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). With the alignment of the cells into a column (17 hpf), these actin patches connected into an actin ring spanning the entire circumference of the basal domain next to the anterior pole of the coin-shaped cell (yellow arrowheads and intensity graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Time-lapse recordings revealed that this early anterior ring observed in coin-shaped cells is the precursor of the equatorial ring (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). While the cells elongated, the ring relocated from the anterior pole to the equator of the cells (white arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To ascertain if the relocation of the cortical actin ring was a continuous movement, we measured the distance between the edges of the ring and the two cell poles over time. While the length between the ring and the posterior pole grew only minimally, the length between the anterior pole and the ring increased steadily, until the distance from the ring to both poles was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Concomitantly with ring relocation and cell elongation, the ring width increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F′</xref>). Myosin filaments (labeled with myosin regulatory light chain fused to mCherry, mCherry-MRLC) also formed a circumferential ring in the anterior basal cortex at the end of C/E. Similarly to the actin ring, the myosin ring subsequently relocated to the equator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), where it remained for the rest of the elongation process.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-09206-media1.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09206.005</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Relocation of cortical actin during cell elongation.</title><p>Notochord cells expressing Lifeact-mEGFP were recorded every min.

This dependence of actin ring migration on myosin II activity prompted us to ask if long-term maintenance of the ring at the equator is also dependent on myosin II activity. We thus analyzed the effect of blebbistatin on cells that had already elongated substantially, and whose circumferential actin ring had been positioned at the equator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

High-speed time-lapse recordings revealed a migration of the cortical actin ring from the equator to the anterior pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,C′</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>), mirroring exactly the reverse sequence of migration of the ring towards the center in normal development. The front of the ring moved at a velocity of 91.8 ± 10.5 nm/min (<italic>n</italic> = 10). The speed of the shift was blebbistatin dose dependent; halving the blebbistatin concentration reduced the velocity significantly to 27 ± 0.5 nm/min (<italic>n</italic> = 10; p &lt; 0.0001). The ring width stayed constant when it shifted anteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Remarkably, the encounter of the ring with the anterior lateral domain did not bring the movement to a halt. Instead, after the ring contacted the lateral domain (red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), the posterior edge of the ring continued to move anteriorly at an increasing speed of 191.6 ± 21.4 nm/min (<italic>n</italic> = 10), so that the width of the ring narrowed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), until the entire ring disappeared at the position of the lateral domain (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). The cell length did not significantly change during this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 10). We also examined the dynamic localization of talin, an actin-binding protein that bridges actin filaments and the adhesion apparatus at the cleavage furrow of dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanger et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Critchley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</xref>), and normally colocalized with the cortical actin ring at the equator in <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sehring et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Live imaging showed that talin concentrated at the cell equator slightly after the ring had been established centrally (data not shown), suggesting that talin actually responds to cortical repositioning rather than driving it. Upon blebbistatin treatment of already established central rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), whereas the cortical actin was shifted to the anterior pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A′</xref>), talin lagged behind at the equatorial position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B′</xref>).

The kymograph unveiled a persistence of this dynamics within the ring in blebbistatin-treated embryos: circumferentially oriented actin filament bundles (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; further examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) from the anterior and posterior edges of the ring continued to flow towards the equator, which itself was shifting anteriorly (dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In the first 15 min of blebbistatin treatment, the filament bundles moved at a velocity of 7.62 ± 0.78 nm/s (<italic>n</italic> = 18), which was significantly slower than the velocity in control cells (DMSO-treated cells) (29.92 nm/s, <italic>n</italic> = 10; p &lt; 0.001), where the filaments moved towards a stationary equator. Continued exposure to blebbistatin further reduced filament movement. Within the next 15 min, the velocity decreased significantly to 3.92 ± 0.9 nm/s (<italic>n</italic> = 22; p = 0.004). The deceleration of the filament bundles resulted in a flattening of their trajectories in the kymograph. Measurement of the angles of filament bundles revealed a reduction from 39° to 3° within 30 min of blebbistatin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E′,F</xref>). After 31.1 ± 1.36 min (<italic>n</italic> = 20), directed movement of filament bundles towards the center of the ring (the moving equator) ceased, and only filament bundles moving nearly parallel to the direction of the shifting ring could be observed (yellow arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). After the ring had reached the anterior lateral domain, no pronounced filaments were detectable. There is no statistical difference in either velocities or angles between anterior- and posterior-directed filament bundles at any time. To analyze if there was still actin turnover within the ring at a time point when no prominent filament bundles were visible in a kymograph, or if it was a static ring shifting anteriorly, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments on notochord cells expressing mCherry-hActin. We bleached the entire equatorial ring in cells of control embryos, or the entire shifting ring in cells of embryos treated with blebbistatin for at least 30 min. For control embryos, the recovery curve was well fitted by a single exponential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), yielding a characteristic turnover rate of 90 s ± 3 s. In the shifting ring with blebbistatin treatment, fluorescence also recovered, indicating a persistent cortical flow of actin elements from outside the ring towards its center. Interestingly, the dynamics could no longer be fitted by a single exponential, as it contained two characteristic recovery times: a fast one, very similar to the control, and a much slower one of 7.8 ± 0.6 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). A rough estimate of the flow-induced duration to close a bleached segment of 3 µm, assuming a mean velocity of 30 nm/s, is 100 s, which cannot be distinguished from the turnover time. However, after blebbistatin treatment, the mean velocity drops to roughly 6 nm/s (see Figure 6E), leading to a duration of 8 min, which is very similar to the measured slower recovery time. This further indicates a requirement of myosin motor activity for a strong cortical flow of actin elements, while local polymerization and depolymerization is still present and represents 30% of the recovery and appears to be very slightly affected by the blebbistatin treatment. These observations together reveal a persistence of fast inner-ring dynamics, albeit a bit slower because of decreased actin velocity, superimposed on a slow global shifting of the ring towards the anterior edge upon blebbistatin treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Emergence of additional rings after prolonged blebbistatin treatment</title><p>Prolonged treatment with blebbistatin (&gt;1 hr) led to the complete disappearance of the actin ring.

A conspicuous feature of the A/P polarity is the posterior localization of the nucleus, which is regulated by <italic>prickle</italic>, a core PCP component. The <italic>Ciona savignyi</italic> mutant <italic>aimless</italic> carries a deletion in <italic>prickle</italic>, resulting in a loss of A/P polarity manifested in the randomized localization of nucleus in addition to an earlier convergent extension defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>). We first explored the possibility that the posterior nucleus might influence the direction of ring movement mobilized by blebbistatin. To this end, we examined the notochord of the ascidian <italic>Halocynthia roretzi</italic>, which follows a remarkably similar early developmental process as in <italic>Ciona</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), except at the cell elongation stage, the nuclei are positioned in the center of the cells (asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). A conspicuous circumferential constriction is present at the equator, which is colocalized with a cortical ring of actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and activated myosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), whose activity is essential for notochord cell elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). We next treated embryos with elongating notochord cells with blebbistatin for 3 hr. Similar to what was observed in <italic>Ciona</italic>, the actin ring was shifted invariably anteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), indicating that the position of the nucleus does not influence the dynamic behavior of the ring. We thus used <italic>aimless</italic> embryos to explore the role of a compromised A/P polarity on the repositioning of the ring and its shifting upon blebbistatin treatment, independent from its influence on nuclear position. In wild-type <italic>C. savignyi</italic> embryos, elongated notochord cells possess a circumferential actin ring at the cell equator and a posterior nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Blebbistatin treatment shifts the ring towards the anterior pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), mirroring exactly the events in <italic>C. intestinalis</italic>. In <italic>aimless</italic> embryos, the intercalation of notochord cells (outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) is impaired, except in the posterior region where the cells often align into a single file (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>). In these cells, the loss of A/P polarity is evident by the random position of the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> insert). In 92% of mock-treated <italic>aimless</italic> cells in this region, the actin ring is positioned at the equator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> insert), showing that equatorial ring positioning is independent from PCP. However, reducing contractility in polarity-deficient mutant cells led to a dramatically different phenotype: after 60-min blebbistatin treatment, no unidirectional migration towards the anterior was observed. The direction of the shift was randomized and independent of the localization of the nucleus: examples for anterior nucleus and ring, anterior nucleus and posterior ring, posterior nucleus and ring, and posterior nucleus and anterior ring could be found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,D'</xref>). In 56% of the cells, the ring was still positioned at the equator, and in the rest, the ring migrated either to the anterior or posterior side (18% and 26%) (<italic>n</italic> = 57) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These results imply that A/P polarity by <italic>prickle</italic> is not necessary for the establishment of an equatorial actin ring; however, it is instrumental for the direction of movement of the ring upon blebbistatin treatment.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09206.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Circumferential actin rings are shifted anteriorly in <italic>Halocynthia roretzi</italic> notochord cells with centrally localized nuclei.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) <italic>Halocynthia</italic> notochord cells elongate from coin-shaped (<bold>A</bold>) to drum-shaped (<bold>B</bold>).

To begin, in order to expose the role of contractility only, we first assumed that they vanish. It should be noted that the actomyosin flux <italic>J</italic> encompasses both actin filament velocity, and an effective diffusive flux arising from actin polymerization (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>: the model). Therefore, a vanishing total flux does not necessarily entail a vanishing velocity.

We can then interpret that the driving force positioning the ring at the equator is the contractility increase during the process of ring migration. Before finalizing the model, we check two of its key assumptions that (1) contractility increases smoothly as ring migration proceeds, and (2) the velocity gradient of actin filaments towards the center should depend linearly on the local contractility, indicated by local actomyosin concentration (as seen in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>). To address the first assumption, we measure the angle between the lateral and basal side, from embryos at various stages (n &gt; 20 angles for each embryo) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). As shown recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maître et al., 2012</xref>), this angle <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf89"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>arccos</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> reflects a force balance between the tensions of the basal (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf90"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) and lateral (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf91"><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) surfaces, and therefore can be used as a proxy for tension changes. Interestingly, the angle decreased smoothly and continuously during elongation and ring migration, indicative of an increased basal tension relative to lateral tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), by roughly a factor of 2.5 during the elongation process, and 1.5 during the ring migration process. We assume at first order approximation that lateral tension is constant and set in the model that (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf92"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) increases by a factor 1.5. As we shall show later, such an increase enables a good fit to all of the available data (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4">Appendix 4</xref>: rough estimates of model parameters, and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app5">Appendix 5</xref>: model predictions for further details). To test the second assumption, we performed PIV analysis on high frequency movies of actin flows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), to measure local velocity gradients. When plotting these as a function of local actin concentration, we found a robust negative linear correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), which shows that flows are driven by differences in actomyosin concentration, validating quantitatively <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref> of our model. From the slope of the correlation, as well as from the characteristic of actin bundles measured above in the kymographs, we could extract the ratio (χ/η) of contractility and viscosity. Finally, we fixed the last parameters of our model through FRAP experiments (τ = 90 s) and through the width of the ring intensity profile (D = 2.10<sup>−12</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s) (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4">Appendix 4</xref>: rough estimates of model parameters for the details of parameter fitting). Under these assumptions and with these parameters, a central ring spontaneously forms at the center of the cell when contractility increases above the critical threshold <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf93"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, and contractility is self-sufficient to maintain the ring structure through actomyosin flows. However, the experimental data show the existence of a stage where the ring is positioned at the anterior side and also underlines the importance of PCP in the repositioning of actin rings. Our final model therefore incorporates polarity in the model in the simplest way possible: by assuming that it creates a small preferential polymerization of actin at the anterior side, that is, there is a non-zero flux at the anterior side, different from the flux at the posterior side. We considered that the flux on the posterior side was still zero, that is, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf94"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf95"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. We showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app5">Appendix 5</xref>: model prediction that lifting this constraint does not qualitatively change our results, as the key parameter is the difference between anterior and posterior flux, but not their respective magnitude and our system is locally robust with respect to this type of perturbation. Assuming the existence of a preferential polymerization at one boundary due to PCP was supported by the well-studied link between PCP and actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wallingford and Habas, 2005</xref>). In particular, Disheveled (Dsh), one of the core member of the PCP pathway has been shown to activate key actin regulators such as Rho and Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tahinci and Symes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wallingford and Habas, 2005</xref>), as well as Daam1, a member of the formin protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kida et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao and Chen, 2010</xref>). It should be noted that as we are treating the actomyosin gel as a single species (with the assumption that bipolar filaments performing the contractile power stroke co-localize with actin), assuming that PCP localizes myosin anteriorly, as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Newman-Smith et al., 2015</xref>, would yield the same qualitative results. With these final boundary conditions, the dynamical system <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ2 equ3">Equations (1–3)</xref> predicts a transition (which is now smooth, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>: the model) between two mechanically stable states of the actin ring: a central position if the contractility χ is large enough, and an anterior position when χ is small enough and the polarity-induced actin flux F dominates. We set the value of F using the filament velocity order of magnitude as well as the experimental actin density profiles when the contractility is impaired (blebbistatin experiments, see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app5">Appendix 5</xref>: model predictions).</p><p>To verify the model, we then numerically integrated <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ2 equ3">Equations (1–3)</xref> in order to calculate the steady state of a central actin ring, using the parameters deduced above. We found that our model can reproduce quantitatively very well both the velocity and intensity profiles in the entire actin cortex at the late stages of elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Interestingly, we predicted, and observed in the PIV, a rather large, non-zero value for the actin filament velocity at the posterior edge of the cell, which is compensated in the model by actin polymerization on the side, since the total flux is zero. Moreover, we note a remaining, albeit small bias in ring position towards the anterior side, as in the data, showing that an anterior-imbalance remains at the later stages, both in simulations and in the data.</p><p>Next, we wished to compare the dynamics of ring migration predicted by the model to the experimental data, both in the case of normal ring migration towards the center, and blebbistatin-induced ring migration towards the anterior side. We simulated the effect of the linear increase in contractility, deduced from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, and followed the appearance and migration towards the center of a ring. After 110 min, we then simulated a blebbistatin treatment as an exponential decrease in contractility, following previous experimental results on traction force decrease with blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lam et al., 2012</xref>; details in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app5">Appendix 5</xref>: model predictions), which predicted a rapid migration back towards the anterior pole. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> displays a kymograph of the numerical integration. Next, we compared model predictions and experimental data (average over 7 cells for normal ring migration, and 5 cells for blebbistatin treatment). It should be noted that in our model, the migration speed of the ring is controlled by the dynamics of contractility changes. This is in agreement with our experimental observation that the velocity is dependent on the dose of blebbistatin used, but also with the fact that the velocity of the ring migration is an order of magnitude smaller than the velocity of the actin filament bundles.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09206.010</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Comparison between theory and experiments on the dynamics of actin rings during migration and blebbistatin treatment.</title><p>All theoretical curves are extracted from the same parameter set (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app5">Appendix 5</xref>: model predictions for details on non dimensional values and parameters).

Indeed, in control cells, a rough estimate of the time needed to close a bleached segment of 3 µm through flows, given a mean velocity of 30 nm/s, is 100 s, which cannot be distinguished from the turnover time. Therefore, we only see a single-exponential recovery. However, after blebbistatin treatment the mean velocity drops to roughly 6 nm/s (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), leading to a time of 8 min for flow-induced recovery, which is strikingly similar to the time extracted from the FRAP analysis of 7.8 min. There are then two time scales for recovery, one linked to turnover, unaffected by blebbistatin, and one linked to flows, which is dramatically compromised by blebbistatin.</p><p>We first examined the dynamics of normal ring migration to the center and verified that our dynamical prediction for the positions of the anterior and posterior sides of the ring matched very well the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We also compared theoretical and experimental profiles of actin intensity during ring migration towards the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), and observed again a good agreement between the two: first an exponential ring profile at the anterior pole, then detachment of a ring of broad thickness during migration, and then refinement of a thinner central actin ring.</p><p>Moreover, a rather intriguing feature of our model is that it predicts the size of the actin ring should first increase linearly with the length of the cell, before showing a plateau region for large cell sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This is because ring formation is a spontaneous, self-organizing phenomenon that depends on boundary conditions, and therefore on the size of the cell. We measured experimentally actin ring width during cell elongation, and found it indeed increases linearly with the length of the cell, in very good quantitative agreement with our model, with all parameters having already been fixed above. In cytokinesis, it was proposed that such a scaling could allow cytokinetic time to be independent of cell size as observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turlier et al., 2014</xref>). Our model provides a natural explanation to how this might be implemented in a simple manner in vivo.</p><p>Next, we turned to the blebbistatin treatment. The only free parameter is the timescale of contractility decrease (over a time of 15 min), which we fitted through ring position shifting, keeping all other parameters constant. This yielded a good theory-experiment agreement for the shifts of both the anterior and posterior sides of the ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Having fixed the one parameter for the blebbistatin treatment, we sought to test our model further via second independent measurement. We plotted the predicted decay of actin velocity from our simulations and compared it to the experimental data measured above. Again, we found an excellent quantitative agreement between predictions and data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Finally, we examined the spatial profiles of actin intensity during blebbistatin treatment and migration towards the anterior edge. This recapitulated in reverse the normal migration sequence and showed good qualitative agreement between theory and experiments.</p><p>To verify the role of PCP in the model, we performed the simulation under the conditions of no polarity and random polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>): for low polarity and increased contractility (<italic>aimless</italic> mutant), the ring formed directly in the center of the cell; for low contractility and low, uncoordinated polarity between neighboring cells (<italic>aimless</italic> mutant with blebbistatin), the actin ring did not have any strong forces positioning it, and was therefore positioned randomly, depending on the strength of the respective anterior and posterior boundary fluxes (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app5">Appendix 5</xref>: model predictions for further details).</p><p>We next turned back to our data to find experimental clues for this preferential polymerization of actin at the anterior side. As noted earlier, Dsh is a core member of the PCP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29a">Keys et al., 2002</xref>), and we found that it initially accumulated at the basal membrane, but was relocated to the lateral domains, with a preference for the anterior side (28% ± 9% enrichment compared to the posterior side, n = 11 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), mirroring the localization of Prickle protein at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Newman-Smith, et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, this relocation occurred roughly at the same time as the appearance of the anterior ring (between 19 and 20 hpf). This is fully in line with our prediction of a PCP-driven preferential polymerization at the anterior side, which could be mediated by Dsh.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Ascidians have the simplest notochord in the Chordate phylum. It consists of merely 40 cells arranged in a single file at a transient stage of development. Yet, emerging evidence suggests that the <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord possesses an intriguing array of complexity, including differential gene expression, asymmetrical cell lineages, desynchronized morphogenetic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reeves et al., 2014</xref>), and an A/P polarity which manifests in the posterior localization of nuclei in the first 39 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>). The current study reveals hitherto unknown aspects of A/P polarity in dynamical properties of actomyosin cortex. An actin ring forms at the anterior side of cells as core PCP proteins such as Disheveled relocate there, and then migrates to the equator as contractility increases, where it contributes to cell elongation. Interestingly, planar polarized contractile flows were reported during <italic>Drosophila</italic> germ-band extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rauzi et al., 2010</xref>). The ring movements that we observe are very robust, with surprisingly little fluctuation, given the highly dynamic nature of the ring. Here, we could disentangle the contributions of contractility and PCP to this robust positioning, by a combination of drug and genetic experiments. We show that decreasing contractility via blebbistatin reverses the normal developmental sequence, causing an anterior shift of the equatorial ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which can be observed consistently throughout the elongation stage, but not in polarity mutants. This suggests a tug-of-war between contractility and cellular polarity: sufficiently large myosin contractility antagonizes the <italic>Prickle/Dishevelled</italic>-mediated anterior bias and can self-organize the actin ring in the center of the cell purely by physical forces, as shown by our theoretical analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Indeed, the equatorial ring in the notochord cells, despite its resemblance to the equatorial ring in cytokinesis, is established in a spindle-independent manner. A similar phenomenon has been reported in the asymmetrical cell division of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cabernard et al., 2010</xref>), which also uses cortical polarity signals to regulate the furrow.</p><p>During longer blebbistatin treatments, we observe complex oscillations of the cortex, with a second ring usually emerging at the equator. This suggests the existence of additional signals for ring formation and from a theoretical perspective, underlines the need to go beyond our simple one-component model, for instance, in order to take into account the dynamics of adhesion complexes as well. Indeed, our model is the simplest one can write for active gels, and it assumes for instance that all the rheological coefficients are constant, while in principle some, for example, viscosity, could depend on the state of the gel, and on blebbistatin concentration in the drug treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stirbat et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, the fact that we can capture well the experimental data with such a simple model suggests that such coupling effects are probably of secondary importance for the observed phenomenon. It should be noted that, in this study, we have considered polarity as a constant, externally fixed parameter and examined its effect on actomyosin localization. In fact, a recent study in the same system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Newman-Smith et al., 2015</xref>) suggested an active feedback of myosin in core PCP protein localization. The next logical step would therefore be to incorporate this feedback loop to our formalism.</p><p>Earlier reports have noted movement of constrictions in isolated amphibian cells, especially the neural plate cells, which form local circumferential constriction rings traveling the length of the cells in successive waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holtfreter, 1946</xref>). Traveling constrictions have also been observed in leukocytes during cell shape changes and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Senda et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haston and Shields, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shields and Haston, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bornens et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data and theoretical analysis suggest a novel and generic framework through which PCP and contractility can interact to modify the forces acting on actomyosin rings and therefore their positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and fertilization</title><p>Adult <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> were obtained from Station Biologique de Roscoff, France and maintained in running filtered seawater.

On the one hand, an enormous body of information concerning developmentally important transcription factors and their target genes exists and on the other hand, cell biology has provided a wealth of information about the primary agent of cell shape change – the actomyosin cytoskeleton. And yet the connections between the two remain maddeningly elusive.</p><p>In the current study, the authors provide a fascinating look into one such connection – that responsible for driving elongation of notochord cells of an ascidian. In brief, the authors show that an equatorial ring of actin filaments and myosin-2, previously found to be responsible for powering elongation, assembles as a result of myosin-2 powered contraction and resultant cortical flow of F-actin. Initially, F-actin is concentrated in a ring at the anterior end of the cells, but it moves parallel to the plane of the cortex to the middle of the cell, where it is needed to do its job. Myosin-2 shows a similar behavior and disruption of its motor activity with blebbistatin (which blocks elongation) prevents repositioning of the actin ring. Moreover, blebbistatin causes repositioning (to the anterior) of the ring when applied after the achievement of its central location. The authors develop a simple model, which successfully captures some of the key features observed, but does one essential feature – the starting localization at the anterior of the cell. This prompted a series of experiments designed to test the possibility that the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway is responsible for the starting localization. They found that it is, providing a link between a pathway implicated in several different morphogenetic events (PCP) and a cellular process that actually powers a morphogenetic event. The authors modified their model which was thereupon able to capture all of the relevant results.</p><p>This is a very nice piece of work, not only for the reasons presented above, but also for the quality of the data. The authors obviously appreciate the importance of high quality imaging and also obviously appreciate what to do with the results provided by it. I thus have just a couple of comments:</p><p>1) Based both on the movies and on the fact that many F-actin nucleators concentrate at cell-cell junctions, I was puzzled by the assumption that “actin fluxes vanish” at cell-cell junctions (Results) underlying the model. Am I just misunderstanding what is meant by flux in this context? Perhaps some clarification is in order, as it seems manifestly obvious that F-actin is being generated at the boundaries and flowing inward.</p><p>2) The point of the talin experiments eluded me. Is the point simply that not everything is going with the flow? If so, having double labels would be more convincing.</p><p>3) The Dsh labeling was far below the standard set by the authors in the other images.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>This manuscript examines the process of notochord formation in <italic>Ciona</italic>, focusing on the positioning of the actomyosin contractile ring. The imaging is fantastic and the long-term drug treatments are rather illuminating and show very non-trivial dynamics. This reviewer was quite satisfied with the quality of experimental data, but the model, while being perfectly sensible, did not seem to produce any non-trivial predictions enabling a serious test of understanding.</p><p>The first claimed prediction of the model (in the subsection “A simple biophysical model of the actomyosin cortex for the formation and maintenance of equatorial actomyosin ring”) is that “contractility increases smoothly as elongation and ring migration proceeds”. Since contractility “chi” is a parameter of the model, rather than a dynamical variable, this looks to me like an assumption rather than a prediction.</p><p>The second “prediction” of the model that “the velocity gradient of actin filaments towards the center should be proportional to the local contractility, indicated by local actin concentration.” This is such a trivial consequence of force balance (obtained by integration of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>), that it is difficult to accept it as a “prediction”. Instead I would regard this fact, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, as the basic premise underlying the formulation of the model. A more convincing logical progression would be a) the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> supports the model, b) now calculate non-trivial consequences of the model based on these assumptions that explain a difficult to understand observation.</p><p>The fourth paragraph of subsection “A simple biophysical model of the actomyosin cortex for the formation of equatorial actomyosin ring” comes closer to stating model predictions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> shows the simulated time evolution of actin intensity. What controls the width of the final steady state (in red)? If a certain set of parameters allows the final predicted profile to fit the observed actin intensity distribution (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), does the same set of parameters predict the observed time-evolution of actin intensity before a steady state is achieved? Or, stated in a different way, do the blue, green, and cyan curves match up with the data? Same question can be asked of the actin velocity profiles. Does the predicted time evolution match up with the data?</p><p>In the same subsection, the authors state: “Moreover, a rather intriguing feature of our model is that it predicts the size of the actin ring should scale with the length of the cell. This is because ring formation is a spontaneous, self-organizing phenomenon that depends on boundary conditions. We therefore measured experimentally actin ring width during cell elongation, and found it indeed increases linearly with the length of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).” Yet, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> quite clearly shows that the dependence is not linear. Furthermore, the model prediction itself is nonlinear, and this seems to contradict what is stated in the manuscript.</p><p>Again, in the same subsection, the authors state: “to probe how PCP can participate in the repositioning of actin rings, we incorporated polarity in the model in the simplest way possible”. The alteration or addition to the model is that PCP alters actin polymerization locally. Simulations of the model with this additional assumption show that the equatorial ring can transition smoothly to an anterior position. The observation that the transition is smooth is not a strong validation of the model; it would be consistent with a whole class of models. A more stringent test of the model is needed. Does the predicted time series of the transition match the data?</p><p>In conclusion, I do not see that the model has been tested rigorously. Support for model assumptions is confused with predictions. Centering by contractility seems to be the key insight of the model. It is not too surprising that inclusion of PCP-induced polarity would generate an asymmetry. I believe that the authors could strengthen model “validation” by comparing observed dynamics with model predictions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>This study proposes a very interesting and rather novel mechanism for the positioning of a contractile actomyosin ring in <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord cells. However, besides this intriguing finding and the dissection of the individual contributions of contractility and PCP, there are some major issues (also concerning the model) as mentioned next.</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the authors measured the contact angle between basal and lateral surfaces and incorporated an increase in contractility (by 2.5) into the model. It is not clear how the contractility has been calculated from the angle measurements. Furthermore, by measuring the contact angle between cells (which is not the same as angle θ between basal and lateral domain as indicated here) the relative cortical tensions can be obtained. Therefore, probably the correct term that should be used here is 'cortical tension' along the basal and lateral domains, which is different from 'contractility'. 'Contractility' arises from active tension generated by actomyosin and 'cortical tension' is the total mechanical tension within the cortex. The authors should clearly state what they measured and how they used the obtained values for the model fitting. The statement of 'Basal contractility increases = angle θ opens' does not make sense, since θ, as indicated in the schematic diagram 3B, is getting smaller in the case of higher 'contractility'. In addition to measuring the contact angles, cortical laser ablation could be used to measure the relative changes of cortical tension throughout time and elongation process.</p><p>2) To account for the contribution of PCP, a preferential actin polymerization at the anterior pole was incorporated into the model by changing one boundary condition at the anterior pole from no flux to flux&gt;0 (<italic>J</italic>(0)=0 to <italic>J</italic>(0)=<italic>F</italic>). However, the authors also state that they observe large, non-zero values for the actin filament velocity at both edges of the cell via PIV. Please clarify why it is legitimate to use only anterior flux for model fitting then.</p><p>3) Besides affecting actin polymerization there is evidence, that the Wnt/PCP pathway also modulates myosin contractility via Rho GTPases. The authors should make clear why they only proposed polymerization changes in the model and provide more supporting data to show that the influence of PCP is happening indeed via actin polymerization only. The authors further state that Dsh relocated from basal to lateral domains with preference to the anterior side and 'this relocation occurred roughly at the same time as the appearance of the anterior ring (19-20h)'. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig6">Figures 1 and 6</xref> show examples of ring appearance around 21hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) in wildtype case &amp; Dsh lateral localization only at 22 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The authors should provide a better temporal analysis of the proposed components involved. When does the ring appear on average (statistics would be useful) and when is Dsh and Pk localized there? Without providing these data the statement about the actomyosin positioning via “<italic>Prickle/Dishevelled</italic>-mediated anterior bias” cannot be made.</p><p>4) In the model, blebbistatin treatment is considered as downregulation of contractility in notochord cells, which leads to an anterior shift of the ring by keeping the inner-ring dynamics persistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F-G</xref>). Since blebbistatin not only interferes with contractility but also with other properties such as viscosity, it is very likely that the ring dynamics are changed, which can also be seen by FRAP experiments (half time more &gt;2.5 fold). Therefore, blebbistatin treatment should not only be considered as downregulation of contractility. In addition, blebbistatin treatment interferes with contractility in the whole organism and will change various parameters also in surrounding tissues. It is essential to show the same outcome of actomyosin repositioning with more localized methods, e.g. by using photoinducible aryl azide derivative of blebbistatin to stably inhibit myosin within notochord cells.</p><p>5) The model for <italic>aimless</italic> mutant with low polarity and high contractility predicts the ring to form directly in the center of the cell. No data on a time series is shown to support this statement. The model prediction of <italic>aimless</italic> embryos says that the anterior Flux Ja is considerably lowered. Can this be checked experimentally with PIV? It would be good to show what happens to Dsh localization in <italic>aimless</italic> mutants to support the proposed “<italic>Prickle/Dishevelled</italic>-mediated anterior bias”.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled “Assembly and positioning of actomyosin rings by contractility and PCP” for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>.

This has considerably improved the study. However, there are still several points of criticism that need to be addressed before the manuscript is suitable for publication.</p><p>1) The initial value for contractility was a 2.5-fold increase, which is reflecting the change in contractility during the whole process of ring movement and cell elongation. Why did the authors decide to use the lower 1.5-fold change in contractility (during ring movement only) in the revised version of the manuscript? Please comment on the rationale behind changing this value, and would a 2.5-fold contractility increase instead change the model predictions significantly? (In the figure description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, the authors still mention a 2.5-fold linear increase in contractility; is this a typo?)</p><p>2) Why did the turnover time measured from FRAP experiments change significantly from 50sec to 90sec in the revised manuscript after re-analyzing data? Have new experimental measurements been done?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, when calculating the basal tension from the contact angles, what justifies to neglect adhesion tension without measuring/calculating it for this specific tissue?</p><p>There are no measurements of lateral tension, so why is it valid to take lateral tension as constant? Especially in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, the length of the lateral domain seems to decrease during cell elongation. (Change “basal contractility” to “basal tension” and “Contractility” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> to “relative tensions”.)</p><p>4) When changing assumptions for boundary tension to S=0.95C (5.2.2) the average filament velocity is not in good agreement with the model prediction anymore. Since in this case the model prediction changes quantitatively, the assumption of S=C might be too much of a simplification?</p><p>5) Is polarity still intact in blebbistatin treated embryos? Since the paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Newman-Smith et al. (2015)</xref> shows the incorrect localization of PCP components (Prickle) upon blebbistatin treatment. In case polarity is disrupted, would blebbistatin treatment then not reflect decrease in contractility in addition to loss in polarity, whereas in the model decrease in contractility will not at the same time lead to a change in polarity?</p><p>6) The question of why the authors focused on actin polymerization and did not consider modulations of myosin contractility was not addressed (point 3 in previous comments).</p><p>7) Suggestions for <italic>aimless</italic> mutant (point 5 in previous comments) have not been sufficiently addressed.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript describes an experimental and mathematical modeling study of the assembly and migration of an actomyosin ring in <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord cells, and how these processes depend on planar cell polarity. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that after convergent extension basal cortical actin rings assembled close to the anterior pole of the cell. The rings then migrated to the equator. Using the myosin-II ATPase inhibitor blebbistatin and the deletion mutant (“<italic>aimless”</italic>) of a core planar cell polarity component named <italic>prickle</italic>, the authors studied the dependence of ring positioning and directional migration on myosin-II activity and on planar cell polarity. A mathematical model of the basal cortex, based on an active gel model, reproduced experimental ring formation and migration behavior.</p><p>Images of actin in <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord cells marked by Lifeact-mEGFP and mCherry-UtrCH showed an actin ring initiating near the anterior pole of the coin-shaped cell ∼17 hours post fertilization, which migrated to the equator as the cell elongated after convergent extension. The lateral distance from ring to anterior (posterior) pole increased (remained constant) as the ring migrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In cells treated with blebbistatin before ring migration, the ring failed to migrate and remained close to the anterior pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Blebbistatin treatment after the ring had migrated to the equator caused the ring to return to the anterior pole and eventually disappear. Prolonged blebbistatin treatment produced a second and a third ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Experiments with notochord cells of <italic>Ciona</italic> and the ascidian <italic>Halocynthia roretzi</italic>, whose nuclei are positioned on the posterior side and in the center, respectively, both showed ring migration towards the anterior pole after blebbistatin treatment. This suggested to the authors ring motion was likely unaffected by nucleus position.</p><p>For <italic>Ciona</italic>, in the <italic>aimless</italic> mutant (which lacks normal polarity) ring motion was random and uncorrelated with nucleus position after treatment with blebbistatin. This contrasts with the wild-type behavior where the ring returned to the anterior pole after blebbistatin treatment, suggesting to the authors that anterior ring migration depends on planar cell polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>A 1D mathematical model attributed the rate of change of actomyosin density in the cortex to turnover, gradient of actomyosin flux and a diffusion-like term representing nonlocal turnover (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>). The cortical stress sums contributions from the velocity gradient and actomyosin contractility (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>). Zero external forces on the cortex are assumed, implying constant cortical stress (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>). With low actomyosin contractility and zero flux at the poles (mimicking the cortex before convergent extension) a constant actomyosin density was predicted as seen experimentally. With increased contractility, nonzero anterior flux and zero posterior flux, a “ring” formed (a high density band) near the anterior pole, which migrated slightly beyond the equator. On decreasing the contractility, the ring migrated back to the anterior pole. Both effects agree with experiment, provided one assumes that lowering the contractility correctly represents the effect of blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5, 6</xref>). When the model was run with (1) zero flux at both poles (no polarity), or (2) flux at the posterior pole only, the ring located to (1) the equator or (2) close to the posterior pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Based on these results, the authors proposed a self-reinforcing ring formation mechanism driven by actomyosin contractility, and a ring-positioning mechanism depending on unbalanced anterior and posterior boundary actin fluxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig7">Figures 5, 7</xref>).</p><p>This is an interesting study of an actomyosin phenomenon that involves a ring in some respects reminiscent of the cytokinetic contractile ring. The development and migration of the ring is worthy of study, and this paper makes a serious attempt to establish the mechanism involved. The lessons are likely to be generally informative for actomyosin contractility phenomena in the cell cortex, and may lead to insights into cytokinesis.</p><p>Some of my major concerns are that insufficient evidence was presented for critical assumptions of the model, and presentation of both experiment and modeling is poor and difficult for a reader to follow. Specific points follow:</p><p>1) The paper lacks necessary background and motivation (this would mainly be in the Introduction, but could permeate the paper). The biological significance of the actomyosin phenomenon under study is not explained. The reader does not discover how the actomyosin ring under study is related to elongation. What is the mechanism? A reference to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sehring et al. (2014)</xref> is inadequate. Why should we be concerned about the migration of this ring?</p><p>2) In the figures, there is no sign of actin away from the ring and the poles. There is presumably an extended actomyosin cortex everywhere (assumed by the model) yet we don't see it in images. Why is it invisible?</p><p>3) In the model, a 3 dimensional stress σ is evolved in space and time. And yet variations of σ in the direction normal to the cell surface are not addressed. Presumably, there is an unstated assumption that variations of σ across the cortex are small and can be neglected? This (or whatever the assumption is) should be clearly stated and it should be explained how this leads to the model equations.</p><p>4) The model assumed a nonzero actomyosin flux at the anterior side. This boundary condition was the feature of the model that caused migration and positioning of the ring near the equator. The authors claim this assumption is “supported by the well-studied link between PCP and actin polymerization, notably via Disheveled, which regulates actin assembly”, citing the study of Kida et al. (in the subsection “A simple biophysical model of the actomyosin cortex for the formation and maintenance of equatorial actomyosin ring”). Given the critical role of this assumption, it requires a much more explicit justification that can be properly judged by a reviewer and readers of the journal. What does actin polymerization have to do with it, and how does actin polymerization lead to actomyosin flux, etc.? A detailed, self-contained explanation is needed. A reader should be able to discover why the flux boundary condition is the uniquely correct one, without studying Kida et al.</p><p>5) The assumption that basal stress <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf101"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">σ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> increases ∼ 1.5 fold during ring migration is apparently based on a force balance using the measured angle θ between the lateral and basal sides (in the subsection “A simple biophysical model of the actomyosin cortex for the formation and maintenance of equatorial actomyosin ring”, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4">Appendix 4</xref>). No data is presented to justify this, neither is any actual force balance equation presented. The validity of the claim is impossible to judge as a result.</p><p>6) Related to (2), is it reasonable to assume that γ is constant in time? What is the justification? This was used to deduce the value of the stress <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf102"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">σ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p><p>7) The model presentation could be improved. The entire model (i.e. equations) plus boundary conditions (essential to all of the results) should be clearly laid out in sequence. At present, the initial conditions and boundary conditions are often not stated or buried in text.

The decision letter expressed interest in our study but felt our paper suffered from weakness in the modeling part. We agree with the editorial opinion completely that our study should be seen as a work of experiments and modeling working in concert to reveal a novel mechanism in cytoskeleton biology. We also appreciate the constructive and detailed comments and criticisms from the reviewers, which have led to a major revision of our work.</p><p>In the new manuscript, we have followed the suggestions of the referees, and divided the physical model part into model assumptions and model predictions. We have expanded the modeling part of the manuscript to two theory figures, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref>, to more clearly articulate the logic progression in our modeling, and to include more analyses, some of which were inspired by referees’ criticisms. Specifically, in this new manuscript we added a much more precise description of the dynamical implications of the model in the main text. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> compares dynamic data and model at the anterior and posterior positions of the ring, and explores the detailed spatial profiles in intensity, both in normal and blebbistatin-induced migration. We also added another new dynamical check of the model, to show that the decrease in actin filament density subsequent to blebbistatin treatment matches very well quantitatively our predictions. The new analyses and thorough re-work of our model have strengthened our belief that the current work now makes non-trivial predictions, and hypotheses generated have been tested for the modeling to be useful.</p><p>We hope you find that our new paper has made substantial improvement, and that the conceptual novelty of our theoretical work, inspired and verified by our novel experimental findings, is now more clearly accentuated.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) Based both on the movies and on the fact that many F-actin nucleators concentrate at cell-cell junctions, I was puzzled by the assumption that “actin fluxes vanish” at cell-cell junctions (Results) underlying the model. Am I just misunderstanding what is meant by flux in this context? Perhaps some clarification is in order, as it seems manifestly obvious that F-actin is being generated at the boundaries and flowing inward</italic>.</p><p>Prompted by the question, as well as the one from Reviewer 3, we now explain more precisely the meaning of flux in the paper: it consists of both the actual actin flows (\rho v), as well as a non-local term due to actomyosin turnover and diffusion (D d\rho/dx). Therefore, even if we assume that the total flux F vanishes at the posterior boundary, there can still be a flow \rho v of actomyosin, which is counterbalanced by preferential polymerization at the boundary (which is the case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in the main text). We chose the assumption of total flux to vanish because it is the simplest one as a first approximation, and one does not need a non-zero total flux to explain the data. Though we consider the case where the total anterior flux vanishes to explain why contractility drives the formation of a central ring, our final model accounts for a non-zero anterior flux representing the cell polarization. Nevertheless, in order to show more clearly that our mechanism and results hold qualitatively in the presence of a non-zero posterior flux, we show the robustness of our numerical simulations in that case.</p><p><italic>2) The point of the talin experiments eluded me. Is the point simply that not everything is going with the flow? If so, having double labels would be more convincing</italic>.</p><p>Indeed, we showed talin data in the manuscript simply to state that not everything is going with the flow. We have live-imaging data showing that talin concentrates at the cell equator slightly after the ring has been established centrally (data not shown), suggesting that talin actually responds to cortical repositioning rather than driving it. Moreover, this data also indicates that there is not a global effect in the embryo after the drug treatment that would shift everything around.</p><p>The figure does show a double labelling experiment, where we co-expressed mCherry-talin and Lifeact-emGFP, and present two channels in separate panels.</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree that the talin data presented in the main text does not connect well with other parts. To make our story concise and coherent, we now put it into the supplementary material (as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>) and shortened the description in this part, while making above point more clear.</p><p><italic>3) The Dsh labeling was far below the standard set by the authors in the other images</italic>.</p><p>We admit the quality of these pictures is not at a high level. This is because the images were made using fluorescence microscope that was available at the time. The construct used in this experiment is no longer available. Newer fluorescent protein-fusion constructs have proved to be highly toxic to <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord cells, and either wild type or mutant <italic>dsh</italic> renders notochord abnormal and embryo dead.</p><p>We went through all the data and found that these are the best we can offer. We think these images, together with the images in previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang, et al., 2005</xref>), and recently published data from Smith lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Newman-Smith et al., 2015</xref>) are adequate in support of our claim in the text (we have cited these papers).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>The first claimed prediction of the model (in the subsection “A simple biophysical model of the actomyosin cortex for the formation and maintenance of equatorial actomyosin ring”) is that “contractility increases smoothly as elongation and ring migration proceeds”. Since contractility “chi” is a parameter of the model, rather than a dynamical variable, this looks to me like an assumption rather than a prediction</italic>.</p><p><italic>The second “prediction” of the model that “the velocity gradient of actin filaments towards the center should be proportional to the local contractility, indicated by local actin concentration.” This is such a trivial consequence of force balance (obtained by integration of</italic> <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2"><italic>Equation 2</italic></xref><italic>), that it is difficult to accept it as a “prediction”. Instead I would regard this fact, shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref><italic>, as the basic premise underlying the formulation of the model. A more convincing logical progression would be a) the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref> <italic>supports the model, b) now calculate non-trivial consequences of the model based on these assumptions that explain a difficult to understand observation</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the referee that these experiments are better characterized as validation of model assumptions. We re-organized the text in order to distinguish validations and predictions.</p><p>In the first case, we would like to argue that we do in fact measure the rescaled basal tension, related to “chi”, by our angle analysis, following the ideas of Maitre et al. (Science, 2012), so we do see dynamical variation of “chi”.</p><p>In the second case, it is worth mentioning that even though the proportionality is a direct consequence of force balance and a visco-contractile rheology, it hadn't been verified before, to the best of our knowledge.</p><p><italic>The fourth paragraph of subsection “A simple biophysical model of the actomyosin cortex for the formation of equatorial actomyosin ring” comes closer to stating model predictions.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3E</italic></xref> <italic>shows the simulated time evolution of actin intensity. What controls the width of the final steady state (in red)? If a certain set of parameters allows the final predicted profile to fit the observed actin intensity distribution (as shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3G</italic></xref><italic>), does the same set of parameters predict the observed time-evolution of actin intensity before a steady state is achieved? Or, stated in a different way, do the blue, green, and cyan curves match up with the data? Same question can be asked of the actin velocity profiles. Does the predicted time evolution match up with the data</italic>?</p><p>We thank the referee for this comment, which allowed us to substantially improve our manuscript.</p><p>First, to clarify our model, we now split the theory figures into two: one addressing model assumptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and a second addressing model predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>The width of the ring is dictated by: 1) the cell length and 2) the length scale created by diffusion D and turnover <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf96"><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, as we show in Appendix 5–figure 3, where we vary D to show the evolution in ring width.</p><p>In order to address the second part of the question, we measured dynamically the positions of the anterior and posterior boundaries of the ring and compared to the model, both in the normal migration from anterior to middle, and the reverse migration following blebbistatin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>), and we found a very good dynamical agreement as well. In order to provide a further test of the model, we compared the theoretical predictions for filament velocity during blebbistatin treatment, and saw an excellent quantitative agreement, although all parameters were already fixed from the profiles of overall ring migration. Finally, we measured, as the referee suggested, the intensity profiles dynamically during both ring migrations, and compared them to the model prediction; again we obtained a good agreement for the same set of parameters. The unique set of parameters taken to fit the data is given and explained in details in the appendices. We have now included a substantial amount of dynamical verification, all for a fixed parameter set. We thank the referee for advising us towards these new analyses.</p><p><italic>In the same subsection, the authors state: “Moreover, a rather intriguing feature of our model is that it predicts the size of the actin ring should scale with the length of the cell. This is because ring formation is a spontaneous, self-organizing phenomenon that depends on boundary conditions. We therefore measured experimentally actin ring width during cell elongation, and found it indeed increases linearly with the length of the cell (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3F</italic></xref><italic>).” Yet,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3F</italic></xref> <italic>quite clearly shows that the dependence is not linear. Furthermore, the model prediction itself is nonlinear, and this seems to contradict what is stated in the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for the slight confusion introduced by the term “scaling”. For small and intermediate cell sizes, the ring width indeed scales with cell length, and the dependence is linear. For large cell size, the width increases less rapidly than the cell size indeed.</p><p>Nevertheless, this actually matches very well the biological data itself, which displays a plateau for large cell length. We therefore clarified this in the text.</p><p><italic>Again, in the same subsection, the authors state: “to probe how PCP can participate in the repositioning of actin rings, we incorporated polarity in the model in the simplest way possible”. The alteration or addition to the model is that PCP alters actin polymerization locally. Simulations of the model with this additional assumption show that the equatorial ring can transition smoothly to an anterior position. The observation that the transition is smooth is not a strong validation of the model; it would be consistent with a whole class of models</italic>. <italic>A more stringent test of the model is needed. Does the predicted time series of the transition match the data</italic>?</p><p>As described above, we performed our analysis on the time series to show how the shape of the actin density profiles reproduce the experimental data, even though there is some biological variations on actin fluorescence levels. We agree that the smoothness of the transition itself is not the proof. Rather, we take a very simple model amenable to detailed mathematical analysis, and show that it can reproduce our data quite accurately. We clarified this in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>In conclusion, I do not see that the model has been tested rigorously. Support for model assumptions is confused with predictions. Centering by contractility seems to be the key insight of the model. It is not too surprising that inclusion of PCP-induced polarity would generate an asymmetry. I believe that the authors could strengthen model “validation” by comparing observed dynamics with model predictions</italic>.</p><p>We would like to argue that a strength of our model is that we use one of the most simple model imaginable for actomyosin gels, yet this still reproduces very faithfully virtually all the features of our data. This therefore demonstrates the broad applicability of our approach, which should be relevant to the many other biological event involving actomyosin positioning and PCP.</p><p>Following the advice of the referee, we improved the manuscript further by comparing the dynamical evolution of the actin intensity between theory and experiments, both in the case of normal and blebbistatin-induced migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We've also shown new predictions such as actin velocity evolution, which fit very well quantitatively with our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>This study proposes a very interesting and rather novel mechanism for the positioning of a contractile actomyosin ring in</italic> Ciona <italic>notochord cells. However, besides this intriguing finding and the dissection of the individual contributions of contractility and PCP, there are quite some major issues (also concerning the model) as mentioned next</italic>.</p><p><italic>1) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref><italic>, the authors measured the contact angle between basal and lateral surfaces and incorporated an increase in contractility (by 2.5) into the model. It is not clear how the contractility has been calculated from the angle measurements. Furthermore, by measuring the contact angle between cells (which is not the same as angle θ between basal and lateral domain as indicated here) the relative cortical tensions can be obtained. Therefore, probably the correct term that should be used here is 'cortical tension' along the basal and lateral domains, which is different from 'contractility'. 'Contractility' arises from active tension generated by actomyosin and 'cortical tension' is the total mechanical tension within the cortex. The authors should clearly state what they measured and how they used the obtained values for the model fitting. The statement of 'Basal contractility increases = angle θ opens' does not make sense, since θ, as indicated in the schematic diagram 3B, is getting smaller in the case of higher 'contractility'. In addition to measuring the contact angles, cortical laser ablation could be used to measure the relative changes of cortical tension throughout time and elongation process</italic>.</p><p>The referee is perfectly right in pointing out that the figure should read “=angle θ closes”, we apologize for this typo due a change in angel definition.</p><p>We also clarified how we extract contractility, and the rationale behind it. The absence of a friction term in the force balance equation implies that the cortical tension in the z direction is homogeneous inside the cortex. From the measurement of contact angles, we obtain the increase of such tension as a function of time. A simplifying hypothesis of the model is that this tension (which being homogeneous is also the average tension in the z direction) is proportional to the average contractility (but not the local contractility which as the reviewer rightly underlines is very different, as the viscous part of the stress also enters there).</p><p>Within our model, this is a natural hypothesis to make since, in the absence of actin flux at the boundary and when contractility is weak as in stage prior to the ring migration, we expect to have a homogeneous concentration of actin inside the cell which can only be fulfilled if S = C. It is however true that we may have an average tension S slightly smaller than C. We examined the effect of such deviation in the appendices of the revised manuscript, redoing all the numerical integration, and show that our mechanism remains qualitatively unchanged.</p><p>Cortical laser ablation is indeed a good tool to measure the cortical tension. We actually tested this technique on <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord several times. However, it does not work well, because the notochord locates at the centre of the tail, surrounded by muscle and epithelial tissues. Increase of laser power will cause damage to the whole tissue/cell structure, making any analysis virtually impossible.</p><p><italic>2) To account for the contribution of PCP, a preferential actin polymerization at the anterior pole was incorporated into the model by changing one boundary condition at the anterior pole from no flux to flux&gt;0 (</italic>J<italic>(0)=0 to</italic> J<italic>(0)=</italic>F<italic>). However, the authors also state that they observe large, non-zero values for the actin filament velocity at both edges of the cell via PIV. Please clarify why it is legitimate to use only anterior flux for model fitting then</italic>.</p><p>In this model, we make a distinction between the actin flux and velocity. Indeed, the flux also contains a diffusive part, which effectively accounts for the actin production in the layer as we have now clarified in the main text, and explained in greater details in the appendices.</p><p>As a consequence, while the total flux may vanish at the boundary, (<italic>J</italic>(<italic>L</italic>) = 0), indicating that there is no local overall production at this side, the velocity is not necessarily zero, because of actin polymerization which can counterbalance the velocity of actin filaments going in.</p><p>Nevertheless, the referee is correct that the total flux could also be non-zero. Therefore, we also now show the robustness of our results in the presence of a small flux at the posterior side. We show that again our mechanism is qualitatively unchanged, as only the difference between anterior and posterior boundary fluxes matter. We clarified the text by adding a description as following:</p><p>“Interestingly, we predicted, and observed in the PIV, a rather large, non-zero value for the actin filament velocity at the posterior edge of the cell, which is compensated in the model by actin polymerization on the side, since the total flux is zero. Moreover, we note a remaining, albeit small bias in ring position towards the anterior side, as in the data, showing that an anterior-imbalance remains at the later stages, both in simulations and in the data.”</p><p><italic>3) Besides affecting actin polymerization there is evidence, that the Wnt/PCP pathway also modulates myosin contractility via Rho GTPases. The authors should make clear why they only proposed polymerization changes in the model and provide more supporting data to show that the influence of PCP is happening indeed via actin polymerization only. The authors further state that Dsh relocated from basal to lateral domains with preference to the anterior side and 'this relocation occurred roughly at the same time as the appearance of the anterior ring (19-20h)'.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig6"><italic>Figures 1 and 6</italic></xref> <italic>show examples of ring appearance around 21hpf (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1E</italic></xref><italic>) in wildtype case &amp; Dsh lateral localization only at 22 hpf (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref><italic>). The authors should provide a better temporal analysis of the proposed components involved. When does the ring appear on average (statistics would be useful) and when is Dsh and Pk localized there? Without providing these data the statement about the actomyosin positioning via “</italic>Prickle/Dishevelled<italic>-mediated anterior bias” cannot be made</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer's criticism. We have now made it clear in the text that two references, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al. (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Newman-Smith et al. (2015)</xref>, show the time course of Dsh and Pk. The data from these and our current manuscript provide a very detailed time course on the localization of these proteins. We feel these data together support our claim that the anterior relocation of dsh to the anterior edge, which begins to show an anterior bias already at 20.8 h (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> middle picture), occurs very early during ring formation.</p><p><italic>4) In the model, blebbistatin treatment is considered as downregulation of contractility in notochord cells, which leads to an anterior shift of the ring by keeping the inner-ring dynamics persistent (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2F-G</italic></xref><italic>). Since blebbistatin not only interferes with contractility but also with other properties such as viscosity, it is very likely that the ring dynamics are changed, which can also be seen by FRAP experiments (half time more &gt;2.5 fold). Therefore, blebbistatin treatment should not only be considered as downregulation of contractility</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer is correct in stating that blebbistatin surely influences more than contractility. Nevertheless, it is widely accepted that we now explicitly state in the manuscript's Discussion the following:</p><p>“Indeed, our model is the simplest one can write for active gels, and it assumes for instance that all the rheological coefficients are constant, while in principle some, for example viscosity, could depend on the state of the gel, and on blebbistatin concentration in the drug treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stirbat et al. 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, the fact that we can capture well the experimental data with such a simple model suggests that such coupling effects are probably of secondary importance for the observed phenomenon.”</p><p>One should note, as we did in our revised manuscript, that a 2.5 fold increase in FRAP half-time does not mean a 2.5 increase in turnover time, as blebbistatin decreases the speed of turnover flows, and therefore one would expect, for constant turnover an increased time in ring recovery.</p><p>Therefore, to address the reviewer's remark, we re-analyzed quantitatively our FRAP data. Interestingly, we find that although the control data is well-fitted by a single exponential, the blebbistatin recovery is much better fitted by two-exponential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), where the fast timescale is very similar to control, and the second much longer. A simple calculation shows that given the measured velocity of flow, one expects quantitatively this behavior. This has been added to the new manuscript as following:</p><p>“Indeed, in control cells, a rough estimate of the flow induced time needed to close a bleached segment of 3µm, given a mean velocity of 30 nm/s, is 100s, which cannot be distinguished from the turnover time. Therefore, we only see a single-exponential recovery. […] There are then two time scales for recovery, one linked to turnover, unaffected by blebbistatin, and one linked to flows, which are dramatically compromised by blebbistatin.”</p><p><italic>In addition, blebbistatin treatment interferes with contractility in the whole organism and will change various parameters also in surrounding tissues. It is essential to show the same outcome of actomyosin repositioning with more localized methods, e.g. by using photoinducible aryl azide derivative of blebbistatin to stably inhibit myosin within notochord cells</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer's concern that the whole organism, including the tissues directly in contact with notochord cells, is also treated with the drug. We have indeed sought out methods to disrupt contractility locally and specifically in the notochord cells. As stated above, we have discovered that cortical laser ablation is technically impossible in <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord cells.</p><p>We have also looked into azidoblebbistatin and found that its applicability in live embryos is limited, and the drug is hard to obtain. Furthermore, we have found out other species of commercially available blebbistatin behaved erratically in cells and in embryos. For example, nitro-blebbistatin formed numerous, large, and highly fluorescent precipitants in the cytoplasm, probably due to certain reactions to the salinity or certain content of seawater.</p><p>Interestingly, in a separate line of experiments conducted aiming to search for an external cause of the ring shifting, i.e. the surrounding tissues are driving the ring to migrate to the anterior end of the notochord cells, we found the relative movement of notochord cells and its neighbouring tissues was not disrupted by blebbistatin. For example, the extension and posterior migration of muscle proceeded normally. Under the microscope the relatively sliding of muscle cells over notochord was undeterred. Most importantly, there was no correlation between the movement of the muscle and the anterior migration of the ring (unpublished observations). Based on these observations, we believe the ring behaves quite autonomously within the notochord cells. The relatively autonomy of notochord in the morphogenesis of <italic>Ciona</italic> embryonic development is supported by both genetics and embryology studies, and the higher sensitivity of notochord cells may be underscored by the highly abundant expression of myosin- and actin-regulatory proteins in notochord compared with other tissues.</p><p><italic>5) The model for</italic> aimless <italic>mutant with low polarity and high contractility predicts the ring to form directly in the center of the cell. No data on a time series is shown to support this statement. The model prediction of</italic> aimless <italic>embryos says that the anterior Flux Ja is considerably lowered. Can this be checked experimentally with PIV? It would be good to show what happens to Dsh localization in</italic> aimless <italic>mutants to support the proposed “</italic>Prickle/Dishevelled<italic>-mediated anterior bias”</italic>.</p><p>We now added a much more precise description of the dynamical implications of the model in the main text. We have added a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), where we compare dynamically data and model on the anterior and posterior positions of the ring, as well as on the detailed spatial profiles in intensity, both in normal and blebbistatin migration. We also added another new dynamical check of the model, to show that the decrease in actin filament density subsequent to blebbistatin treatment matches very well quantitatively our predictions.</p><p>The model for <italic>aimless</italic> mutant does not necessarily predict that the ring forms exactly at the center since there may be some imbalance between the small remaining posterior and anterior fluxes that make one side prevail. Nevertheless, the localization is expected theoretically to be much less precise, which is what we see experimentally.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) The initial value for contractility was a 2.5-fold increase, which is reflecting the change in contractility during the whole process of ring movement and cell elongation. Why did the authors decide to use the lower 1.5-fold change in contractility (during ring movement only) in the revised version of the manuscript? Please comment on the rationale behind changing this value, and would a 2.5-fold contractility increase instead change the model predictions significantly? (In the figure description of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7A</italic></xref><italic>, the authors still mention a 2.5-fold linear increase in contractility; is this a typo?</italic>)</p><p>We had shown that there was a total 2.5-fold and 1.5-fold increase in contractility during the process of notochord cell elongation and the early process of ring migration, respectively (in the subsection “A simple biophysical model of the actomyosin cortex for the formation and maintenance of equatorial actomyosin ring” and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Nevertheless, in the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), we concentrated on the early process of ring migration, which reaches the center before the end of elongation, corresponding to a 1.5-fold increase only, hence the change. We modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and figure legend to indicate clearly 1.5 and 2.5-fold increase on the relative contractility at 2 different stages.</p><p>Assuming a 2.5-fold increase would not change qualitatively the story, but assuming that other parameters remain unchanged, would make the migration faster, as well as the ring more peaked.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> legend, this is indeed a typo. It should be 1.5-fold linear increase in contractility.</p><p><italic>2) Why did the turnover time measured from FRAP experiments change significantly from 50sec to 90sec in the revised manuscript after re-analyzing data? Have new experimental measurements been done</italic>?</p><p>The first version of the manuscript mentioned 50s as being the half-time of recovery. Nevertheless, we realized that the turnover involved in the model is the exponential recovery time (which is by definition 30% higher than the half time). We also re-analyzed the data as mentioned in the previous response letter to correct for some photo-bleaching and the presence of one recovery time for the control versus two recovery times for the blebbistatin treated cells. We explain this better and give the detailed results from the fits in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref><italic>, when calculating the basal tension from the contact angles, what justifies to neglect adhesion tension without measuring/calculating it for this specific tissue</italic>?</p><p><italic>There are no measurements of lateral tension, so why is it valid to take lateral tension as constant? Especially in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1E</italic></xref><italic>, the length of the lateral domain seems to decrease during cell elongation. (Change “basal contractility” to “basal tension” and “Contractility” in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref> <italic>to “relative tensions”</italic>.)</p><p>We made the modifications suggested by the referee on the terminology.</p><p>Adhesion is very hard to quantify in this system, although pipettes measurements on more easily accessible systems (Maitre et al, Science, 2012; Maitre et al, NCB, 2015) suggests it is negligible for force balance.</p><p>We also agree that constant lateral tension is an approximation and that during the ring migration the length (height) of lateral domain indeed decreases, suggesting the increase of lateral domain tension. Unfortunately, right now, it is not possible for us to directly measure the lateral tension in <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord cells. Our measurements provide the ratio of the basal tension over the lateral tension (it should be noted that absolute measurements are very hard to get, as even laser ablation does not measure tension, but tension over viscosity, which can also change). This ratio increases linearly in time and by supposing that the lateral tension is roughly constant, we might underestimate the basal tension increase. We may thus view it as giving a rough approximation of the contractility increase which precise value is adjusted in the theoretical model to fit the experiments. We added a statement to the subsection “A simple biophysical model of the actomyosin cortex for the formation and maintenance of equatorial actomyosin ring”.</p><p>We now make this clearer in the text and thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention.</p><p><italic>4) When changing assumptions for boundary tension to S=0.95C (5.2.2) the average filament velocity is not in good agreement with the model prediction anymore</italic>. <italic>Since in this case the model prediction changes quantitatively, the assumption of S=C might be too much of a simplification</italic>?</p><p>We first would like to emphasise that the choice S=C is not arbitrary, as it is the only one leading to a homogeneous actin distribution before elongation (low contractility and polarity) as observed experimentally. We discussed this in more detail in the model presentation.</p><p>In the supplementary material, we indeed show that if we perturb the constraint S=C, the actomyosin flow is strongly perturbed which suggests that the tension externally applied by the neighbouring cells strongly regulates the actomyosin flow. Notice however that this does not invalidate the model as, if we fix S≠C, we could still get a good agreement with experiments from adjusting the boundary flux parameter.</p><p>The main aim of the model is to expose the simplest mechanical agents driving the migration of the ring. For this, we focus on a single a cell and impose a simple force boundary condition consistent with a homogeneous cortex at low basal contractility and polarity. We thank again the reviewer for suggesting us to investigate if this condition evolves during the elongation process and it is our hope that future works analysing the whole 39 cells assembly will shed more light on this boundary condition.</p><p><italic>5) Is polarity still intact in blebbistatin treated embryos?

(2015)</italic></xref> <italic>shows the incorrect localization of PCP components (Prickle) upon blebbistatin treatment. In case polarity is disrupted, would blebbistatin treatment then not reflect decrease in contractility in addition to loss in polarity</italic>, <italic>whereas in the model decrease in contractility will not at the same time lead to a change in polarity</italic>?</p><p>As migration in blebbistatin-treated embryos was always towards same (anterior) side, there is clearly still polarity in the system. Actually we show on Appendix 5–figure 3 that disrupting the polarity in a mild way by adding a small posterior flux does not affect our results on migration at all (in physical terms, an important theoretical result is that the system is locally robust with respect to this type of perturbation). We discussed this again in the presentation of the model.</p><p><italic>6) The question of why the authors focused on actin polymerization and did not consider modulations of myosin contractility was not addressed (point 3 in previous comments)</italic>.</p><p>We would like to point out that although our argument relies on actin polymerization, because of its known link to Dsh and PCP, our 1D model is an effective model of both actin and myosin as a gel treated as single specie with the assumption that bipolar filaments performing the contractile power stroke co-localize with actin. Therefore, our assumption that actin is brought preferentially at the anterior side resulting in an effective increased contractility there (because of increased density), which would be very similar qualitatively to considering preferential myosin activity. We made the connection more explicit in our revision and discussed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Newman-Smith et al. (2015)</xref> in the Results section and in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>7) Suggestions for</italic> aimless <italic>mutant (point 5 in previous comments) have not been sufficiently addressed</italic>.</p><p>The initial suggestion of the reviewer is interesting. However, live-imaging in these conditions is extremely challenging for several reasons. In <italic>pcp</italic> mutants, cell intercalation is disrupted in the notochord. Only few last cells present a normal elongated shape. In addition, until the later stage of embryonic development, we cannot distinguish which cells are PCP mutants (we have no early genetic marker in <italic>Ciona)</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) The paper lacks necessary background and motivation (this would mainly be in the Introduction, but could permeate the paper). The biological significance of the actomyosin phenomenon under study is not explained. The reader does not discover how the actomyosin ring under study is related to elongation</italic>.</p><p>We have re-edited the text and added additional explanations in the Introduction. In particular, we have made explicit the connection between ring positioning and cell shape, but also the fact that in cytokinesis, precise ring positioning is crucial to ensure the proper segregation of fate determinants (Clevers et al., Nature Genetics, 2005; Sedzinski et al., Nature, 2011 for instance)</p><p><italic>What is the mechanism? A reference to</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53"><italic>Sehring et al. (2014)</italic></xref> <italic>is inadequate. Why should we be concerned about the migration of this ring</italic>?</p><p>In Sehring et al. (PLOS Biology, 2014), the scenario we present is that the force generated by actomyosin constriction transmits pinches from the basal cortex to the anterior and posterior lateral domains, and therefore elongates the cell because the cytoplasm is incompressible, thus driving notochord elongation.</p><p>Crucially, in our previous studies, we found that the position of contractile rings significantly influences notochord cell shape and elongation. For example, in α-actinin mutants, the ring cannot maintain at the equator and the cells hereby fail to elongate and become asymmetric shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sehring et al., 2014</xref>). This stimulated us to focus on the position of rings, which we clarify in our Introduction.</p><p>As the referee correctly points out, it will be intriguing in the future to study quantitatively in more details the interplay between ring positioning, that we elucidate here, and the detailed cell shape.</p><p><italic>2) In the figures, there is no sign of actin away from the ring and the poles. There is presumably an extended actomyosin cortex everywhere (assumed by the model) yet we don't see it in images</italic>. <italic>Why is it invisible</italic>?</p><p>This is indeed an illusion: we corrected the background in all the figures showing intensity profiles, and the actin is never zero (typically 1/3 to 1/4 of the peak). We clarified that the cortex is continuous in the introduction to the modelling.</p><p><italic>3) In the model, a 3 dimensional stress σ is evolved in space and time. And yet variations of σ in the direction normal to the cell surface are not addressed. Presumably, there is an unstated assumption that variations of σ across the cortex are small and can be neglected? This (or whatever the assumption is) should be clearly stated and it should be explained how this leads to the model equations</italic>.</p><p>We thank the referee for raising this point.</p><p>Indeed, we have used the lubrication approximation to integrate over variations in the perpendicular direction to the gel. This is a very common approximation in hydrodynamics, valid if the thickness of the cortex is small compared to the length of the cell. And indeed, typical cortex thickness is 100-200 nanometers, whereas the typical cell length is 10 microns, two orders of magnitude above.</p><p>We now made this more explicit in the model presentation.</p><p><italic>4) The model assumed a nonzero actomyosin flux at the anterior side. This boundary condition was the feature of the model that caused migration and positioning of the ring near the equator</italic>.</p><p>We would like to point out that the actomyosin flux at the anterior side does not cause the migration per se. It allows the distribution of actin at low contractility to be polarized and not homogeneous. The positioning of the ring to the equator is due to the increased contractility, which shifts the ring to the center. We clarified this in the modelling part.</p><p><italic>The authors claim this assumption is “supported by the well-studied link between PCP and actin polymerization, notably via Disheveled, which regulates actin assembly”, citing the study of Kida et al. (subsection “A simple biophysical model of the actomyosin cortex for the formation and maintenance of equatorial actomyosin ring”). Given the critical role of this assumption, it requires a much more explicit justification that can be properly judged by a reviewer and readers of the journal. What does actin polymerization have to do with it, and how does actin polymerization lead to actomyosin flux, etc.? Detailed, self-contained explanation is needed. A reader should be able to discover why the flux boundary condition is the uniquely correct one, without studying Kida et al</italic>.</p><p>We thank the referee for the suggestion and present the link between PCP and actin assembly much more explicitly in the main text. However, we would like to mention that the “positioning of the ring near the equator” mentioned by the referee is not due to boundary condition, but only due to acto-myosin contractility, which we also make more explicit in the new manuscript (and related to comment 7).</p><p><italic>5) The assumption that basal stress</italic> <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf103"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">σ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> <italic>increases ∼ 1.5 fold during ring migration is apparently based on a force balance using the measured angle θ between the lateral and basal sides (subsection “A simple biophysical model of the actomyosin cortex for the formation and maintenance of equatorial actomyosin ring”,</italic> <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4"><italic>Appendix 4</italic></xref><italic>). No data is presented to justify this, neither is any actual force balance equation presented. The validity of the claim is impossible to judge as a result</italic>.</p><p>The data to justify this is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, which displays changes in measured changes θ at different time points. We clarify this point, and write explicitly force balance at the lateral/basal interface in the main text, in order to make the reasoning clear.</p><p><italic>6) Related to (2), is it reasonable to assume that γ is constant in time? What is the justification? This was used to deduce the value of the stress</italic> <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf104"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">σ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p><p>As we discussed for the comment of Reviewer 1, this is the simplest hypothesis one can make.</p><p><italic>7) The model presentation could be improved. The entire model (i.e. equations) plus boundary conditions (essential to all of the results) should be clearly laid out in sequence. At present, the initial conditions and boundary conditions are often not stated or buried in text. Examples</italic>:</p><p><italic>a) In the fourth paragraph of subsection “A simple biophysical model of the actomyosin cortex for the formation and maintenance of equatorial actomyosin ring”, the initial condition is not stated although the boundary conditions are in the previous paragraph</italic>.</p><p><italic>b) In the fifth paragraph of the aforementioned subsection, neither initial nor boundary conditions are stated. The key assumptions of their model (third paragraph) were presented after the model was applied to the homogeneous cortex case (second paragraph). Further, it is unclear if the length of the ring is fixed as an input of the model or evolves dynamically</italic>.</p><p>We thank the referee for the suggestion, and followed his guidelines to expand the presentation of the theory section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
