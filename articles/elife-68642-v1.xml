Whether these enzymes also influence feeding preference is largely unknown. We studied the metabolization of taraxinic acid β-D-glucopyranosyl ester (TA-G), a sesquiterpene lactone of the common dandelion (<italic>Taraxacum officinale</italic>) that deters its major root herbivore, the common cockchafer larva (<italic>Melolontha melolontha</italic>). We have demonstrated that TA-G is rapidly deglucosylated and conjugated to glutathione in the insect gut. A broad-spectrum <italic>M. melolontha</italic> β-glucosidase, Mm_bGlc17, is sufficient and necessary for TA-G deglucosylation. Using cross-species RNA interference, we have shown that Mm_bGlc17 reduces TA-G toxicity. Furthermore, Mm_bGlc17 is required for the preference of <italic>M. melolontha</italic> larvae for TA-G-deficient plants. Thus, herbivore metabolism modulates both the toxicity and deterrence of a plant defense compound. Our work illustrates the multifaceted roles of insect digestive enzymes as mediators of plant-herbivore interactions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants produce certain substances to fend off attackers like plant-feeding insects. To stop these compounds from damaging their own cells, plants often attach sugar molecules to them. When an insect tries to eat the plant, the plant removes the stabilizing sugar, ‘activating’ the compounds and making them toxic or foul-tasting. Curiously, some insects remove the sugar themselves, but it is unclear what consequences this has, especially for insect behavior.</p><p>Dandelions, <italic>Taraxacum officinale</italic>, make high concentrations of a sugar-containing defense compound in their roots called taraxinic acid β-D-glucopyranosyl ester, or TA-G for short. TA-G deters the larvae of the Maybug – a pest also known as the common cockchafer or the doodlebug – from eating dandelion roots. When Maybug larvae do eat TA-G, it is found in their systems without its sugar. However, it is unclear whether it is the plant or the larva that removes the sugar. A second open question is how the sugar removal process affects the behavior of the Maybug larvae.</p><p>Using chemical analysis and genetic manipulation, Huber et al. investigated what happens when Maybug larvae eat TA-G. This revealed that the acidity levels in the larvae’s digestive system deactivate the proteins from the dandelion that would normally remove the sugar from TA-G. However, rather than leaving the compound intact, larvae remove the sugar from TA-G themselves. They do this using a digestive enzyme, known as a beta-glucosidase, that cuts through sugar. Removing the sugar from TA-G made the compound less toxic, allowing the larvae to grow bigger, but it also increased TA-G’s deterrent effects, making the larvae less likely to eat the roots.</p><p>Any organism that eats plants, including humans, must deal with chemicals like TA-G in their food. Once inside the body, enzymes can change these chemicals, altering their effects. This happens with many medicines, too. In the future, it might be possible to design compounds that activate only in certain species, or under certain conditions. Further studies in different systems may aid the development of new methods of pest control, or new drug treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Melolontha melolontha</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Taraxacum officinale</italic></kwd><kwd>plant defense</kwd><kwd>root herbivore</kwd><kwd>sesquiterpene lactone</kwd><kwd>β-glucosidase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>422213951</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huber</surname><given-names>Meret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P400PB_186770</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huber</surname><given-names>Meret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FP7 Research and Technological Development of the European Union</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7 MC-CIG 629134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erb</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_189071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>Christelle AM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>153517</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erb</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An insect digestive enzyme metabolizes a plant defense compound and thereby modulates herbivore performance and host plant choice, which in turn may alter plant defense evolution in nature.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants produce an arsenal of toxic secondary metabolites, many of which protect them against phytophagous insects by acting as toxins, digestibility reducers, repellents, and deterrents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mithöfer and Boland, 2012</xref>). Insect herbivores commonly metabolize defense metabolites, with important consequences for the toxicity of the compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heckel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pentzold et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies identified a series of enzymes that metabolize plant defense metabolites and thereby benefit herbivore growth and fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poreddy et al., 2015</xref>). However, to date, the behavioral consequences of insect metabolism of plant defense metabolites are little understood, despite the importance of behavioral effects of plant defenses for plant fitness and evolution in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mithöfer and Boland, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huber et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huber et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">War et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Insect enzymes that were identified to metabolize plant defense compounds belong mainly to a few large enzyme classes including the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, UDP-glycosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heidel-Fischer and Vogel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bass et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maag et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wouters et al., 2014</xref>). However, members of other enzyme groups can participate in detoxification, some of which are also involved in primary digestive processes for the breakdown of carbohydrates (β-glucosidases), proteins (proteases), and lipids (lipases). For instance, a <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> β-glucosidase deglycosylates the <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> diterpene glycoside lyciumoside IV, thus alleviating its toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poreddy et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, the Mexican bean weevil (<italic>Zabrotes subfasciatus</italic>) expresses a protease that degrades α-amylase inhibitors from its host, the common bean (<italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ishimoto and Chrispeels, 1996</xref>). Finally, several insects degrade antinutritional plant protease inhibitors through intestinal proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giri et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhu-Salzman and Zeng, 2015</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that families of typical digestive enzymes should be examined more carefully for possible roles in the detoxification of plant chemicals.</p><p>Enzymes involved in carbohydrate digestion may play a particular role in processing plant defense glycosides. Such compounds are typically considered protoxins, non-toxic, glycosylated precursors that are brought into contact with compartmentalized plant glycosidases upon tissue damage to yield toxic aglycones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wittstock and Gershenzon, 2002</xref>). Both plant and insect glycosidases may activate plant defense glycosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pentzold et al., 2014</xref>). The alkaloid glucoside vicine in fava beans, for instance, is hydrolyzed to the toxic aglycone divicine in the gut of bruchid beetles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Desroches et al., 1997</xref>). Similarly, phenolic glycoside toxins are hydrolyzed rapidly by <italic>Papilio glaucus</italic>, the eastern tiger swallowtail. <italic>P. glaucus</italic> subspecies adapted to phenolic glycoside-containing poplars and willow show significantly lower hydrolysis of these metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lindroth, 1988</xref>). Finally, iridoid glycosides from <italic>Plantago</italic> species are hydrolyzed and thereby activated by herbivore-derived β-glucosidases, and β-glucosidase activity is negatively correlated with host plant adaptation both within and between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pankoke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pankoke and Dobler, 2015</xref>). These studies show that herbivore-derived enzymes may cleave plant protoxins and so may be a target of host plant adaptation. However, the genetic basis of protoxin activation by herbivores and the biological consequences of this phenomenon for insect feeding preference and performance are poorly understood.</p><p>Although the deglycosylation of plant defense metabolites is commonly assumed to be disadvantageous for the herbivore, a recent study in <italic>M. sexta</italic> showed that deglycosylation of a plant glycoside may decrease rather than increase toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poreddy et al., 2015</xref>). Silencing <italic>M. sexta</italic> β-glucosidase one resulted in developmental defects in larvae feeding on <italic>N. attenuata</italic> plants producing the diterpene glycoside lyciumoside IV (Lyc4), but not in larvae feeding on Lyc4-deficient plants, suggesting that deglycosylation detoxifies rather than activates Lyc4. Although Lyc4 is an atypical defensive glycoside that carries several different sugar moieties and is only partially deglycosylated by <italic>M. sexta</italic>, these results bring up the possibility that defensive activation by glycoside hydrolysis does not necessarily increase the toxicity of these compounds, but may be a detoxification strategy. Clearly, more research on how glycoside hydrolysis by digestive enzymes impacts herbivores is needed to understand the role of this process in plant-herbivore interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pentzold et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poreddy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marti et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The herbivore toxins derived from glycoside protoxins have often been investigated for their defensive roles in connection with herbivore growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poreddy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Desroches et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lindroth, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pankoke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pankoke and Dobler, 2015</xref>) rather than feeding deterrence, despite the fact that the latter is a well-established mechanism for plant protection in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pollard, 1992</xref>). For example, the maize benzoxazinoid glucoside HDMBOA-Glc reduces food intake by <italic>Spodoptera</italic> caterpillars as soon as the glucoside moiety is cleaved off by plant β-glucosidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glauser et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, the deterrent effect of cyanogenic glucosides in <italic>Sorghum</italic> toward <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> is directly dependent on a functional plant β-glucosidase that releases cyanide upon tissue disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krothapalli et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, different glucosinolate breakdown products have been shown to affect oviposition and feeding choices by <italic>Pieris rapae</italic> and <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Vos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mumm et al., 2008</xref>). However, whether protoxin activation by herbivore-derived enzymes influences herbivore host plant choice remains unknown.</p><p>All protoxin-activating enzymes that have been characterized so far in insect herbivores are β-glucosidases, which cleave β-D-glucosides and release free glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pentzold et al., 2014</xref>). The primary role of β-glucosidases in insect digestion is to function in the last steps of cellulose and hemicellulose breakdown by converting cellobiose to glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Most insect β-glucosidases, however, also accept other substrates, including various di- and oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids, which may help herbivores to obtain glucose from various sources and enable the further breakdown of glycosylated proteins and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marana et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azevedo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferreira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferreira et al., 2001</xref>). However, the broad substrate specificity of insect β-glucosidases for plant glucosides with an aryl or alkyl moiety may also result in the activation of defense metabolites, as discussed above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Terra and Ferreira, 1994</xref>). Thus, investigating the substrate specificity and the biochemical function of insect β-glucosidases is important to understand the ecology and evolution of insect-mediated protoxin activation.</p><p>Known plant protoxins include glucosinolates, salicinoids, and cyanogenic, iridoid, and benzoxazinoid glycosides. Plants produce many other types of glycosides that may also be protoxins, but most of these have not yet been carefully investigated for their toxicity or metabolic stability in herbivores. Among these potential protoxins are the bitter-tasting sesquiterpene lactone glycosides. Sesquiterpene lactones form a large group of over 2000 plant defense compounds found principally in the Asteraceae family, with glycosides especially common in the latex-producing tribe Cichorieae, which enters the human diet through lettuce, endive, and chicory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chadwick et al., 2013</xref>). These substances have a long appreciated role in defense against insect herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Picman, 1986</xref>), but it is not clear if glycosylated sesquiterpene lactones should be considered as protoxins that are activated by plant damage.</p><p>Here, we studied the metabolism of a sesquiterpene lactone glucoside during the interaction between the common dandelion <italic>Taraxacum officinale</italic> aggregate (Asteraceae, Chicorieae) and the larvae of the common cockchafer, <italic>Melolontha melolontha</italic> (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keller et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hasler, 1986</xref>). <italic>M. melolontha</italic> larvae feed on roots of different plant species including members of Poaceae, Brassicaceae, Salicaceae, and Asteraceae families, which can contain glycosylated defense compounds such as benzoxazinoids, glucosinolates, and salicinoids, as well as sesquiterpene lactone glycosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kondor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hauss and Schütte, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hauss, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sukovata et al., 2015</xref>). The alkaline gut pH of <italic>M. melolontha</italic> (pH = 8.0–8.5) possibly facilitates its polyphagous feeding habit by inhibiting the often acidic activating glucosidases of plant protoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pentzold et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Egert et al., 2005</xref>).

The most abundant latex compound, the sesquiterpene lactone glucoside taraxinic acid (TA) β-D-glucopyranosyl ester (TA-G), deters <italic>M. melolontha</italic> feeding and thereby benefits plant fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huber et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huber et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huber et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To understand the interaction between TA-G and <italic>M. melolontha</italic>, we first investigated whether TA-G is deglucosylated during insect feeding and whether plant or insect enzymes are involved. We then identified <italic>M. melolontha</italic> β-glucosidases that might hydrolyze TA-G through a comparative transcriptomic approach and narrowed down the list of candidate genes through in vitro characterization of heterologously expressed proteins. Finally, we silenced TA-G-hydrolyzing β-glucosidases in <italic>M. melolontha</italic> through RNA interference (RNAi) and determined the effect of these enzymes on TA-G hydrolysis, toxicity, and deterrence in vivo. Taken together, our results reveal that β-glucosidases modify the effects of plant defense metabolites on both herbivore performance and host plant choice, with potentially important consequences for the ecology and evolution of plant-herbivore interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TA-G is deglucosylated and conjugated to GSH during <italic>M. melolontha</italic> feeding</title><p>To test if TA-G is hydrolyzed during <italic>M. melolontha</italic> feeding, we analyzed larvae that had ingested defined amounts of TA-G-containing <italic>T. officinale</italic> latex.

TA-G on the other hand disappeared as soon as the latex was ingested by the larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). TA-glutathione (TA-GSH) and TA-cysteine (TA-Cys) were also identified in latex-fed larvae based on mass spectral and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data, with the Cys sulfhydryl moiety being conjugated to TA at the exocyclic methylene group of the α-methylene-γ-lactone moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>).

No TA-G-GSH or TA-G-Cys conjugates were detected in this experiment. Based on current knowledge of the GSH pathway in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schramm et al., 2012</xref>), it is likely that TA is first conjugated to GSH and then cleaved sequentially to form the other metabolites, although some conjugation to GSH prior to deglucosylation may also occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Quantitative measurements showed that approximately 25% of the ingested TA-G was converted to GSH conjugates and derivatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), with TA-Cys accounting for 95% of all identified compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Furthermore, the effects of plant defense metabolizations on herbivore host plant choice are not understood. Here, we show that a herbivore β-glucosidase deglucosylates a plant secondary metabolite, which modifies both its toxic and deterrent properties and thereby determines the interaction between a plant and its major root-feeding natural enemy.</p><p>Metabolization of plant defense metabolites is considered central for the ability of species to overcome chemical defenses of their host plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heckel, 2014</xref>), and recent papers have established direct molecular evidence for this concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poreddy et al., 2015</xref>). A major metabolization product of TA-G is TA-Cys, with about 25% of the ingested TA-G accumulating in this form. Based on our current knowledge of the GSH pathway in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schramm et al., 2012</xref>), it is likely that TA-G is deglucosylated prior conjugation to GSH and subsequently sequentially cleaved to TA-Cys by peptidases. The first step of this metabolization pathway, the conjugation of GSH to TA, may occur spontaneously and/or via GSH glucosyl-transferases. When we incubated TA and TA-G with high concentrations of GSH and Cys in vitro, several isomers of the conjugates formed that were not detected inside the <italic>M. melolontha</italic> gut, suggesting that enzymatic rather than spontaneous conjugation of GSH to TA prevails inside the larva. Interestingly, TA-Cys mostly accumulated in the anterior midgut, and only neglectable amounts of TA-Cys were excreted by the larvae, a pattern that was stable over long-term feeding of <italic>M. melolontha</italic> on <italic>T. officinale</italic>. Consequently, larvae must further metabolize TA-Cys to yet unknown products, and either store or excrete these compounds. Future experiments with radioisotope-labeled TA-G may shed light into the ultimate fate of TA inside the <italic>M. melolontha</italic> larva, and may help to assess whether <italic>M. melolontha</italic> sequesters TA and uses the compound for its own prupose.</p><p>As the transformation of defense metabolites by insect enyzmes occurs in the gut, metabolization products are considered unlikely to be tasted via frontal sensory structures of insect herbivores. It is thus commonly assumed that there is no direct impact of this process on herbivore behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pentzold et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Simon et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, transformation of defense metabolites by plant enzymes that are activated by tissue disruption is well accepted to have a strong behavioral impact on insect herbivores, which is in line with the rapid and early formation of plant defense catabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glauser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krothapalli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Vos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mumm et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we have found that the insect β-glucosidase Mm_bGlc17, which deglucosylates a defensive sesquiterpene lactone (TA-G) in the insect gut, is also required to elicit the deterrent effect of this metabolite. Our early work on TA-G showed that, in a community context, the capacity of dandelions to produce the glucosylated sesquiterpene lactone reduces <italic>M. melolontha</italic> attack and its negative effect on plant growth and fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huber et al., 2016b</xref>), resulting in the selection of high TA-G genotypes under high <italic>M. melolontha</italic> pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huber et al., 2016a</xref>). As these effects are likely the result of the deterrent, rather than the toxic properties of TA-G, they are likely also directly dependent on the presence of Mm_bGlc17. Thus, the metabolism of <italic>M. melolontha</italic> may not only drive the feeding preferences of the herbivore, but also the ecology and evolution of dandelions in their natural habitat. Insect-detoxifying enzymes may thus shape plant defense evolution not only by reducing the toxicity of defense compounds but also by modulating herbivore host plant choice.</p><p>Many plant defensive metabolites are glycosides, which are typically non-toxic themselves but are deglucosylated upon herbivore damage, forming toxic products. Both plant- and herbivore-derived β-glucosidases can mediate deglycosylation in the insect gut, but their relative contribution is often unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pentzold et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Desroches et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lindroth, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pankoke et al., 2012</xref>). Here we provide several parallel lines of evidence to demonstrate that the deglucosylation of TA-G, a glucosylated secondary metabolite in the latex of <italic>T. officinale</italic>, depends primarily on β-glucosidases from <italic>M. melolontha</italic> rather than on plant enzymes. First, <italic>T. officinale</italic> TA-G hydrolase activity has an acidic pH optimum (4.8–5.4), and the activity is very low at the alkaline pH (8.0) found in the gut of <italic>M. melolontha</italic>. Second, TA-G is deglucosylated by <italic>M. melolontha</italic> gut extracts in the absence of plant material. Third, the presence of TA-G-hydrolyzing latex proteins in TA-G-containing diet does not result in higher amounts of TA or TA conjugates inside <italic>M. melolontha</italic> compared to the diet with heat-deactivated latex proteins. Fourth, <italic>M. melolontha</italic> expresses several β-glucosidases with TA-G-hydrolyzing activity as demonstrated in in vitro assays. Fifth, silencing the <italic>M. melolontha</italic> TA-G β-glucosidase Mm_bGlc17 reduces TA-G deglucosylation activity in larval gut extracts and abolishes the avoidance behavior of <italic>M. melolontha</italic> toward TA-G-containing plants. Together, these results demonstrate that insect rather than plant β-glucosidases hydrolyze ingested TA-G in <italic>M. melolontha</italic>.</p><p>A large number of plant glycosides are protoxins that are activated by deglycosylation including glucosinolates, benzoxazinoids, salicinoids, alkaloid glycosides, cyanogenic glycosides, and iridoid glycosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mithöfer and Boland, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pentzold et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wittstock and Gershenzon, 2002</xref>). But, until now nothing was known about whether sesquiterpene lactone glycosides are also protoxins. Sesquiterpene lactone aglycones are much more potent than their corresponding glycosides in pharmacological studies of cytotoxicity and anti-cancer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seto et al., 1988</xref>). However, the consequences of sesquiterpene lactone deglycosylation for herbivore behavior and performance have not been previously investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sessa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Graziani et al., 2015</xref>). Our experiments show that deglucosylation of TA-G is associated with an increase rather than a decrease in larval growth on TA-G-producing plants. This suggests that the cleavage of TA-G to TA reduces rather than enhances the toxicity of this sesquiterpene lactone. Several explanations for this phenomenon are possible. First, GSH may be more rapidly conjugated by TA than TA-G, and thus deglucosylation is a step toward detoxification. Second, if the target site of TA-G lies in a hydrophilic compartment (such as the gut lumen), deglucosylation may block its activity. Third, the glucose liberated by TA-G deglucosylation may enhance the nutritional quality of dandelion roots for the larvae. When we compared dandelion roots exposed to different native grassland species in previous studies, we found both positive and negative correlations between root glucose levels and larval growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting a high degree of context dependency. In summary, our results provide evidence that deglycosylation of plant defenses may reduce negative impacts on herbivores. Deglycosylation of a diterpene glycoside of <italic>N. attenuata</italic> was also found to reduce its toxicity, but in this case, the product still contained two other glycoside moieties and thus differs little from its substrate in terms of polarity compared to the differences between TA and TA-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poreddy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>While Mm_bGlc17 improves larval performance on TA-G-producing plants, the enzyme is also required for <italic>M. melolontha</italic> larvae to avoid TA-G. We propose two mechanisms that may be responsible for these counterintuitive results. First, the recognition of TA-G through deglucosylation may guide the <italic>M. melolontha</italic> larva to feeding sites that are most suitable for fast larval growth, independently of the toxicity of TA-G. Exploitation of plant secondary metabolites and sugars to locate nutritious tissue has been reported, for instance, for the specialist root herbivore <italic>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</italic> feeding on maize roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Robert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Machado et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Melolontha melolontha</italic> larvae preferentially feed on side roots of dandelions, which contain lower TA-G and higher soluble protein levels than main roots and also may be more nutritious as they are actively growing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huber et al., 2016b</xref>). Thus, the larvae may not be avoiding TA-G because of its toxicity, but because avoiding high TA-G levels guides them to nutritious roots, with the avoidance behavior being facilitated by <italic>Mm_bGlc17</italic>.</p><p>A second explanation for the observed patterns may be that herbivore growth by itself gives an incomplete picture regarding the costs of TA-G consumption and metabolism. It has been shown, for instance, that plant secondary metabolites can enhance larval weight gain, but at the same time increase larval mortality, suggesting that growth is not always beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Veyrat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erb, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, TA may change the susceptibility of the larvae to parasites and pathogens, as has been shown for the plant volatile indole in maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ye et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, the hydrolysis of TA-G may deplete the level of cysteine inside the larva through conjugation of TA to glutathione, as has been observed in lepidopteran larvae that conjugate food-derived isothiocyanates to GSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jeschke et al., 2016</xref>). The negative consequences of Cys depletion on larval performance may only be observed under stressful conditions, for instance, under nutrient limitations or in the presence of other toxic allelochemicals that require detoxification through GSH conjugation. Thus, it is possible that under natural conditions, Mm_bGlc17-dependent cleavage of TA-G reduces rather than enhances <italic>M. melolontha</italic> fitness, which may explain Mm_bGlc17-mediated TA-G avoidance. The gene may, nevertheless, be maintained in the insect genome if Mm_bGlc17 is important for the larva to acquire nutrients. In such a scenario, dandelions would exploit a promiscuous β-glucosidase (Mm_bGlc17) whose evolution is constrained by its primary functions in nutrient acquisition.</p><p>If the evolution of Mm_bGlc17 is constrained by its primary function, such constraints may be alleviated by down-regulating the expression of the gene under harmful conditions, as has been observed for other insect β-glucosidases in the presence of glycosydic protoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pentzold et al., 2014</xref>). In our study, while the initial RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) analysis did not detect differences in <italic>Mm_bGlc17</italic> expression in the presence and absence of TA-G, our follow-up quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis on <italic>M. melolontha</italic> larvae feeding on transgenic plants showed that <italic>Mm_bGlc17</italic> is up-regulated in the presence of TA-G. Further experiments are required to determine whether this discrepancy is due to different methods and sample sizes or due to differences in TA-G concentration, the presence of a plant matrix, or the genotypic background of the <italic>M. melolontha</italic> larvae. Despite these uncertainties, the observed up-regulation of <italic>Mm_bGlc17</italic> expression in the presence of TA-G is compatible with a beneficial role of this enzyme for <italic>M. melolontha</italic> feeding on TA-G-producing dandelions. A more detailed understanding of the role of Mm_bGlc17 and TA-G under natural conditions and over the full 3-year life cycle of <italic>M. melolontha</italic> would help to shed light on whether the expression of <italic>Mm_bGlc17</italic> is indeed beneficial for the larvae.</p><p>While Mm-bGlc17 is required for the feeding deterrence of TA-G, the underlying physiological mechanisms that lead to TA-G avoidance are unclear. On the one hand, insect feeding preference may be triggered by the presence of the aglycone TA or TA conjugates inside the gut. These metabolites may bind to specific receptors that face the gut lumen or are located inside the gut membrane, and thereby alter herbivore host plant choice. Additionally, reduction of GSH or Cys levels through conjugation to TA may be perceived by the larvae and thereby alter herbivore feeding preference, although this scenario is less likely as GSH or Cys depletion likely requires longer time than the immediately observed feeding responses of naive <italic>M. melolontha</italic> larvae. On the other hand, TA or its conjugates may be present at low concentrations inside the <italic>M. melolontha</italic> mouth, for instance, via regurgitation or through direct formation due to the potential presence of Mm_bGlc17 in the saliva, and may thus be detected by gustatory receptors that modulate herbivore host plant choice. We found that forced regurgitants of <italic>M. melolontha</italic> possess TA-G-hydrolyzing activity; however, it is unclear whether forced regurgitants are informative to infer normal feeding processes of the larvae. While Mm_bGlc17 is highly abundant in the gut, it is unclear whether Mm_bGlc17 is also present in the saliva. Analyzing the expression profile of <italic>Mm_bGlc17</italic> across different organs of the <italic>M. melolontha</italic> larva, as well as performing neurosensory experiments with orally administered TA, would help to shed light onto the exact mechanisms underlying TA feeding deterrence.</p><p>Interestingly, besides TA-G, Mm_bGlc17 deglycosylates other substrates, including cellobiose and salicinoid and benzoxazinoid defense compounds. The ability of this enzyme to hydrolyze benzoxazinoids seems counterintuitive from the insect’s perspective since benzoxazinoid hydrolysis increases both feeding deterrence as well as toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glauser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Vos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mumm et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wittstock et al., 2003</xref>), raising the possibility that some plants can co-opt insect enzymes to activate their own defenses. On the other hand, insects are known to have evolved some resistance to plant glycosidic protoxins by inhibiting the activating glycosidases of plants and down-regulating their own activating glycosidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pentzold et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Desroches et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lindroth, 1988</xref>). The fact that Mm_bGlc17 catalyzes the hydrolysis of a range of glucosides plus the glucose ester TA-G is also unusual. There are only a few previous reports of enzymes with this versatility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakano et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Okamoto et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The ability of Mm_bGlc17 to mediate hydrolysis of cellobiose, a disaccharide derived from cellulose, suggests its evolutionary origin as a digestive enzyme that was later recruited for processing plant defenses. The relatively large number of β-glucosidases in many insect herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pentzold et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poreddy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beran et al., 2014</xref>) and their species-specific phylogenetic clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beran et al., 2014</xref>) indicate that in addition to contributing to the digestion of cell wall carbohydrates—which are mostly shared among plant species—many β-glucosidases also act on a variety of specialized metabolites, such as plant defense compounds. Thus, plant defenses may play an underestimated role in the evolution of β-glucosidases in insect herbivores. Other herbivore digestive enzymes may also interact with plant defenses, leading to changes in herbivore performance and behavior, which likely modulate the ecology and evolution of plants and their consumers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Melolontha melolontha</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Mm_bGlc17</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Taraxacum officinale</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TA-G-deficient plants</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002332">10.1371/journal.pbio.1002332</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">A34-RNAi-1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. melolontha</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Mm_bGlc17</italic> silenced</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See ‘Materials and methods’ (‘TA-G deglucosylation activity in RNAi-silenced <italic>M. melolontha</italic> larvae’)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">High Five Cells</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (<italic>T. ni</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pIB/V5-His TOPO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>M. melolontha</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>M. melolontha</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Collection of different natural populations</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>T. officianle</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>T. officinale</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Doi:</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Different natural genotypes</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Plasmid pGJ 2648</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Supplied by Dr. Christian Schulze-Gronover, Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pCR2.1-TOPO plasmids</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Life Technologies</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">cDNAs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Kapa Biosystems</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">innuPREP RNA Mini Kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RNeasy Plant Mini Kit;

The final yields of the conjugates were TA-G-GSH: 2.1 mg; TA-G-Cys: 0.38 mg; TA-GSH: 1.47 mg; TA-Cys: 0.23 mg. Purified fractions were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy for structure verification.

Injection volume was 5 μl. Metabolite separation was accomplished on a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 column (50 × 4.6 mm, 1.8 μm; Agilent Technologies). The mobile phase consisted of 0.05% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B) using a flow rate of 1.1 ml min<sup>–1</sup> with the following gradient: 0 min: 5% B, 0.5 min: 5% B, 4 min: 55% B, 4.1 min: 90% B, 5 min: 90% B, followed by column reconditioning. The column temperature was kept at 20°C. The ion spray voltage was maintained at –4.5 keV. The turbo gas temperature was set at 600°C. Nebulizing gas was set at 50 psi, curtain gas at 20 psi, heating gas at 60 psi, and collision gas at 5 psi. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in negative mode monitored analyte parent ion → product ion: m/z 423 → 261 (collision energy (CE) –14 V; declustering potential (DP) –40 V) for TA-G; m/z 730 → 143, (CE –66 V; DP –80 V) for TA-G-GSH; m/z 544 → 382 (CE –26 V; DP –80 V) for TA-G-Cys; m/z 261 → 217 (CE –14 V; DP –30 V) for TA; m/z 568 → 143 (CE –44 V; DP –50 V) for TA-GSH; m/z 382 → 120 (CE –30 V; DP –45 V) for TA-Cys; m/z 568 → 143 (CE –44 V; DP –50 V) for loganic acid.

The identity and purity of the isolated 4-MSOB were checked by LC-MS (Bruker Esquire 6000; Bruker Daltonics, Bremen) and 1 H NMR (500 MHz model; Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). The deglucosylation of 4-MSOB was quantified based on the formation of 4-MSOB isothiocyanate with an API 3200 LC-MS as described above operating in positive ionization mode. Injection volume was 5 μl using a flow rate of 1.1 ml*min<sup>–1</sup>. Metabolite separation was accomplished with ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 column (50 × 4.6 mm, 1.8 μm; Agilent Technologies) using the following gradient of 0.05% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B): 0 min: 3% B, 0.5 min: 15% B, 2.5 min: 85% B, 2.6 min: 100% B, 3.5 min: 100% B, followed by column reconditioning.

Hydrolysis of Glc-MU was scored visually by the presence of fluorescence in samples excited with UV light at 360 nm using a gel imaging system (Syngene).</p><p>Activity of the heterologously expressed β-glucosidases was categorized into presence and absence based on the formation of the respective aglycones of TA-G, BXDs, salicin, and 4-MSOB, and the decrease of the substrate for cellobiose. For the secondary metabolites, activity was accepted if the aglycone concentration was threefold higher than the mean aglycone concentration of the controls (GFP, WT; except only WT for TA-G). For cellobiose, activity was scored as positive if the cellobiose concentration after the assay was lower than 30% of the cellobiose concentration of the controls (GFP, WT). The enzymatic assays were performed three times (except TA-G only twice) with freshly harvested recombinant proteins within 2 weeks, which gave similar results ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In a thoroughly investigated case study the detoxification strategy of cockchafer larvae towards the major defensive compound of one of their preferred host plants, dandelion, are revealed and effects on the behavior of the larvae described.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A β-glucosidase of an insect herbivore determines both toxicity and deterrence of a dandelion defense metabolite&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Youngsung Joo as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Meredith Schuman as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Susanne Dobler (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Both reviewer 1 and 3 argue that the current discussion for the deterrent behavior causing by silencing β-glucosidase need to be more specified.</p><p>2) Detoxification of TA-G by cockchafer larvae has been nicely analyzed in Figure 1, but there are more interesting results which the author did not properly interpret, e.g. the frass only contained a trace amount of TA-associated metabolites. Both reviewers 2 and 3 argue that the metabolic fate of TA-G needs to be discussed more.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>However, I still consider that the following concerns should be considered and addressed:</p><p>1. I think one of the key take-home messages of this manuscript is the behavioral consequence of herbivore digestive enzymes. It is a very interesting and striking result. I know it would be very difficult to give a solid mechanism for how it works, but it is necessary to discuss how Mm_bGluc17-associated deglycosylation can alter herbivore behavior. In addition, to explain the feeding preference data, the authors suggested two hypotheses. I fully agree the first one (&quot;good feeding site hypothesis&quot;), but I could not understand well for the second hypothesis. Could you explain which ecological context really Mm_bGluc17-dependent cleavage of TA-G decrease herbivore fitness and then why they still have Mm_bGluc17-dependent cleavage of TA-G?</p><p>2. Inducibility of Mm_bGluc17 is inconsistent between Figure 3 and Figure 4. In Figure 3, transcript abundances of Mm_bGluc17 did not differ among the treatment groups (water, TA-G, and Latex). However, the transcript abundances of Mm_bGluc17 decreased in the larvae fed on TA-G deficient plants compared to the larvae fed on WT plants. Could you explain why they are different?</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Regarding the metabolic fate of dietary TA-G, a major metabolite was detected as TA-Cys (25%), which is distributed in the body and mainly accumulated in the anterior midgut (Lines 160 – 163 and Figure 1D), whereas only a trace amount of TA-G was identified in frass, compared to the total amount consumed within 24 hr (Lines 163-164 and Lines 176 – 177, Figure 1E). It leads me to call into a couple of questions: (1) Is TA-Cys the ultimate final metabolite of TA-G? Or can it be further processed to other metabolites? (2) It seems that TA-Cys is not likely excreted out of body. If it continues, the larvae could be doused with a thick concentration of TA-Cys. Do you think it is sequestered for any further utilization for its own benefit? Otherwise, it should be ultimately excreted, which doesn't seem so within 24 hr. (3) The distribution map is a snapshot at 24 hr post-feeding. Can it be a different distribution pattern in a long-term observation? Please give your answers either to each question or as a whole. I suggest authors add a paragraph in Discussion to deal with this issue. Current discussion is mostly focused on the β-glucosidase found in the herbivore gut, but I think the metabolic fate data would pave a ground way for further research.</p><p>2. As soon as TA-G is hydrolyzed, it seems to be simultaneously conjugated with GSH, resulting in TA-Cys after consecutive enzymatic processes. Although β-glucosidase is the enzyme acting at the first step, other enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) and peptidases, may not be less significant. Non-enzymatic processes could be carried out instead, since it seems to happen very quickly. However, I cannot find any mention about these possible occasions. I suggest authors add a mention probably together with the comment 1 above.</p><p>3. Regarding the second evidence of your claim (Lines 345-347), TA-G is deglycosylated by the gut extracts not only in the absence of plant material, but also in the presence of plant material (Figure 2C – TA-G panel). Also, &quot;the presence of plant extract with active TA-G glycohydrolases does not increase TA-G deglycosylation&quot;, compared to what? It looks true when compared to the insect gut extracts only, but it is not true when compared to the treatment of &quot;plant enzyme + and diet&quot; (Figure 2C – TA panel). Also the &quot;active TA-G glycohydrolases&quot; is not clear what it means: plant or insect one? From another perspective, I am wondering whether the reaction substrate (TA-G) was sufficiently enough or not in the latex coated on carrot slices for the enzymatic conversions. The Figure 2C – TA-G panel shows that the substrate TA-G was almost completely depleted (presumably by deglycosylation) at the given condition (substrate concentration, reaction time, etc.), which could probably tell that the TA-G was not sufficiently enough to in the beginning. If there was a sufficient amount of substrate, it could have been shown that &quot;the plant extract with active TA-G glycohydrolases&quot; DOES increase TA-G deglycosylation in addition to the insect activity.

We now address these issues in the revised manuscript, and replied to the reviewers point by point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>However, I still consider that the following concerns should be considered and addressed:</p><p>1. I think one of the key take-home messages of this manuscript is the behavioral consequence of herbivore digestive enzymes. It is a very interesting and striking result. I know it would be very difficult to give a solid mechanism for how it works, but it is necessary to discuss how Mm_bGluc17-associated deglycosylation can alter herbivore behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. The neurophysiological mechanisms that lead to TA-G avoidance are unclear. On the one hand, it is possible that TA or a TA conjugates bind to specific receptors inside the gut, and thereby modulate herbivore behaviour. On the other hand, TA may be present at low concentrations in the larval mouth part, either through regurgitants or the presence of Mm_bGlc17 in the insect saliva, and activate gustatory receptors that alter herbivore behavior. We now discuss these possibilities in more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, to explain the feeding preference data, the authors suggested two hypotheses. I fully agree the first one (&quot;good feeding site hypothesis&quot;), but I could not understand well for the second hypothesis. Could you explain which ecological context really Mm_bGluc17-dependent cleavage of TA-G decrease herbivore fitness and then why they still have Mm_bGluc17-dependent cleavage of TA-G?</p></disp-quote><p>While the glucohydrolysis of TA-G seems to improve <italic>M. melolontha</italic> growth under laboratory conditions, the presence of other biotic or abiotic stresses may reverse the beneficial effects of TA-G deglycosylation. For instance, the hydrolysis of TA-G may deplete the level of cysteine inside the larva through conjugation to glutathione. Under stressful conditions, e.g. under nutrient limitations or in the presence of other toxic allelochemicals, the depletion of cysteine may have negative impacts on the larva. If Mm_bGlc17 is however critical for the larvae to acquire nutrients, the gene may still be maintained in the genome, as the net effect might be positive for the larva. Thus, the common dandelion would exploit a promiscuous β-glucosidase whose evolution is constrained by its primary function in nutrient acquisition. We now explain these points in more details in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Inducibility of Mm_bGluc17 is inconsistent between Figure 3 and Figure 4. In Figure 3, transcript abundances of Mm_bGluc17 did not differ among the treatment groups (water, TA-G, and Latex). However, the transcript abundances of Mm_bGluc17 decreased in the larvae fed on TA-G deficient plants compared to the larvae fed on WT plants. Could you explain why they are different?</p></disp-quote><p>There are several possibilities that may account for the observed differences in the inducibility of Mm_bGlc17 by TA-G. First, this difference might be due to different methodologies and sample sizes used (RNAseq, N=3 vs qPCR, N=12-14). qPCR experiments with high samples sizes are more powerful in detecting differences in gene expression among treatment groups than RNAseq experiments with small sample sizes. Second, the differences in the inducibility may be caused by different TA-G concentrations, the presence of a natural plant matrix, or the genotypic background of the <italic>M. melolontha</italic> larvae. We now mention these aspects in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Regarding the metabolic fate of dietary TA-G, a major metabolite was detected as TA-Cys (25%), which is distributed in the body and mainly accumulated in the anterior midgut (Lines 160 – 163 and Figure 1D), whereas only a trace amount of TA-G was identified in frass, compared to the total amount consumed within 24 hr (Lines 163-164 and Lines 176 – 177, Figure 1E). It leads me to call into a couple of questions: (1) Is TA-Cys the ultimate final metabolite of TA-G? Or can it be further processed to other metabolites? (2) It seems that TA-Cys is not likely excreted out of body. If it continues, the larvae could be doused with a thick concentration of TA-Cys. Do you think it is sequestered for any further utilization for its own benefit? Otherwise, it should be ultimately excreted, which doesn't seem so within 24 hr. (3) The distribution map is a snapshot at 24 hr post-feeding. Can it be a different distribution pattern in a long-term observation? Please give your answers either to each question or as a whole. I suggest authors add a paragraph in Discussion to deal with this issue. Current discussion is mostly focused on the β-glucosidase found in the herbivore gut, but I think the metabolic fate data would pave a ground way for further research.</p></disp-quote><p>To address these questions, we analysed the accumulation of TA-Cys in <italic>M. melolontha</italic> larvae feeding for one month on <italic>T. officinale</italic> plants. This experiment showed that the anterior midgut remains the body part with highest concentration of TA-Cys , followed by the posterior midgut. The hindgut and also the fat tissue contained only small amounts of TA-Cys. Thus, the distribution pattern of <italic>M. melolontha</italic> feeding for prolonged time on TA-G containing diet is similar to the 24h snapshot. Consequently, TA-Cys must be further metabolized to yet unknown products, and these products may either be sequestered or excreted. As we cannot differentiate between these possibilities, we can only speculate whether <italic>M. melolontha</italic> uses TA for its own benefits. We added the data on long-term feeding of <italic>M. melolontha</italic> on <italic>T. officinale</italic> plants into the manuscript and included a paragraph to discuss the metabolic fate of TA-G inside the larva in more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. As soon as TA-G is hydrolyzed, it seems to be simultaneously conjugated with GSH, resulting in TA-Cys after consecutive enzymatic processes. Although β-glucosidase is the enzyme acting at the first step, other enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) and peptidases, may not be less significant. Non-enzymatic processes could be carried out instead, since it seems to happen very quickly. However, I cannot find any mention about these possible occasions. I suggest authors add a mention probably together with the comment 1 above.</p></disp-quote><p>We now discuss the possibility of enzymatic and non-enzymatic conjugation of GSH to TA-G in the same paragraph as mentioned above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Regarding the second evidence of your claim (Lines 345-347), TA-G is deglycosylated by the gut extracts not only in the absence of plant material, but also in the presence of plant material (Figure 2C – TA-G panel). Also, &quot;the presence of plant extract with active TA-G glycohydrolases does not increase TA-G deglycosylation&quot;, compared to what? It looks true when compared to the insect gut extracts only, but it is not true when compared to the treatment of &quot;plant enzyme + and diet&quot; (Figure 2C – TA panel). Also the &quot;active TA-G glycohydrolases&quot; is not clear what it means: plant or insect one? From another perspective, I am wondering whether the reaction substrate (TA-G) was sufficiently enough or not in the latex coated on carrot slices for the enzymatic conversions. The Figure 2C – TA-G panel shows that the substrate TA-G was almost completely depleted (presumably by deglycosylation) at the given condition (substrate concentration, reaction time, etc.), which could probably tell that the TA-G was not sufficiently enough to in the beginning.

How would you think? Anyways, the Lines 345-347 should be more clearly rephrased.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the substrate TA-G was depleted after ingestion by the <italic>M. melolontha</italic> larvae, and thus, we cannot exclude that plant hydrolases may contribute to deglycosylation if higher amounts of TA-G are present. However, considering that we added half of the entire root latex of a plant to the diet, which was consumed to a large part, it is very unlikely that in nature the larva is exposed to higher amounts of TA-G than what we tested. Increasing substrate concentration thus would not provide much insight into the ecological relevance of plant-mediated deglycosylation. In addition, our RNAi approach clearly shows that plant hydrolases <italic>in planta</italic> are not sufficient to trigger TA-G avoidance in <italic>M. melolontha</italic>, which is the strongest possible support that insect rather than plant glucohydrolases mediate TA-G cleavage and avoidance behaviour of the larvae in vivo.</p><p>To make these aspects clearer, we now improved the description of the experiment and results.
