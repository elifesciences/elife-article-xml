In the soil, Hülle cells nurse the overwintering fruiting bodies of <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic>. The genome of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> harbors genes for the biosynthesis of xanthones. We show that enzymes and metabolites of this biosynthetic pathway accumulate in Hülle cells under the control of the regulatory velvet complex, which coordinates development and secondary metabolism. Deletion strains blocked in the conversion of anthraquinones to xanthones accumulate emodins and are delayed in maturation and growth of fruiting bodies. Emodin represses fruiting body and resting structure formation in other fungi. Xanthones are not required for sexual development but exert antifeedant effects on fungivorous animals such as springtails and woodlice. Our findings reveal a novel role of Hülle cells in establishing secure niches for <italic>A. nidulans</italic> by accumulating metabolites with antifeedant activity that protect reproductive structures from animal predators.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hülle cells</kwd><kwd>sexual development</kwd><kwd>secondary metabolites</kwd><kwd>xanthones</kwd><kwd>emodin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Verticillium</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Sordaria macrospora</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Folsomia candida</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Trichorhina tomentosa</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BR 1502/19-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Braus</surname><given-names>Gerhard H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011102</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>607332</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Braus</surname><given-names>Gerhard H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004939</institution-id><institution>Göttingen Graduate School for Neurosciences, Biophysics, and Molecular Biosciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Xanthones produced by the filamentous fungus <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> protect its sexual structures from predation by arthropods.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fungi are sessile organisms and cannot escape when they are attacked by predators or competitors. Whereas vertebrates have a protective immune system, which is regulated by Rel homology domain transcription factors, fungi have developed chemical defense strategies by producing protective secondary metabolites (SMs), many of which are regulated by the structurally similar velvet domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2013</xref>). These small molecules (&lt;1000 Da) are not directly involved in the growth of the producing organisms but play important roles in the organism’s survivability in nature. Many fungal SMs affect the growth, survival, and reproduction of surrounding organisms and/or are toxic or deterrent to animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Künzler, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rohlfs and Churchill, 2011</xref>). Former studies showed that the presence of bacteria or the predation by animals triggers fungal SM production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fischer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Volker Schroeckh and Brakhage, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, secondary metabolism and development as well as primary metabolism are interconnected processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayram et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayram et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sarikaya-Bayram et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keller, 2019</xref>). Many fungal SMs possess intrinsic functions as components of developmental structures or signals initiating developmental processes. For example, fungal SMs as signaling hormones induce the formation of spores and regulate their germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rodríguez-Urra et al., 2012</xref>). SMs required for the formation of fungal resting or sexual structures have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calvo and Cary, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schindler and Nowrousian, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Studt et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The SMs epishamixanthone and shamixanthone were commonly isolated from several <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). The cosmopolitan fungal genus <italic>Aspergillus</italic> comprises more than 300 species, some of which are used in biotechnology, cause human diseases, or spoil harvested crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samson et al., 2014</xref>). The biosynthetic pathway for epishamixanthone and shamixanthone was first identified in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanchez et al., 2011</xref>). The corresponding gene cluster consists of one polyketide synthase (PKS) encoding gene <italic>mdpG</italic> and 11 ‘tailoring’ genes (<italic>mdpA-F</italic>, <italic>mdpH-L</italic>). The <italic>mdp</italic> genes are biosynthetically linked with the three <italic>xpt</italic> genes <italic>xptA</italic>, <italic>xptB,</italic> and <italic>xptC</italic>, which are scattered over the genome, and encode two prenyltransferases and one oxidoreductase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). All biosynthetic genes will be referred to as the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> gene cluster. In total, more than 30 compounds belonging mostly to anthraquinones, benzophenones, and xanthones are synthesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caesar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pockrandt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanchez et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>A. nidulans</italic> wildtype A4, transcription of 10 out of 15 <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> genes was up-regulated under sexual development-inducing conditions and the three corresponding metabolites shamixanthone, emericellin, and emodin were detected in a metabolome analysis of cultures incubated under conditions inducing the sexual cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayram et al., 2016</xref>). SM-producing fungi possess global regulation mechanisms to control the SM production at specific times and in certain tissues for particular physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keller, 2015</xref>). Whether the expression of the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> cluster and the corresponding metabolites play a role in the sexual development of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> remains unknown.</p><p><italic>A. nidulans</italic> is a soil-borne filamentous fungus with a well-characterized life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Park et al., 2019</xref>). After spore germination, a network of vegetative hyphae is formed, which under certain environmental conditions matures through asexual or sexual developmental programs into spore-bearing conidiophores or sexual fruiting bodies (cleistothecia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busch and Braus, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Etxebeste et al., 2010</xref>). Light stimulates the asexual pathway, whereas lowered oxygen levels and darkness stimulate the sexual pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayram et al., 2016</xref>). The cleistothecium serves as an overwintering structure and contains more than 10,000 sexual ascospores. It is surrounded by several layers of globose Hülle cells, which have nuclear storage and developmental backup functions and nurse the young fruiting body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Troppens et al., 2020</xref>). Lack of the epigenetic global regulator LaeA results in a loss of Hülle cells and in cleistothecia of reduced sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sarikaya-Bayram et al., 2010</xref>), whereas lack of the velvet proteins VelB and VeA abolishes formation of cleistothecia and Hülle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayram et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated the localization of <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic>-encoded proteins and their SM products during sexual development of <italic>A. nidulans</italic>. The Mdp/Xpt proteins are localized in sexual mycelia and Hülle cells, and the corresponding SMs are produced as soon as Hülle cells are present and cleistothecia begin to form. Furthermore, the loss of the regulatory velvet complex impaired the metabolite production by the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> cluster. Strains with a disturbed biosynthetic pathway due to deletion of <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> genes could not produce the final products epi-/shamixanthone. Instead, they accumulated various intermediates in Hülle cells, leading to smaller Hülle cells with reduced activity and delayed maturation of cleistothecia. Food choice experiments showed that metabolites of the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> cluster present in the wildtype protected <italic>A. nidulans</italic> from animal predators. These results suggest that xanthones produced by the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> cluster in Hülle cells protect sexual fruiting body of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> from fungivorous animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Proteins encoded by the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> cluster are located in Hülle cells and sexual mycelia in <italic>A. nidulans</italic></title><p>Most of the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> genes in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> are expressed during sexual development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayram et al., 2016</xref>). A comparative proteome study on protein extracts of whole sexual tissues as well as enriched Hülle cells from wildtype A4 was conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and Proteomic MS analysis data). Vegetative and asexual mycelia were used as controls. Vegetative mycelia were cultivated 20 hr in liquid medium and asexual and sexual tissues as well as Hülle cells were harvested 3, 5, and 7 days after inoculation on plates. An LC-MS analysis revealed that 24 proteins were present exclusively in both sexual mycelia and enriched Hülle cells but were not identified from vegetative or asexual tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Among them, five proteins encoded by the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> cluster were identified, MdpG, MdpL, MdpH, XptB, and XptC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To verify the localization of these proteins, the final enzyme in the biosynthesis of epi-/shamixanthone, XptC, was selected as an example and C-terminally fused to GFP for fluorescence microscopy. The fusion protein XptC-GFP was exclusively detected in 3-day-old sexual hyphae as well as in enriched Hülle cells but not in 20-hr-old vegetative hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The stability of the fusion protein XptC-GFP was verified by applying an α-GFP antibody in Western analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). These results suggest that at least five members of the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> cluster, MdpG, MdpL, MdpH, XptB, and XptC, are specifically localized to Hülle cells as well as sexual hyphae. Members of the Mdp/Xpt proteins can be detected from 3 to 7 days of sexual development.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Five Mdp/Xpt proteins are found in sexual mycelia and Hülle cells.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle">Gene ID (protein)</th><th align="center" valign="middle">Putative function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Szwalbe et al., 2019</xref>)</th><th align="center" colspan="2" valign="middle">3 days</th><th align="center" colspan="2" valign="middle">5 days</th><th align="center" colspan="2" valign="middle">7 days</th><th align="center" valign="middle">20 hr</th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="center" valign="middle">Sexual mycelia</th><th align="center" valign="middle">Hülle cells</th><th align="center" valign="middle">Sexual mycelia</th><th align="center" valign="middle">Hülle cells</th><th align="center" valign="middle">Sexual mycelia</th><th align="center" valign="middle">Hülle cells</th><th align="center" valign="middle">Vegetative mycelia</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">AN10023 (MdpL)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">121</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">25</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">98</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">–</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">34</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">42</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">AN7998 (XptC)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Reductase</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">54</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">7</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">48</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">6</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">26</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">–</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">AN12402 (XptB)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Prenyltransferase</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">52</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">19</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">–</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">–</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">8</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">–</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">AN10022 (MdpH)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anthrone oxidase, decarboxylase</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">27</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">–</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">2</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">27</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">6</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">–</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">AN0150 (MdpG)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Polyketide synthase</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">12</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">4</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">–</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">–</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">–</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">–</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>XptC is enriched in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> <italic>nidulans</italic> Hülle cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Fluorescence microscopy of sexual mycelia, Hülle cells (after 3 days of incubation), and vegetative mycelium after 20 hr of incubation from <italic>xptC:gfp</italic> strain. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> wildtype (wt, AGB552) and constitutively expressed GFP strain (OE<italic>gfp</italic>, AGB596) were used as controls.

Many SMs possess protective properties for the producing organism and are synthesized in response to abiotic and biotic stimuli. They protect fungi against environmental stresses such as oxidation and UV radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rao et al., 2017</xref>) and inhibit bacterial or fungal competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Künzler, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stroe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wheatley, 2002</xref>). Besides, many SMs exert antifeedant activities. Aurofusarin protects <italic>Fusarium</italic> species from animal grazing and asparasone A protects <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> from insect predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cary et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). The main finding of this study is that the soil fungus <italic>A. nidulans</italic> accumulates various xanthones in a specific fungal sexual cell type, the Hülle cells, and that these xanthones protect its sexual structures from predation by exerting antifeedant effects on fungivorous animals.</p><p>Fruiting bodies (cleistothecia) of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> serve as reproductive and overwintering structures, and their formation is highly material- and energy-consuming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pöggeler et al., 2006</xref>). During overwintering, cleistothecia secure fungal survival. Thus, a potent protection mechanism against predators is needed to ensure long-term survival. While feeding on <italic>A. nidulans,</italic> the fungivorous springtail <italic>F. candida</italic> prefers vegetative hyphae and conidia to cleistothecia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Döll et al., 2013</xref>). The cleistothecia are covered with globose Hülle cells which are suggested to serve as nursing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sarikaya-Bayram et al., 2010</xref>) and fungal backup stem cells with nuclear storage function to produce genetically diverse spores in changing nutrient conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Troppens et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we showed that xanthone metabolites of the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> pathway are produced and accumulate in Hülle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and that they deter animal predators from feeding on the fungus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests an additional role for Hülle cells to secure survival of cleistothecia. The <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> metabolites are produced as soon as the first Hülle cells appear, protecting sexual mycelium and the developing, young fruiting body. They are still present when the cleistothecia mature, guaranteeing long-term protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). It will be an interesting question whether there are also conditions where <italic>A. nidulans</italic> is capable of inducing the <italic>mdp/xpt</italic> cluster in the presence of specific animal fungivors to protect its mycelium. Fruit fly larvae preferred grazing on strains deleted for the regulatory <italic>veA</italic> or <italic>laeA</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trienens et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Trienens and Rohlfs, 2012</xref>). Both encoded proteins are components of the trimeric velvet complex, which is involved in the coordinated regulation of secondary metabolism and sexual development. In <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, deletion of either gene resulted in defective Hülle cell and fruiting body development and in disturbed SM production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayram et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sarikaya-Bayram et al., 2010</xref>). Transcriptome analysis revealed that VeA positively regulates the expression of 8 out of 15 <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lind et al., 2015</xref>). Here, deletion of the genes for VeA and VelB abolished the production of <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Deletion of <italic>laeA</italic> reduced the number of Hülle cells as well as the production of <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> metabolites. These findings indicate that the production of the antifeedant <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> metabolites is under the regulatory control of the velvet complex.</p><p>The <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> gene cluster is moderately conserved in two closely related <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species, <italic>Aspergillus versicolor</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus sydowii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Vries et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>A. nidulans</italic> and <italic>A. versicolor</italic> form cleistothecia, whereas no sexual cycle has been found yet for <italic>A. sydowii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raper and Fennell, 1965</xref>), though it forms Hülle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dyer and O’gorman, 2012</xref>). The velvet complex VelB-VeA-LaeA is conserved in the fungal kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayram and Braus, 2012b</xref>) and it is required for Hülle cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sarikaya-Bayram et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2002</xref>). The strains ∆<italic>veA</italic> and ∆<italic>velB</italic> cannot produce Hülle cells and ∆<italic>laeA</italic> just produces a few Hülle cells. This is well connected with the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> metabolites production in velvet complex gene deletion strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and suggests that the velvet complex regulation of the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> cluster is Hülle cell-dependent. The <italic>Aspergillus</italic> section <italic>Nidulantes</italic> is subdivided into 7 clades and 65 species. Three clades and 34 species have a sexual state forming the fruiting body cleistothecium, typically surrounded by layers of Hülle cells. Therein, 27 species have been identified to produce <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> metabolites, for example, emericellin, 2,ω-hydroxyemodin or shamixanthone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). The correspondence between <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species producing Hülle cells and those possessing <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> clusters raises the question whether Hülle cell-associated metabolites protect reproduction structures in all these species.</p><p>The <italic>mdp</italic> gene cluster is biosynthetically connected with three <italic>xpt</italic> genes, which are scattered over the genome. The <italic>mdp</italic> genes produce emodin as well as monodictyphenone, whereas the <italic>xpt</italic> genes use the <italic>mdp</italic> metabolites as precursors, converting them to xanthones and arugosin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pockrandt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanchez et al., 2011</xref>). Emodin can inhibit the formation of fruiting bodies and resting structures of other fungi such as <italic>S. macrospora</italic> and two different species of <italic>Verticillium</italic>, but not of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This might be explained by the fact that <italic>A. nidulans</italic> is able to convert emodin to other structures, whereas <italic>S. macrospora</italic> and <italic>Verticillium</italic> spp. do not possess enzymes for the conversion. This kind of detoxification is one common self-protection mechanism of fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keller, 2015</xref>). The fact that emodin represses the formation of fruiting and resting structures in such divergent fungi as <italic>S. macrospora</italic> and <italic>Verticillium</italic> spp. suggests a commonly present emodin target. Emodin is widely identified in plant families but also in fungi, particularly in <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. It exhibits a wide spectrum of ecological functions and protects higher plants against herbivores, pathogens, competitors, as well as extrinsic abiotic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Izhaki, 2002</xref>). In addition, emodin has pharmaceutical properties, such as anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities in mammalian cells by affecting the cellular NF-κB and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xie et al., 2019</xref>). The MAPK signaling pathways are conserved from yeast to human playing a central role in transducing extracellular stimuli into intracellular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Thorner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meskiene and Hirt, 2000</xref>). It is well known that MAPK pathways are commonly involved in fungal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayram et al., 2012a</xref>). The fungal MAPK signaling pathways could be a suitable emodin target, disordering the signaling transduction and inhibiting the sexual fruiting body or resting structure formation. In some fungi, emodin might act as an agent of interference competition, securing space and nutrients for biomass accumulation and sexual fruiting body development. In our study, the analyzed <italic>A. nidulans</italic> AGB552 wildtype strain did not produce emodin under tested laboratory conditions, therefore it is unlikely that emodin has a direct ecological function. However, emodin production has been described in the <italic>A. nidulans</italic> natural isolate A4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayram et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It is conceivable that the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> pathway can produce emodin rather than terminal xanthones under certain conditions in natural habitats. The mechanism could include a selective, limited inactivation of the velvet complex by disassembly or protein stability control or action of other regulators of the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> pathway. The scenario is however highly speculative. We rather suggest that the synthesis of antifeedant xanthones in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> evolved from a pathway producing interference competition metabolites in an ancestral species.</p><p>Besides emodin, other <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> SMs seem to be involved in the repression of fruiting and resting structure formation, since SMs of Δ<italic>mdpD</italic>, which do not contain emodin, are involved in repression in <italic>S. macrospora</italic>, <italic>V. dahliae,</italic> and <italic>V. longisporum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Further, enriched intermediates in the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> deletion strains Δ<italic>mdpC</italic>, Δ<italic>mdpL</italic>, Δ<italic>mdpD</italic>, Δ<italic>xptA,</italic> and Δ<italic>xptB</italic> delayed the fruiting body maturation of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Whereas the delay was gradually rescued along with the decrease of accumulated intermediates in Δ<italic>mdpL</italic>, Δ<italic>mdpD</italic>, Δ<italic>xptA,</italic> and Δ<italic>xptB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), Δ<italic>mdpC</italic> showed an additional reduction in cleistothecia size even after 25 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Emodin and ω-hydroxyemodin do not show an effect on cleistothecia size when externally added to <italic>A. nidulans</italic> wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, 2,ω-dihydroxyemodin or a combination of the different anthraquinone SMs might be the responsible compounds for the reduction in cleistothecia size. Smaller cleistothecia have lower energy and material costs. The accumulation of those intermediates might be an internal signal for incomplete xanthone/arugosin biosynthesis, which leads to fruiting bodies unprotected from animal predators. SMs produced by the Δ<italic>mdpC A. nidulans</italic> strain reduce fruiting body formation, but do not affect vegetative growth of <italic>S. macrospora</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Moreover, they had no toxic effects on the tested fungal predators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, it seems that the intermediates as well as the final products of the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> cluster have rather a limited regulatory effect on the developmental program than a general toxic inhibiting influence on the fungus.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> pathway in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> was recruited for the protection of fruiting bodies from predation. This occurred by (i) connecting the anthraquinone producing <italic>mdp</italic> cluster with <italic>xpt</italic> genes converting anthraquinones into xanthones with antifeedant activity; (ii) expressing the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> pathway in Hülle cells that surround the fruiting bodies; and (iii) coordinating <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> expression with sexual development by the velvet complex. These findings support a new role of Hülle cells as protective cells. They establish a secure niche for <italic>A. nidulans</italic> by accumulating metabolites with antifeedant activity that protect the reproductive and overwintering structures from animal predators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), which guarantees a long-term survival of <italic>A. nidulans</italic>.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>The <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> cluster metabolites establish a secure niche for <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic>.</title><p>The velvet complex VelB-VeA-LaeA regulates sexual development of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> and the expression of <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> genes.

As standard, para-aminobenzoic acid was added to the samples in a final concentration of 0.002%. For quantification, the FreeStyle software version 1.6 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used. The wildtype extract contains approximately 75 µg/mg emericellin/shamixanthone and 32.5 µg/mg epishamixanthone. Animal food was dried for 3 days to evaporate the methanol. As control, food was mixed with methanol without SMs and dried as well. Animals were fed with the prepared food for 5 days; 100 µg total extracts per mg food was used for the experiments. Experiments were carried out on 24-well plates at 22°C. Before feeding the animals were starved for 20 hr. Petri dishes were sealed with parafilm. For <italic>T. tomentosa</italic> oat flakes and for <italic>F. candida</italic> dried yeast were used as food. For <italic>T. tomentosa</italic> four animals were used per strain. For <italic>F. candida</italic> six different experiments were carried out except for Δ<italic>mdpG</italic> with five independent experiments. Each experiment contains 1–12 animals. Total number of animals were n = 22 for the control, n = 26 for Δ<italic>mdpG</italic>, n = 44 for wildtype, and n = 43 for Δ<italic>mdpC</italic>. The survival rate was determined after 5 days. Significance was calculated using the two-tailed t-test with p &lt; 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>none</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>None</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Software, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Software, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – original draft</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>LC-MS analysis revealed 24 proteins that were exclusively produced in both sexual mycelia and Hülle cells.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-68058-supp1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Secondary metabolites produced by the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> genes in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> sexual development identified by LC-MS.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-68058-supp2-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Fungal strains used in this study.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-68058-supp3-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Plasmids employed in this study.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-68058-supp4-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Primers for DNA sequence amplification and plasmid construction.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-68058-supp5-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title>Primers for semi-quantification of the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> cluster genes.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-68058-supp6-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-68058-transrepform1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

In this work, Liu et al., suggest that these cells have a strong ecological impact because they contain specific secondary metabolites that help the fungus to &quot;withstand&quot; the attack by fungivorous animals, like springtails, and also inhibit sexual reproduction of other fungi. This work sheds new light on the development and ecology of fungi as well as on the ecological functions of secondary metabolites.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Hülle-cell-mediated protection of fungal reproductive and overwintering structures against fungivorous animals&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Milton Drott (Reviewer #2); Jae-Hyuk Yu (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There was enthusiasm by all three reviewers for this work and several constructive suggestions were raised by each of the reviewers. In your revisions, there are two items that must be addressed:</p><p>1) The insect-fungus interactions will require additional experiment(s) to clarify if differences in &quot;food preference&quot; actually are associated with difference in fungivory. Given central hypotheses that the secondary metabolite compounds are cleistothecia/hulle-cell associated, the reviewers would like to see how the compounds of interest may impact the fitness of cleistothecia specifically. At present, it is not clear if differences in insect behavior associated with these compounds have any impact on the fungus.</p><p>2) There is a need for clarification of some of the ecological inferences on the fungus-fungus interaction. These can be dealt by being more explicit about the limitations of the experiments and inferences drawn and by clarifying how the concentrations of compounds used relate to what might actually occur in/around (secreted and sequestered in structures) the fungus.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have a few specific comments:</p><p>1. The effect of epi-/shamixanthone precursors on fruiting body formation and resting structure formation of other fungi. An alternative hypothesis could be that the compounds just inhibit the growth of these fungi.

How to explain delayed germination, when the compounds are missing? Or the accumulated intermediates are toxic?</p><p>8. Figure 9 is a nice summary of the findings, but can be improved by better arrangements.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The introduction contains much of the relevant information needed to approach the paper but does not flow clearly from secondary metabolism to sexual reproduction (and the subsequent importance of Hulle cells). It is my understanding that the authors try to connect these ideas through the velvet complex. While the velvet complex does indeed impact sexual reproduction and secondary metabolism, LaeA deletion mutants are often found to differentially express thousands of genes. Thus, associations between Hulle cells and SM formation that are based solely on this global regulator do not imply any close relationship. I would recommend decreasing the focus on the velvet complex.</p><p>Related to the previous point, while velvet-complex mutants have been of great value for disentangling molecular pathways and understanding the general architecture of gene regulation in fungi, they are of extremely limited value to ecological experiments. I appreciate that for consistency with other papers this may be a reasonable piece of data to retain. However, it is important that the authors acknowledge that there are severe limits on what inferences we can draw from these mutants. As the authors note (line 473), the velvet complex is conserved across fungi, indicating a strong selective pressure for this complex. Mutants of this complex do not grow normally. Thus, ecological inferences based on these mutants are based on genotypes that would not persist in nature and are thus of dubious value. Furthermore, given that these mutants are often aberrant in the expression of thousands of genes, interpretation of any resulting phenotypes is near impossible. While other studies have used similar approaches, I have always been extremely skeptical of ecological inferences that stem from velvet-complex mutants.</p><p>The authors do support their claims with specific mutants of the cluster that they are looking at. I applaud them for also using appropriate complementation controls.</p><p>The authors do a very nice job of showing the localization of mdp/xpt cluster metabolites and their gene expression. I would recommend adding the non-sexual mycelial images that are currently in the supplement to figure 1. Similarly, Table 1 should also include values for non-sexual mycelia.</p><p>The use of the term &quot;accurate&quot; for sexual development is a little misleading as it implies that something is inherently wrong (i.e., &quot;inaccurate&quot;). It appears that while the number and size of cleistothecia are impacted by intermediates in this pathway, it does seem that this structure, and the ascospores are produced. I agree that these changes may be important, but I think the language surrounding this discussion needs to be more nuanced to better reflect the possible ecological impact (or lack thereof) of these differences.</p><p>Even when appropriate complementation controls are used, there can be concerns about the use of mutants for ecological inferences that touch on fitness. In particular, some associations between secondary metabolism and fungal fitness that have been elucidated with mutants seem to have no reflection on natural patterns. For example, using mutants it has been shown that conidiation is decreased when aflatoxin production is knocked out. However, studies have not been able to find any evidence that non-aflatoxigenic isolates of Aspergillus spp. produce fewer conidia (even when comparing closely related isolates). The transformation process alone (without disrupting genes) can result in shifts in fitness (https://doi.org/10.1094/Phyto-80-1166) – not to mention off-target impacts of gene deletion. It is thus of great importance to consider how the mutations induced in this study might reflect mutations that occur and or persist in nature. Problematically, the WT does not accumulate many of the compound intermediates (figure S10) that are determined to inhibit the growth of other fungi, raising questions about the relevance of these experiments to nature. While it is fine to look at the impact of these intermediates, the authors must acknowledge the fact that these intermediates may not occur in nature and that isolates that do produce them may succumb to selective pressures that could be associated with their findings of aberrant sexual development (some clarification on how the authors can be sure that the aberrant cleistothetical development is bad would benefit the manuscript – I don't know that I disagree, but it is worth discussing).</p><p>Interpretation of the fungal-competition experiments is further complicated by questions that remain about the concentrations of pure/crude compounds used. Were concentrations of extracts at all reflective of what might be produced/secreted by A. nidulans? Indeed – are these compounds secreted at all? How does the 75 ug per disc reflect concentrations actually produced by the fungus? Can anything resembling inhibitory concentrations be produced on non-synthetic media that may be encountered in nature? Importantly if these compounds are not secreted, might they instead protect against the growth of other fungi directly on cleistothecia?</p><p>I commend the authors for their use of three diverse fungivores. However, the simple food-choice test that was conducted does not provide much insight into the ecological role of xanthones. It is important to note that just because insects spend more time near colonies unable to produce <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> metabolites does not necessarily mean that these colonies are eaten more or have a fitness disadvantage. Other studies approaching similar questions, including those cited by the authors, have performed far more comprehensive assays to draw similar conclusions as the authors do here. For example, Cary et al. (2014) performed similar food-choice tests of fungal tissues to fungivores. However, in addition to offering fungivores a choice between two genotypes of fungus, they also performed no-choice experiments that help to elucidate the nature of antifeedant activity. Furthermore, Cary et al. assessed the weight of fungal structures in question, thus adding a fitness measure to their food-choice. It is also not uncommon for studies to also assess the toxicity of compounds of interest on insects.</p><p>The authors approach to the insect experiments is a little confusing in light of their hypothesis. It is my understanding of the authors argument that xanthones are targeted through Hülle cells to protect cleistothecia. However, the authors do not investigate if there is any difference in the protection conferred specifically to these structures. If xanthones do indeed have strong antifeedant effects, then it would be important to clarify if these effects are conferred preferentially to the cleistothecia or if they are realized by the entire thallus.</p><p>The authors identify a correlation between species that produce Hülle cells and those that produce the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> metabolites. While this is intriguing, it is not evidence that these other species also produce mdp/xpt metabolites in a Hülle-cell associated manner. The text should be more cautious in its interpretation (lines 479-485).</p><p>The discussion should acknowledge a large body of literature that now ties close connections between secondary metabolism and primary growth raising questions about the authors suggestion that SMs are not &quot;directly involved in growth&quot;.</p><p>I do not find the speculation about the Emodin target very convincing. Additionally, I do not find conclusions about the ecological role of emodin production convincing given that emodin does not seem to be accumulated by the WT and thus the ecological function of emodin production rests in its derivatives.</p><p>The manuscript is clear, well written, and well organized. There are a few minor grammatical errors throughout that could be fixed to make the manuscript feel even more polished. I acknowledge that many of these errors are subtle and may not be immediately apparent even for native English speakers. For example (but not limited to): (a) line 124 &quot;specifically located to&quot; should be &quot;localized to&quot; (b) line 206 &quot;this assisted us to trace&quot; should be &quot;this enabled us to trace&quot; (c) line 304-305 &quot;repression of cleistothecia size&quot; should be &quot;decrease in cleistothecial size&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68058.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There was enthusiasm by all three reviewers for this work and several constructive suggestions were raised by each of the reviewers.

If xanthones do indeed have strong antifeedant effects, then it would be important to clarify if these effects are conferred preferentially to the cleistothecia or if they are realized by the entire thallus.</p></disp-quote><p>This point was addressed by our new experiments, which revealed that the animals prefer feeding on mycelium as well as cleistothecia without the final <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> xanthones (lines 433-448; Figure 8, Figure 8—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors identify a correlation between species that produce Hülle cells and those that produce the <italic>mdp</italic>/<italic>xpt</italic> metabolites.
