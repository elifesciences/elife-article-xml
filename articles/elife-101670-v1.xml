Malnourished individuals are especially vulnerable to infectious diseases, which is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for this population. Despite the known link between undernutrition and infection susceptibility, the mechanisms remain poorly understood, and it is unclear whether refeeding can reverse nutritionally acquired immunodeficiency. Here, we investigate how malnutrition leads to immune dysfunction and the ability of refeeding to repair it. Malnourished mice show an inability to control sublethal <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> infection, reduced immune cell function and expansion, and early contraction before pathogen clearance. Myelopoiesis is particularly affected, with fewer neutrophils and monocytes present both before and after infection in malnourished mice. While refeeding restores body mass, lymphoid organ cellularity, and T cell responses, refed mice remain susceptible to <italic>Listeria</italic> infection, revealing that recovery from lymphoid atrophy alone is not sufficient to restore protective immunity. Accordingly, peripheral neutrophils and monocytes fail to fully recover, and emergency myelopoiesis remains impaired in refed animals. Altogether, this work identifies dysregulated myelopoiesis as a link between prior nutritional state and immunocompetency, indicating that food scarcity is an immunologic risk factor, even after nutritional recovery.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>malnutrition</kwd><kwd>immunodeficiency</kwd><kwd>neutrophil</kwd><kwd>myelopoiesis</kwd><kwd>diet</kwd><kwd>refeeding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM138085</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bailis</surname><given-names>Will</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017023</institution-id><institution>Paul G.

In the past 5 years, these numbers worsened due to economic instability ushered by COVID-19 pandemic, and they are projected to further increase throughout the impending climate crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mbow et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">United Nations, 2022</xref>). In patients with undernutrition, the largest contributor to morbidity and mortality is infectious disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rice et al., 2000</xref>). It has been demonstrated that undernutrition alone puts patients, especially children, at a higher risk of developing long-lasting disability or dying from an infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antwi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhargava, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caulfield et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rice et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schlaudecker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sinha et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to increased susceptibility to infection, chronically undernourished individuals have been reported to have impaired barrier function, atrophy of immune organs, and less effective responses to vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharjee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collins and Belkaid, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Prendergast, 2015</xref>). In keeping with this, undernutrition is the leading cause of secondary immunodeficiency in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chinen and Shearer, 2010</xref>). Considering the geographical overlap between areas with high prevalence of undernutrition and infectious disease and the persistent nature of the global undernutrition crisis, it is critical to investigate how undernutrition causes immunodeficiency and contributes to poor infection outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mbow et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murray and Lopez, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pelletier, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roberts, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rohr et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sinha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">UNICEF-WHO-World Bank JME Working Group, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Despite the first link between undernutrition and poor infection outcomes being posited over a century ago, the cellular mechanisms underlying undernutrition-induced immunodeficiency remain poorly resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hess, 1932</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Newsholme, 1908</xref>). The primary explanation given for this dysfunction has centered on defects in lymphocyte biology. Patient data and animal studies suggest that T, B, and NK cells are reduced in the periphery of patients with undernutrition and experimental animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cason et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Contreras et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">NÃ¡jera et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saha et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schattner et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, animal models of short-term fasting and protein deficiency have been found to impair T cell expansion, cytokine production, and memory recall responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chatraw et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mengheri et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Procaccini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saucillo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). While the contribution of lymphocyte dysfunction to nutritionally acquired immunodeficiency is well established, the impact of prolonged undernutrition on other immune cell populations and the role they play in disease susceptibility is not well understood.</p><p>Prior studies have reported disparate impacts of undernutrition on immunity and infection, with some finding dietary or caloric restriction enhances inflammation or immunity, while others observing a loss in immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharjee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chatraw et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collins et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hasegawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pena-Cruz et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piccio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Starr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). These discrepancies likely result from whether animals are subjected to caloric restriction alone or if there is also corresponding limitation in key micro- and macronutrients and whether the restriction in food intake is administered as a short-term fast or is sustained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cerqueira and Kowaltowski, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Contreras et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meydani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). To this end, caloric and nutrient restriction diets significantly differ in weight loss patterns, physiology, and nutritional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cerqueira and Kowaltowski, 2010</xref>). While both diets are associated with reduced inflammation, caloric restriction is understood to support both lifespan and health span, in stark contrast to chronic undernutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collins and Belkaid, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Contreras et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Green et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hasegawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jordan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piccio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spadaro et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Beyond our mechanistic understanding of nutritionally acquired immunodeficiency, there is limited knowledge on whether this dysfunction is reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Contreras et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schattner et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vaisman et al., 2004</xref>). Because current treatment guidelines for patients with undernutrition utilize refeeding protocols that focus on weight gain as the indicator of recovery, the effects of refeeding on the immune system are understudied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashworth et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, whether prior exposure to malnutrition has durable effects on the ability to control infection following refeeding remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we investigate the impact of nutritionally acquired immunodeficiency on the immune responses to <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> infection and the ability of refeeding intervention to restore immune competency. We employ a chronic murine dietary restriction model and demonstrate that it effectively recapitulates the hallmarks of human undernutrition. We find that chronic undernutrition results in a specific atrophy of immune organs that is not mirrored in essential organs, such as the liver and kidney. This loss of lymphoid tissue is accompanied by a broad reduction in both innate and adaptive immune cell compartments. Undernourished mice fail to control sublethal <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection, either succumbing to disease or failing to clear the pathogen long term. We find that while these mice undergo the initial phase of immune cell expansion following infection, they fail to sustain it, and the response rapidly undergoes contraction. Accordingly, we observe that T cells in these mice display muted expansion, accelerated contraction, and impaired effector function. We further find that undernutrition selectively impairs steady-state and emergency myelopoiesis, resulting in reduced neutrophil and monocyte abundance prior to and post-infection. Finally, we demonstrate that while refeeding protocols are sufficient to restore body mass, growth, and reverse global lymphoid atrophy, refed mice remain more susceptible to infection even months after recovering size and peripheral immune cell numbers. In contrast to the ability of refeeding to reverse the effects of undernutrition on lymphoid numbers, we go on to show refed mice display impaired emergency myelopoiesis as well as neutrophil and monocyte abundance. Altogether, our work identifies dysregulated myelopoiesis as a major factor contributing to increased susceptibility to infection during chronic undernutrition. Furthermore, we for the first time demonstrate that refeeding protocols are not sufficient to reverse defects in the ability of mice to control infection or dysregulated myelopoiesis, despite outwardly displaying a recovery from malnutrition. We believe these findings have important implications for global public health policy and medical standards of care not only for treating people actively experiencing chronic malnutrition, but also for individuals who have experienced and recovered from food scarcity as part of their life history.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sustained dietary restriction recapitulates the hallmarks of nutritionally acquired immunodeficiency</title><p>To investigate the relationship of undernutrition and immunodeficiency, we began by adopting a faithful model of chronic malnutrition. In patients, undernutrition is associated with (1) a consistent weight loss of 10% or more compared to the age-appropriate body weight that occurs in under 6 months and persists for months to years; (2) stunting of growth; and (3) a change in body composition associated with weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Institute of Medicine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maleta, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martins et al., 2011</xref>). While short-term fasting and macronutrient or caloric restriction models have been previously used, we elected to employ a 40% reduced diet (40RD) model, which provides both the weight loss as well as micro- and macronutrient deficiency over extended periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cerqueira and Kowaltowski, 2010</xref>). For the 40RD system, the average food intake of C57Bl6 mice was measured at baseline consumption. After a week of baseline measurements, mice were randomly assigned to either the ad libitum fed (AL) or the 40RD group. 40% of the average food intake by weight was removed from the diet of 40RD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Animal weight, body length, and body condition score (BCS) were then regularly surveyed to measure wasting, stunting, and body composition, respectively. Highlighting the ability of the model to reliably generate a state of moderate undernutrition, 40RD mice consistently lost 10% of their initial body weight (IBW) in 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) and achieved an average 20% loss of IBW relative to the AL group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). At the same time, BCSs decreased significantly in 40RD mice compared to the AL group over the course of 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

These effector-like populations expanded minimally during early and peak response and contracted quickly by day 14, prior to pathogen clearance in 40RD mice. In addition to these defects in expansion/contraction dynamics, we further tested whether chronic malnutrition also impaired T cell function. We thus evaluated both the frequency and per-cell cytokine-producing capacity of T cells at day 8 post-infection. We observed that T cells from undernourished mice displayed both a decreased frequency of cytokine-producing cells and a decreased capacity for producing cytokines on a per-cell basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3câe</xref>).

In keeping with the steady-state recovery observed, post-infection splenic and bone marrow cellularity were equivalent between RF and AL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Moreover, we found that T and B cell numbers were restored in RF mice, and all lymphocyte populations underwent comparable expansion to AL controls after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, we observed no differences in the number of antigen-experienced T cells in the spleen nor T cell functional capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6eâg</xref>). Thus, refeeding permits recovery of lymphocyte number, lymphocyte expansion capacity, and T cell function in response to infection, suggesting lymphocyte dysfunction is unlikely to be responsible for the persistent susceptibility observed.</p><p>In contrast to the restoration of the lymphocyte response, we observed sustained defects in the myeloid compartment. RF mice displayed impaired peripheral expansion of neutrophil and monocyte populations after infection, both by frequency and number, with neutrophil number diminished in steady-state RF mice as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i, j</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2a, b</xref>). Within the bone marrow, we observed a reduced frequency in steady-state monocyte and neutrophil abundance as well as reduced total neutrophil numbers; however, both populations expanded upon infection, reaching control numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2câf</xref>). Having seen this, we next asked whether RF mice exhibited a persistent impairment in either central or emergency myelopoiesis. Whereas myeloid progenitor populations were not perturbed in the bone marrow, we found that RF mice exhibited significantly reduced frequency and numbers of splenic pre-GM and GMP cells following infection, with the GMP population also diminished in steady-state mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6jâl</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Altogether, our findings demonstrate that refeeding intervention uncouples a global recovery in lymphoid atrophy from an enduring impairment in emergency myelopoiesis, resulting in lasting susceptibility to infection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we employ a murine model of chronic undernutrition that phenocopies many of the hallmarks of human undernutrition (stunting, wasting, and changes in body composition) to characterize how chronic malnutrition leads to nutritionally acquired immunodeficiency. We demonstrate that sustained malnutrition results in global lymphoid atrophy, with loss of both innate and adaptive immune cell populations. Additionally, we identified a unique and severe impairment in neutrophil abundance and myelopoiesis, with a similar but more modest effect on monocytes. Our data suggest that the combination of diminished homeostatic levels of these critical myeloid populations along with impaired emergency myelopoiesis leads to poor control of early <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection, while a blunted T cell response to infection and their premature contraction results in lack of effective infection resolution. We then tested whether a refeeding intervention could restore protective immunity to infection. We found that restoring food access permitted mice to regain weight and size as well as reverse many signs of immunodeficiency. Refeeding was sufficient to recover lymphoid organ atrophy, the abundance of most circulating lymphocytes, and T cell cytokine production. Nonetheless, refed mice continued to display increased susceptibility to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection along with sustained defects in neutrophil and monocyte abundance and emergency myelopoiesis. These data demonstrate that exposure to chronic undernutrition can result in lasting changes to specific compartments of the immune system, with long-term implications for the health of the individual even after recovering growth and size.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that impaired pathogen responses during undernutrition are driven by lymphocyte loss and functional impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beisel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beisel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Institute of Medicine, 2000</xref>). Low levels of circulating lymphocytes have been well documented in patients with undernutrition and various restrictive diet models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cason et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Contreras et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saha et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schattner et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). Our data from the refeeding model suggest that while these defects likely contribute to poor resolution of infection, they are not sufficient to explain why previously malnourished mice remain vulnerable to infection, as these mice recover from lymphoid atrophy and display normal T cell responses. Nonetheless, we find consistent with other groups that undernourished mice exhibit a steady-state reduction in circulating T cells. Upon infection, the T cell compartment is capable of undergoing expansion in malnourished conditions, but the magnitude of this response is blunted and quickly contracts prior to pathogen clearance. We also found that there was reduced abundance of antigen-experienced T cells throughout the infection. Additionally, we found that the intrinsic ability of T cells to produce inflammatory cytokines was reduced. In keeping with work demonstrating that T cells from patients with undernutrition display reduced function, we find that T cells from malnourished mice have impaired cytokine-producing capacity post-infection. Altogether, our work supports clinical observations and earlier studies delineating the relationship of undernutrition on lymphoid atrophy and T cell dysfunction and has revealed the reversible nature of these defects after refeeding intervention.</p><p>In contrast to the recovery found in the adaptive immune cells after refeeding, our work demonstrates that exposure to chronic periods of malnutrition results in durable defects in the myeloid compartment. We find that undernourished mice display impaired myelopoiesis and a loss in abundance in critical peripheral myeloid populations that does not properly recover upon refeeding. Indeed, some small cohort studies have shown that circulating neutrophil numbers are reduced in undernourished children and that hematopoiesis is impacted in anorexic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kohama et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vaisman et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, while hematopoiesis and peripheral immune cell numbers are broadly sensitive to an animalâs ongoing nutritional status, specific subsets are uniquely sensitive to periods of undernutrition and exhibit nutritional scarring that uncouples their activity from future improvements in dietary intake. These findings raise the possibility that lasting epigenetic changes within the myeloid compartment occur during exposure to undernutrition, akin to what has been observed for trained immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Netea et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, a recent study in a small cohort of undernourished children reported changes in H3 acetylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kupkova et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>While this work provides a novel link between myelopoiesis and nutritional state, many questions remain. Our study investigated the effect of chronic undernutrition during <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection; however, the extent to which these findings apply more broadly to other models of bacterial infection or innate inflammation is unclear. Moreover, our malnutrition model broadly restricted food intake without regard to the components of diet that are required for immunocompetency nor consideration for potential interactions of the magnitude of food restriction with immunodeficiency and the rate of onset. It will be of interest in future studies to resolve the extent to which the phenotypes observed are due to the gross loss of calories, specific macronutrients, certain micronutrients, and the grade of dietary restriction enforced. In addition, our study focused on the effects of dietary restriction on adult, normal weight mice. Whether similar phenotypes would emerge if obese animals were dietarily restricted and if weight loss was achieved through pharmacologic means (e.g. GLP-1 targeted drugs) is not clear. Likewise, how similar dietary restriction might affect the immune system if it were initiated in juvenile mice is not addressed here. Mechanistically, additional work is needed to address whether the changes in myelopoiesis are due to changes within the hematopoietic compartment, non-hematopoietic cells, and/or to systemic levels of key cytokines and hormones â such as G-CSF, interferons, and leptin â both in malnourished and refed mice. Finally, the known impact dietary restriction has on microbiota composition and in turn how this might durably impact the immune system is unaccounted for in this work and warrants investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanton et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, our work offers new insight into the contribution of myelopoiesis in nutritionally acquired immunodeficiency and the ability of refeeding intervention to treat these defects. The burden of morbidity and mortality of infections on undernourished individuals is one of the leading global health crises, and evidence of impaired vaccine responses in undernourished people is putting in question the worldâs ability to protect the most vulnerable populations with its most reliable strategies for prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharjee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhargava, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dubos, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishikawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Prendergast, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rice et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saha et al., 1977</xref>). We provide evidence that even prior exposure to food scarcity may be sufficient to permanently alter future immune responses. This suggests that the current dietary status of an individual may be insufficient information to understand the impact nutrition has on their immune system. Future work delineating the specific components of diet required to sustain immune health in the face of food scarcity will be critical for developing nutritional interventions or broader food supplementation programs for at-risk populations. We believe that this work indicates periods of poverty and food insecurity may be an important factor in patient medical history as well as for formulating global health policy in these areas.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and diets</title><p>All mice were female on a C57Bl6 background maintained at Childrenâs Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) animal facility.

One week before the start of the experiment, average food intake was measured per 5 mice per day. Average food consumption for all experimental animals between 6 and 8 weeks of age was 4 g/day/mouse. At the start of the experiment, mice were weighed to make sure that all the animals were in the range of Â±1.5 g and randomly assigned to an AL or a 40RD group. AL mice were maintained as before with unlimited access to chow. 40RD mice were placed on the 40% reduced diet by weight, resulting in 2.4 g/day/mouse of feed. Consistent weight loss and no competition for food was observed in 40RD mice. 40RD mice lost 10% of their IBW every 4 weeks. If mice lost over 20% of their IBW, they were euthanized. During the 40RD diet, experimental animals did not exhibit behavioral or clinical changes and only moderate changes in body composition and growth stunting. When all 40RD mice reached 10â15% IBW loss, they were considered undernourished and utilized for further experiments.</p><p>For the RF diet, mice were set up in the identical way to the 40RD diet until they reached 10â15% IBW loss.

On the 40RD diet, mice had access to 2.4 g/day/mouse (60% of the initial average food consumption). On day 1 of the refeeding intervention, mice had access to 2.8 g/day/mouse (70%). On day 3, they had access to 3.2 g/day/mouse (80%). On day 5, it was 3.6 g/day/mouse (90%). On day 7, mice were given unrestricted food access. RF mice were then maintained on ad libitum feed for a month after they entered normal weight range for their age,and their food intake normalized to the AL age-matched controls. At that point, mice were considered refed and were utilized for further experiments.</p><p>40RD mice and mice on the 1-week-long refeeding intervention were fed daily between 4 pm and 6 pm to avoid interference with circadian rhythm.

After incubation, cells were washed with PBS and stained with L/D aqua dye for 15 min at 4Â°C. Then, cells were washed and stained for 20 min at 4Â°C in 2% Rat Serum and PBS with the following antibodies: anti-CD4 (eBioscience GK1.5, cat. 64-0041-82), anti-CD8 (Invitrogen 53-6.7, cat. MA1-10303), and anti-CD44 (eBioscience IM7, cat. 45-0441-82). After staining, cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 30 min at 4Â°C using eBiosciences Intracellular Fixation Buffer. Cells then were washed using eBiosciences Intracellular Permeabilization Buffer (Termo, cat. 88-8824-00) and stained for 30 min at room temperature in 2% Rat Serum and Permeabilization Buffer with the following antibodies: anti-TNFÎ± (eBioscience MP6-XT22, cat. 12-7321-82), anti-IL-2 (eBioscience MQ1-17H12, cat. 25-7029-42, 1:200), and anti-IFNÎ³ (eBioscience XMG1.2, cat. 17-7311-82).</p><p>All antibodies used at 1:300 dilution unless otherwise specified. Regardless of staining, all cells were washed with PBS at the end of the protocol and resuspended in PBS to perform flow cytometry. Stained samples were analyzed on a 4-laser CytoFlex by Beckman Coulter using an automated plate reader. Data were analyzed using FlowJo 10.5.3 software.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistics and reproducibility</title><p>All experiments were repeated at least three independent times. Data were represented either as a mean Â± SD or SEM. Throughout the manuscript, no explicit power analysis was used, but group size was based on previous studies using similar approaches. Blinding was used for CFU measurements, body conditioning score, and clinical score. For measurements over time within the same experimental cohort, statistical analysis was done via simple linear regression comparing slopes or elevation. For survival curves, the log-rank test was performed. For all other pairwise comparisons, the MannâWhitney test was performed. For all other measurements, statistical analysis was done via non-parametric one-way (KruskalâWallis) or two-way (mixed-effect) ANOVA depending on the number of variables. p-values are recorded on the graphs as follows: **** for p &lt; 0.0001; *** for p &lt; 0.001; ** for p &lt; 0.01; * for p â¤ 0.05; ns for p &gt; 0.05. All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.2.0 software.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and with PHS-approved animal welfare (assurance number D16-00280).

They model malnutrition with a diet switch from ad libitum to 40% caloric restriction (CR) in post-weaned mice. They test impacts on immune function with listeriosis. They then test whether re-feeding corrects these defects and find aspects of emergency myelopoiesis that remain defective after a precedent period of 40% CR. Overall, this is a very interesting observational study on the impacts of sudden prolonged exposure to less caloric intake.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study is rigorously done. The observation of lasting defects after a bout of 40% CR is quite interesting. Overall, I think the topic and findings are of interest.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the observations are interesting, in this reviewer's opinion, there is both a lack of mechanistic understanding of the phenomena and also some lack of resolution/detail about the phenomena itself. Addressing the following major issues would be helpful towards aspects of both:</p><p>(1) Is it calories, per se, or macro/micronutrients that drive these phenotypes observed with 40% CR. At the least, I would want to see isocaloric diets (primarily protein, fat, or carbs) and then some of the same readouts after 40% CR. Ie does low energy with relatively more eg protein prevent immunosuppression (as is commonly suggested)? Micronutrients would be harder to test experimentally and may be out of the scope of this study. However, it is worth noting that many of the malnutrition-associated diseases are micronutrient deficiencies.</p><p>(2) Is immunosuppression a function of a certain weight loss threshold? Or something else? Some idea of either the tempo of immunosuppression (happens at 1, in which weight loss is detected; vs 2-3, when body length and condition appear to diverge; or 5 weeks), or grade of CR (40% vs 60% vs 80%) would be helpful since the mechanism of immunosuppression overall is unclear (but nailing it may be beyond the scope of this communication).</p><p>(3) Does an obese mouse that gets 40% CR also become immunodeficient? As it stands, this ad libitum --&gt; 40% CR model perhaps best models problems in the industrial world (as opposed to always being 40% CR from weaning, as might be more common in the developing world), and so modeling an obese person losing a lot of weight from CR (like would be achieved with GLP-1 drugs now) would be valuable to understanding generalizability.</p><p>(4) Generalizing this phenomenon as &quot;bacterial&quot; with listeriosis, which is more like a virus in many ways (intracellular phase, requires type I IFN, etc.) and cannot be given by the natural route of infection in mice, may not be most accurate. I would want to see an experiment with <italic>E. coli</italic>, or some other bacteria, to test the statement of generalizability (ie is it bacteria, or type I IFN-pathway dominant infections, like viruses). If this is unique listeriosis, it doesn't undermine the story as it is at all, but it would just require some word-smithing.</p><p>(5) Previous reports (which the authors cite) implicate Leptin, the levels of which scale with fat mass, as &quot;permissive&quot; of a larger immune compartment (immune compartment as &quot;luxury function&quot; idea). Is their phenotype also leptin-mediated (ie leptin AAV)?</p><p>(6) The inability of re-feeding to &quot;rescue&quot; the myeloid compartment is really interesting. Can the authors do a bone marrow transplantation (CR--&gt;ad libitum) to test if this effect is intrinsic to the CR-experienced bone marrow?</p><p>(7) Is the defect in emergency myelopoiesis a defect in G-CSF? Ie if the authors injected G-CSF in CR animals, do they equivalently mobilize neutrophils? Does G-CSF supplementation (as one does in humans) rescue host defense against Listeria in the CR or re-feeding paradigms?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for considering our work of interest and noting the rigor with which it was conducted. The referee raises several excellent mechanistic hypotheses and follow-up studies to perform. We agree that defining the specific dietary deficiency driving the phenotypes is of great interest. The relative contribution of calories versus macro- and micronutrients is an area we are interested in exploring in future studies, especially given the literature on the role of micronutrients in malnutrition driven wasting as the referee notes. We also agree that it will be key to determine whether non-hematopoietic cells contribute as well as the role of soluble factors such G-CSF and Leptin in mediating the immunodeficiency all warrant further study. Likewise, it will be important to evaluate how malnutrition impacts other models of infection to determine how generalizable these phenomena are. We have added these points to the discussion section as limitations of this study.</p><p>Regarding how the phenotypes correspond to the timing of the immunosuppression relative to weight loss, we have performed new kinetics studies to provide some insight into this area. We now find that neutropenia in peripheral blood can be detected after as little as one week of dietary restriction, with neutropenia continuing to decline after prolonged restriction. These findings indicate that the impact on myeloid cell production are indeed rapid and proceed maximum weight loss, though the severity of these phenotypes does increase as malnutrition persists. We wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer that it will be interesting to explore whether starting weight impacts these phenotypes and whether similar findings can be made in obese animals as they are treated for weight loss.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>In this study, the authors used a chronic murine dietary restriction model to study the effects of chronic malnutrition on controls of bacterial infection and overall immunity, including cellularity and functions of different immune cell types.

Discrepancies exist with the absolute cell number and relative abundance data, except for the neutrophil and monocyte data, which makes the data difficult to interpret.

We based our methodology on the <italic>general</italic> guidelines for refeeding protocols for malnourished people. We elected to increase food intake 10% daily to avoid risk of refeeding syndrome or other complications. Our method is by no means replicates the administration of specific vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, nor precise caloric content as would be given to a human patient. The citation provided offers information from the WHO regarding the complications that can arise during refeeding syndrome, which while it is from a document on pediatric care, we did not mean to imply that our method modeled refeeding intervention for children. We have modified the text to avoid this confusion.</p><p>â¢ The reviewer requested more clarity on why we studied both the innate and adaptive immune system as well as why we chose the time points studied. As referenced in the manuscript, prior work has observed that caloric restriction, fasting, and malnutrition all can impact the adaptive immune system. Given these previous findings, we felt it important to evaluate how malnutrition affected adaptive immune cell populations in our model. To this end, we provide data tracking the course of T-cell responses from the start of infection through day 14 at the time that the response undergoes contraction. However, since we find that bacterial burden is not properly controlled at earlier time points (day 5), when it is understood the innate immune system is more critical for mediating pathogen clearance, we elected to better characterize the effect malnutrition had on innate immune populations, something less well described in the literature. As phenotypes both in bacterial burden and within innate immune populations were observable as early as day 5, we chose to focus on that time point rather than later time points when readouts could be further confounded by secondary or compounding effects by the lack of early control of infection. We have tried to make this rationale clear in the text and have made changes to further emphasize this reasoning.</p><p>â¢ The reviewer also requested an explaination over why bacterial burden was measured in the liver and the immune response was measured in the spleen. While the reviewer is correct that our model is a systemic infection, it is well appreciated that bacteria rapidly disseminate to the liver and spleen and these organs serve as major sites of infection. Given the central role the spleen plays in organizing both the innate and adaptive immune response in this model, it is common practice in the field to phenotype immune cell populations in the spleen, while using the liver to quantify bacterial burden (see PMID: 37773751 as one example of many). We acknowledge this does not provide the full scope of bacterial infection or the immune response in every potentially affected tissue, but nonetheless believe the interpretation that malnourished and previously malnourished animals do not properly control infection and their immune responses are blunted compared to controls still stands.</p><p>The reviewer raised several points about di3erences in the results for cell frequency and absolute number and why these may deviate in some circumstances. For example, the reviewer notes that we observe thymic atrophy yet the frequency of peripheral T-cells does not decline. It should be noted that absolute number can change when frequency does not and vice versa, due to changes in other cell types within the studied population of cells. As in the case of peripheral lymphocytes in our study, the frequency can stay the same or even increase when the absolute number declines (Supplemental 1). This can occur if other populations of cells decrease further, which is indeed the case as the loss of myeloid cells is greater than that of lymphocytes. Hence, we find that the frequency of T and B cells is unchanged or elevated, despite the loss in absolute number of peripheral cell, which is our stated interpretation. We believe this is consistent with our overall observations and is why it is important to report both frequency and absolute number, as we have done.</p><p>We have made the requested changes to the text to address the reviewers concerns as noted to improve clarity and accuracy for the description of experiments, results, and overall conclusions drawn in the manuscript. We have also included a discussion of the limitations of our work as well as additional areas for future investigation that remain open.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Regarding the known drivers of myelopoiesis, can the authors quantify circulating levels of relevant immune cytokines (e.g. type I and II IFNs, GM-CSF, etc.)?</p><p>Regarding the microbiota (point #2), how dramatically does this undernutrition modulate the microbiota both in terms of absolute load and community composition, and how effectively/quickly is this rescued by refeeding?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these recommendations. We agree that the role of circulating factors like cytokines and growth factors in contributing to the defects in myelopoiesis is of interest and is the focus of future work. Similarly, the impact of malnutrition on the microbiota is of great interest and has been evaluated by other groups in separate studies. How the known impact of malnutrition on the microbiota affects the phenotypes we observe in myelopoiesis is unclear and warrants future investigation. We have added these points to the discussion section as limitations of this study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
