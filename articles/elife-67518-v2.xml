To investigate adaptations of the photosynthetic machinery in cyanobacteria to excessive light stress, we isolated a new strain of cyanobacteria, <italic>Cyanobacterium aponinum</italic> 0216, from the extreme light environment of the Sonoran Desert. Here we report the biochemical characterization and the 2.7 Å resolution structure of trimeric photosystem I from this high-light-tolerant cyanobacterium. The structure shows a new conformation of the PsaL C-terminus that supports trimer formation of cyanobacterial photosystem I. The spectroscopic analysis of this photosystem I revealed a decrease in far-red absorption, which is attributed to a decrease in the number of long- wavelength chlorophylls. Using these findings, we constructed two chimeric PSIs in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp.

Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria carry out this process and are found in a wide variety of environments. Despite nearly 3 billion years of evolution, all oxygenic photosynthetic organisms use the same large pigment–protein complexes, known as photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), to convert solar energy to chemical energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fromme et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Witt, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zouni et al., 2000</xref>). Both complexes use light to induce a charge separation event, then transport the high-energy electron, ultimately to be stored as a chemical bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fromme et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Witt, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zouni et al., 2000</xref>). Although light is required for photosynthesis, an excess of light can be detrimental to photosynthetic organisms by damaging the photosynthetic proteins in a process called photoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kok, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones and Kok, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gururani et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the ability to adapt to different qualities and quantities of light is paramount for photosynthetic organisms to survive.</p><p>To prevent photoinhibition, photoprotective mechanisms such as changes in the photosystem content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Muramatsu and Hihara, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murakami and Fujita, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demmig-Adams and Adams, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miskiewicz et al., 2002</xref>), dissipation of excess energy as heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peltier and Schmidt, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levy et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jacob and Lawlor, 1993</xref>), and upregulation of antioxidant enzymes have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tsang et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camp, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang and Scheller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ort and Baker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horling, 2003</xref>). A response shown by the model cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 to high light is to decrease the PSI:PSII ratio, minimizing its light harvesting capacity and presumably protecting against the generation of reactive oxygen species around PSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hihara et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sonoike et al., 2001</xref>). This is in agreement with the response observed in vascular plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 1986</xref>). However, this response is not universal. In the terrestrial cyanobacteria, <italic>Synechococcus</italic> OS-B’, isolated from a microbial mat in a hot spring, the ratio of PSI:PSII increases upon high-light conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kilian, 2007</xref>), demonstrating the importance of PSI in the high-light response of cyanobacteria.</p><p>A significant amount of work on photoinhibition has focused on PSII due to its rapid turnover in high light and the efficient repair mechanisms that evolved to cope with PSII-specific photodamage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yao et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yao et al., 2012b</xref>). PSI-specific damage, however, is irreversible and long lived due to a lack of repair mechanisms, requiring the biosynthesis of new PSI polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sonoike, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Terashima et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sonoike et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lima-Melo et al., 2019</xref>). Fluctuating light and low temperatures have been attributed to PSI photoinhibition by causing an imbalance in the redox state of PSI donors and acceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sonoike, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allahverdiyeva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tiwari, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kudoh and Sonoike, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kono and Terashima, 2016</xref>). Recovery times in leaves for PSI-specific photodamage have been reported to be longer than a week, much longer than the 30 min half-life of the D1 protein of PSII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang and Scheller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yao et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kudoh and Sonoike, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanervo et al., 1993</xref>). PSI inhibition is therefore potentially more devastating than damage to PSII because it results in the over-reduction of the plastoquinone pool subsequently inhibiting PSII and thereby blocking the complete electron transfer chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sonoike, 2010</xref>). This has lead to the proposal that photoinhibition of PSII is a mechanism to protect PSI by reducing the amount of electrons sent to PSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tikkanen et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, there are multiple mechanisms acting on both the lumen and stromal side to reduce PSI damage under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sonoike, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tiwari, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Munekage, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Munekage et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Suorsa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Suorsa, 2015</xref>), suggesting PSI damage plays an important role in adaptation to stress. The first high-resolution structure of cyanobacterial PSI revealed a core antenna system comprised of 96 chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> (Chl<italic>a</italic>) molecules, of which 6 are integral to the electron transport chain (ETC), while the remaining chlorophyll molecules function to harvest light and transfer excitation energy to the ETC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fromme et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jordan et al., 2001</xref>). Still, the roles and properties of individual chlorophylls in the antenna remain largely unknown. While all chlorophyll molecules in cyanobacteria are chemically identical except one (one Chl<italic>a</italic> of P700 is Chl<italic>a</italic>’, the C13 epimer of Chl<italic>a</italic>), the local environment of a few individual chlorophylls has been shown to extend their absorbance properties above 700 nm, giving rise to long-wavelength chlorophylls (LWC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fromme et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wientjes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Croce and van Amerongen, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Further studies have revealed that, in cyanobacteria, LWC are associated with PSI and the amount of these pigments vary between species, suggesting that the number of LWC is an important evolutionary adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shubin et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gobets et al., 2001</xref>). It has also been shown that LWC are strongly affected by their immediate chemical environment. The absorbance properties of specific chlorophylls are highly dependent on its coordinating residues as well as excitonic coupling between neighboring chlorophylls; and changing either can alter the spectroscopic properties of a chlorophyll. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wientjes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Toporik, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khmelnitskiy et al., 2020</xref>). These characteristics have led to several suggestions to the physiological role of LWC such as directing energy to P700, extending light-harvesting capabilities into the far red, and photoprotective mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Valkunas et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Trissl, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rivadossi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schlodder et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herascu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While the function of PSI is conserved in all photosynthetic organisms, the oligomeric state and subunit composition of PSI varies. Higher plants exclusively utilize monomeric PSI, whereas cyanobacteria utilize monomeric, trimeric, and tetrameric oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). It has been suggested that trimerization is a way of modulating light harvesting in changing light conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chitnis and Chitnis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sener et al., 2004</xref>). The PsaL subunit has been shown to be vital for these larger oligomeric complexes to form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chitnis and Chitnis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malavath et al., 2018</xref>). Adding a single histidine to the C-terminus of PsaL was shown to completely disrupt trimerization in Synechocystis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malavath et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Netzer-El et al., 2018</xref>). The first crystal structures of PSI from <italic>Thermosynechococcus elongatus</italic> and <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC. 6,803 (<italic>Synechocystis</italic>) showed that the C-terminus of PsaL coordinates a calcium ion together with the PsaL subunit of the adjacent monomer, which was suggested to stabilize trimer formation and emphasized the importance of the C-terminus of PsaL in oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jordan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mazor et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In order to understand how the light harvesting machinery has evolved to adapt to high-light conditions, we isolated a cyanobacterium from the Sonoran Desert, an environment with light intensities regularly exceeding 1600 µmol photon m<sup>–2</sup>s<sup>–1</sup>, in order to characterize its photosynthetic machinery.

<italic>Synechocystis</italic> reveals a high degree of conservation, except for chlorophyll B40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This chlorophyll is located next to a seven amino acid insertion seen in the sequence alignment of PsaB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) that creates a loop sterically forcing chlorophyll B40 to shift its orientation in <italic>C. aponinum</italic>. As a result, the coupling between chlorophyll B40 and B19 changes. The significance of this conformation was determined using a combination of mutagenesis and modeling (see below). Shorter insertions at the same PsaB location are also observed in PSI sequences from other photoautotrophs, including <italic>T. elongatus</italic> and <italic>Pisum sativum</italic>, marking this PsaB loop as a unique, variable region, in the core PSI (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The structure of <italic>T. elongatus</italic> PSI shows the corresponding B40 chlorophyll is not present due to an additional subunit, PsaX, which results in a different conformation of this loop relative to <italic>C. aponinum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jordan et al., 2001</xref>), sterically blocking the binding site of chlorophyll B40. In the structure of <italic>P. sativum</italic> PSI, chlorophyll B40 is present; however, it exhibits a similar shift compared to <italic>C. aponinum</italic> because of a two amino acids insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the rearrangement around chlorophyll B40, an additional chlorophyll molecule was modeled on the stromal side of the PsaK subunit in the <italic>C. aponinum</italic> structure. This chlorophyll was not modeled in early cyanobacteria PSI structures; however, it has been recently resolved in PSI structures from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> and <italic>Synechococcus</italic> sp.

The loop on the stromal side in <italic>C. aponinum</italic> lays relatively flat along the membrane plane and only differs slightly in conformation compared to plant PSI due to the PsaH subunit, which is missing in cyanobacteria. In the plant PSI structure this loop is raised to accommodate the binding of PsaH shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p>Previously solved PSI structures from cyanobacteria reveal that the C-terminus of PsaL from one monomer coordinates a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion together with a negatively charged residue from the adjacent PsaL subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jordan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mazor et al., 2013</xref>). However, in the structure from <italic>C. aponinum</italic> this interaction does not occur, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. Comparing the structures of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> and <italic>C. aponinum</italic> revealed that at the position of aspartate 73, one of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordinating residues in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, a leucine is present in <italic>C. aponinum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Unlike aspartate, leucine is an uncharged species which prevents the coordination of this Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion. Furthermore, the C-terminus in <italic>C. aponinum</italic> is longer than <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>) and would sterically prevent oligomerization if adopting the same orientation as <italic>Synechocystis</italic>.</p><p>A similar orientation of PsaL was shown in the structure of the PSI-IsiA antenna super-complex from <italic>Synechococcus</italic>. In this structure, there is also no Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion modeled and an asparagine is in the coordination position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2020</xref>). To understand the frequency of cyanobacterial PSI that coordinate a calcium ion, a protein alignment of 680 cyanobacteria PsaL sequences was constructed and sorted by their position on an evolutionary tree. This alignment revealed that the position of the calcium coordinating residue is variable in cyanobacteria. Early structures suggest a negatively charged residue is crucial for the calcium coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jordan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malavath et al., 2018</xref>); however, negatively charged residues were present in only 48% of sequences in this alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). The next most prevalent residue in this position is asparagine, occurring in 30% of the sequences. The recent PSI-IsiA structure from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2020</xref> contains an asparagine at this position, demonstrating that asparagine does not coordinate an calcium ion. Additionally, in eukaryotic organisms, which contain monomeric PSI, the residue at this position is as asparagine in 81% of sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Therefore, other interactions must be present for trimerization to occur, as less than 50% of cyanobacteria contain a residue capable of coordinating Ca<sup>2+</sup> at this position.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Structural changes lead to spectral shifts around the Q<sub>y</sub> transition</title><p>To explore the functional significance of the structural differences highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> between <italic>C. aponinum</italic> and <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (henceforth <italic>WT Synechocystis</italic>), two mutant strains of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> were constructed.

Residues containing a negative charge are seen at this location in ~50% of species, including <italic>WT Synechocystis</italic> and <italic>T. elongatus</italic>, which likely corresponds to coordination of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In <italic>Synechococcus</italic> however, the coordinating residue is an asparagine. The recently solved PSI structure from <italic>Synechococcus</italic> lacks a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion, giving further support to the importance of this residue in coordinating a calcium ion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2020</xref>). While the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> aids in the stabilization of trimerization for some species, the structure of trimeric PSI from <italic>C. aponinum</italic> and <italic>Synechococcus</italic> shows it is not required. It is interesting to note that the majority of differences in sequence between <italic>C. aponinum</italic> and <italic>WT Synechocystis</italic> occur in the intermonomer space. These differences probably stabilize the monomer–monomer interaction in <italic>C. aponinum</italic> despite the absence of the PsaL Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion.</p><p>The mechanism underlying the contribution of PSI to photoprotection in <italic>C. aponinum</italic> is not presently clear; however, PSI is potentially the most potent quencher of excitation energy in the cell. The optical properties of PSI from <italic>C. aponinum</italic> are similar to the eukaryotic core PSI family, with a low number of LWC. The contribution of PSI to cellular resistance to high light can stem from its interaction with other components of the light reactions, such as PSII, PBS, or the stress-induced antenna, IsiA, as has been suggested in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tiwari, 2016</xref>). The role played by LWC in these interactions is not clear to a large degree because specific mutations or precise information on the architecture of LWC in PSI is scarce. Previously, it was hypothesized that LWCs can serve several functions within the core PSI antenna. Light harvesting in the far-red region is one clear suggestion, but it was also shown that low energy states associated with LWC are quenched by an oxidized P700<sup>+</sup> and that this varies between cyanobacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schlodder et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herascu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schlodder et al., 2011</xref>). This shows that energy transfer in the core PSI antenna varies depending on the oxidation state of P700 and this can be important during high-light conditions when P700 is in its oxidized state. A specific LWC in PSI, in close proximity to the ETC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schlodder et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herascu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schlodder et al., 2011</xref>), is responsible for this effect and can play a role in photoprotection. In this scenario, the optical adaptations that are seen in <italic>C. aponinum</italic> facilitate energy transfer through this LWC, this is consistence with our 77 K emission results, which show red shifted emission from <italic>C. aponinum</italic> compared to <italic>WT Synechocystis,</italic> probably due to the contribution from this site. Overall, it is necessary to develop an understanding of individual LWC as specific sites (these sites probably include more than one chlorophyll molecule) that carry out specific functions. An essential step on this route is identifying specific LWC and factors that tune them in PSI, as the present study does.</p><p>The environment that <italic>C. aponinum</italic> was isolated from provides ideal conditions for using P700 as a photoprotective mechanism. PSI-specific photodamage is known to be induced by fluctuating light and cold temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sonoike, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Terashima et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sonoike et al., 1997</xref>); however, the environment <italic>C. aponinum</italic> was isolated from rarely experiences these conditions. Constant light and temperature may allow P700 to withstand more irradiance without causing photoinhibition.</p><p>PSI displays high conservation in sequence and structure across domains despite the vastly different environments occupied by photosynthetic organisms. The results of this work show that small structural variations can have large effects, highlighting the sensitivity of pigments to the local electronic environment, and potentially giving rise to physiological advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wientjes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wientjes et al., 2011</xref>). The structural effects on spectroscopic properties of PSI observed in this work lay the foundations for intelligently designing photosynthetic organisms with absorption spectra tuned to specific light environments. The structure and biochemical characterization of trimeric PSI from <italic>C. aponinum</italic> advances the fundamental understanding of the photosynthetic machinery in organisms that can survive extreme light conditions and reinforces the need to study extremophiles and their adaptations to fully understand the photosynthetic process.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Selection conditions</title><p>Crude biofilm samples were placed in 50 ml of BG-11 media in Erlenmeyer flasks and exposed to &gt;3000 µmol photons m<sup>–2</sup>s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekker, 2004</xref>).

The results give important clues about the adaptations of photosynthetic systems that allow them to function under such harsh environmental conditions. The revised version of the paper clears up most of the questions presented by the reviewers and adds data pointing to a possible new insights on the function of long wavelength chlorophylls in photosystem I light harvesting complexes.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The Structure of Photosystem I from a High-Light Tolerant Cyanobacteria&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Geoffry A. Davis (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All of the reviewers felt that the structural work was both interesting and well done. Also, there was considerable enthusiasm for the approach of comparing structures from diverse species that might reveal interesting adaptations to different environments.</p><p>On the other hand, all of the reviewers had substantial questions about how the identified structural variations relate to the biophysical/spectroscopic measurements or whether these differences were relevant to any physiological changes.</p><p>It should be possible to address the spectroscopy issues by reanalyzing the data along the lines of that proposed by reviewer 4.</p><p>It will probably be more difficult to deal with the issue of physiological relevance. As stated by several of the reviewers, given the many changes that are likely to have occurred between the two species, it is difficult to know if the specific structural variations identified in the paper are important, or indeed, if they have any physiological consequences by themselves. It may be, as pointed out by one reviewer, that the big story is not that there are vast differences, but that there are so few differences.</p><p>It was also pointed out that there is an inherent difficulty with comparing light acclimation between two species, especially those that are quite distantly related and grow under very different light regimes.</p><p>From these comments, it would seem that directly addressing the question of physiological relevance will require some additional data, though it may be possible to approach to achieve this by extending the bioinformatics approaches rather than additional experimentation.</p><p>A second approach would be to better focus the discussion to aspects of the structure that are more directly supported by the data itself, and discuss the potential implications more hypothetically. It would be great if this could be achieved while retaining the intended high impact.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The paper can be improved by: (1) better describing the fitting methods and their bases; (2) describing alternative models; (3) providing more evidence and arguments that the structural differences that we observed are relevant to the selection pressure or physiological differences required for growth in the different light regimes; and (4) acknowledging and discussing that the light environments are relative, e.g. that using Synechococcus, which is generally found growing at very low light, may not be an adequate (sole) comparison for a high light species.</p><p>1) &quot;…had a constant drip of fresh water and exposed to extreme light conditions.&quot; How is 1300 uE an extreme light? Are all terrestrial vascular plants now extremophiles?</p><p>2) In this regard, choosing <italic>Synechocystis</italic> as a comparison is a bit of a &quot;straw man&quot; and it would be more appropriate to compare to a wider range of species/strains. In other words, wouldn't it be more accurate to say that <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is adapted to LOW light, rather than <italic>C. aponiunum</italic> adapted to high? If this is true, then the story may be about selection pressure for low light rather than photoprotectiom.</p><p>3) The work shows that <italic>C. aponium</italic> can grow at higher light than Synechocystis. However, it was not possible to attribute this difference to PSI properties. This would be a pretty high bar to set, of course, but can the authors make the case that the differences they do observe are relevant?</p><p>4) The experiments exposed plates to 3000 µmol photons m-2 s<sup>-1</sup>, which is higher than that these cells experience in the real world. What is the argument that 3000 uE is physiologically relevant? Is it not the case that this selects for something not relevant to nature?</p><p>5) The 77K emission spectrum is not a measure of PSI:PSII content, but on the distribution of excitation energy. Further, the interpretation of these spectra is dependent on the specific excitation wavelength. For instance, if cyan light will excite the PBS, which can dump energy differently into PSI and PSII, compared to, e.g. blue light. The emission spectrum is also impacted by cell density and other factors. None of these issues is acknowledged in the text, nor is that excitation wavelength described in the Methods, as is clear from the scant description given in the text: &quot;An Oxford instruments Cryostat was used to cool 26 the sample to 77 K (cells were plunged into liquid nitrogen and measured immersed in liquid nitrogen).&quot; which does not give any indication of the instrument, excitation, cell concentration, etc., though Figure 2 mentions that particular data was collected with excitation at 440 nm. What is the resolution of the spectrometer?</p><p>6) Figure 3. The spectra are interpreted as apparent shifts based on subtracting pairs of spectra normalized to their peaks. This seems to be based on a subjective interpretation and other interpretations are possible. Changing the normalization point could result in an entirely different interpretation. For instance, normalizing to a point on the red side of the peak could give the appearance of an increase in absorbance or emission on the blue edge of the spectrum (rather than a shift). The deconvolution of the absorbance spectra using three Gaussian components as in Figure 2D is likewise based on an assumption or interpretation that there are only these components.</p><p>7) The text needs to be more circumspect and/or directly address this as a possibility, since such alternative normalization could indicate a quite different story. For example, the text reads: &quot;The difference spectrum of <italic>C. aponinum</italic> – <italic>Synechocystis</italic> shows a strong negative peak at 701 nm revealing that <italic>C. aponinum</italic> PSI contains less LWC 150 than <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (Figure 2D).&quot; It suggests this, but there are other interpretations. This issue is more evident further in the manuscript, in Figure 4, a different method of normalization was used, as stated in the following: &quot;The absorbance spectra were normalized to the area between 650 nm to 775 nm and the spectrum of Wild Type <italic>Synechocystis</italic> was 238 subtracted from Red_c (Figure 4C and 4D).&quot; As argued above, changing the normalization method can give rise to different interpretations, so some real justification must be presented for using a particular approach, and an even stronger argument needs to be made when changing the normalization between samples. None is given.</p><p>8) Figure 4 D compares isolated complexes from two different species and the differences spectra can be interpreted as a series of narrowing and shifting of spectra, but all of which are likely to be dependent on the method of normalization, which is not adequately described. Moever, the method used to make the differences spectra were not consistently applied, e.g. &quot;[t]he absorbance spectra were normalized to the area between 650 nm to 775 nm and the spectrum of Wild Type <italic>Synechocystis</italic> was subtracted from Red_c (Figure 4C and 4D).&quot; What were the criteria for using the different procedures and how was bias avoided?</p><p>9) The shifts in absorbance and fluorescence emission are quite small, especially realizing that the bands tend to sharpen at 77K. At RT, there may be essentially no functionally-relevant differences in the spectra. How can this be addressed?</p><p>10) Can the text be expanded to further discuss the very large apparent difference in PsaF?</p><p>11) <italic>Cyanobacterium aponinum</italic> (C. 78 aponinum). should be both Ital. Is this an official name?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Dobson et al., describes photosystem I (PSI) of a high-light tolerant cyanobacterium, <italic>Cyanobacterium aponinum</italic> 0216, isolated from an environmental sample at both the sequence and structural level and attempts to test how differences in the <italic>C. aponinum</italic> (PSI) sequences may result in the structural and spectroscopic differences characterized. The authors solved the Cryo-EM structure of trimeric PSI of <italic>C. aponinum</italic> and noted two major differences with the model cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PCC 6803 trimeric PSI, namely insertions in the PsaB and PsaL sequences, potentially resulting in a shifted position of chlorophyll B40 and loss of calcium ion coordination by PsaL. With the construction of a <italic>Synechocystis</italic> mutant containing the <italic>C. aponinum</italic> PsaB sequence, the authors attempted to clarify if the structural changes around chlorophyll B40 could explain the loss of long wavelength chlorophylls and absorbance differences seen in <italic>C. aponinum</italic>. The work carried out by the authors is useful in the understanding of structural and sequence variability in PSI for understanding chlorophyll energy tuning as well as the variability in amino acid sequences throughout cyanobacterial PSI subunits and how they may be adapted for specific light conditions.</p><p>The spectral characterization of <italic>C. aponinum</italic> PSI relative to <italic>Synechocystis</italic> provides the crux of the rationale for the work done in the manuscript, however the discussion and interpretation by the authors is limited to primarily the baseline differences between the spectra. As <italic>C. aponinum</italic> is presented as a cyanobacterium isolated via propagation of environmental samples at 3,500 umol photons m-2s<sup>-1</sup>, discussion of the physiological significance of the PSI differences is minimal.</p><p>The <italic>C. aponinum</italic> PSI Cryo-EM is well discussed and presented by the authors to highlight the structural features that may be involved in shifted the absorbance spectrum and the loss of far-red wavelength chlorophylls. Calculations of the excitonic interactions based on the solved structure and the shifted position of chlorophyll B40 (relative to the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> position) highlighted the utility of solving the PSI structure rather than relying on sequence differences modeled onto reference structures.</p><p>Similarly beneficial to the objective of trying to understand how <italic>C. aponinum</italic> differences impact the function of PSI is the introduction of <italic>C. aponium</italic> PsaB sequence into <italic>Synechocystis</italic> and analysis of the resulting spectrum and far-red chlorophyll presence. As the authors found a large shift in the position of chlorophyll B40 in <italic>C. aponinum</italic> PSI, potentially caused by amino acid changes in the PsaB gene, the introduction and testing in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is a reasonable first method to understand the impact. The discussion of this chimeric PSI (Red_c) should be addressed better to make clear what is being referenced, the Red_c mutant versus <italic>C. aponinum</italic> itself, as discussion of the differences seems to misstate at times what is actually being compared.</p><p>While the manuscript presents data in a clear, concise format, there are some outstanding issues that should be addressed to improve the understanding of the results and significance of the findings.</p><p>The selection strategy was using 3,000 umol photons m-2s<sup>-1</sup> light to select for high light tolerant strains. As the sample was from the Sonoran desert, it would be useful to clarify if/what temperature was used for the selection as well, as the growth temperature of 30C is not particularly high for many cyanobacteria.</p><p>The figures detailing the characterization of PSI between different samples could benefit from a clearer delineation between the samples shown. For most samples, the spectra are nearly identical, and the differences, or the fact that two samples are shown is nearly impossible to determine (figures 2C, 4C).</p><p>Similarly, it would be useful to discuss the other differences in PSI subunit composition. From the analysis of isolated PSI (figure 2), the authors discuss the migration differences between PsaL. However, there are clear differences between the migration of other subunits as well. Whether the primary sequences are markedly different should be mentioned. The authors also state that the expected number of bands is observed for <italic>C. aponinum</italic> (line 137). It is unclear from the figure if that is the case, as five distinct bands are visible in the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sample but only four in C. aponinum. If PsaF migrates almost together with PsaD that should be clarified.</p><p>Lines 176-177 should be clarify which chlorophylls are discussed relative to the changes in B40 coupling.</p><p>The description of the chimeric <italic>Synechocystis</italic> mutant needs considerable clarification. Figure 4B: what is Blue6803? The legend for Figure 2G does not seem to be correct. It should also be clarified that the amino acids present in <italic>C. aponinum</italic> are not mutations (ex: line 253, 399), they are the wild-type sequences and are different relative to Synechocystis. The discussion within the section of the excitonic coupling calculations should also be addressed to clarify the distinction between the <italic>C. aponinum</italic> structure and the Synechocycsist Red_C mutant.</p><p>As the PsaB changes around chlorophyll B40 did not explain either the absorbance spectrum changes or the long-wavelength chlorophyll differences, the authors also discuss amino acid differences in the vicinity between the two species. It would be beneficial to do a similar comparison between these positions and amino acid composition between difference cyanobacterial species as was done for the calcium binding residue position. This may also provide more information to discuss these changes rather than a preliminary list of the differences between the two structures.</p><p>It is interesting that this mutant did not reproduce either the <italic>C. aponinum</italic> absorbance spectrum or the loss of far-red wavelength chlorophylls, again highlighting the utility of doing both the sequence and structure comparisons. While it would increase the impact of this work to also include mutation comparisons introducing the <italic>C. aponinum</italic> PsaL into Synechocystis, as well as the double <italic>C. aponinum</italic> PsaB/PsaL chimera, that work may not be feasible under current circumstances. However, because the Red_c mutant did not explain the differences between absorbance spectra, a more detailed discussion of how the various changes may be involved in those changes should be carried out.</p><p>Based on the presentation in the manuscript, it is unclear why full genome sequencing was performed, as PSI genes could have presumably be sequenced via PCR methods. The authors do themselves a disservice at having done this analysis and essentially not addressing the results. It would be interesting to know if there are any genes within the genome beside those highlighted for PSI that may be of interest in understanding the high-light capacity of this cyanobacterium.</p><p>The methods section should be tidied up. Many explanations are unnecessary and likely could be better described via referencing previous works.</p><p>In general the manuscript requires further proof-reading throughout to rectify typos, italicization issues, unit labels, etc.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this work, Dobson Z et al., target the PSI complex of a high-light adaptive cyanobacterium <italic>C. aponinum</italic> 0216. The cyanobacterial PSI complexes carry a number of long wavelength chlorophylls (LWCs) in their core antennae. The LWCs were suggested to increase the absorption cross section of PSI, and to serve in photoprotective function. In this work, they suggest that the <italic>C. aponinum</italic> PSI contains less LWC compared with <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PSI, based on their spectroscopic results. They further determine the 2.7 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of PSI complex from the high-light tolerant strain to investigate if it possesses some special structural features. The structure shows that one chlorophyll, B40, shifts its orientation which is likely induced by an inserted loop in PsaB of <italic>C. aponinum</italic> PSI. Therefore, they assume that the altered loop region and chlorophyll B40 are responsible for the spectral property of less LWC in <italic>C. aponinum</italic> PSI. To confirm this assumption, they construct a mutant form of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> strain containing the sequence of the PsaB loop from <italic>C. aponinum</italic>. However, spectra of the mutant PSI indicate that chlorophyll B40 is not responsible for the difference of LWC. Then they analyze the local environment of chlorophylls in <italic>C. aponinum</italic> and <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PSI, and suggest that the local environment of chlorophylls B7-A32-A31 accounts for some of the differences in the absorption spectra.</p><p>Overall, the structural data in this work is solid. Generating a mutant strain possessing the different peptide sequence to induce different chlorophyll arrangement based on the structural data is useful in analyzing the spectral property and potential function of individual chlorophyll molecules. It was widely applied in the previous studies to generate a mutant strain possessing different pigment arrangement and to analyze the spectral difference of photosynthetic complexes from the mutant strain, now with the high-resolution structural information, the interpretation of the biochemical and spectral data are more reliable, as the structure provides details regarding the position, orientation and environment of each chlorophyll molecules.</p><p>In this work, although the red LWCs or the factors affecting the spectral features of this high-light tolerant cyanobacterial PSI are not identified, they do have some suggestions/ideas worthy of further exploration based on their present results. Therefore the findings about <italic>C. aponinum</italic> PSI are beneficial to the photosynthesis research field, including the artificial photosynthesis research. The conclusions and suggestions put forward by the authors are largely supported by their data, but some aspects of data analysis need to be clarified and amended.</p><p>The interpretation of spectral analysis of <italic>C. aponinum</italic> PSI is questionable. They conclude that <italic>C. aponinum</italic> PSI contains less LWC than <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PSI based on the differences of absorption spectra between the two PSIs shown in Figures 2C and 2D. However, the difference is very small, with the amplitude of δ-absorbance lower than 0.04, which seems within the error range, while the absorbance of the PSI complex is around 1.5. On the contrary, the 2-nm red-shift of 77K fluorescence emission of <italic>C. aponinum</italic> PSI is quite evident (Figure 2F). Therefore it is possible that <italic>C. aponinum</italic> PSI contains more, but not less, LWC.</p><p>They construct a mutant form of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> strain containing the sequence of the PsaB loop from <italic>C. aponinum</italic>, and find that the 77K fluorescence emission of the mutant PSI is the same with <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PSI. Thus conclude that chlorophyll B40 is not responsible for the different absorption of LWC. Although they confirm the complete and correct replacement of PsaB in the mutant strain, they do not validate that B40 orientates the same with that in <italic>C. aponinum</italic> PSI. Since the loop regions are usually highly flexible and may adopt quite different conformation even with the same primary sequence, it is possible that B40 is indeed responsible for the different absorption of LWC in C. aponinum, but B40 in the mutant does not change its orientation, i.e. adopts the same orientation as that in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PSI.</p><p><italic>C. aponinum</italic> is a high-light tolerant cyanobacterium, and it does not grow well under low light conditions as shown in Figure 1C. However, in this study, they culture the cells at low light (∼40 μE), which may lead to some changes of the photosynthetic complexes, therefore the structural features of PSI important for <italic>C. aponinum</italic> to survive in the high light environment cannot be identified.This reviewer understands that the difference of absorption spectra between PSI from <italic>C. aponinum</italic> and <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is very small, as only a few chlorophylls are changed. However, if they would like to use the spectral data, they need to prove that the differences of absorption spectra are indeed due to the different spectral property of PSI, but not the standard error. The spectra should be repeated at least three times for each PSI complexes and the differences of the repeated spectra should be shown in the paper.</p><p>It's better to determine the structure of the PSI complex from the constructed mutant to show the orientation of chlorophyll B40. If it is the same as that in <italic>C. aponinum</italic> PSI, this result will further strengthen their conclusion. If it is not, then chlorophyll B40 should be further investigated.</p><p>It will be more convincing if they purify and determine the structure of the PSI complex from <italic>C. aponinum</italic> cultured under high-light conditions.</p><p>Figure 4 please explain Blue6803 and Red_c.</p><p>Line 276, B39/B40 -&gt; B19/B40</p><p>Line 363, The orientation of the C-terminus -&gt; The orientation of the C-terminus of PsaL</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>In this work the authors present the structure and the biochemical and spectroscopic properties of the photosystem I complex of a high light tolerant cyanobacterium, C. aponimum. They find that this complex has slightly different spectroscopic features compared to PSI from the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis, which grows in low/medium light, and try to relate them to the differences in light growth conditions. Next they proceed to mutate <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PSI introducing some of the structural features present in <italic>C. aponimum</italic> PSI. By comparing the spectroscopic properties of the two complexes, they could identify the absorption property of one specific chlorophyll out of the 96 present in the complex.</p><p>The work is interesting and nicely combines structural and spectroscopic data. The conclusions on the second part of the work are sound and show how the protein environment can tune the spectroscopic properties of the pigments. On the other hand the link between the observed PSI features and the high light tolerance of this organism is less convincing.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>The authors discuss the PSI/PSII ratio of the cells and relate it to the light stress experienced by the two organisms. There are two relevant points</p><p>1. The correlation between PSI/PSII ratio and light intensity is less straight forward than indicated in the manuscript. This ratio depends on the species and in plants does not change in different light conditions.</p><p>2. The authors estimate the PSI/PSII ratio using the relative intensity of the 680- and 720-nm peaks of the 77-K fluorescence spectra. This quantification is not reliable because it depends on the excited-state lifetimes of PSI and PSII complexes, which might be different in the two organisms. The PSI/PSII ratio should be determined biochemically (i.e. by looking at the protein content) and/or via physiological measurements (electrochromic shift, P700 oxidation rates, etc.). On the other hand, this information is not essential for this manuscript, since the discussion about changes in PSI/PSII ratio is not needed (see the previous point) and PSI is the main focus of the manuscript.</p><p>The authors noted – correctly – that the PSI of the high-light growing <italic>C. aponimum</italic> has a lower content of red Chls in comparison to PSI of Synechocystis. However, the correlation of the red Chl content to light stress conditions remains unclear, and the related discussion (page 21) is not very convincing. In general, the authors seem to favor the conclusion that red Chls are detrimental for PSI in high light, which would explain the reduced red Chl content of <italic>C. aponimum</italic> PSI. For instance, the authors hypothesize that <italic>C. aponimum</italic> PSI might carry less red Chls to reduce its trapping time and maximize photoprotection. This claim is not supported by data, since the authors do not measure the trapping time of the two PSI. Moreover, it is known from the analysis of other organisms that the differences in PSI trapping times with different red Chl content are typically small, and that the PSI of cyanobacteria always behaves as a very efficient trap (lifetime &lt; 50 ps) and is therefore well protected independent of the red Chl content. The other hypothesis regarding the IsiA ring (i.e. that the IsiA ring is mainly there to drag excitations away from the red Chls) is also not sound.</p><p>The last section in the results is not as strong as the rest of the work and could be removed/reduced. Indeed, the differences in amino acids (mostly aromatic) around Chls B7, A31, A32 do not seem enough to justify the presence/absence of a red Chl cluster. Indeed, red Chls in PSI are usually ascribed to charge-transfer states, which are expected to be influenced more by changes in surrounding charged/polar residues rather than aromatic ones. Also, the mentioned calcium ion seems to be too distant from the Chl cluster to really play an effect in this sense. Finally, the hypothesis of electron donation to a Chl by an aromatic amino acid having a large influence on the spectral properties (discussion, page 20) is not sound from a chemical perspective.</p><p>Detailed points:</p><p>Lines 34-39.

That being said, the Sonoran Desert experiences one of the highest light conditions on the planet, experiencing over 300 days of sunlight per year. We theorize that an organism isolated from this type of desert environment could have adapted unique properties. Additionally, the south facing wall (with no shade) provides an optimal environment for studying an organism adapted to experiencing high light. In addition, an even higher light intensity was used during the selection process that ultimately revealed the ability of <italic>C. aponinum</italic> to grow in conditions up to 3000 µmol photons m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> to explore the limits of light adaptation.</p><p>In our opinion comparing these light intensities to the 200 µmol photons m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> used to culture other desert cyanobacteria in (Alwathnani, A. and Jeffrey, R.

In other words, wouldn't it be more accurate to say that Synechocystis is adapted to LOW light, rather than C. aponiunum adapted to high? If this is true, then the story may be about selection pressure for low light rather than photoprotectiom.</p></disp-quote><p>Our main motivation for using <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is that it is used in laboratories worldwide as the model cyanobacterium leading to its PSI being well characterized. <italic>Synechocystis</italic> can also be genetically modified relatively easily, so we are able to modify its PSI to test how structural variations effect spectroscopic properties. This allows us to validate the significance of the structural differences we observe in <italic>C. aponinum</italic>. Having a well characterized “baseline” to compare is paramount in order to reach any conclusions on the PSI core antenna. Additionally, <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is relatively close to <italic>C. aponinum</italic> on an evolutionary tree. While it may be possible to argue that <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is adapted to low light; “high-light” treatment is usually no more than 500 µmol photons m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> for short durations of time (see Muramatsu, M. and Hihara, Y.

However, it was not possible to attribute this difference to PSI properties. This would be a pretty high bar to set, of course, but can the authors make the case that the differences they do observe are relevant?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. This is an important question. Under high light conditions, PSII is known to become damaged. In <italic>C. aponinum</italic> we show that there is an increased dependence on PSI for cells grown under high light. Even with the contribution of PBS’s, this still means that the balance between the two available photochemical traps changes and PSI is now more dominant. It is true that we cannot yet fully explain how PSI acts to confer high light resistance, but we can show that it is an important conduit of excitation energy at high light. In the revised version of this manuscript, we demonstrate that the red states of PSI are affected by the presence of a ca<sup>2+</sup> ion located on the luminal side of PSI in the PsaL subunit. This explains the spectroscopic differences between the oligomeric states of PSI, a subject which has been studied for some time, as well as some of the properties of the core PSI complex in the green lineage. We think that identifying precise ways to manipulate the properties of PSI is integral to being able to address its contribution to high light stress and identify the underlying mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The experiments exposed plates to 3000 µmol photons m-2 s<sup>-1</sup>, which is higher than that these cells experience in the real world. What is the argument that 3000 uE is physiologically relevant? Is it not the case that this selects for something not relevant to nature?</p></disp-quote><p>3000mE was used during the selection on liquid cultures and not on plates. By exposing cells to extreme environments, we can explore the limits of light adaptation and thereby expose unique properties. This has been done in many genetic screens and has led to the elucidation of highly relevant cellular mechanisms. One example that comes to mind is DNA repair, where cells are often exposed to high levels of UV radiation or DNA damaging agents, still, the repair pathways that were discovered proved to be functional under everyday growth. While 3000mE is not something any cyanobacteria would experience in nature, the fact that <italic>C. aponinum</italic> could survive those conditions was the first indication that photosynthetic organisms can survive high light conditions. <italic>C. aponinum’s</italic> tolerance to high light conditions was also demonstrated on agar plates in direct comparison to <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (Figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The 77K emission spectrum is not a measure of PSI:PSII content, but on the distribution of excitation energy. Further, the interpretation of these spectra is dependent on the specific excitation wavelength. For instance, if cyan light will excite the PBS, which can dump energy differently into PSI and PSII, compared to, e.g. blue light. The emission spectrum is also impacted by cell density and other factors. None of these issues is acknowledged in the text, nor is that excitation wavelength described in the Methods, as is clear from the scant description given in the text: &quot;An Oxford instruments Cryostat was used to cool 26 the sample to 77 K (cells were plunged into liquid nitrogen and measured immersed in liquid nitrogen).&quot; which does not give any indication of the instrument, excitation, cell concentration, etc., though Figure 2 mentions that particular data was collected with excitation at 440 nm. What is the resolution of the spectrometer?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We altered the description in the Results section and improved the description in the method section. We refer to the 77K measurements as a way to approximate the reliance on PSI:PSII, and that is now better reflected in the text. We excited our sample at 440 nm which preferentially excite Chls. While some backflow to PBS may occur, the physiological relevant parameter is the PSI/PSII utilization which ultimately shows more reliance on (or energy distribution to) PSI after growing in high light. We used a Horiba Fluoromax-4 for these measurements with a stated resolution of +/- 0.5 nm. We have indicated our slit settings on both monochromators in the method section for both RT and 77 K measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3. The spectra are interpreted as apparent shifts based on subtracting pairs of spectra normalized to their peaks. This seems to be based on a subjective interpretation and other interpretations are possible. Changing the normalization point could result in an entirely different interpretation. For instance, normalizing to a point on the red side of the peak could give the appearance of an increase in absorbance or emission on the blue edge of the spectrum (rather than a shift). The deconvolution of the absorbance spectra using three Gaussian components as in Figure 2D is likewise based on an assumption or interpretation that there are only these components.</p></disp-quote><p>We now normalized the absorbance spectra to the area between 550-775 nm because the structures of each PSI reveal the same number of chlorophylls, making this method a reasonable approximation (this is different from the previous manuscript in which we used the 650-775 nm interval for integration). Normalizing the area between 550-775 normalized the amount of light being absorbed exclusively by chlorophylls. The presence of long wavelength features in the difference spectra persisted using several normalization methods and integration intervals. When computing the deconvolution of the peak, we used the least number of components that adequately fit the data, resulting in 3 total peaks. It’s entirely possible (even probable) that these peaks contain contributions from multiple Chls, we are not assigning these gaussians to specific chlorophylls in our work and our statements that these gaussians represent the contribution of LWC still holds. Methods with higher optical resolution are required to provide finer details on the electronic structure of LWC. Our choice of deconvolution and normalization represents, in our view, the most conservative treatment of our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The text needs to be more circumspect and/or directly address this as a possibility, since such alternative normalization could indicate a quite different story. For example, the text reads: &quot;The difference spectrum of C. aponinum – Synechocystis shows a strong negative peak at 701 nm revealing that C. aponinum PSI contains less LWC 150 than Synechocystis (Figure 2D).&quot; It suggests this, but there are other interpretations. This issue is more evident further in the manuscript, in Figure 4, a different method of normalization was used, as stated in the following: &quot;The absorbance spectra were normalized to the area between 650 nm to 775 nm and the spectrum of Wild Type Synechocystis was 238 subtracted from Red_c (Figure 4C and 4D).&quot; As argued above, changing the normalization method can give rise to different interpretations, so some real justification must be presented for using a particular approach, and an even stronger argument needs to be made when changing the normalization between samples. None is given.</p></disp-quote><p>The indication of different normalization methods were the results of typos that we apologies for, all the previous absorbance data was normalized using the same method to the area between 650 to 775 nm. We completely agree that the same normalization method should be applied to all relevant data and that any changes should be well reasoned. In this version of the manuscript all the presented absorbance spectra were normalized to the area between 550-775 nm to completely account for both Qy and Qx transitions contributions, so comparisons between species are consistent and there are no changes in normalization methods between absorbance samples as we have clarified in the text. Room temperature and 77K emission spectra were normalized to the max wavelength for comparison of peaks ratios and shapes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 4 D compares isolated complexes from two different species and the differences spectra can be interpreted as a series of narrowing and shifting of spectra, but all of which are likely to be dependent on the method of normalization, which is not adequately described. Moever, the method used to make the differences spectra were not consistently applied, e.g. &quot;[t]he absorbance spectra were normalized to the area between 650 nm to 775 nm and the spectrum of Wild Type Synechocystis was subtracted from Red_c (Figure 4C and 4D).&quot; What were the criteria for using the different procedures and how was bias avoided?</p></disp-quote><p>This was addressed by our answer above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The shifts in absorbance and fluorescence emission are quite small, especially realizing that the bands tend to sharpen at 77K. At RT, there may be essentially no functionally-relevant differences in the spectra. How can this be addressed?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point and was addressed in the new version of the manuscript. The addition of a new mutant (<italic>Red_d</italic>) to the updated manuscript shows a difference in LWC at room temperature in both absorption and emission measurements, but not 77K, and therefore we included the room temperature emission of all species/mutants to this version. These differences could be physiological significance, by possibly affecting the rate of chl triplet accumulation or any other damage inducing mechanism known to occur in PSI. Currently, <italic>C. aponinum</italic>, is not genetically amenable and we cannot test these mutations in this organism. On the other hand, transferring them to <italic>Synechocystis</italic> unavoidably leaves additional differences (in PSI and other cellular systems) between these two organisms unaccounted for. Generating a detailed understanding on the mechanisms that tune energy transfer and damage avoidance in PSI can ultimately provide the answer to this question, but the complexity of this system currently prevents a simple explanation, so more work should be done in the future to fully unravel the mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Can the text be expanded to further discuss the very large apparent difference in PsaF?</p></disp-quote><p>To explain this we have run, and included, a new gel that better separate the PsaF and PsaD bands (Figure 2B) and expanded an explanation in the manuscript. In the new gel, size differences can still be seen between some subunits, notably, PsaC, PsaD, and PsaF. We examined the DNA sequences for these genes carefully and found no evidence for additional sequences that can be translated at both the N and C termini. Based on the protein sequence data, the mass of PsaC for <italic>C. aponinum</italic> and <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is 8.82 kD and 8.83 kD, respectively; the mass of PsaD for <italic>C. aponinum</italic> and <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is 16.18 kD and 15.65 kD, respectively; and the mass of PsaF for <italic>C. aponinum</italic> and <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is 18.69 kD and 18.25 kD. These masses do not explain the difference in migration for either species, and the bands we observe on the gel do not correspond precisely to these molecular weights. However, due to the variations of sequences between species, some changes in detergent binding are likely different between these samples. This is known to cause gel shifting, and is common when analyzing membrane proteins via SDS-PAGE and can also account for soluble proteins like PsaC and PsaD. This is well described in (Rath, A., Glibowicka, M., Nadeau, V. G., Chen, G. and Deber, C. M. Detergent binding explains anomalous SDS-PAGE migration of membrane proteins. 106, 1760–1765 (2009)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Cyanobacterium aponinum (C. 78 aponinum). should be both Ital.

Additionally, Figure 6 —figure supplement 1 compare the structure of <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, <italic>C. aponinum</italic>, and <italic>Pisum Sativum</italic> (Pea plant), a known eukaryotic PSI structure. Plants have less LWC in its core PSI (Croce, Roberta, Giuseppe Zucchelli, Flavio M. Garlaschi, and Robert C. Jennings. 1998. “A Thermal Broadening Study of the Antenna Chlorophylls in PSI- 200, LHCI, and PSI Core.” Biochemistry.). Further, we have added multiple sequence alignment statistics of the residues shown in Figure 6, to the supplemental figures, investigating the identity of these residues across bacteria and eukaryotic databases (Figure 6 —figure supplements 2-4), demonstrating that these specific residues vary between cyanobacteria and eukaryotic organisms, and that <italic>C. aponinum</italic> contains residues that are more prevalent in eukaryotic organisms than in cyanobacteria. It’s important to note that we don’t want to discount the possibility that water molecules (which we cannot resolve at the current resolution) could be causing the shifts in the spectral characteristics, however the amino acids nearby could also be the underlying reason for a different organization of water molecules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is interesting that this mutant did not reproduce either the C. aponinum absorbance spectrum or the loss of far-red wavelength chlorophylls, again highlighting the utility of doing both the sequence and structure comparisons. While it would increase the impact of this work to also include mutation comparisons introducing the C. aponinum PsaL into Synechocystis, as well as the double C. aponinum PsaB/PsaL chimera, that work may not be feasible under current circumstances. However, because the Red_c mutant did not explain the differences between absorbance spectra, a more detailed discussion of how the various changes may be involved in those changes should be carried out.</p></disp-quote><p>We included a new mutant, <italic>Red_d</italic>, in this manuscript to explain the consequence of calcium ion binding which partially answers this remark. We agree that generating additional combinations of site mutations is important, however more information is needed before we approach this large task, and we think this should be addressed in a separate work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on the presentation in the manuscript, it is unclear why full genome sequencing was performed, as PSI genes could have presumably be sequenced via PCR methods. The authors do themselves a disservice at having done this analysis and essentially not addressing the results. It would be interesting to know if there are any genes within the genome beside those highlighted for PSI that may be of interest in understanding the high-light capacity of this cyanobacterium.</p></disp-quote><p>Because the 16S based tree suggested this is a new species, we sequenced the entire genome to confirm this, and this data is now publicly available for the community to study (NCBI:txid2676140).

They conclude that C. aponinum PSI contains less LWC than Synechocystis PSI based on the differences of absorption spectra between the two PSIs shown in Figures 2C and 2D. However, the difference is very small, with the amplitude of δ-absorbance lower than 0.04, which seems within the error range, while the absorbance of the PSI complex is around 1.5. On the contrary, the 2-nm red-shift of 77K fluorescence emission of C. aponinum PSI is quite evident (Figure 2F). Therefore it is possible that C. aponinum PSI contains more, but not less, LWC.</p></disp-quote><p>A 0.04 difference is well above the baseline variation of our spectrophotometer (which is app. 0.0005 OD over the measured wavelength range). To better demonstrate the robustness of this measurement, PSI was isolated from both <italic>C. aponinum</italic> and <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 3 separate times and absorption spectra were taken on 3 separate days and compared to each other. These spectra were then normalized according to our methods section, and the difference spectra of these measurements are shown in Figure 2D, including the standard deviation of the measurements along the entire wavelength range, showing that around the Qy transition (which includes the LWCs) the variation is negligible compared to the size of the difference signal. 77K emission is not a good indication for the total number of LWC, as it is affected by transfer processes that still occur at 77K, therefore this measurement is a better indication of the terminal emitter in PSI. Our hypothesis is that eliminating some of the LWC in <italic>C. aponinum</italic> causes increased energy transfer to a different LWC, which now has a stronger contribution to 77 K emission. This is consistent with the findings that <italic>C. aponinum</italic> contains less LWC but displays a red shifted emission peak at 77K. The principles of this hypothesis are that the contribution of a specific LWC to the 77K emission depends not only on its transition energy but also on its connectivity. This has been shown by many studies, but our recent work on site specific mutations in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is relevant for this particular case (Khmelnitskiy, A., Toporik, H., Mazor, Y. and Jankowiak, R. On the Red Antenna States of Photosystem I Mutants from Cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC 6803. <italic>J. Phys. Chem. B</italic> (2020). doi:10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c05201).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They construct a mutant form of Synechocystis strain containing the sequence of the PsaB loop from C. aponinum, and find that the 77K fluorescence emission of the mutant PSI is the same with Synechocystis PSI. Thus conclude that chlorophyll B40 is not responsible for the different absorption of LWC. Although they confirm the complete and correct replacement of PsaB in the mutant strain, they do not validate that B40 orientates the same with that in C. aponinum PSI. Since the loop regions are usually highly flexible and may adopt quite different conformation even with the same primary sequence, it is possible that B40 is indeed responsible for the different absorption of LWC in C. aponinum, but B40 in the mutant does not change its orientation, i.e. adopts the same orientation as that in Synechocystis PSI.</p></disp-quote><p>The general statement that loop regions are more flexible than regions with secondary structure is of course correct, but we do not think it applies in this particular case. The first indication for this is the fact that the B40 loop is well resolved in our cryo-EM structure, this means that it adopts a relatively stable conformation in <italic>C. aponinum</italic>. This can be explained by the additional interactions between this loop and the chlorophylls it binds, together with the stacking interactions between the chlorophylls themselves. We have shown previously that chlorophyll binding loops can be transferred between different PSIs, and that the conformation of the loop remain essentially identical to the original structure even in the absence of adjacent subunits (Toporik, H. <italic>et al.</italic> The structure of a red-shifted photosystem I reveals a red site in the core antenna. <italic>Nat. Commun.</italic> (2020). doi:10.1038/s41467-020-18884-w). Further support for our assertion that the B40 loop adopts a similar configuration comes from the high sequence similarity of sequences juxtaposed to this loop, making the immediate environments between the two different PSI’s highly similar (see Figure 3 —figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C. aponinum is a high-light tolerant cyanobacterium, and it does not grow well under low light conditions as shown in Figure 1C. However, in this study, they culture the cells at low light (∼40 μE), which may lead to some changes of the photosynthetic complexes, therefore the structural features of PSI important for C. aponinum to survive in the high light environment cannot be identified.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to point out that <italic>C. aponinum</italic> grows fine under low light conditions. In the growth study in Figure 1 (and described in the methods and in the updated manuscript’s figure legend), <italic>C. aponinum</italic> was plated at an OD<sub>730</sub> of 3 and <italic>Synechocystis</italic> was plated at an OD<sub>730</sub> of 5, and both were diluted in ¼ steps. This was done to best depict the difference in viability between the two cyanobacteria in increasing light. While it would be ideal to grow the cyanobacteria at higher light, technical issues arise, mainly that proteins isolated from stressed cells are not ideal for structural analysis. We also prepared PSI from highlight grown cells and from low light grown cells and did not observe any differences in absorbance or protein content (SDS PAGE), we conclude that PSI itself does not change in response to highlight.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This reviewer understands that the difference of absorption spectra between PSI from C. aponinum and Synechocystis is very small, as only a few chlorophylls are changed. However, if they would like to use the spectral data, they need to prove that the differences of absorption spectra are indeed due to the different spectral property of PSI, but not the standard error. The spectra should be repeated at least three times for each PSI complexes and the differences of the repeated spectra should be shown in the paper.</p><p>It's better to determine the structure of the PSI complex from the constructed mutant to show the orientation of chlorophyll B40. If it is the same as that in C. aponinum PSI, this result will further strengthen their conclusion. If it is not, then chlorophyll B40 should be further investigated.</p><p>It will be more convincing if they purify and determine the structure of the PSI complex from C. aponinum cultured under high-light conditions.</p><p>Figure 4 please explain Blue6803 and Red_c.</p><p>Line 276, B39/B40 -&gt; B19/B40</p><p>Line 363, The orientation of the C-terminus -&gt; The orientation of the C-terminus of PsaL</p><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>The authors discuss the PSI/PSII ratio of the cells and relate it to the light stress experienced by the two organisms. There are two relevant points</p><p>1. The correlation between PSI/PSII ratio and light intensity is less straight forward than indicated in the manuscript. This ratio depends on the species and in plants does not change in different light conditions.</p><p>2. The authors estimate the PSI/PSII ratio using the relative intensity of the 680- and 720-nm peaks of the 77-K fluorescence spectra. This quantification is not reliable because it depends on the excited-state lifetimes of PSI and PSII complexes, which might be different in the two organisms. The PSI/PSII ratio should be determined biochemically (i.e. by looking at the protein content) and/or via physiological measurements (electrochromic shift, P700 oxidation rates, etc.). On the other hand, this information is not essential for this manuscript, since the discussion about changes in PSI/PSII ratio is not needed (see the previous point) and PSI is the main focus of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 4 correctly points out that PSI/PSII ratio is complex and adds that these values are a measure of the distribution of excitation energy between photosystems. The distribution of excitation energy between the photosystems is probably a more relevant parameter then the PSI/PSII protein ratio. We have changed the text to better reflect that the 77K measurements is a way to approximate the distribution of excitation energy between PSI and PSII. This demonstrates that under high light, <italic>C. aponinum</italic> directs more excitation energy to PSI, relative to PSII, and this is the opposite of what was reported for <italic>Synechocystis</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors noted – correctly – that the PSI of the high-light growing C. aponimum has a lower content of red Chls in comparison to PSI of Synechocystis. However, the correlation of the red Chl content to light stress conditions remains unclear, and the related discussion (page 21) is not very convincing. In general, the authors seem to favor the conclusion that red Chls are detrimental for PSI in high light, which would explain the reduced red Chl content of C. aponimum PSI. For instance, the authors hypothesize that C. aponimum PSI might carry less red Chls to reduce its trapping time and maximize photoprotection. This claim is not supported by data, since the authors do not measure the trapping time of the two PSI. Moreover, it is known from the analysis of other organisms that the differences in PSI trapping times with different red Chl content are typically small, and that the PSI of cyanobacteria always behaves as a very efficient trap (lifetime &lt; 50 ps) and is therefore well protected independent of the red Chl content. The other hypothesis regarding the IsiA ring (i.e. that the IsiA ring is mainly there to drag excitations away from the red Chls) is also not sound.</p></disp-quote><p>In the context of the PSI core antenna, we do not think there is a general all-inclusive idea explaining the physiological role of red chlorophylls. We favor the position that specific LWC (including groups of coupled chlorophylls) contribute to specific functions. A prerequisite for this approach is identifying and being able to manipulate LWC in vivo and in vitro and this work provides an important step towards this goal. We have included a new section in the discussion expanding on this point. We do think that specific red sites are important for interactions with antenna systems (PBS and IsiA) and this is clearly relevant to high light growth. At the same time, we can only propose a general mechanism to account for the contribution of PSI to high light growth in <italic>C. aponinum</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The last section in the results is not as strong as the rest of the work and could be removed/reduced. Indeed, the differences in amino acids (mostly aromatic) around Chls B7, A31, A32 do not seem enough to justify the presence/absence of a red Chl cluster. Indeed, red Chls in PSI are usually ascribed to charge-transfer states, which are expected to be influenced more by changes in surrounding charged/polar residues rather than aromatic ones. Also, the mentioned calcium ion seems to be too distant from the Chl cluster to really play an effect in this sense. Finally, the hypothesis of electron donation to a Chl by an aromatic amino acid having a large influence on the spectral properties (discussion, page 20) is not sound from a chemical perspective.</p></disp-quote><p>The inclusion of <italic>Red_d</italic>, which removes the ca<sup>2+</sup> ion in question, in this manuscript demonstrates its effect on LWC of <italic>Synechocystis</italic>.</p><p>With regards to the distribution of aromatic amino acids, we compared the environment of A31-B7 cluster between <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, <italic>C. aponinum</italic>, diatom, green algae, red algae, and plant PSI, the amino acids discussed are identical between <italic>c. aponinum</italic> and eukaryotic structures and different in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>. Together with the fact that the plant (and green algae) core PSI was shown to contain less LWC than the cyanobacterial PSI (<italic>Synechocystis</italic> and <italic>T. elongatus)</italic> this supports our suggestion that these changes affect LWC is reasonable (see new Figure 6 —figure supplements 2-4). Published structures show that the electrons on the tryptophan indole are 3.1 Å from the chlorophyll ring in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, which is closer than the ring-ring distance known to effect chlorophyll absorbance.
