While the role of adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) pro-inflammatory signalling in the development of insulin resistance has been established, it is less clear how WAT inflammation is initiated. Here, we show that ATMs isolated from obese mice and humans exhibit markers of increased rate of de novo phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis. Macrophage-specific knockout of phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase A (CCTα), the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo PC biosynthesis pathway, alleviated obesity-induced WAT inflammation and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, CCTα-deficient macrophages showed reduced ER stress and inflammation in response to palmitate. Surprisingly, this was not due to lower exogenous palmitate incorporation into cellular PCs. Instead, CCTα-null macrophages had lower membrane PC turnover, leading to elevated membrane polyunsaturated fatty acid levels that negated the pro-inflammatory effects of palmitate. Our results reveal a causal link between obesity-associated increase in de novo PC synthesis, accelerated PC turnover and pro-inflammatory activation of ATMs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47990.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Although inflammation can be good for the body and help fight off infection, in certain cases it can also be harmful. When immune cells switch on at the wrong time, they can cause damage to cells and tissues. Fat tissue has its own population of immune cells called adipose tissue macrophages that remove dead fat cells and keep the tissue working. However, obesity changes the behaviour of these macrophages so they switch on as though they were fighting an infection and make the fat tissue inflamed. The signals produced by these activated macrophages stop fat tissue working, and this can lead to type 2 diabetes.</p><p>The trigger that activates macrophages in obesity is not yet clear, but some evidence suggests that it is due to the type of fat available. Fats come in two main forms: saturated, which can lead to high cholesterol, or unsaturated which can reduce the risk of high blood pressure. An increase in saturated fats can cause cells, including macrophages, to become stressed.</p><p>Researchers showed in 2011 that macrophages in the fatty tissue of obese mice accumulate fat and become inflamed, but it was unclear which types of fat, if any, were driving the inflammation.</p><p>Now, Petkevicius et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the 2011 work – report that macrophages in the fatty tissue of obese mice make excess phosphatidylcholine, a fat normally found in the cell membrane. Phosphatidylcholine is a type of fat known as a phospholipid and it is made up of two subunits called fatty acids that can either be saturated or unsaturated. In obese people and mice, fatty tissue produces too much of the enzyme that makes phosphatidylcholine, called CCTa.</p><p>Petkevicius et al. showed that partially removing the CCTa gene from macrophages reduces inflammation, but, unexpectedly, the amount of phosphatidylcholine in the cells stays the same. This is because macrophages respond to the halt in phosphatidylcholine production by removing less of the phospholipid from the membrane. This gives the macrophages time to exchange the saturated fatty acids in phosphatidylcholine for unsaturated fatty acids. Therefore, the longer phosphatidylcholine stays in the membrane, the more likely it is to contain unsaturated fatty acids. Further experiments demonstrated that this change counteracts the effects caused by excess saturated fats, protecting the cells and reducing inflammation.</p><p>Although the understanding of obesity is still in its early stages, this study adds another piece of the puzzle. If we can understand why fat stops working in obesity, and how this leads to disease, it could aid the design of new treatments for type 2 diabetes.</p></abstract><kwd-group

metabolic disorders are among the most prevalent causes of death worldwide. Secondary complications of obesity have been suggested to be caused by the functional failure of white adipose tissue (WAT), leading to ectopic lipid deposition, lipotoxicity and systemic insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Virtue and Vidal-Puig, 2010</xref>). Obesity is associated with a chronic low-grade inflammation, characterised by immune cell infiltration to WAT, a switch of adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) polarisation from a tissue-remodelling (M2) to a pro-inflammatory (M1) state and elevated production of pro-inflammatory, insulin-desensitising cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα). Over the last decade, multiple genetic and pharmacological approaches have defined a causal role of macrophage-driven WAT inflammation in the development of insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hotamisligil, 2017</xref>). However, specific pathophysiological mechanisms triggering pro-inflammatory activation of ATMs during obesity are poorly understood.</p><p>Our previous work identified that the lipid composition of ATMs undergoes both quantitative and qualitative changes during obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Prieur et al., 2011</xref>). Qualitative changes in the lipid composition of both plasma and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes represent a major factor promoting insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Holzer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wei et al., 2016</xref>). Obesity-associated alterations in ER lipid composition lead to a cellular process termed ER stress, which invokes an adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hou et al., 2014</xref>). In macrophages, the UPR is coupled to the activation of intracellular inflammatory signalling pathways that cause WAT inflammation and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Robblee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Suzuki et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, M1 macrophages are characterised by increased endogenous fatty acid synthesis, which stabilises lipid rafts within plasma membrane to allow pro-inflammatory signal transduction in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wei et al., 2016</xref>). While phospholipids (PLs) are the main constituents of plasma and ER membranes, the importance of PL biosynthesis in ATMs during obesity has not yet been investigated.</p><p>The concept that macrophage ER stress could be induced during obesity due to changes in membrane composition is in line with the known physiological changes in lipid metabolism that occur during obesity. Obesity is associated with increased circulating saturated fatty acids (SFAs), which cause cellular ER stress by being incorporated into membrane PLs, leading to a decreased membrane fluidity due to increased membrane PL acyl chain saturation. Increased SFA-mediated ER rigidification is directly sensed by the transmembrane domains of UPR-transducing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Robblee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Volmer et al., 2013</xref>). ER saturation and the resulting UPR can be counteracted by both endogenously and exogenously derived mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs and PUFAs), and PUFA-containing phospholipids, in particular phosphatidylcholines (PCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gianfrancesco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Robblee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rong et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>PC is the most abundant PL in mammalian cells. Most cells can synthesise PC de novo through the Kennedy pathway, involving the transfer of phosphocholine onto diacylglycerol moiety. PCs synthesised de novo predominantly contain saturated (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), while polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are incorporated into PCs via the Lands cycle, involving a hydrolysis of a single fatty acyl chain and esterification of a free PUFA to a resulting lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shindou et al., 2013</xref>). Metabolic flux through the de novo PC synthesis pathway and cellular PC levels are greatly increased in differentiating macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ecker et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, pro-inflammatory signalling via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) increases the rate of choline uptake and de novo PC synthesis in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Snider et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tian et al., 2008</xref>). However, de novo PC synthesis in mature macrophages is not coupled to the expansion of the cellular PC pool, as it is counteracted by phospholipase D activity, leading to a rapid turnover of membrane PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jackowski et al., 1997</xref>). The consequences of altered PC turnover in metabolic disease are not currently known.</p><p>Conceptually, the rate of de novo PC synthesis and turnover should affect PC remodelling via Lands cycle. The role of the Lands cycle in ER stress function has been studied by genetic manipulation of the enzyme lysoPC-acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3), the major LPCAT isoform in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>). LPCAT3 overexpression increases the rate of PUFA incorporation into PCs and protects cells from palmitate-induced ER stress, while the loss of LPCAT3 sensitises cells to palmitate lipotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rong et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that during obesity, ATMs acquire an M1 phenotype concomitantly with their intracellular lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Prieur et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that markers of de novo PC synthesis are increased in ATMs isolated from obese mice and humans. <italic>Lep</italic><sup>ob/ob</sup> mice with a myeloid cell-specific reduction in de novo PC synthesis rate display reduced adipose tissue inflammation and improved metabolic profile compared to controls. Mechanistically, we show that reducing the activity of the de novo PC synthesis pathway by 30% does not reduce total cellular PC levels in macrophages. Instead, the reduction in PC synthesis is balanced by a reduction in PC degradation, maintaining the cellular PC pool size but increasing the half-life of PCs. The extended PC half-life leads to increased incorporation of PUFAs into PCs by allowing more time for PC remodelling. Elevated PC PUFA content protects macrophages from palmitate-induced ER stress and pro-inflammatory activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Obesity accelerates de novo PC biosynthesis in ATMs</title><p>In order to identify intrinsic metabolic pathways associated with the phenotypic switch of ATMs towards an M1 polarisation state, we reanalysed our published microarray dataset (GSE36669) of epididymal WAT (eWAT) macrophages isolated from WT and <italic>Lep</italic><sup>ob/ob</sup> animals using inferred metabolic flux analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cubuk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Çubuk et al., 2019</xref>).

Reducing de novo PC synthesis rate in ATMs alleviates obesity-induced WAT inflammation and improves systemic glucose metabolism. Mechanistically, we show that decreasing CCTα activity in macrophages does not reduce PC levels, but instead leads to a compensatory reduction in PC degradation and maintenance of normal PC levels. Because of this reduced PC turnover, more time is afforded for PC remodelling enzymes to act on PCs, leading to an increase in PUFA-containing PC species that are protective against ER stress in response to palmitate. Our results reveal a novel relationship between the regulation of de novo PC synthesis, PC turnover and membrane saturation.</p><p>Our study extends on existing findings regarding the importance of CCTα in mediating SFA-induced lipotoxicity in cultured macrophages. Two recent independent reports have suggested that de novo PC synthesis is responsible for exogenous palmitate incorporation into membrane PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gianfrancesco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Robblee et al., 2016</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Robblee et al. (2016)</xref> based their conclusions on data obtained from pharmacologically inhibiting CCTα using miltefosine at a dose of 100 μM, which inhibits de novo PC synthesis rate to a level that also leads to a reduction in exogenous palmitate incorporation, a result we reproduce here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, lower doses of miltefosine reduce de novo PC synthesis rate without affecting palmitate incorporation into cell membranes. At 25 μM mitefosine, we detect a 30% reduction in de novo PC synthesis rate with no reduction in palmitate incorporation, which phenocopies our genetic model of <italic>Pcyt1a</italic> deficiency in BMDMs. Importantly, our data show that a 30% reduction in de novo PC synthesis rate is sufficient to ameliorate ER stress, highlighting the capacity for changes in PC biosynthetic rate to regulate ER stress in a manner that does not require changes in palmitate incorporation. In this publication, we describe such a mechanism; that of reduced CCTα activity leading to increased PC half-life and thus permitting the establishment of a membrane composition that is protective against palmitate-induced ER stress. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gianfrancesco et al. (2019)</xref> have utilised siRNA-mediated <italic>PCYT1A</italic> knockdown in cultured human macrophages to achieve approximately 50% reduction in de novo PC synthesis rate and demonstrated that it reduces SFA-induced inflammation. Due to a lack of tracer experiment in their study, we believe that reduced IL-1b secretion in their <italic>PCYT1A</italic> knockdown model is due to increased membrane PUFA content, as our experimental findings demonstrate that at 50 μM mitefosine, we detect a 50% reduction in de novo PC synthesis rate with no significant reduction in palmitate incorporation.</p><p>Further support for a role of PC turnover in regulating ER stress comes from recent work investigating TLR4 signalling. It has recently been shown that palmitate is not a direct TLR4 agonist, but instead requires TLR4 activation-induced changes in intracellular metabolism in order to promote ER stress and inflammation in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lancaster et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, it has previously been demonstrated that TLR4 activation increases the rate of de novo PC synthesis and PC turnover in macrophages in order to provide a supply of new membranes for secretory vesicle formation in Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Snider et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tian et al., 2008</xref>). As such, our findings are in line with a mechanism in which basal TLR4 activation increases sensitivity of cells to palmitate by increasing PC turnover. In support of this concept, we demonstrate that decreasing de novo PC synthesis protects macrophages from palmitate-driven ER stress and inflammation. Furthermore, two recent reports have demonstrated that TLR4 activation in macrophages increases the transcription of <italic>Slc44a1</italic>, encoding choline transporter CTL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Snider et al., 2018</xref>).

While speculative, the absence of pro-inflammatory activation and normal de novo PC synthesis rate in liver macrophages could explain why hepatic genes related to metabolism and inflammation were comparable between CCTα-null <italic>Lep</italic><sup>ob/ob</sup> BMT and control mice.</p><p>The observed effect size of macrophage-specific <italic>Pcyt1a</italic> deletion on systemic insulin sensitivity on the <italic>Lep</italic><sup>ob/ob</sup> genetic background is relatively small.

In either case, our data demonstrates a link between the increase in de novo PC biosynthesis rate in ATMs and the development of adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance.</p><p>Finally, inactivating mutations in <italic>PCYT1A</italic> gene have been linked to several human pathologies, including retinal dystrophy, spondylometaphyseal dysplasia and lipodystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoover-Fong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Payne et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yamamoto et al., 2014</xref>).

Bone marrow cells were counted manually, pelleted by centrifugation, and re suspended in RPMI-1640 with 20–30% L929 conditioned medium, 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco, Thermofisher Scientific) and 100 U/ml penicillin- streptomycin (Thermofisher Scientific) (macrophage differentiation medium). To differentiate into macrophages, cells were seeded in 10 cm non-culture treated plates (Falcon) at a density of 5 × 106 cells per plate per 10 ml of macrophage differentiation medium and cultured for 7 days at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. On day 5 of differentiation, medium was removed, and 10 ml of fresh macrophage differentiation medium was added to each plate. On day 7 of differentiation, macrophages were detached using ice-cold PBS containing 1 mM EDTA, counted using Countess automated cell counter (Thermofisher), centrifuged at 500 g, room temperature for 5 min and re suspended in macrophage differentiation medium at the concentration of 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml. Immediately after, cells were plated for experiments at the following densities: 500 μl/well of 24-well plate, 1 ml/well of 12-well plate, 2 ml/well of 6-well plate and 10 ml per 10 cm plate. Cells were incubated for at least 24 hr after plating before conducting experiments.</p><p>To make L929 conditioned medium, L929 cells (CCL-1, ATCC) were seeded in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma) at a density of 500,000 cells per 50 ml of medium per T175 tissue culture flask. Medium was harvested after 1 week of culture, and then 50 mL of fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine was added onto cells and harvested 1 week later.

Intact vacuoles completely surrounded by F4/80-positive cells were considered as CLS, while whole section vacuole analysis was used to determine average adipocyte area. The analyses were performed on the whole section to avoid selection bias; tissue edges were excluded using manual annotation. Halo was ‘trained-by-example’ on randomly selected images, and then the analysis was extended on the whole batch of sections with HALO automated pipeline.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Lipid extraction</title><p>Total lipids from cells were extracted using a modified Folch extraction method. Glass pipettes were used throughout the procedure in order to avoid plastic-bound lipid contamination. 1 ml of HPCL-grade chloroform: methanol 2:1 v/v mixture was added to cell samples in a glass vial. Where applicable, appropriate amounts (calculated by approximating the average abundance of every fatty acid within the sample and adding matching amounts of standard) of 1,2-diundecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (phospholipid standard, 850330C, Sigma) were included in extraction mixture as internal standard. Samples were homogenised by vortexing for 15 s. 200 μl of HPLC-grade water was added to each sample before vortexing for 2 min and centrifuging at 4000 g for 10 min. 700 μl of the lower lipid fraction was transferred to a 7 ml glass tube. A second extraction was performed by adding 700 μl of fresh HPLC-grade chloroform followed by vortexing and centrifugation as above. 900 μl of lower lipid fraction was collected and pooled with the first 700 μl fraction (total 1600 μl).

Vials were sealed and incubated in an oven at 80°C for 90 min in order to hydrolyse fatty acid-glycerol and fatty acid-cholesterol ester bonds and form FAMEs. Samples were allowed to cool, and 1 ml of HPLC-grade n-Hexane and 500 μl of HPLC-grade water were added. Samples were briefly vortexed and centrifuged at 2000 g using benchtop centrifuge.

Dried FAME samples were re-suspended in 100 µl HPLC-grade n-Hexane. 1 µl of this solution was injected for analysis. The oven programme used for separation was as follows: 100°C hold for 2 min, ramp at 25 °C/min to 150°C, ramp at 2.5 °C/min to 162°C and hold for 3.8 min, ramp at 4.5 °C/min to 173°C and hold for 5 min, ramp at 5 °C/min to 210°C, ramp at 40 °C/min to 230°C and hold for 0.5 min. Carrier gas flow was set to constant 1.5 ml/min. If the height of any FAME peaks exceeded 10<sup>8</sup> units, sample was re-injected with 10:1 – 100:1 split ratio. Identification of FAME peaks was based on retention time and made by comparison with those in external standards (Food industry FAME mix, 35077, Restek).</p><p>Peak integration and quantification was performed using MassHunter Workstation Quantitative Analysis software (version B.07.00, Agilent). Specific high-abundance ions from total ion chromatogram were chosen to calculate each fatty acid peak.

This opens a new path for exploration of an important topic. The data provided substantiate this conclusion.</p><p>However, there is one issue that was raised that deserves your attention and some revision in the manuscript prior to acceptance. The effects shown on systemic metabolism are very small (Figure 2) in this ob/ob mouse model, raising the question of whether there is a major impact on insulin resistance.

In response to reviewers suggestion, we have produced p-AKT Western blots of gastrocnemius muscles and livers isolated from ob/ob mice carrying LysM-Cre Pcyt1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> and control bone marrow and included them in the revised manuscript (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). These new data show that loss of <italic>Pcyt1a</italic> in macrophages does not affect liver insulin AKT phosphorylation and, while it appears to have some effect on muscle insulin sensitivity, AKT phosphorylation is more variable than in WAT and does not reach statistical significance. These results are in good accordance with the GTT and ITT data.</p><p>We have also included additional discussion regarding the effect sizes in the revised manuscript, noting the relatively low penetrance of the <italic>Pcyt1a</italic> knockout in macrophages. Finally, we have linked the discussion between the specificity of the effects observed in our mouse model, in terms of <italic>Pcyt1a</italic> deletion having different effects on specific macrophage populations, to the phenotypes of <italic>PCYT1A</italic> human mutations, where despite it being expressed in almost every cell, loss of function <italic>PCYT1A</italic> mutations only impact certain tissues and organs. We proposed to study this topic further in future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
