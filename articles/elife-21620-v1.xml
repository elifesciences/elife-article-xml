How these lineages segregate from neural and epidermal fates has been a matter of debate. We address this by performing a fine-scale quantitative temporal analysis of transcription factor expression in the neural plate border of chick embryos. The results reveal significant overlap of transcription factors characteristic of multiple lineages in individual border cells from gastrula through neurula stages. Cell fate analysis using a Sox2 (neural) enhancer reveals that cells that are initially Sox2+ cells can contribute not only to neural tube but also to neural crest and epidermis. Moreover, modulating levels of Sox2 or Pax7 alters the apportionment of neural tube versus neural crest fates. Our results resolve a long-standing question and suggest that many individual border cells maintain ability to contribute to multiple ectodermal lineages until or beyond neural tube closure.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21620.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21620.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neural plate border</kwd><kwd>Pax7</kwd><kwd>Sox2</kwd><kwd>Six1</kwd><kwd>chicken</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Sox2</kwd><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD037105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roellig</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name><name><surname>Bronner</surname><given-names>Marianne E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIRM Bridges Training Grant #TB1-01176</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esaian</surname><given-names>Sevan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The vertebrate neural plate border is comprised of precursors that coexpress multiple lineage markers and small changes in their levels can bias border cell fate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Evolution of vertebrates is intimately linked to the advent of two embryonic cell types: neural crest and ectodermal placode cells. Both contribute to many of the defining characteristics of vertebrates, including a well-defined head with sensory organs and peripheral ganglia. Neural crest cells differentiate into sensory and autonomic ganglia, pigment cells and elements of the craniofacial skeleton, whereas ectodermal placodes give rise to the ear, nose, lens and sensory ganglia of the head.</p><p>In all chordate embryos, the ectoderm in the midline of the embryo, called the neural plate, subsequently folds or cavitates to form the neural tube, the future central nervous system (CNS). In vertebrates, neural crest and placode cells originate from a region of ectoderm at the juncture between neural and non-neural ectoderm, the ‘neural plate border’. Whereas basal chordate embryos possess a sharp demarcation between presumptive neural and epidermal fates at this border, much less in known about how cell fates as disparate as neural crest, placode and CNS cells become segregated at the neural plate border of vertebrate embryos.</p><p>The classical view, favored in many reviews and textbooks, is that the vertebrate neural plate border initially contains intermingled precursors of various fates that by neurula stages become subdivided into separate zones, with placodal precursors found more laterally and neural crest precursors more medially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Groves and LaBonne, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moody and LaMantia, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patthey and Gunhaga, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saint-Jeannet and Moody, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Streit, 2007</xref>). An alternative and equally possible scenario is that the neural plate border region maintains a random mixture of intermingled but fate-restricted precursors. Finally, it is possible that individual neural plate border cells initially are naïve and capable of giving rise to all ectodermal lineages.</p><p>In past decades, this question has been addressed by fate mapping studies in which small groups of neural plate border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schoenwolf and Sheard, 1990</xref>) or presumptive placodal precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Streit, 2002</xref>) were labeled using focal injections of the lipophilic dye DiI in gastrula stage chicken embryos. This results in DiI-labeled cells localized to multiple tissues (e.g. epidermis, neural tube, neural crest and placode). These studies confirmed that the neural plate border region contributes to a mixture of cell fates. However, DiI labeling typically labels small numbers (10-50) of cells, thus leaving open the question of whether the neural plate border contains multipotent and/or intermixed, fate restricted cells and their relative positions. While single cell lineage tracing has partially addressed this issue in the trunk neural crest just prior to their emigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baggiolini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bronner-Fraser and Fraser, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKinney et al., 2013</xref>), these studies did not examine early neural plate border stages or the relationship between different transcription factors in the border region.</p><p>Here, we characterize dynamic changes in neural plate border cells at high resolution and at the single cell level in the anterior neural plate border of the early chick embryo. To this end, we performed quantitative analysis of the transcription factors Sox2, Pax7, Msx1/2, Tfap2a and Six1 in neural plate border cells of chick embryos as a function of time. The results show that individual border cells have a high degree of overlap of multiple transcription factors at early gastrula stages. This overlap is maintained within the rising neural folds until the time of neural tube closure. Cell fate analysis further reveals that cells that initially express Sox2 contribute not only to the neural tube but also to neural crest and epidermis and that modulating transcription factor levels impacts the allocation of cells to neural versus neural crest lineages. Taken together, these results suggest that neural plate border cells have the ability to contribute to multiple ectodermal fates and that segregation of individual lineages does not occur until around the time of or after neural tube closure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcription factors associated with different fates are colocalized in the majority of neural plate border cells</title><p>In all vertebrate embryos, the neural plate border is the source of both neural crest and placodal precursors. The chick embryo develops as a disc-shaped embryo on top of the yolk such that the gastrula-stage embryo (stages 3–4 accordingly to the criteria of Hamburger and Hamilton, HH) is flat with the presumptive neural region surrounding the primitive streak. In cross section, the neural plate is a single layer of cells surrounding the midline of the embryo, with the neural plate border being relatively broad. Here, we define the neural plate border at mid- to late gastrula stages (HH4 to HH4+) by virtue of the expression of Sox2 throughout the neural plate and Tfap2a, which is expressed throughout the presumptive non-neural ectoderm at this stage. At subsequent stages, we use Pax7 to define the extent of the border, since it is one of the earliest markers of the neural plate border and becomes quickly restricted to this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khudyakov and Bronner-Fraser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Otto et al., 2006</xref>). With time, the neural plate border elevates to form the neural folds as the embryo undergoes neurulation until the time of neural tube closure at HH8+ in the cranial region. Neural crest emigration from the neural tube then commences at HH9.

For this purpose, we chose Sox2, Pax7, Msx1/2, Tfap2a and Six1. Sox2 has been used in many studies to define the neural plate territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Linker and Stern, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Streit et al., 1997</xref>).

Frequently, we observed individual cells simultaneously expressing markers reflective of neural plate, neural crest, placodal and/or epidermal character at multiple stages of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>We observe cells coexpressing Tfap2a and Sox2 as early as HH4+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and continuing through later stages, e.g. at HH8 and HH10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), at which time we also observe concomitant expression of Sox2, Pax7 and Tfap2a in individual neural plate border cells. Similarly, cells co-expressing Msx1/2 and Sox2 can be observed at HH6 to HH10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>). Co-expression of Msx1/2 with the placodal marker Six1 as well as Six1 plus Sox2 can be observed at HH8 in the dorsal neural folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). At HH10, however, coexpression of Sox2, Msx1/2 and Six1 is only observed in the ectoderm since Six1 is no longer expressed in the neural crest or dorsal neural tube by this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Interestingly, in addition to the neural plate territory, expression of Sox2 extends throughout the entire neural plate border region when compared with Msx1/2 and Pax7 at all time points examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–H</xref>). Nevertheless, we do also observe some cells that only express a single marker at a time at all stages, though this appears to be a minority population. Altogether, our single cell analysis indicates an extensive overlap in expression of various transcription factors in individual neural plate border cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Quantification of marker coexpression in single cells in the neural plate border</title><p>The above results reveal a large degree of overlap of transcription factors associated with diverse lineages in single neural plate border cells. To assess the degree of coexpression of these markers in a quantitative manner, we used Imaris software to quantify how many cells expressed one, two or three markers simultaneously independent of expression intensity. We considered the left and right side of embryos embryos independently and evaluated six neural plate borders (4–5 sections each) of four embryos at HH5, eight neural plate borders (4–7 sections each) of five embryos at HH6, 11 dorsal neural folds (4–6 sections each) of six embryos at HH8 and 7 dorsal neural tubes including delaminated neural crest and Pax7+ cells in epidermis (4–9 sections each) of four embryos at HH9. Based on their predominant marker expression and their antibody compatibility and quality, we evaluated three markers for this analysis: Sox2, Pax7 and Six1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To unambiguously demonstrate the specificity of the antibodies used, we transfected chicken fibroblast Df1 cells with constructs expressing fluorescently tagged Sox2 or its paralog Sox1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B and G</xref>). By immunostaining we find that Sox2 antibody does not recognize its paralog Sox1, even though the construct is transcribed as shown by RT-PCR. A similar experiment was performed for Pax7 and its paralog Pax3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D and H</xref>). The Pax7 antibody did not recognize its paralog Pax3. We also show that two different Sox2 antibodies (goat polyclonal Sox2 and rabbit monoclonal Sox2 antibodies) exhibit identical expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) and according to the manufacturer the rabbit monoclonal Sox2 antibody does not recognize Sox1 or Sox3.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21620.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Quantification of marker (co-) expression in single cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagrams of sections staged accordingly to those used in (<bold>B–E</bold>).

These numbers stay relatively constant over time. However, more than half of these cells (~44%) coexpress Sox2/Pax7 at HH5, which rises significantly to about 54% at HH6 and remains relatively constant until HH9 (~58%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). This suggests an extensive overlap of neural/neural crest precursors.</p><p>On the lateral side of the neural plate border, where Six1 is expressed predominantly, we also found cells that coexpress Six1 and Sox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>), as well as triple expression of Six1/Sox2/Pax7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref> arrowheads). Cells coexpressing Sox2/Six1, but not Pax7 ranged between 0–1%, and cells coexpressing Six1/Pax7 but not Sox2 between 1% (HH6) and 4% (HH9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D and F</xref>). However, cells coexpressing all three markers (Sox2, Pax7 and Six1) peaked at 7% at HH8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Similarly, we see a higher degree of coexpression of Sox2, Pax7 and Tfap2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). These data indicate a burst of triple marker coexpression between HH7 to HH8.</p><p>Although the majority of cells express multiple markers, we do observe neural plate border cells that express only a single marker at all stages. For example, 23–24% of the cells express Sox2 alone at HH5-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F’’</xref>). Although one might expect that this number would increase with time as an indication that cells are becoming progressively restricted, instead we find that this number significantly decreases to about 13–14% at HH8-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F’’</xref>). In the case of Pax7, 26% of the cells express Pax7 alone at HH5 and this significantly decreases to 18% and 12% at HH6 and HH8, respectively, before it slightly increases again at HH9% to 17% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G’’</xref>), possibly indicating the onset of neural crest migration. Six1 is expressed alone in about 1% and 3% of the cells at HH5/6 and HH8/9, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H’’</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, this quantitative analysis shows that roughly double the number of cells express two or more markers when compared to cells expressing only one of the three markers at a time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Moreover, the percentage of cells co-expressing different transcription factors increases over time while the number of cells expressing individual markers within the neural plate border diminishes, contrary to what would be expected if the developmental potential of cells was decreasing with time. The finding that multiple markers associated with different fates increases in individual cells over time suggests that neural plate border remains flexible with respect to cell fate choice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Spatial distribution of marker expression at the neural plate border</title><p>Next we evaluated the spatial distribution of these transcription factors to investigate regional restrictions of cells with different marker co-expression within the neural plate border domain as a function of time. To this end, we analyzed the overall tissue level expression of the transcription factors with Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) at stages HH5 (3–8 sections/embryo, n = 5 embryos), HH6 (six sections/embryo, n = 6 embryos) and HH8 (6–7 sections/embryo, n = 6 embryos). Since immunostaining reveals relative amounts of fluorescence, we normalized the expression levels of a given factor to a reference area to account for global differences in protein expression levels. Although markers are plotted in the same chart for better comparison of different stages, this is a measure of relative levels of each factor compared with its own reference rather than a comparison between factors. We used Pax7 expression to define the extent of the neural plate border (HH5-6) and later the dorsal neural folds (HH8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–F</xref>). We found that the neural plate border narrows over time, such that at HH5 Pax7 expression at the neural plate border is wider than at later stages of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>). Similarly, the intensity of Pax7 expression increases over time between HH5 to HH6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>). Within the dorsal neural fold, there is no significant increase of Pax7 expression between HH8 (5–9 sections/embryo, n = 7 embryos) and HH9 (3–6 sections/embryo, n = 5 embryos), but Pax7 expression increases significantly in the delaminating neural crest, which could indicate a time point of fate determination at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21620.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Spatial distribution of transcription factor expression at the neural plate border and dorsal neural fold/tube.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Images of Pax7 immunostaining (yellow) in representative embryos used to measure intensity profiles across the neural plate border at HH5 (<bold>A</bold>), HH6 (<bold>B</bold>) and the dorsal neural fold at HH8 (<bold>C</bold>).

At HH10 Sox2 expression is maintained in the dorsal neural tube even as neural crest cells begin to migrate away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

To address this, we sought to examine the subsequent fate of cells that initially express Sox2 at gastrula through neurula stages. For this purpose, we used the well characterized N1 and N2 Sox2 enhancers to drive reporter expression in a manner that recapitulates endogenous <italic>Sox2</italic> gene expression only in the neural plate and neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Uchikawa et al., 2003</xref>). To build a Sox2-reporter that marks the entire neural plate/tube, we combined the N1 and N2 Sox2 enhancers into a construct that drives H2B-eGFP. eGFP protein is highly stable and has a half-life of approximately 26 hr in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corish and Tyler-Smith, 1999</xref>); addition of a H2B nuclear localization signal has been reported to further stabilize the fluorescent label (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foudi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanda et al., 1998</xref>), making it an advantageous tool to trace cell fates.

Consistent with this, the N1N2-reporter is not detectable in migrating neural crest cells, whereas low levels of Sox2 protein expression remain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E’</xref>, arrowheads). This indicates that Sox2 protein expression in neural crest cells perdures from transcription and translation occurring prior to migration rather than being newly produced.</p><p>We next evaluated how <italic>Sox2</italic> mRNA expression corresponds to Sox2 protein expression in the neural plate border, neural tube and migratory neural crest by performing in situ hybridization (ISH) at different developmental stages. At HH7 and HH8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>) we observe strong <italic>Sox2</italic> mRNA in the neural plate border and dorsal neural folds and complete overlap with the Pax7 protein expression domain as detected by immunostaining after in situ hybridization. At HH9 <italic>Sox2</italic> mRNA expression in the dorsal neural tube is greatly reduced to almost undetectable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). This drop of Sox2 mRNA expression between HH8 and HH9 is consistent with the decline of Sox2 protein at that stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>) although it remains detectable. At HH13 we no longer see <italic>Sox2</italic> transcripts in the dorsal neural tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I’</xref>), whereas Sox2 protein is still present in that region likely due to protein stability after <italic>Sox2</italic> mRNA is degraded. <italic>Sox2</italic> mRNA expression is barely detectable in migrating neural crest as it can only be observed at very low levels in the rhombomere 4 stream (pre-otic level) where the neural crest population is very dense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I’’</xref>). ISH also reveals overlap of Pax7 and the neural plate border markers <italic>Msx1</italic> and <italic>Tfap2a</italic> at mRNA level. At HH6 we see <italic>Msx1</italic> mRNA expression nested within the Pax7 protein expression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>).

Similarly, Tfap2a mRNA expression overlaps with Pax7 protein expression in the dorsal neural fold at HH8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Manipulation of Sox2 and Pax7 levels affects the balance of neural crest versus neural tube cells</title><p>To investigate possible genetic interactions between Sox2 and Pax7, we performed gain- and loss-of-function experiments by electroporating one side of HH4 embryos with a Sox2 overexpression construct pCaggs-cSox2 (n = 40 embryos) with the uninjected side serving as internal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basch et al., 2006</xref>).

To this end, we electroporated one side of HH4 chicken embryos with a Sox2 translation-blocking morpholino (MO) and the other side with a control morpholino at a concentration of 0.5 mM. This resulted in a small but statistically significant decrease in Sox2 protein levels that in turn caused a statistically significant increase of Pax7 protein expression (5–11 sections/embryo, n = 9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>). Higher concentrations of Sox2 MO resulted in cell death in the neural tube and were not evaluated further. To control for the specificity of Sox2 MO and to demonstrate that the observed phenotype was not due to off-target binding, we co-electroporated the Sox2 MO with pCaggs-Sox2 (4–7 sections/embryo, n = 16 embryos). This resulted in marked rescue of the loss-of-function phenotype, restoring Pax7 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To further demonstrate morpholino specificity and efficacy, we show that the Sox2 MO causes knock-down of a construct with the Sox2 UTR sequence driving RFP expression but has no effect on an analogous construct with the Sox3 UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–D,H</xref>).</p><p>To investigate if a decrease in Sox2 expression leads to fate changes at later stages, we again electroporated HH4 embryos with control MO and Sox2 MO on left and right side, respectively, and performed ISH for the neural crest markers <italic>Sox10</italic> (n = 26 embryos) and <italic>FoxD3</italic> (n = 14 embryos). We see that in about half of the embryos <italic>Sox10</italic> and <italic>FoxD3</italic> mRNA expression levels are increased on the Sox2 MO electroporated side when compared to the control MO treated side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–K</xref>), suggesting a change in fate.</p><p>Next, we asked whether changes of Pax7 expression influenced Sox2 expression in the neural plate border. Similar to the experiment above, we overexpressed Pax7 using pCI-Pax7-IRES-H2B-RFP which resulted in a small, but significant decrease in Sox2 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>) when compared to the untreated control side of the embryo (3–6 sections/embryo, n = 8 embryos). However, when compared to control embryos electroporated with the empty vector pCI-H2B-RFP (3–6 sections/embryo, n = 7 embryos) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C and D</xref>), the difference was not statistically significant. We therefore turned to investigating whether we could detect Sox2 expression level changes on the single cell level. Using Fiji software, we measured the intensity of Sox2 and Pax7 expression in cells with very strong RFP expression in embryos that were injected with Pax7-H2B-RFP on the one side and H2B-RFP on the other side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). As expected, cells expressing high levels of RFP also express high levels of Pax7 on the Pax7-H2B-RFP treated side (total of 44 cells of 5 embryos, 2–6 sections evaluated per embryo) but not on the H2B-RFP control side (total of 35 cells of 5 embryos, 4–6 sections evaluated per embryo) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The Pax7-H2B-RFP treated side also had a statistically significant decrease of Sox2 protein expression in these cells when compared to the control side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).

This suggests that neural plate border cells can be biased to a different fate by relatively small changes in transcription factor levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Transition of a stem cell into a specialized state often involves several cell fate decisions. Transcriptional priming, or the expression of numerous mixed-lineage-affiliated programs, has been described extensively during stem cell fate determination in the hematopoietic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laslo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olsson et al., 2016</xref>). These mixed-lineage states are generally achieved by expression of alternative lineage determinants like transcription factors and have been proposed to be mandatory steps in cell fate specification. Additionally, single-cell analysis of primary chicken erythroid progenitors revealed a peak of high cell-to-cell variability in gene expression, that precedes an irreversible commitment to differentiation, before being strongly decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richard et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that a similar transcriptional priming appears to occur in the neural plate border, which contains precursors of neural, neural crest, placodal and epidermal cells. By performing an in depth and detailed analysis of differential transcription factor expression at single cell resolution, we have gained a fine-grained view of the signatures of markers indicative of diverse cell fates in this region. Although previous studies have examined gene expression at the neural plate border by in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khudyakov and Bronner-Fraser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Streit and Stern, 1999</xref>), the resolution was not sufficient to resolve whether there are characteristic subdomains of cells fated toward neural crest, ectodermal placode, neural or epidermal fates. Our results show that individual neural plate border cells have a high degree of overlap of multiple markers even at early gastrula stages. This overlap is maintained within the rising neural folds until the time of neural tube closure and in some migrating neural crest cells. This suggests that the neural plate border region is not comprised of separate zones containing prospective placodal, neural and neural crest, but rather contains a mixture of intermingled precursors which are not fate-restricted. Consistent with flexibility of cell fates, explant experiments have shown that intermediate neural plate tissue, normally fated to form CNS, can give rise to neural crest cells when exposed to BMP signaling in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liem et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, we speculate that initially naïve cells are open to many possible fates and retain the ability to contribute to multiple lineages ranging from neural crest, placodal, epidermal and central nervous system fates.</p><p>We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that some cells are fate restricted from early stages since a subpopulation was found that only expressed one marker at a time. For example, Pax7 alone was seen in 12–26% of neural plate border cells, Sox2 between 13–24% and Six1 from 1–3% of cells at any particular stage. Although this may indicate commitment to a particular lineage, it is equally possible that stochastic gene expression accounts for this variation in cell to cell protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McAdams and Arkin, 1997</xref>). It is interesting to note that the number of cells expressing single markers did not increase as a function of time, as might be expected with progressive commitment toward a particular fate, but rather dropped. Furthermore, single cells that concomitantly expressed multiple markers were much more prevalent than those expressing a single factor. Taken together, these results suggest that the majority of neural plate border cells are open to multiple fates.</p><p>Classical descriptions of the vertebrate neural plate border at neurula stages draw different domains within the border region, with placodal precursors populating a more lateral domain and neural crest precursors a more medial domain. Consistent with this view, we see Six1 expression primarily in the lateral portions of the neural plate border and Pax7 expression biased toward the medial regions. However, no sharp demarcations exist between precursor populations and we noted extensive intermixing such that even cells expressing a single marker were adjacent to border cells expressing multiple markers. These results are consistent with explant studies performed in mouse embryos. Explants of the prospective neural plate border at a late blastula stage (HH2) were found to express neural, neural crest, epidermal and to a small extent placode markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Patthey et al., 2009</xref>). In agreement with these findings, we conclude that the idea of distinct precursor subdomains within the vertebrate neural plate border cannot be substantiated.</p><p>In contrast to the chick neural plate border region, neural and epidermal fates in basal invertebrate chordates such as amphioxus are separated by a sharp border. Even urochordates have an invariant cell lineage such that the fate of neural versus epidermal precursors is fixed prior to the gastrula stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conklin, 1905</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lemaire, 2009</xref>). However, recent evidence has shown that the caudal neural plate border of <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> contains a precursor to bipolar tail neuron (BTNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stolfi et al., 2015</xref>) that delaminates and migrates along the paraxial mesoderm on either side of the neural tube. These cells share some properties as well as some molecular markers with vertebrate neural crest cells, including co-expression of neural plate border and neural crest markers like <italic>Msx</italic> and <italic>Snail</italic>. Thus, an intriguing possibility is that advent of neural crest and placode cells in the vertebrate lineage resulted in the superposition of a multifated neural plate border region onto a sharp neural/epidermal border in the chordate ancestor and that urochordates may already possess an ‘intermediate’ neural plate border with partial overlap of marker expression.</p><p>To examine the fate of cells that initially express Sox2 in the chick neural plate border, we took advantage of a Sox2-reporter that drives stabilized eGFP expression, enabling long term analysis of the fate of Sox2-positive cells that were electroporated at different times. Although enhancer-mediated expression is turned off as neural crest cells emigrate, the results show that cells initially expressing Sox2 can contribute not only to the central nervous system but also to the neural crest and non-neural ectoderm. This was true for electroporations performed from gastrula stages to the time of neural tube closure. This suggests that Sox2 is present and translated in neural crest precursors until the time they initiate detachment from the dorsal neural tube. These results favor the idea that many individual border cells maintain the ability to contribute to multiple ectodermal fates until the time of neural tube closure. Accordingly, previous single cell lineage analyses in chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bronner-Fraser and Fraser, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKinney et al., 2013</xref>) and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baggiolini et al., 2015</xref>) trunk have shown that individual dorsal neural tube cells are multipotent and able to contribute to both neural crest and dorsal neural tube.</p><p>Consistent with these lineage studies, our data suggest that the majority of neural plate border cells in vertebrate embryos are open to numerous prospective fates. We further suggest that small changes in transcription factor levels can bias cells toward a particular lineage. For example, we find that subtle modulations of either Sox2 or Pax7 levels can shift the balance of neural versus neural crest cells. This is similar to the well-known Drosophila gap gene scenario where mutually repressive transcription factors regulate each other’s relative expression, leading to sharp segmental borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jäckle et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaeger, 2011</xref>). During patterning of the vertebrate neural tube, a transcriptional network of three transcription factors (Pax6, Olig2 and Nkx2.2) defines the final positions of the boundaries of distinct ventral progenitor domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briscoe et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ericson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Novitch et al., 2001</xref>). It was proposed that this three transcription factor circuit encodes a multistable switch that results in stabilizing neural tube patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balaskas et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, we propose that the mutual repression of Sox2 and Pax7 can lead to a bistable switch with three solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>): an unstable state occurs when the concentration of two cross-repressing factors is similar. However, increasing the concentration of one transcription factor causes a switch from unstable to a stable state where the other one is repressed. According to this model, increase of Sox2 expression above a certain threshold represses expression of Pax7 that in turn leads to neural fate. In the reciprocal situation, high levels of Pax7 induce reduction of Sox2 in the dorsal neural fold and lead to a neural crest fate. In Xenopus a similar model has been proposed for protein cross-regulation during cranial ganglion neurogenesis. This work shows that high levels of the placodal genes Eya1 and Six1 promote proliferation of placodal neuronal progenitor by modulating SoxB1 expression, while lower levels promote neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schlosser et al., 2008</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21620.030</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of fate decisions in the dorsal neural folds.</title><p>We propose that, within the neural folds, mutual repression can lead to a bistable switch with three possible solutions: an unstable state occurs when the concentration of two cross-repressing factors is similar.

When Pax7 concentration increases to a certain level, it causes reduction of Sox2 and induction of neural crest fate.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21620.030">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21620.030</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21620-fig8-v1"/></fig></p><p>There are other examples suggesting that levels of transcription factors can affect cell fate at the neural plate border. For instance, Dlx proteins have been shown to shift the position of the zebrafish neural plate border causing changes of cell fates in that region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Woda et al., 2003</xref>). By inhibiting or ectopically activating endogenous Dlx protein, these authors observed an expansion of the neural plate into the non-neural ectoderm or reduction of neural differentiation, respectively. Similarly, altering BMP levels in frog and chick embryos shifts the position of the neural plate border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marchant et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Streit and Stern, 1999</xref>). Overexpression of Sox2 in the neural folds causes down-regulation of neural crest specifier genes <italic>FoxD3, Snail2</italic> and <italic>Sox10</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wakamatsu et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the neural plate border region appears to be highly regulative in ability to respond to transcriptional modifications.</p><p>In summary, our data show that the neural plate border contains precursors which have mixed identity until at least the time of neural tube closure. These findings have implications for several fields of biology as correct timing of cell fate decisions and differentiation is not only important for proper embryonic development, but also for stem cell biology, regenerative medicine and cancer cell biology, where new protocols are needed for cell specification and to understand why cells dedifferentiate to return to a progenitor state.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electroporation</title><p>Fertilized chicken eggs were incubated at 37°C to the desired stages.

The study reports on the time course of expression of various transcription factors in the neural border zone during the developmental window when neural plate, neural crest and placode fates should be segregating. The work takes full advantage of available reagents and methods to interrogate the dynamics of key fate determining transcription factors in the development of neural crest cells. By using immunofluorescent detection, the authors uncovered that the majority of cells in the neural border zone (which ultimately assumes neural plate, neural crest and placode fates) express more than one TF indicating that cell fate may remain plastic for longer periods of time than previously anticipated. The findings that cells in the border zone are expressing several TFs simultaneously are novel, and they lead to the important conclusion that these cells are multipotent for longer in development than anticipated from prior studies based on mRNA expression domains (ISH). These findings present important new data for the fields of neural crest and placode development, and have broader implications for all areas, particularly stem cell biology, in which understanding the progression of cell fate restrictions is important.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Multipotency is a functional definition: to be proven multipotent, a cell has to be shown to give rise to 2 or more different cell types (e.g., single cell lineage tracing, single cell cloning). Early co-expression of two proteins, which happen to be retained later in distinct cell types, is not sufficient to prove multipotency. At most, these variations reflect interesting different regulatory states within a tissue, although potential oscillations in protein content cannot be visualized. The outcome of these diverse regulatory states in terms of cell fate choice remains to be identified. Thus, many conclusions in the manuscript are, unfortunately, over-interpretations and need to be qualified (e.g. at the end of the subsection “Quantification of marker coexpression in single cells in the neural plate border”).</p><p>2) Thus far, there is no early (i.e. gastrula stage) specific marker for cell fates arising from the neural plate border. Hence the choice of markers used here is an issue, as there is no marker &quot;predictive of different fates&quot; (subsection “Markers associated with different fates are colocalized in the majority of neural plate border cells”, second paragraph). In chick, Sox2 is expressed in the whole epiblast initially then restricts to the neural plate (Streit et al., 1997). During neurulation, not all neural tube cells maintain Sox2 expression (this study, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>); finally, Sox2 is activated in the placodes by Six1 (Riddiford et al., 2016). Sox2 is thus not a &quot;definitive neural marker&quot; (see aforementioned paragraph), as the authors themselves show in later sections of the manuscript, <italic>Sox2</italic> expression varies according to the stage considered, and many neural crest cell progenitors have expressed Sox2.</p><p>Similarly, Pax7 cannot be used as a bona fide neural crest progenitor marker as in many instances in this study (e.g. Introduction, last paragraph; subsection “Quantification of marker coexpression in single cells in the neural plate border”, end of first paragraph), since it is expressed in the dorsal neural tube.</p><p>Finally, AP2 is expressed in the early neural plate border (Luo et al., 2003; de Croze et al., 2011), in the premigratory and migrating neural crest, and in the non-neural ectoderm: it cannot be used to specifically identify the non-neural epidermis (Introduction, last paragraph) or the late neural crest (subsection “Quantification of marker coexpression in single cells in the neural plate border”, second paragraph). Thus, the choice of markers is not suitable to support the conclusions of this analysis. Rather, there are interesting and important information on the relative expression levels of these proteins.</p><p>3) It is not clear how many embryos were used for some of the key experiments, and equally important how many sections within each embryo were subjected to the analyses reported here. Although numbers are to be found in some of the figure legends, a more explicit identification of these numbers in the main text of the relevant sections of the manuscript would be welcomed.</p><p>4) Because of their central importance to support the claims put forward by the authors in this manuscript, it seems appropriate to unambiguously demonstrate the specificity of the antibodies used. In addition, experiments/controls that gauge the affinities of the different antibodies used for quantification should be shown so as to establish whether the resulting quantification data is or is not based by different affinities of the antibodies for their respective epitopes.</p><p>5) There is some controversy in the developmental biology field as to the specificity and efficacy of morpholino-based knock-down. Thus, it is important that researchers using these reagents present as much information as possible so their results are not dismissed by skeptics in the field. Some suggestions include: showing by Western blot that the Sox2 and Pax7 MOs significantly decrease protein expression perhaps in a cell line in which the increased amount of MO would not be lethal as it is in the embryo; showing that the MOs will not bind to closely related family members, i.e., simply do a sequence comparison; rewording the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to state what percent KD is achieved. Yes, the bar graphs show those data, but the text could be misconstrued. For example, on first read I misinterpreted the figure legend to state that Pax7MOs achieved 81% knock-down. I think it would be beneficial to make the language a little clearer.</p><p>6) It has been well described in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gap gene literature that mutually repressive TFs are expressed in the same cells and regulation of their relative levels eventually leads to sharp segmental boundaries. I see a lot of similarities between that work and what is presented in this manuscript, particularly since Sox2 and Pax7 seem to repress each other. Therefore, reference to this mechanism is appropriate.</p><p>7) The number of embryos is rather on the low side; for analytic power in mouse embryos we use 5 embryos per experimental group/genotype as the rule of thumb. Since chick embryos are more readily available, the conclusions would be more convincing if the power were increased by larger sample sizes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21620.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Multipotency is a functional definition: to be proven multipotent, a cell has to be shown to give rise to 2 or more different cell types (e.g., single cell lineage tracing, single cell cloning).

For the purpose of telling a story, we were essentially setting up a “straw man” that we then disproved since our results clearly show that the majority of neural plate border cells express multiple transcription factors. Obviously, we were not sufficiently careful with our wording for which we apologize. We have now attempted to correct this and appreciate the reviewer bringing this to our attention.</p><p><italic>3) It is not clear how many embryos were used for some of the key experiments, and equally important how many sections within each embryo were subjected to the analyses reported here. Although numbers are to be found in some of the figure legends, a more explicit identification of these numbers in the main text of the relevant sections of the manuscript would be welcomed.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for bringing this omission to our attention. We have now carefully gone through the manuscript to include numbers of embryos, sections examined, etc., and have included more complete methods describing the analysis.</p><p><italic>4) Because of their central importance to support the claims put forward by the authors in this manuscript, it seems appropriate to unambiguously demonstrate the specificity of the antibodies used. In addition, experiments/controls that gauge the affinities of the different antibodies used for quantification should be shown so as to establish whether the resulting quantification data is or is not based by different affinities of the antibodies for their respective epitopes.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for not providing this information previously. We have used two different Sox2 antibodies, both of which exhibit identical expression patterns and according to the manufacturer the monoclonal rabbit anti-Sox2 antibody does not recognize Sox1 or Sox3 (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). To address this point, we now show that the Pax7 antibody does not recognize its paralog Pax3 and that the Sox2 antibody does not recognize its paralog Sox1. This is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>Importantly, we clarify that we are quantifying relative levels of Sox2 to Sox2 at different stages and relative levels of Pax7 to Pax7 at different stages, but not comparing Pax7 protein levels to Sox2 protein levels. Thus, the affinity of the antibody to the protein to which it binds is not relevant in this case. We also now state in the text that although markers are plotted in the same chart for better comparison of different stages, this is a measure of relative levels of each factor compared with its own reference rather than a comparison between factors.</p><p><italic>5) There is some controversy in the developmental biology field as to the specificity and efficacy of morpholino-based knock-down. Thus, it is important that researchers using these reagents present as much information as possible so their results are not dismissed by skeptics in the field. Some suggestions include: showing by Western blot that the Sox2 and pax7 MOs significantly decrease protein expression perhaps in a cell line in which the increased amount of MO would not be lethal as it is in the embryo; showing that the MOs will not bind to closely related family members, i.e., simply do a sequence comparison; rewording the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to state what percent KD is achieved. Yes, the bar graphs show those data, but the text could be misconstrued. For example, on first read I misinterpreted the figure legend to state that Pax7MOs achieved 81% knock-down. I think it would be beneficial to make the language a little clearer.</italic> </p><p>To address this point, we now clarify in the methods section that the UTR sequences of Sox1, Sox2 and Sox3 and very different, as are the sequences of Pax3 and Pax7. To further demonstrate specificity and efficacy, we have added additional controls for the morpholinos, now shown in a new supplementary figure. Specifically, we show that the Sox2 MO causes knock-down of a construct with the Sox2 UTR sequence driving RFP expression but has no effect on an analogous construct with the Sox3 UTR. Similarly, a Pax7 MO affects expression driven by Pax7 UTR but has little effect on a Pax3 UTR. Moreover, the Pax7 morpholino has been previously used and validated (Basch et al., 2006; Simoes-Costa et al., 2012). We have rewritten the results to be more clear and thank the reviewers for pointing out the lack of clarity.</p><p>Importantly, while doing these experiments, we noticed sequence polymorphism in the Pax7 UTR with an extra “C” within the morpholino recognition site. Therefore, we tested the knock-down ability of both the published UTR sequence and the one with the extra C. In both cases, we observed knock-down though the former was more robust.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the confusing language when describing results of the knock-downs and we have now reworded the text and figure legends to be more clear, as well as included data from these additional important controls.</p><p><italic>6) It has been well described in the Drosophila gap gene literature that mutually repressive TFs are expressed in the same cells and regulation of their relative levels eventually leads to sharp segmental boundaries. I see a lot of similarities between that work and what is presented in this manuscript, particularly since Sox2 and Pax7 seem to repress each other. Therefore, reference to this mechanism is appropriate.</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent suggestion and we have now incorporated reference to this type of mutual repression in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>7) The number of embryos is rather on the low side; for analytic power in mouse embryos we use 5 embryos per experimental group/genotype as the rule of thumb. Since chick embryos are more readily available, the conclusions would be more convincing if the power were increased by larger sample sizes.</italic> </p><p>We have now indicated numbers of embryos and have increased the sample size.</p></body></sub-article></article>
