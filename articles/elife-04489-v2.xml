Previous studies have indicated that kinesin-14 motors are non-processive enzymes, working in the context of multi-motor ensembles that collectively organize microtubule networks. In this study, we show that the yeast kinesin-14 Kar3 generates processive movement as a heterodimer with the non-motor proteins Cik1 or Vik1. By analyzing the single-molecule properties of engineered motors, we demonstrate that the non-catalytic domain has a key role in the motility mechanism by acting as a ‘foothold’ that allows Kar3 to bias translocation towards the minus end. This mechanism rivals the speed and run length of conventional motors, can support transport of the Ndc80 complex in vitro and is critical for Kar3 function in vivo. Our findings provide an example for a non-conventional translocation mechanism and can explain how Kar3 substitutes for key functions of Dynein in the yeast nucleus.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04489.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04489.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04489.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Molecules can be transported around a cell by so-called motor proteins that move along a network of filaments called microtubules. Many motor proteins—including the kinesin family of these proteins—can only move in one direction along a microtubule. In most cells, kinesins tend to transport other molecules away from the center and towards the cell edge.</p><p>Kinesins can have different structures, but most are made up of two subunits that are joined and work together to create a walking-like movement. Each subunit has a region called a motor domain (also known as its ‘head’) that can bind to the microtubule and to a molecule called ATP, which provides the energy required for the motor to step forward.</p><p>Kinesins can be classed either as processive or non-processive motors. Processive motors can walk continuously along a microtubule for several hundred steps, whereas non-processive motors fall off after just a few steps. A motor protein called Kar3 belongs to a group of non-processive kinesins. Kar3 is unusual; unlike most of the motors in this group (which work together in pairs), Kar3 motor protein subunits each bind to and work with non-motor protein subunits, including one called Cik1. The head of the non-motor protein cannot bind to ATP, although it can bind to microtubules. This means that the non-motor protein subunits are not provided with the energy to make a stepping motion; this raises questions about how the Kar3 motor protein moves along the microtubule, and whether this affects the roles the motor performs.</p><p>Mieck et al. studied how a molecular motor made up of Kar3 and Cik1 moves along microtubules using sensitive microscopy that allows single molecules to be observed. This revealed that, contrary to what is expected from a non-processive motor, Kar3–Cik1 moves long distances on microtubules without detaching from them. Further investigation showed that Cik1 provides a ‘foothold’ for the motor, binding it to the microtubule in such a way that allows it to move along the microtubule in the opposite direction to most kinesins. In addition, Mieck et al. found that the Kar3–Cik1 motor binds to and transports a protein complex that is crucial for separating chromosomes during cell division.</p><p>A challenge for the future is to understand in even greater detail how the movement of such a motor occurs. If it doesn't ‘walk’ like other motors, then how can its motion be explained? The benefits for the cell that underlie why this mechanism evolved also remain to be discovered.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04489.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04489.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>kinesins</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP2/2007-2013/no.203499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Westermann</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund (FWF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB F34-B03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Westermann</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001821</institution-id><institution>Wiener Wissenschafts-, Forschungs- und Technologiefonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VRG10-11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vaziri</surname><given-names>Alipasha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGP004½012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vaziri</surname><given-names>Alipasha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The kinesin-14 motor Kar3 moves along microtubules using a previously undescribed mechanism that critically requires the presence of a non-catalytic head.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Motors of the kinesin family are ubiquitous enzymes essential for intracellular transport along microtubules in eukaryotes. The mechanism by which kinesin motor proteins convert the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis into coordinated, long-range directional movement has fascinated cell biologists, biochemists, and engineers for many decades. Biophysical studies of kinesins have focused on conventional Kinesin-1 and established the ‘hand-over-hand’ model for the processive walking behavior of this type of motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asbury et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yildiz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaseda et al., 2003</xref>). In analogy to other enzymes, the term ‘processivity’ describes the ability of individual motor molecules to undergo multiple catalytic cycles—and therefore translocate—before releasing from the microtubule.</p><p>Kinesin-14 family members, exemplified by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ncd motor, are common examples for nonprocessive kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Case et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foster and Gilbert, 2000</xref>). They generate motility through the minus-end-directed rotational movement of a coiled-coil mechanical element that occurs upon ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Endres et al., 2006</xref>). After each catalytic cycle, Ncd motors release from the microtubule lattice, meaning that to support microtubule sliding and crosslinking in the spindle, many Ncd motors must work together cooperatively in an ensemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fink et al., 2009</xref>). Budding yeast kinesin-14 Kar3 is distinct from other family members in its heterodimeric composition with either Cik1 or Vik1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manning et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). High-resolution structural analysis has shown that these accessory proteins contain a motor homology domain that harbors a microtubule binding site but lacks the structural elements required to bind and hydrolyze ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allingham et al., 2007</xref>). Biochemical experiments have indicated that Cik1 and Vik1 modulate the interaction of Kar3 with microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allingham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rank et al., 2012</xref>). In vivo Kar3's heterodimeric composition governs its subcellular localization and function: Kar3 in complex with Vik1 crosslinks parallel microtubules in proximity to spindle pole bodies during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manning et al., 1999</xref>), whereas antiparallel microtubule sliding is powered by Cik1–Kar3 complexes that associate with the microtubule lattice and plus-ends during mitotic and meiotic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maddox et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gardner et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, Kar3 has been implicated in kinetochore capture and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Middleton and Carbon, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2007</xref>). The unusual composition of the Kar3 motor with the combination of a catalytic and a non-catalytic domain, as well as its key roles for diverse cellular processes in yeast, has made it a particularly interesting object of study both from a biophysical and cell biological point of view. The understanding of the mechanistic basis of Kar3 function, however, has remained incomplete, as biochemical experiments have been limited to ensemble assays using truncated or artificially dimerized proteins. On the basis of such experiments and the interpretation of in vivo phenotypes, it has been proposed that Cik1–Kar3 acts as a microtubule depolymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sproul et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allingham et al., 2007</xref>). We hypothesized that the presence of a non-catalytic domain may allow functionalities fundamentally different from conventional kinesin-14 homodimers. As the activity of individual full-length Kar3 motors had not been observed directly, we developed assays to investigate motors at the single molecule level and analyze the contribution of the non-catalytic domain.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04489.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Purification and characterization of Cik1–Kar3 kinesin motors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of conventional Kinesin-1 in comparison to the kinesin-14 Cik1–Kar3.

Purification and labeling yielded a homogenous preparation containing a heterodimer of Cik1 and TMR-labeled Kar3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). During size exclusion chromatography, Cik1–Kar3 motors eluted as a single major peak with a Stokes radius of ∼9.1 nm, well separated from the void volume of the column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Sucrose-gradient centrifugation revealed the presence of a single major species with an apparent sedimentation coefficient of ∼5.6S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Combining these hydrodynamic values yielded a native molecular weight of 214 kDa, close to the calculated molecular weight of a Halo-tagged Cik1–Kar3 heterodimer of 190 kDa. We further characterized the oligomeric state of full-length Cik1–Kar3 motors by performing low-angle Pt/C rotary shadowing electron microscopy on peak fractions from the gel filtration experiments. This analysis revealed individual well-defined, highly elongated molecules that were characterized by globular domains separated by a 61 ± 8 nm (mean ± SD, n = 100) long coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Typically, two closely spaced globular domains likely corresponding to catalytic and non-catalytic head domains were discernible at one end, while a single globular domain decorated the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The highly elongated shape of the Cik1–Kar3 molecules can explain their early elution from the gel filtration column. Overall, the hydrodynamic analysis and the direct visualization of motor molecules by EM support the presence of heterodimeric Cik1–Kar3 molecules.</p><p>We next observed the behavior of single motor molecules on surface-immobilized microtubules in vitro using time-lapse multi-color TIRF microscopy. Unexpectedly, and contrary to the classification of kinesin-14s as non-processive motors, Kar3 molecules displayed efficient ATP-dependent movement over several micrometers and accumulated at microtubule minus ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Automated tracking of motors revealed a Gaussian velocity distribution of Cik1–Kar3 with a mean speed of 77 ± 23 nm/s (mean ± SD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) in range with reported microtubule gliding velocities for truncated Cik1–Kar3 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allingham et al., 2007</xref>). The motor is therefore approximately 10-fold slower than conventional Kinesin-1, but similar in speed to yeast cytoplasmic Dynein, the major minus-end directed-motor in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>). The run-length histogram followed an exponential distribution and revealed that individual Cik1–Kar3 motors advanced processively for an average of 5.2 μm before detaching from the microtubule track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The motile parameters were highly sensitive to the ionic strength of the imaging buffer: at the same ATP concentration higher salt concentration increased the mean squared displacement of the motors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), but decreased the on-rate, run length and minus-end dwell time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We additionally noticed that Cik1–Kar3 oscillated back-and-forth when entering microtubule overlap zones. Because Cik1–Kar3 is exclusively moving towards the minus-end on single MT filaments, we concluded that reversing motors encountered an antiparallel-oriented MT bundle. Individual motors were able to switch the track microtubule multiple times leading to a prolonged association with antiparallel bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04489.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cik1–Kar3 motors move processively with a single catalytic domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Kymograph showing two-color time lapse TIRF microscopy of Cik1–Kar3 (red) moving along taxol-stabilized microtubules (blue).

Photobleaching experiments in the absence of nucleotide, in which the motor is persistently bound to the microtubule, revealed that 43 out of 50 molecules lost fluorescence in a single step consistent with the presence of a single Cik1–Kar3 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).

To discriminate between processive and non-processive motility modes by an alternative approach, we varied the motor concentration in a standard microtubule gliding assay. Titration of Cik1–Kar3 over a 50-fold concentration range revealed no decrease in velocity for microtubule gliding, a characteristic feature of processive motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hancock and Howard, 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Contrary to previous reports, we did not observe substantial depolymerization of taxol-stabilized microtubules in the presence of Cik1–Kar3.

We found that Cik1–Kar3 velocity was largely independent of motor team size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H,I</xref>). The run length, however, increased with larger team size while the variance of the velocity decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2J</xref>). These motile behaviors of Cik1–Kar3 complexes of different sizes can be quantitatively explained by a biophysical model in which individual motors influence each other through mechanical coupling with spring-like properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Importantly, a key feature of the biophysical model is the ability of an individual Cik1–Kar3 heterodimer to move processively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mutations in the non-catalytic head domain abolish directional movement</title><p>We next sought to establish the molecular requirements for Kar3 motility: processive movement could be a property intrinsic to the head domains or require secondary microtubule interaction sites in the motor tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gudimchuk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Su et al., 2013</xref>). To distinguish between these possibilities, truncation constructs were designed, systematically eliminating parts of the tail, coiled-coil, or globular domains of either the motor or the partner protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Truncation of the amino-terminal tail domain, either in Kar3 (up to aa 174) or in Cik1 (up to aa 250) allowed robust processive movement in the single molecule assay and also had little effect on multi-motor gliding velocity. This distinguishes Cik1–Kar3 from the homodimeric <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinesin-14, Ncd, which has been shown to be capable of a weakly processive motion at very low ionic strength depending on its tail region that acts as an electrostatic tether to microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furuta and Toyoshima, 2008</xref>). Further truncations of the coiled-coil interfered with heterodimer formation (not shown). In contrast, carboxyterminal truncations that either completely eliminated the predicted globular Cik1 motor homology domain (Cik1<sup>1–360</sup>) or removed a portion of the carboxyterminus (Cik1<sup>1–521</sup>) had severe effects and prevented directional movement. The specific nature of the defect was most apparent for the shorter truncation Cik1<sup>1–521</sup>–Kar3, which was able to bind microtubules under our standard conditions, but instead of smooth translocation it displayed erratic forward and backward displacements that did not lead to directional movement as revealed by kymographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video4 video5">Videos 4 and 5</xref>). The defect imposed by the Cik1<sup>1–521</sup> mutation was also readily apparent in multi-motor gliding assays, where microtubules frequently switched their direction of movement and displayed little net transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The pronounced defect of the Cik1<sup>1–521</sup> mutant points to an essential role for the non-catalytic head in the motility mechanism. To corroborate this point, we also co-overexpressed Flag-tagged Kar3 with Kar3-Halo and purified fluorescently labeled Kar3 homodimers that can form in the absence of Cik1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2005</xref>). We failed to observe processive movement of Kar3-Kar3 combining two catalytic domains or of Kar3-Kar3<sup>rigor</sup> complexes combining catalytically active and inactive Kar3 heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These results point to a specific role of the non-catalytic Cik1 head that cannot be simply replaced by a second catalytically active or inactive Kar3 head.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04489.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Molecular requirements for processivity and identification of a translocation-deficient Cik1 mutant.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing analyzed Cik1 and Kar3 truncation constructs with the corresponding results from TIRF assays and multi-motor gliding assays.

To gain insights into this question, we quantitatively compared the microtubule-binding properties of single wild-type Cik1–Kar3 molecules with a mutant that lacks the globular Cik1 motor homology domain (Cik1<sup>1–360</sup>–Kar3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast to wild-type motors, the Cik1<sup>1–360</sup>–Kar3 mutant displayed short-lived diffusive interactions with microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). MSD data obtained in ATP for wild-type and mutant were fitted to the equation &lt;x<sup>2</sup>&gt; = a·t<sup>n</sup>. n = 1 suggests standard diffusion and in this case, a = 2D, where D is the one-dimensional diffusion coefficient. For the mutant, an optimal fit was obtained with n = 1.01 ± 0.04, indicating unconstrained diffusion with no directional component. By contrast, n = 1.96 ± 0.03 was obtained for the wild-type motor, consistent with directional processive movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Further MSD analysis indicated that the mutant is about 20-fold more diffusive than the wild-type motor in the no nucleotide state (D = 0.01 ± 0.0006 μm<sup>2</sup>/s vs 0.00045 ± 0.00011 μm<sup>2</sup>/s) and about 30-fold more diffusive in the AMPPNP state (D = 0.0036 ± 0.00011 μm<sup>2</sup>/s vs 0.00011 ± 0.00001 μm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Further analysis indicated that the Cik1<sup>1–360</sup> mutation also increased diffusion in the ADP state, but the difference was less pronounced in comparison to the other states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>). We additionally constructed and purified a monomeric Kar3 head encompassing residues 353–729 with an N-terminal Halo-Tag. Under standard imaging conditions in the presence of ATP only very short-lived microtubule interactions without directional movement could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate only a heterodimer containing a non-catalytic Cik1 head is able to move processively and a key contribution of the non-catalytic domain is to promote tight, non-diffusive binding of the motor in no nucleotide and AMPPNP states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The non-catalytic head determines the velocity of the Kar3 motor</title><p>Having established that the non-catalytic partner is critical for achieving mechanically processive Kar3, we sought to gain further insights into the underlying mechanism by studying the alternative Vik1–Kar3 motor. The non-catalytic proteins Cik1 and Vik1 are paralogs that display about 45% sequence similarity between each other. We purified Vik1–Kar3 complexes from yeast extracts and imaged their interaction with microtubules under the same conditions as previously employed for Cik1–Kar3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, Vik1–Kar3 also displayed highly processive movement, but with faster velocity compared to Cik1–Kar3. Under standard assay conditions, Vik1–Kar3 complexes moved at 234 ± 29 nm/s towards microtubule minus-ends where they strongly accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). To ask how these differences might be determined by the non-catalytic partner, we constructed a chimeric protein in which the globular motor homology domain and the neck of Vik1 (aa 351–647) were fused to the tail domain of Cik1 (aa 1–353) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The Vik1–Cik1 chimera formed a stable heterodimer with Kar3-HALO and supported movement with 188 nm/s to the minus-end, significantly faster than Cik1–Kar3 and approaching the velocity of Vik1–Kar3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Thus, the globular non-catalytic domain is a key determinant for setting the velocity of the motor. The engineered chimeric protein was able to functionally replace Cik1 in cells as demonstrated by its ability to rescue the phenotypes of a Cik1 deletion and to support growth at wild type level under all tested conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04489.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The non-catalytic head domain determines the velocity of the Kar3 motor.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the kinesin-14 Vik1–Kar3 and purification of recombinant Vik1–Kar3 from yeast extracts.

To identify such interactors, we performed affinity purifications of Cik1–FLAG at different cell cycle stages and analyzed associated proteins by mass spectrometry. In addition to Kar3, we reproducibly mapped two plus-end tracking proteins Bim1 and Bik1, the EB1 and CLIP-170 homologues of budding yeast, as well as the microtubule-binding Ndc80 kinetochore complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). By performing pull-down assays with recombinant proteins, we established that Cik1–Kar3, but not Vik1–Kar3, directly interacted with Bim1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The binding interface involved the C-terminal EB homology domain of Bim1 and the aminoterminal tail domain of Cik1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).

By contrast neither a <italic>bim1</italic> deletion, which eliminates spindle localization, nor a <italic>vik1</italic> deletion, removing spindle pole localization, displayed a pronounced growth phenotype (data not shown). Together with our finding that the Vik1<sup>head</sup>–Cik1<sup>tail</sup> chimera fully supports viability, this implies that the key function of Kar3 in vegetatively growing yeast cells requires motility—supported by any of the two non-catalytic heads—and the Cik1 tail domain, but does not involve spindle localization via Bim1. Based on previously characterized mutants and on our finding that the Ndc80 complex co-purifies with Cik1, this supports a key role for Kar3 at the kinetochore. Consistent with this notion, we found that 80% of Cik1<sup>1–521</sup> cells arrested as large budded cells upon shift to the restrictive temperature, indicative of mitotic checkpoint activation. Analysis of chromosome segregation at the semi-permissive temperature of 25°C by fluorescent labeling of chromosome V showed that 50% of large budded Cik1 mutant cells attempted nuclear division without proper bi-orientation of sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). We conclude that the key contribution of the non-conventional Cik1 motility mechanism for cell proliferation lies in the promotion of sister chromatid bi-orientation in mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Cik1–Kar3 motors can promote transport of the Ndc80 kinetochore complex in vitro</title><p>To ask whether Cik–Kar3 can act as a transport motor, we first performed bulk in vitro recruitment assays in the absence of nucleotide using purified motor proteins and recombinant, fluorescently labeled Ndc80 complex as the candidate kinetochore binding partner revealed in the mass spectrometry experiments. In the absence of motor, the Ndc80 complex only weakly associated with taxol-stabilized microtubules under standard conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Vik1–Kar3 motors strongly decorated microtubules in the absence of ATP, but had no effect on the Ndc80 complex. By contrast, combining Cik1–Kar3 and the Ndc80 complex resulted in decoration of microtubules with both molecules. Upon lowering protein concentrations, Cik1–Kar3 and the Ndc80 complex co-localized to distinct spots on the microtubule where their intensities were correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Inclusion of ATP initiated co-transport of the Ndc80 complex and Cik1–Kar3 towards the minus end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). While transporting the Ndc80 complex, the average speed of the motor was 76 ± 15 nm/s (mean ± SD), indicating that cargo binding did not significantly impede movement. The value is also in range with the reported velocity for kinetochore transport in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>). Microtubule binding by the Ndc80 complex was not required for efficient transport, as shown by effective recruitment and translocation of the microtubule-binding defective calponin-homology domain mutant K122E K204E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lampert et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result is in agreement with the observation that Kar3 localizes to unattached kinetochores prior to microtubule binding. We conclude that the Ndc80 complex can be transported by the Kar3 motor in vitro and that in addition to promoting processive motility a key function of Cik1 may lie in the differential binding of this complex.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04489.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Processive transport of the Ndc80 kinetochore complex by Cik1–Kar3 motors in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cik1–Kar3, but not Vik1–Kar3 recruits the Ndc80 kinetochore complex to taxol-stabilized microtubules in vitro.

So far this point has been most clearly demonstrated for the Dynein motor, as recent studies have shown that cytoplasmic dynein is capable of processive movement in vitro despite inactivating mutations in one of the two force-generating AAA ring domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeWitt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>), or even as a combination of one active head with a second passive microtubule-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cleary et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Also several kinesin motors have been reported to move in violation of the hand-over-hand model: monomeric constructs of the kinesin-3 KIF1A have been shown to move along microtubules in vitro using a biased diffusion mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Okada and Hirokawa, 1999</xref>), but the in vivo function of these motors probably involves dimeric molecules for effective cargo transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tomishige et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Endres et al., 2006</xref>). We could not detect evidence for processive movement of monomeric Kar3, making it unlikely that it works via a KIF1A-type mechanism. Among the kinesin-14 family, Ncd can exhibit processive motility but requires at least two homodimers coupled together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furuta et al., 2013</xref>). A number of studies have shown that inactivating mutations in one of the two heads of conventional kinesin can still allow residual processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Subramanian and Gelles, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thoresen and Gelles, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaseda et al., 2003</xref>). We note, however, that in these examples processive movement of the mutant heterodimeric kinesins was compromised compared to wild-type homodimers. By contrast, Kar3 does not simply tolerate the loss of a second active head but instead it has evolved a specific requirement for the non-catalytic domain in order to move processively. In other words, Kar3 can only walk with a combination of an active and an inactive ‘leg’.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A working model for the movement of Kar3 kinesins</title><p>A precise elucidation of the stepping mechanism of Kar3 motors will require further biophysical experiments. Based on the results obtained in this and in previous studies, we propose a working model that describes the non-catalytic head as a ‘foothold’ for Kar3. Based on recent structural data Kar3 and its partner non-catalytic head may be located on adjacent protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rank et al., 2012</xref>), where the non-catalytic domain could contribute to hold the motor complex in place and prevent diffusion. During its ATP cycle, the motor goes through rounds of tightly and weakly bound states. When ADP is bound, the motor is in its weakly bound state which allows for one-dimensional diffusion along the microtubule lattice. On its own, movement in this state would lack directionality and an additional mechanism providing minus-end directed bias is required. We speculate that the presence of Cik1 in combination with the kinesin-14 typical stalk rotation upon ATP binding by Kar3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Endres et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonzalez et al., 2013</xref>) might provide such a mechanism either by shifting the overall position of the molecule or by allowing subsequent directed binding/unbinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Because of the combination of one foot on the track and a diffusive movement to the next binding site, we refer to this possible mechanism as the ‘skateboard’ model. This model can explain a number of our experimental observations: the effect of raising the ionic strength is that initially motor movement occurs with faster velocity, probably by increasing the diffusion term. At some point however, stable binding of the non-catalytic domain is prevented and directional displacement is disrupted, similar to the situation in which the motor lacks the motor homology domain. In addition, diffusive movement in the ADP state and the observed large variation in movement rates are compatible with the model. The biochemical properties of the non-catalytic head binding to the microtubule will have profound effects on the motile characteristics as evidenced by the different properties of Cik1–Kar3 and Vik1–Kar3 motors.</p><p>One of the open questions regarding the mechanism of processivity is how the motor homology domain can provide ‘footing’ in no nucleotide and AMPPNP states yet allow effective diffusion in the ADP state. In agreement with previous work, this suggests that similar to conventional kinesins, a form of head-to-head communication must occur in Kar3 motors such that the catalytic head influences the microtubule affinity of the motor homology domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allingham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rank et al., 2012</xref>). Such coordination may involve intramolecular strain communicated by mechanical elements between the heads as has been reported for conventional kinesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yildiz et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for Kar3 function in vivo</title><p>Based on our experiments and the previously reported rates of microtubule shortening in the presence of Cik1–Kar3, we consider it unlikely that Kar3 functions as a microtubule depolymerase in vivo. We note that none of the Kar3 functions poses a strict requirement for such an activity and indeed recent experiments analyzing Kar3 function during karyogamy support the view that its primary function is transport, not shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibeaux et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>What are the implications of Kar3's processivity? The ability to move processively may be used in the cell to enrich Kar3 motors at minus-ends. In addition, Kar3 could work more effectively in small teams if it can undergo multiple catalytic cycles before releasing from the microtubule. This may be especially important during kinetochore transport, where Ndc80 complexes can provide only a limited number of binding sites for the motor. Kar3 heterodimers have probably evolved from conventional Kinesin14-homodimers that performed Ncd-like roles in spindle organization. We speculate that with the exclusion of dynein from the budding yeast nucleus additional functional requirements for minus-end directed motility in spindle assembly and kinetochore function arose that could be fulfilled with the ‘invention’ of the Cik1 and Vik1 non-catalytic domains. While commonly perceived as conferring a loss of functionality, the pseudo-motor domains have the ability to convert a kinesin-14 into a processive motor and additionally create functional diversity through allowing differential interactions with partners. Together this allows Kar3 to function as a processsive sliding and transport motor that substitutes for key roles of dynein in the yeast nucleus. Other examples for heterodimeric motors exist in the Kinesin-2 family with different subunits conferring distinct activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunnbauer et al., 2010</xref>). Kar3 motors may therefore constitute an extreme example for such diversification strategies that could be more widely used in other motor families. More generally, we note that pseudoenzymes have emerging roles in other cellular contexts, for example in the form pseudo-GTPases during human kinetochore assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basilico et al., 2014</xref>), or as pseudo-kinases and pseudo-phosphatases in cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boudeau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tonks, 2009</xref>). This may suggest that the use of catalytically inactive enzyme derivatives could be a more widespread strategy employed by the cell. The establishment of an in vitro assay for Ndc80 transport serves as a starting point for a detailed analysis of the function and regulation of kinetochore motility. Furthermore, the unique design principle of the Kar3 motor, which allows the same catalytic domain to be paired with different non-catalytic heads, generates functional diversity that may also be exploited in nanotechnological applications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein Biochemistry</title><p>The protein coding sequences of <italic>S. cerevisae</italic> (S288c) full-length Kar3, Cik1, and Vik1 were amplified by PCR and cloned into the overexpression pESC-TRP (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) vector. The non-catalytic motor subunit was tagged C-terminally with 1xFLAG and the motor itself was fused to a HaloTag (DHA, Promega) at the 5′ end of the coding sequence, separated by a 13 amino acid linker. Mutated and truncated versions of Cik1 and Kar3 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis PCR (Phusion, Thermo Scientific). To determine the TMR-labeling efficiency, Halo-Kar3 was fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), creating Halo-eGFP-Kar3. All motor proteins were overexpressed in budding yeast using the pESC vectors (Agilent Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, yeast cells harboring the respective pESC plasmid were induced with 2% Galactose at OD<sub>600</sub> = 1.0 for 7–9 hr, harvested by centrifugation, washed, and frozen as droplets in liquid nitrogen. Lysis was conducted in liquid nitrogen using a freezer mill (Biospec Inc.). The cell powder was resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Hepes [7.4], 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5% glycerole, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.01 mM ATP, 0.1 mM PMSF supplemented with PhosSTOP Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail [Roche]). The lysed cells were centrifuged twice, first at 43.146×<italic>g</italic> for 20 min and afterwards at 125.749×<italic>g</italic> for 1 hr. The resulting supernatant was incubated with M2 affinity agarose (Sigma–Aldrich) for 1 hr, gently rotating at 4°C. The agarose resin was washed five times with lysis buffer (adjusted to 150 mM NaCl, 0.09% Tween-20, omitting the PhosSTOP reagent). Elution of the kinesin heterodimeric constructs from M2 agarose was achieved by applying one resin volume of 3xFLAG peptide at final 2 mg/ml in lysis buffer (adjusted to 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.09% Tween-20, omitting ATP and PhosSTOP). If needed, the elution was loaded onto a cation exchange chromatography (MonoS 5/50 GL, GE Healthcare) in running buffer (10 mM Hepes [pH 7.2], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA) to remove the FLAG peptide. Afterwards a linear salt gradient eluted a single peak, pure motor fraction at 250 mM salt. Elution fractions were supplemented with glycerol (final concentration: 5%), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. The protein concentration was measured using the DC Assay kit (Bio-Rad). All proteins were pre-cleared by centrifugation using a 0.1-μm spin filter (Millipore) to remove aggregates before each experiment.</p><p>Labeling of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus of Kar3 with the HaloTag TMR ligand or HaloTag Alexa488 ligand (Promega, Madison, WI) was performed during the above-described purification before eluting the kinesin heterodimer from the M2 affinity agarose: the proteins were incubated with 10 μM HaloTag ligand for 3 hr. Extensive washing removed unbound TMR ligand and the kinesin was eluted as described before. In order to assess the labeling efficiency the Halo-eGFP-Kar3 construct was expressed, purified, and TMR-labeled. Observing the motor in our multi-color single-molecule imaging setup in the absence or presence of ATP revealed that &gt;90% of eGFP-labeled kinesins also had a TMR-ligand covalently bound to the HaloTag.</p><p>To obtain a stoichiometric heterodimer of Cik1 and Kar3, the motor was subjected to analytical SEC.

Coverslips were incubated 1 hr in boiling Piranha solution and rinsed with a lot of water afterwards. Then rinsed with 0.1 M KOH, MilliQ and dried with nitrogen and immersed in 5% dichlorodimethylsilane in heptane for 1 hr at room temperature.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that in principle this paper would be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, but to make it so, the authors will need to carry out additional experiments and to reduce the strength of their claims, which both reviewers agreed were exaggerated (one reviewer even used the word “reckless”). The key result that the reviewers agreed makes the paper suitable for <italic>eLife</italic> is that the heterodimer walks processively toward the minus end of a MT.</p><p>1) The main conclusion of this manuscript is that Kar3 needs a second non-catalytic microtubule binding domain for processive translocation. If monomeric kinesin Kif1A can move along microtubules in vitro using a biased diffusion mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Okada and Hirokawa, 1999</xref>, but see reservations below), Kar3 might do the same, obviating (or at least reducing) the requirement for a second motor head. A key question is whether the Cik1(1-360)-Kar3 mutant (or the Cik1(1-521)-Kar3 mutant) moves directionally in the presence of ATP. Now it is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B and 2C</xref> that the velocity is substantially lower, but the authors need to analyze these data in more detail. If Cik1(1-360)-Kar3 and Cik1(1-521)-Kar3 do have significant directionality, then the authors might need to modify their description of the “foot-hold” mechanism.</p><p>2) Examples of exaggerated claims or incorrect information, all of which need to be fixed in a revision:</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>(i) “Whether this (hand-over-hand) model is universal, or if alternative mechanisms can support highly processive motion along microtubules, is an open question.” This statement is wrong. It is no longer an open question. Dewitt et al., Science, 2012 and Qiu et al., NSMB, 2012 showed that dynein walks in an uncoordinated manner.</p><p>(ii) “The noncatalytic domain acts as a foothold that allows Kar3 to bias translocation towards the minus end via a diffusive ADP state.” The reported experiments do not prove this statement. That kinesins have lower MT affinity in the ADP state was already known. The authors did not demonstrate how this motor steps along MT. In order to make these claims, they must demonstrate that: a) Cik1/Vik1 biases translocation of Kar3 to the minus end, b) translocation of Kar3 occurs in the ADP bound state and c) diffusion of the Kar3 head to the next tubulin binding site is a critical step. The authors need to delete this statement and replace it with one that sticks to the facts.</p><p>(iii) “This mechanism… allows transport of the Ndc80 kinetochore complex in vitro and is critical for Kar 3 function in vivo.” The authors show that Kar3 can bind and transport the isolated Ndc80 complex, not the Ndc80 complex as part of an assembled kinetochore. It has yet to be shown whether this in vitro transport reflects a property critical for in vivo function of Kar3. This latter statement is what they propose, but do not show, in this manuscript. The authors need to delete this statement and replace it with one that sticks to the facts.</p><p>Introduction section:</p><p>“In general motors equipped with only one catalytically active head fail to achieve long-range processive motility”. This is not true. The authors need to rewrite this paragraph citing: (i) the Okada et al. 2003 Kif1A paper showing processive single-headed motility; (ii) the Kaseda, Higuchi and Hirose (NSMB, 2003) and Thoresen et al. (Biochemistry, 2008) papers showed that processive motility of kinesin heterodimers with mutant motor domains that have lower catalytic activity; (iii) the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clearly et al. 2014</xref> paper on cytoplasmic dynein showing that processive motility can occur when one of the heads in the dimer is replaced by a non-motor domain; and (iv) reports of processive motility with axonemal dynein. In other words, the authors need to remove overblown claims, discuss earlier results in a balanced way, and clearly and accurately indicate how their results advance the field.</p><p>The manuscript lacks evidence that their preps do not include aggregates. The authors could rule out aggregation by running gel filtration experiments, which are standard in the field.</p><p>The authors do cite evidence in Figure 1–figure supplement 1, for mostly single step photobleaching of labeled motors, arguing that processive motility is a property of individual motors. While this may be true, the single step photobleaching is not definitive. First, the data clearly show that some motors show 2 or &gt;2 steps of photobleaching, suggesting protein aggregation or transient interactions. Second, the labeling efficiency is not calculated. If it is low (e.g. 40%), the fact that 10-20% of motors have 2 or more steps of photobleaching would suggest most proteins are aggregates. Third, if the motors are aggregated (e.g. 10 motors in an aggregate) then almost all the aggregates will have TMR even if the coupling efficiency is low. Aggregation may be an even bigger problem with the delta K-loop construct, which is expected to be less soluble. So gel filtration on this construct <italic>is</italic> also necessary.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, how do the authors know that the MTs are antiparallel and overlap? Was the polarity marked?</p><p>Third paragraph of the Results section:</p><p>“We noticed that due to their relatively large velocity distribution…” This whole paragraph does not make sense. How do they know that the motors run into each other (e.g. literally colliding with each other)? What is the evidence that motors travel together in teams? Are the proteins in contacts with each other (which cannot be seen by a fluorescence microscope due to diffraction limited resolution of the assay). In this section, they can also cite the Cin8 study by the Surrey lab (Roostalu et al., Science, 2011).</p><p>Eighth paragraph of the Results section:</p><p>The interpretation of the K-tail mutant experiments is counterintuitive. One would expect that removing positively charged residues from the noncatalytic head would reduce its affinity for MTs (which is not shown biochemically in this manuscript and needs to be shown in a revised version). Since the authors wish to refer to the function of this head as “a foothold”, these mutations would be expected to alter motility by reducing processivity (because it is no longer a very strong MT tether), with increased or unchanged velocity (because it might be easier for Kar3 to pull off the noncatalytic head from MT by force). The description of these results and their interpretation need reconsideration and revision.</p><p>The authors do not present direct evidence that Kar3 transports Ndc80 in vivo. Therefore, they need to change “We conclude that the Ndc80 complex is a direct cargo for Kar3 transport” to “We conclude that the Ndc80 complex can be transported by the Kar3/Cik1 motor.”</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>(i) In the first paragraph, the authors claim to have discovered that Kar3/Cik or Kar3/Vik1 heterodimers have a new mode of processive motility, and they assert that this is the first example of a motor that violates hand over hand motility. These statements are wrong (see comments above). Also note that without high resolution stepping studies their conclusions are too speculative.</p><p>(ii) The authors claim that “Kar3's motile characteristics share similarities to Kif1A”. How so? Kif1A was claimed to be processive on its own and not to require a foothold. The effect of the positive charges is different. Note that processive motility of single-headed Kif1 has not been replicated in another laboratory. The authors should analyze the motility of a Kar3 monomer and compare their results with those published by Hirokawa on Kif1A.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>:</p><p>The model shown does not relate to the main story, and there is no evidence provided for it. It should be removed from the manuscript. The entire discussion of diffusive states, anisotropy and powerstroke are far too speculative. It would be more appropriate for some future review. The problem is that without high-resolution stepping data many of the conclusions are in fact speculations. The authors have to be very careful to distinguish fact from fiction.</p><p>In summary, to be suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>, a revised manuscript will need to include at least the following:</p><p>1) More convincing and complete demonstration, by careful gel filtration experiments, that the motor proteins are not aggregated.</p><p>2) More thorough analysis of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>: is there directionality in the motion detected for the mutants?</p><p>3) Comparison of the behavior of a Kar3 monomer with the reported behavior of Kif1A.</p><p>The revised manuscript must also avoid the exaggerated and overstated claims that mar the current version.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04489.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>In summary, to be suitable for</italic> eLife<italic>, a revised manuscript will need to include at least the following</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) More convincing and complete demonstration, by careful gel filtration experiments, that the motor proteins are not aggregated</italic>.</p><p><italic>2) More thorough analysis of the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B, C</italic></xref><italic>: is there directionality in the motion detected for the mutants?</italic></p><p><italic>3) Comparison of the behavior of a Kar3 monomer with the reported behavior of Kif1A.</italic></p><p><italic>The revised manuscript must also avoid the exaggerated and overstated claims that mar the current version</italic>.</p><p>1) In the revised manuscript we have included a biochemical characterization of Cik1-Kar3 motors by gel filtration and velocity gradient centrifugation analysis (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C, D, E</xref>). To go further and more directly characterize the motors we have visualized the motor proteins used in the experiments by low angle Platinum/Carbon rotary shadowing EM (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F, G</xref>). The hydrodynamic analysis shows that the motor proteins are biochemically well behaved, as they elute as a single species with no indication of aggregation. The EM data (the first visualization of full-length Cik1-Kar3 motors) reveals the overall organization of the motors and supports the conclusion that individual Cik1-Kar3 heterodimers are being analyzed.</p><p>2) As suggested we have more carefully analyzed the movement of wild-type and mutant motors in ATP in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>. A mean-squared displacement analysis indicates that the movement of the Cik1(1-360)-Kar3 mutant is fitted well with n=1 to the one-dimensional diffusion equation &lt;x<sup>2</sup>&gt;= a·t<sup>n</sup>, indicating random diffusion with no directional component. In contrast, data for mean squared displacement of the wild-type motor is fitted with n=2, indicating directed movement.</p><p>3) We have constructed a monomeric, Halo-tagged Kar3 construct and imaged it in the TIRF assay. In the presence of ATP and under low nanomolar motor concentrations, only very short-lived binding events can be detected on microtubules (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Thus, there is no evidence that monomeric Kar3 can move processively.</p><p>We believe that taken together these three points have greatly strengthened the manuscript. The biochemical and EM characterization shows that well-behaved, non-aggregated motors were purified. The additional experiments show that indeed the non-catalytic head is strictly required for processive movement, as no directional movement of the heterodimer can be detected after its removal and in the reciprocal experiment; the Kar3 monomeric head alone does not display processive movement.</p><p><italic>The reviewers agreed that in principle this paper would be suitable for publication in</italic> eLife<italic>, but to make it so, the authors will need to carry out additional experiments and to reduce the strength of their claims, which both reviewers agreed were exaggerated (one reviewer even used the word “reckless”).

In this section, they can also cite the Cin8 study by the Surrey lab (Roostalu et al., Science, 2011)</italic>.</p><p>We have re-worded this section to state that we are simply comparing properties of motors with different brightness, i.e. heterodimers compared to teams that consist of two or more heterodimers</p><p><italic>Eighth paragraph of the Results section</italic>:</p><p><italic>The interpretation of the K-tail mutant experiments is counterintuitive. One would expect that removing positively charged residues from the noncatalytic head would reduce its affinity for MTs (which is not shown biochemically in this manuscript and needs to be shown in a revised version). Since the authors wish to refer to the function of this head as “a foothold”, these mutations would be expected to alter motility by reducing processivity (because it is no longer a very strong MT tether), with increased or unchanged velocity (because it might be easier for Kar3 to pull off the noncatalytic head from MT by force). The description of these results and their interpretation need reconsideration and revision.</italic></p><p>While our experiments establish that the non-catalytic head in combination with Kar3 determines the velocity of the motor complex, we indeed at this point cannot give a mechanistic explanation for the role of the “K-tail”. In additional experiments we determined that simply adding the “K-tail” to the carboxyterminus of Cik1-Kar3 is not sufficient to alter the velocity of this motor. Thus, the K-tail’s role in the mechanochemical cycle might be more complex than simply altering the affinity for microtubules. This is in line with recent work from Yoshi et al., JBC, 2013. We have decided to remove the figure panels describing the K-tail experiments from the revised manuscript, as these points require further experimentation and do not contribute to the main message of the paper.</p><p><italic>The authors do not present direct evidence that Kar3 transports Ndc80 in vivo. Therefore, they need to change “We conclude that the Ndc80 complex is a direct cargo for Kar3 transport” to “We conclude that the Ndc80 complex can be transported by the Kar3/Cik1 motor</italic>.<italic>”</italic></p><p>We agree and have changed the wording accordingly.</p><p><italic>Discussion</italic>:</p><p><italic>(i) In the first paragraph, the authors claim to have discovered that Kar3/Cik or Kar3/Vik1 heterodimers have a new mode of processive motility, and they assert that this is the first example of a motor that violates hand over hand motility. These statements are wrong (see comments above). Also note that without high resolution stepping studies their conclusions are too speculative</italic>.</p><p><italic>(ii) The authors claim that “Kar3's motile characteristics share similarities to Kif1A”. How so? Kif1A was claimed to be processive on its own and not to require a foothold. The effect of the positive charges is different. Note that processive motility of single-headed Kif1 has not been replicated in another laboratory. The authors should analyze the motility of a Kar3 monomer and compare their results with those published by Hirokawa on Kif1A</italic>.</p><p>As suggested, we have tested the motility of a monomeric Kar3 head construct (residues 353-729 fused to an N-terminal Halo tag). We have found no evidence for processive movement under conditions that allow robust motility of the heterodimer (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). We agree that the suggested similarities to Kif1A have been confusing in our Discussion. We have rewritten the Discussion to conclude that Kar3’s mechanism of movement must be different from Kif1A as wehave not detected motility of a monomeric Kar3 construct and no directional movement was observed after removing the non-catalytic Cik1 head.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref>:</p><p><italic>The model shown does not relate to the main story, and there is no evidence provided for it. It should be removed from the manuscript. The entire discussion of diffusive states, anisotropy and powerstroke are far too speculative. It would be more appropriate for some future review. The problem is that without high-resolution stepping data many of the conclusions are in fact speculations. The authors have to be very careful to distinguish fact from fiction</italic>.</p><p>As suggested, we have re-written the discussion section to remove the more speculative statements and focus on the experimentally supported insights. We have removed the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, as we can indeed not give conclusive insights about the stepping mechanism. We would like to maintain a simplified model (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) that illustrates the following experimentally addressed points: 1) the Kar3 motor can take multiple steps along the microtubule before dissociating; 2) the non-catalytic head is required for the movement by promoting tight binding in no-nucleotide and AMP-PNP state 3) the movement likely has a diffusional component, as suggested by the diffusive behavior of the motor in ADP and the pronounced salt-sensitivity of the velocity.</p><p>We agree that further biophysical experiments are required to establish a mechanism and we have greatly tightened the discussion to avoid too much speculation about the mechanism.</p></body></sub-article></article>
