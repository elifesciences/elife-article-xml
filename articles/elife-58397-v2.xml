However, our understanding of climate regions is limited to how they shape vegetation: they do not account for the distribution of animals. Here, we develop a network-based framework to identify important climates worldwide based on regularities in realized niches of about 26,000 tetrapods. We show that high-energy climates, including deserts, tropical savannas, and steppes, are consistent across animal- and plant-derived classifications, indicating similar underlying climatic determinants. Conversely, temperate climates differ across all groups, suggesting that these climates allow for idiosyncratic adaptations. Finally, we show how the integration of niche classifications with geographical information enables the detection of climatic transition zones and the signal of geographic and historical processes. Our results identify the climates shaping the distribution of tetrapods and call for caution when using general climate classifications to study the ecology, evolution, or conservation of specific taxa.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>There are many distinct climates on Earth, from tropical savannas and temperate forests to dry deserts. Historically, each region has been defined by how its annual weather patterns shape the type of vegetation present. For example, hot and humid environments support the growth of evergreen forests that would not survive in drier places.</p><p>Identifying the boundaries between climate regions is key to understanding how life is organized on Earth and predicting how climate change will affect different species. Current climate classifications, however, do not account for where animals can be found or how local conditions, such as precipitation and average temperatures, shape the distribution of different animal species. To bridge this gap, Calatayud et al. analyzed the preferred climate of about 26,000 animal species, including amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles.</p><p>For each species, Calatayud et al. calculated the annual rainfall and temperature of its local environment, or ‘niche’, using previously collected data. They then used a computer algorithm to group together climates that had similar species. This identified 16 climate regions which govern the distribution of the animals studied. Calatayud et al. found that these newly defined climatic regions resembled some of the regions classified using plants. This was particularly true for high-energy climates that had lower levels of rainfall and hot temperatures, such as deserts and the tropical savanna.</p><p>The animals and plant species living in high-energy regions were found to be fairly consistent across both classification systems. Whereas the species present in milder and colder climates, such as temperate forests or Mediterranean climates, were found to be much more varied. This suggests that temperate climates are harder to classify and may affect the distribution of plants and animals differently. It also implies that less extreme conditions support a larger range of species than harsher climates in which only species with certain adaptations are able to survive.</p><p>These findings build the basis for a better understanding of how climates shape ecosystems. More specific climate classifications, based on such analyses, could be used to inform conservation strategies for animal species in the face of climate change.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>climate classification</kwd><kwd>vertebrates</kwd><kwd>climate zones</kwd><kwd>geographic signal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002805</institution-id><institution>Carl Tryggers Stiftelse för Vetenskaplig Forskning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calatayud</surname><given-names>Joaquín</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004200</institution-id><institution>Stiftelsen Olle Engkvist Byggmästare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosvall</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001862</institution-id><institution>Svenska Forskningsrådet Formas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neuman</surname><given-names>Magnus</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosvall</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016–00796</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosvall</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Similarities in climatic niches of terrestrial vertebrates indicate the Earth's climate regions, which differ among groups and from previous plant-based climate classifications.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Climate governs the basis of life on Earth. Besides historical contingencies and geographical barriers, abiotic conditions determine species ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Woodward, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoffmann and Parsons, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calatayud et al., 2019b</xref>) and derived diversity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawkins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kreft and Jetz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mendoza and Araújo, 2019</xref>). On a global scale, distinctive climate types impose generalized constraints that shape species pools adapted to particular climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whittaker, 1962</xref>). Identifying the boundaries of these climate types is a fundamental challenge to understanding how life organizes on Earth, with acute implications in diverse disciplines given the current climate change.</p><p>Pythagoras proposed a classification of climate regimes of the known world in the 6th century BC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanderson, 1999</xref>). Still, it was not until the 19th century that geographers laid the foundations for such classifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oliver, 1991</xref>). By that time, researchers noticed the close relationship between the distribution of various life forms, especially vegetation types, and climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oliver, 1991</xref>). For instance, Köppen built his long-standing climate classification from pioneer plant classifications, assuming that vegetation types carry information about climatic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kottek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thornthwaite, 1943</xref>). This assumption has received considerable support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rohli et al., 2015</xref>), and researchers and stakeholders use Köppen’s classification system in a wide range of disciplines, including climatology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spinoni et al., 2015</xref>), geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gentine et al., 2012</xref>), conservation planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tobin et al., 2014</xref>), and ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcia et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>But the general climatic conditions derived from plant species may not apply to other organisms. Plants’ and animals’ climatic determinants will likely differ, given their large physiological differences. Although diversity patterns of plants and animals are relatively congruent, the climatic correlates of these patterns vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Whittaker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qian and Ricklefs, 2008</xref>). Hence, if climatic adaptations vary among taxa, so will the boundaries defining their climate types. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thornthwaite, 1943</xref> words, the ‘truly active factors’ describing a climate type may vary among organisms, and it remains unknown whether Köppen’s climate classification can indicate the active climatic factors for other organisms than plants. Despite several attempts to refine or propose alternative climate types or regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trewartha, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holdridge, 1947</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thornthwaite, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Netzel and Stepinski, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gardner et al., 2020</xref>), quantitative studies defining climatic regions for other organisms are still lacking.</p><p>The current information on species distributions and global climatic variables, together with recent advances in niche modeling and classification techniques, provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify the climatic boundaries shaping the distribution of faunas and floras across the globe. The last decades have witnessed a tremendous collective effort to record occurrences of a large number of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">GBIF, 2019</xref>), which has resulted in comprehensive datasets of the distributional ranges of several groups of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">IUCN, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">BirdLife, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roll et al., 2017</xref>). Also, data on climatic variables at a global scale have been developed at high spatial resolutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fick and Hijmans, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trabucco and Zomer, 2009</xref>). Combining these two sources of information, we can characterize the realized climatic niches of different taxa and find regularities among them. For example, projecting these realized climatic niches into a climatic space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broennimann et al., 2012</xref>) should, if climatic boundaries exist, reveal co-occurring groups of species across particular portions of the climatic space. Thus, identifying these niche domains should uncover the main climatic boundaries shaping the organization of life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Workflow to identify niche domains and climatic regions.</title><p>Using the climatic conditions a given species experiences within its range (<bold>A</bold>), we project species niches into a climatic space discretized in an optimal number of bins (Appendix 1) (<bold>B</bold>). We translate the binned data into a weighted bipartite network, where climatic bins and species form the nodes and the probabilities of finding the species in the bins form the weighted links (<bold>C</bold>). Using a network community detection algorithm, we identify domains of the climatic space with similar species (<bold>D</bold>, upper). The climatic conditions defining these domains delineate the corresponding climatic regions of the Earth (<bold>D</bold>, lower). The striped climatic bin links to species classified in both climatic domains, and, therefore, it represents a diffuse transition with low specificity.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58397-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In addition to the climate, dispersal barriers and historical contingencies influence the shape of niche domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Warren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calatayud et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calatayud et al., 2019b</xref>). Therefore, similar climates can have different effects across different geographic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ricklefs, 1987</xref>). For instance, while a given climate in some parts of the Earth may lead to specific species pools, the same climate in other parts of the Earth may not. Such a potential lack of specific species can occur, for example, because the required adaptations have not appeared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flohr et al., 2013</xref>), the adapted species have not been able to disperse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tuomisto et al., 2003</xref>), or the area is too small to hold large species pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Connor and McCoy, 1979</xref>). Studying the signature of these historical and geographical processes, known as geographical signals, in niche domains can provide valuable information about the potential mechanisms behind them and their associated climatic regions.</p><p>We explore the global climate regions of tetrapods by characterizing the climatic niche domains of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles. Tetrapods are a well-suited group for our purpose. First, comprehensive databases are available, including the distributional ranges of most species in the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">IUCN, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">BirdLife, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roll et al., 2017</xref>). Second, the different classes of tetrapods have diverse capabilities to disperse and withstand abiotic conditions, allowing us to investigate whether various capabilities influence climatic classifications. Third, accumulated evidence about the main climatic factors controlling the distribution of these species simplifies the selection of appropriate climatic variables. In particular, the distribution of tetrapods is strongly determined by the water and energy aspects of climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawkins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Currie, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tingley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gouveia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, researchers study tetrapods in several disparate fields – from animal husbandry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abecia et al., 2017</xref>) to ecological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Englert Duursma et al., 2019</xref>) and evolutionary studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rolland et al., 2014</xref>) – where a description of their climatic regions can be especially useful.</p><p>In our classification approach, we project the realized niche of each tetrapod species onto a binned two-dimensional space representing water and energy, the primary climatic factors impacting their geographic distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). After translating this climatic niche space into a weighted bipartite network, we apply a network community detection algorithm to identify climatic niche domains with similar species pools. Finally, by mapping the climatic niche domains back onto the Earth’s surface, we provide the climatic regions.</p><p>The detected climatic regions support the notion that similar climatic determinants underlie animal and plant distributions in high-energy regions, including deserts, tropical savannas, and steppe regions. However, differences in temperate climates across all groups indicate that specific climatic regions for each group of taxa are required to address ecological, evolutionary, and conservation questions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Classification of climatic niches</title><p>We first identified the species niche domains by calculating the proportion of observations of each species within each bin of a two-dimensional climatic space defined by potential evapotranspiration (PET) and annual precipitation (AP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, 'Materials and methods' and Appendix 1). We represented this data as a weighted bipartite network, where climatic bins and species form two disjunct sets of nodes and the probabilities of finding the species in the bins form the link weights. Using a hierarchical network clustering algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2011</xref>), we obtained groups of climatic bins holding similar species, niche domains, and the species associated with them.</p><p>We found similarities among tetrapods classes in the detected niche domains but also observed some differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For instance, the number of major domains with 50 or more species in the lower hierarchical level is similar (ranging from 13 to 15) across tetrapods classes. However, mammals and birds show a domain of low-energy inputs, whereas reptiles present some domains across arid conditions, that is, with high energy and low water availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Finally, we classified the climatic space of tetrapods by using all species jointly. The clustering algorithm divided the niche space of tetrapods into 16 main domains that are similar to those of the independent classes, and some of the particularities described above did not appear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Tetrapods’ niche domains across the climatic space.</title><p>The climatic niche domains of each group shown across a space defined by potential evapotranspiration (PET) as a surrogate of energy and annual precipitation (AP) as a surrogate of water inputs.

Numerical subscripts differentiate domains of similar climates. Numbers between 0 and 1 indicate the bootstrap support. The dotted line represents the domains at the highest hierarchical level. Domains of less than 50 species are colored dark gray. Domain colors across groups only indicate similar climatic regions. To characterize the climatic space, we used 17 divisions of both PET and AP for all groups except for amphibians, where we used 18 (see Appendix 1).</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig2sdata1"><label>Figure 2—source data 1.</label><caption><title>niches domains and the species associated to them.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-58397-fig2-data1-v2.zip"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58397-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Since uncertainties related to the ranges of species exist, we employed a bootstrap and a significance clustering procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calatayud et al., 2019a</xref>) to assess the domains’ robustness ('Materials and methods').

Regarding regions of low energy, we found a slightly higher level of disagreement between Köppen’s and tetrapods’ regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Finally, temperate climates (medium energy E<sup>M</sup>) were the least congruent between tetrapod groups and Köppen’s regions. These regions of medium energy were at the same time the least congruent among groups and the least supported by the bootstrap analyses, suggesting that these climates could impose less restrictive conditions in general and allow the appearance of idiosyncratic and variable adaptations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Climatic transition zones</title><p>A complete understanding of niche domains and their associated climatic regions entails the exploration of whether their boundaries represent abrupt or diffuse transitions. Climatic conditions corresponding to diffuse transitions should present low specificity levels to the domain where they belong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Hence, we can consider specificity as the opposite of transitivity. Our network approach allows us to calculate this specificity by the dual classification of climatic bins and species into the same niche domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We computed the specificity of each climatic bin as the ratio between the link weights of the species classified in the same domain and the total link weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernardo-Madrid et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calatayud et al., 2019b</xref>). Then, we projected these values geographically. As expected, lower specificity values were in general associated with the boundaries of the climatic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). Beyond boundaries, our results also revealed that harsh conditions, such as desert and continental-polar climates (E<sup>H</sup>W<sup>L</sup> and E<sup>L</sup>W<sup>L</sup>), present the highest specificity levels, regardless of the group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>), reflecting the difficulty of colonizing these climates. Conversely, temperate regions showed the lowest levels of specificity. These regions were also weakly supported in the bootstrap analyses, and we found that bootstrap p-values and mean specificity were significantly correlated (standard generalized linear mixed model [GLMM] coeff. 6.21; p &lt; 0.001 conditional = 0.29, see 'Materials and methods'). Together with the higher variability of these regions across groups, this result further supports the idea that these climatic conditions could impose less restrictive conditions to tetrapods.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The geographic location of climatic domains and their associated species provides insights into the mechanism underlying the climatic regions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Geographic projection of the specificity of climatic bins to their niche domain.

To search for this geographical signal, we first compared the distribution of the climatic conditions and species grouped within the same niche domain. A geographic mismatch between species and climate distributions would point to portions of the climatic regions that are defined by species occurring in other geographic areas. Exploring these patterns for each niche domain revealed notable geographic agreement between species and climatic conditions of the same domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">7</xref>). Nevertheless, we found some differences across groups and regions. More extreme climates showed larger mismatches between the distribution of species and climates. For instance, for all groups but reptiles, desert climate (E<sup>H</sup>W<sup>L</sup>) was mostly defined by species inhabiting Australia and to a lesser extent by species from the Namibian desert and the Horn of Africa, with few or no species inhabiting the Sahara desert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">7</xref>).

Approaching the geographical signal more quantitatively (see 'Materials and methods'), we found a stronger signal for the worst dispersers, amphibians and reptiles, than for mammals and birds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that dispersal capabilities can contribute to the geographical signal in the niche domains. Finally, all tetrapods together showed the lowest geographical signal, which suggests that, in addition to dispersion, increased evolutionary time can reduce the geographical signal.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We detected 16 climatic regions governing the distribution of tetrapods. Despite the substantial physiological and functional differences among the groups, some of their niche domains and climatic regions are consistent. These climatic regions also resemble Köppen’s regions and correspond, in general, with extreme climates, being arid climates specially congruent across groups. These climates also presented overall low levels of transitivity, showing that species adapted to other climates have more difficulty withstanding these conditions. These results suggest that extreme climates impose strong adaptive barriers, producing a filtering of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butterfield, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cadotte and Tucker, 2017</xref>) even across distinctive evolutionary lineages.</p><p>Conversely, milder climatic conditions, especially temperate climates, showed the lowest statistical support and congruence across groups, as well as the highest transitivity. These results indicate that temperate climates are more difficult to classify (low support and congruence) due to the overlap in the climatic space of species pools with different climatic optima (high transitivity). Two complementary reasons can explain this ambiguity: first, while we used two variables widely recognized to shape the distributions of tetrapods, alternative variables, such as seasonal changes in energy and precipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Köppen and Geiger, 1930</xref>), may also influence species inhabiting temperate regions. Including these variables might help to further separate temperate species pools across the climatic space. Second, the climatic conditions of these domains may not prevent the colonization of species with other realized optima or preferences, which would generate the observed overlap in the climatic space (i.e., high transitivity) across milder conditions. Questions remain about the relative contribution of each process. Similarly, the exact causes and consequences of the climatic transition zones call for future investigation.</p><p>We also found some domains that were well supported but unique for each group. These differences between groups seem to relate to the particular physiological adaptations of each group. For instance, homeothermic birds and mammals defined a region of low energy, consistent with Köppen’s polar climates, that reptiles and amphibians lacked. Similarly, reptiles, a group that includes several groups adapted to arid environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pie et al., 2017</xref>), defined some regions of low precipitation and high PET. Hence, our results stress that caution is needed when generalizing the climate classification to other groups of organisms, and question the validity of using plant-based classifications for studies dealing with animals.</p><p>Beyond niche domains, our results also show differences in the geographical signal across groups. That amphibians – the group with the lowest dispersal capacity – showed the highest geographical signal suggests that dispersal processes play an essential role: species that are worse dispersers have more difficulties tracking their preferred climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araújo and Pearson, 2005</xref>), limiting the colonization of disjoint areas with similar climates. Moreover, all tetrapods together showed the lowest geographical signal, suggesting that increased evolutionary time can reduce this geographic pattern. That is, an extended evolutionary time that enables the appearance of convergent adaptations to similar climates in different geographic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mazel et al., 2017</xref>) may reduce the geographical signal in niche domains. Alternatively, tetrapods include taxa with varying dispersal strategies – such as the high active dispersal of birds and the elevated survival probabilities of reptiles to passive transoceanic dispersal – which may also influence the geographical signal. In any case, the ultimate causes and consequences of this signal require further attention. Why are some amphibians able to inhabit arid conditions in the Australian desert but not in the Sahara desert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendi 1—figure 3</xref>)? Why can some reptiles withstand cold climates around the Himalayan mountains but not in the northern hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendi 1—figure 4</xref>)? These are some examples of the emerging fundamental questions related to the geographical signal. Answering them would require studying the adaptations that allow the species to tolerate particular climatic conditions and the abiotic, biotic, and historical differences between regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moncrieff et al., 2015</xref>) that favor these adaptations in some places but not in others. Moreover, the geographical signal idea could also help unravel idiosyncratic processes occurring at smaller scales by comparing local climate regions with global or regional ones. These examples form exciting avenues for future historical biogeographical and evolutionary studies.</p><p>Our results and data-driven methodology have the potential to bring us closer to a definition of climatic regions that represent active factors for the spatial organization of life. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to improve some aspects in future studies. First, while we used a notable number of species (about 26,000), they are taxonomically biased and only represent a small fraction of terrestrial organisms. Second, we used two climatic variables widely known to affect the distribution and diversity patterns of animals and plants in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Currie, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawkins et al., 2003</xref>), but other climatic variables might refine some of the least supported regions. Finally, our domains represent portions of the realized climatic niche space, which entails two sources of uncertainty. On the one hand, the estimation of realized niches depends on the data quality, scale, and treatment choices. On the other hand, the realized niche space may be influenced by historical, geographical, and biotic factors beyond pure climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Warren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calatayud et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Soberón, 2007</xref>). Hence, using fundamental rather than realized niches may also improve the accuracy of defining climatic regions. At the current pace of biological data accumulation and computational development, it is reasonable to expect that some of these limitations will soon be overcome. Meanwhile, the considerable congruence of several climatic regions across the studied groups and Köppen’s system provides confidence in their robustness. Hence, it is likely that using better data would not produce regions substantially different from those presented here.</p><p>Regardless of how generalizable the results are, the niche domains and their associated species pools and climatic regions can be used as a basis for ecological, evolutionary, and conservation studies concerning tetrapods. Some of the many questions that the results reported here (data available in source data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) can help to answer include: Are the species belonging to different niche domains similarly conserved or protected, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanson et al., 2020</xref>)? To what extent do the differences between the four classes of tetrapods reflect phylogenetic and functional differences, and are such differences to be found in other taxonomic groups? Is the adaptation to niche domains evolutionarily constrained? Do diversification, extinction, or speciation rates differ among the species associated with different domains? Moreover, combining niche domains with bioregions based on pools of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernardo-Madrid et al., 2019</xref>) or lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holt et al., 2013</xref>) can also help answer several relevant questions: Are introductions more common between bioregions with the same climate types? To what extent does the current climate govern bioregions? Do ecological and evolutionary processes differ between different bioregions with same climate types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moncrieff et al., 2015</xref>)?</p><p>In conclusion, our data-driven climate classification reveals major climatic boundaries organizing the distribution of tetrapods on Earth. Questions remain regarding the mechanism underlying the differences between groups in the climatic regions and the geographical signal. Nevertheless, these differences across groups highlight the need for classifications of climates specific to each group to study their ecology, evolution, or conservation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data</title><p>We obtained the distribution ranges of mammals and amphibians from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">IUCN, 2015</xref>, of birds from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">BirdLife, 2015</xref>, and of reptiles from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roll et al., 2017</xref>. We included only the native range of terrestrial species in the analyses in all instances. In the case of birds, we only used the breeding ranges. Moreover, since there is a higher uncertainty when determining the realized niches of narrow-ranging species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lehmann et al., 2002</xref>), we arbitrarily removed the species whose ranges were less than five grid cells of 0.5°. After this cleaning of the data, we used 3657 amphibians, 7204 reptiles, 4574 mammals, and 10,684 birds, for a total of 26,119 tetrapod species.</p><p>We approximated the species’ Grinnellian niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Soberón, 2007</xref>) with two climatic variables that represent energy and water inputs. While we could have used several other variables, we chose energy and water as they best explain climatic effects on species distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawkins et al., 2003</xref>). As surrogates for energy and water inputs, we used mean annual PET and AP, respectively. Both variables have been shown to be important factors for tetrapod species distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Currie, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tingley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gouveia et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, they have also been used in previous climate classifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thornthwaite, 1948</xref>) and are regularly used to derive other drivers of species distributions such as the UNEP aridity index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Unep and Thomas, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuller et al., 2016</xref>). We obtained PET from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trabucco and Zomer, 2009</xref> and AP from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fick and Hijmans, 2017</xref>, both at a 0.08° resolution. Finally, we obtained Köppen’s climatic regions from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kottek et al., 2006</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rubel et al., 2017</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Niche characterization</title><p>We characterized the realized climatic niche of each species using an approach similar to the one proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broennimann et al., 2012</xref>. We divided the climatic space formed by PET and AP into bins and calculated the proportion of occurrences a given species has in each climatic bin. Both the shape of the divisions and the number of divisions of each climatic axis affect the result. For instance, dividing the axis into regular intervals can destroy critical information if the climatic values more important for the species distributions are skewed toward any extreme of the distribution or if the climatic values are represented non-uniformly across the globe (as for AP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8</xref>). Similarly, the grain size to divide the climatic space may affect subsequent results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daru et al., 2020</xref>). Dividing the space into too few intervals destroys information, whereas using too many divisions can generate niche domains with only a few species. To overcome the first issue, we divided the axes into quantiles based on the distribution of climatic values across the Earth. By doing so, we obtained an almost uniformly divided PET axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8</xref>). Contrarily, the number of divisions of the AP axis was skewed toward low values, which resulted in a higher resolution over the presumably more relevant low-precipitation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8</xref>). To solve the second issue, we selected the lowest number of divisions that maximized the gain in information (see Appendix 1). The optimal number of axis divisions was 17 in all cases but amphibians, where it was 18.</p><p>Next we accounted for potential commission errors, which may affect the estimated climates a species experiences. Specifically, range maps can overestimate the area occupied by a species, which directly influences the niche characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rondinini et al., 2006</xref>). Because range maps typically represent the species’ maximum geographical extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rondinini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">La Sorte and Hawkins, 2007</xref>), extracting the climatic values that a species range covers from a well-fitting 0.08° high-resolution climatic raster can reduce commission errors at the species range’s borders. But with many pixels inside the species range, the noise from extreme and unrepresentative climatic values can increase the error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">La Sorte and Hawkins, 2007</xref>). Conversely, extracting climatic values from a coarser raster can reduce the commission errors inside a range by averaging out extreme values at the cost of increasing commission errors over the borders. To alleviate the effects of these potential errors, we first extracted the climatic values from the high-resolution rasters (0.08°). Then, we computed the average climatic values among selected raster pixels located within cells of 0.5°. In this way, we reduced the effects of commission errors both at the borders of and inside species ranges. Finally, mean climatic values may not accurately represent the cells’ climates when there is high climate variability or the values are non-normally distributed. Comparing results obtained from different cell sizes is an indirect way to asses the influence of distorted mean values. Instead, we chose to directly explore the effects of high climatic variability and non-normal distributions with non-parametric bootstrap analysis: we resampled climatic values within 0.5° cells with replacement (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Niche domains and climatic regions identification</title><p>We employed a network community detection approach to identify the niche domains and the species mainly associated with them. For each group of species, we first generated a weighted bipartite network where species and climatic bins formed the disjoint sets of nodes, and the proportion of occurrences of species in intervals of the climatic values corresponding to the climatic bins formed the weighted links. To identify the niche domains, we used the hierarchical version of the community detection algorithm known as Infomap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008</xref>). Infomap capitalizes on the minimum description length principle of information theory, which equates finding regularities and compression: the model that finds most regularities in a given set of data can compress the data the most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rissanen, 1978</xref>). In our case, modules of highly interconnected climatic bins and species form the regularities, and describing the network with an optimal set of communities corresponds to minimizing the description length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernardo-Madrid et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008</xref>). Among the many community-detection algorithms available, we used Infomap because it can find hierarchically nested communities and is known for its high performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lancichinetti and Fortunato, 2009</xref>), also for regionalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernardo-Madrid et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloomfield et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vilhena and Antonelli, 2015</xref>). We ran the algorithm 1000 times, selecting the network partition with the best quality.</p><p>To consider the uncertainty associated with both the species ranges and the community detection, we conducted a bootstrap analysis. For each species, we resampled with replacement from the distribution of climatic values within species ranges at a resolution of 0.08°. We averaged climatic values occurring within 0.5° cells and calculated the proportion of occurrences in each climatic bin. With resampled data from all species, we generated a bootstrapped network and clustered it with Infomap 1000 times. We repeated this procedure for 100 bootstrap networks and followed the community-stability approach proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calatayud et al., 2019a</xref> to calculate the niche domains’ support. For each identified domain, we calculated the proportion of bootstrap networks with a domain more similar to Jaccard index 0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calatayud et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p>With obtained niche domains, we detected the climatic regions by identifying areas across the Earth’s surface that hold the climatic conditions grouped within each niche domain. Finally, to compare climatic regions across tetrapod groups and with Köppen’s classification, we calculated the AMI. AMI measures the mutual information between two partitions, the classifications of raster pixels into climatic regions in this case, correcting for the similarity between partitions that are just due to chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vinh et al., 2010</xref>).

Large differences between the species co-occurring in the climatic and geographic spaces indicate a strong geographic signal.

Areas that host most of the species associated with a niche domain have a higher actual specificity than the projected indicates. Areas that are not, or only scarcely, colonized by these species have a lower actual specificity than the projected indicates.</p><p>Using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>, we calculated the actual specificity of a geographical raster cell <italic>q</italic>, whose corresponding climatic bin <italic>i</italic> is in domain <italic>D</italic> (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mo>∈</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>∈</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), as the ratio between the sum of link weights from bin <italic>i</italic> to species in raster cell <italic>q</italic> that belong to its associated domain and the total link weight from bin <italic>i</italic> to all species in <italic>q</italic>,<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mo largeop="true" symmetric="true">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>∈</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mo largeop="true" symmetric="true">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>∈</mml:mo><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo> <mml:mtext>for </mml:mtext><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>∈</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo> <mml:mtext>and </mml:mtext><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>∈</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>To calculate the geographical signal <italic>G</italic>, we averaged the absolute difference between the projected and actual specificity of each climatic raster cell <italic>q</italic> at 0.5° resolution,<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo largeop="true" movablelimits="false" symmetric="true">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>N</italic> is the total number of raster cells.

the number of bins</title><p>Dividing the climatic space into an optimal number of bins is critical because it can affect subsequent classifications. On the one hand, an insufficient number of bins may destroy information. For instance, in the extreme case of using only one bin, all the species will belong to the same climatic niche. On the other hand, an excess of bins may lead to niche domains with only a few specialist species, which are not suitable for a global climate classification. The optimal value is in between these extremes. Intuitively, the differences in the species’ climatic niches increase with the number of bins. Yet, when the bins are enough to capture the main differences among species’ niches, increasing the number of bins will not increase these differences. In other words, when the number of bins is sufficient to describe the main information of the system, more bins will not significantly increase the information contained in the species niches. Therefore, when the number of bins already captures the main information, the slope of the relationship between the differences in species’ niches and the number of bins becomes less pronounced.</p><p>To measure the average differences between the niches, we used the well-known Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Barnabas Daru as the Guest Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Rutz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kevin Cazelles (Reviewer #1); Serban Proches (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have seen each other's reviews as part of a post-review consultation session. Since there were no disagreements, we have decided to append their separate original reports to this decision letter. Please address the comments as completely as possible in a revised manuscript.</p><p>Since revisions are required before the work can be published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>My comments are meant to be constructive, and I hope they will be helpful as you revise your manuscript.</p><p>Overall opinion</p><p>In this manuscript, Calatayud et al. use a network-based approach to identify climatic regions based on tetrapods occurrence. With these in hand, they assess their congruence with the regions of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification (based on climate and plant distributions) and they also assess their specificity. Overall, I think that this study has a lot of merit and I truly value the work done. However, the current version of manuscript requires some work before being publishable.

The authors addressed some of my comments in the previous version of the manuscript. Thank you. However, a few other comments were not well addressed at least not entirely:</p><p>1) The issue of scale: The authors acknowledge incorporating how they have dealt with sensitivity of the analyses to the scale of measure in the Materials and methods. However, not only did I feel like my comments were not well understood, these were also not discussed in the Discussion. How do the findings vary across grain sizes or spatial extents?</p><p>For instance, the authors stated that &quot;Extracting the climatic values that a species range covers from a high-resolution climatic raster (such as 0.08°) may reduce commission errors at the species range's borders, but otherwise increases this error. Extracting the climatic values that a species range covers from a high-resolution climatic raster (such as 0.08°) may reduce commission errors at the species range's borders, but otherwise increases this error.&quot;</p><p>While this assumption may be true to some extent, however, the authors did not test this empirically.</p><p>Another example of the need to test for scale effects is how the authors stated that: &quot;To alleviate the effects of these potential errors, we first extracted the climatic values from the high-resolution rasters (0.08°). Then, we computed the average climatic values among selected raster pixels located within cells of 0.5 degrees. In this way, we reduced the effects of commission errors both at the borders of and inside species ranges. We also conducted a bootstrap significance test that takes the uncertainty of species ranges into account (see below).&quot;</p><p>In terms of grain size for instance, it is well known that significant climate variation can exist even within a 0.5 degree cell (equivalent to ~50 km) that spans mountain peaks and valleys, and where temperatures can vary over 20°C. In a case where the average of 0.08 degree cells are taken within a 0.5 degree cell, is it unlikely that the average represents the climatic conditions of the grid cell. I imagine this will also be quite different at a grid resolution of 1.0 degree, 2.0 degrees, and/or 5 degrees etc. It is not clear how this was addressed in the Materials and methods and discussed in the Discussion.</p><p>In terms of the spatial extent, will the findings still hold up if this was analyzed at a regional continental scale or local country level (and varying along the grain sizes mentioned above)? Adding a test and a discussion along these lines would be important.</p><p>2) Climatic transition zones</p><p>The authors analyzed an important issue about climate transition zones which can represent places where different climate regimes admix and potentially provide source for novel species interactions, and potentially high diversity. However, the authors miss a great opportunity to return to this aspect later in the Discussion. I was hoping for some real discussion about this where you discussed regions of milder climates. Do the transition zones correspond to these regions of milder climates, and/or what do they mean?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58397.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>My comments are meant to be constructive, and I hope they will be helpful as you revise your manuscript.</p><p>Overall opinion</p><p>In this manuscript, Calatayud et al. use a network-based approach to identify climatic regions based on tetrapods occurrence.

We added an explanation of the basis of the algorithm and our reasons for choosing it in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>“To identify the niche domains, we used the hierarchical version of the community detection algorithm known as Infomap (Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008, 2011). Infomap capitalizes on the minimum description length principle of information theory, which equates finding regularities and compression: The model that finds most regularities in a given set of data can compress the data the most (Rissanen, 1978). In our case, modules of highly interconnected climatic bins and species form the regularities, and describing the network with an optimal set of communities corresponds to minimizing the description length Bernardo-Madrid et al. (2019); Rosvall and Bergstrom (2008). Among the many community detection algorithms available, we used Infomap because it can find hierarchically nested communities and is known for its high performance (Lancichinetti and Fortunato, 2009), also for regionalizations (Bernardo-Madrid et al., 2019; Bloomfield et al., 2018; Vilhena and Antonelli, 2015).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, I don't understand where the assessment of the domain's robustness is done in the Appendix.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing out this problem.

We hope the reviewer find this justification more compelling.</p><p>“…the fact that plant species are good indicators of general climatic conditions does not necessarily imply that such conditions shape the distribution of other organisms in the same manner. For instance, given the large physiological differences between plants and animals, it is expectable that the climatic determinants of their ranges will also be different. Indeed, while diversity patterns of plant and animals are to some extent congruent, the climatic correlates of these patterns vary (Whittaker et al., 2007; Qian and Ricklefs, 2008). Hence, if climatic adaptations vary among taxa, the boundaries defining their climate types will also vary.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Impact statement</p><p>Importantly enough, I don't think that the impact statement : &quot;Similarities in climatic niches of terrestrial vertebrates indicate the Earth's climate regions, which substantially differ from previous plant-based climate classifications.&quot; is a fair depiction of the results and it is actually contradictory with, inter alia, the results presented in Figure 3 (the caption of which reads &quot;Tetrapoda groups and Köppen's climatic regions are largely congruent&quot;). Unless I have miss something.</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful for this comment. The reviewer is right; these two statements are contradictory.

The choice of these metrics comes a bit “off-the-shelf” without unpacking the structural reasons for the potential of other variables such as elevation/altitude or latitude driving tetrapod niches, all of which are key determinants for tetrapod diversity.</p></disp-quote><p>It is certainly true that other variables may turn important to define tetrapods’ niches. Indeed, we explicitly discussed this possibility at various points in the Discussion section:</p><p>“…alternative variables, such as seasonal changes in energy and precipitation (Köppen and Geiger, 1930) may also influence species inhabiting temperate regions. Including these variables might help to further separate temperate species pools across the climatic space.”</p><p>“…but other climatic variables might refine some of the least supported regions.”</p><p>Nevertheless, and in line with reviewer 2’s comments, annual precipitation and mean annual potential evapotranspiration are sufficient variables to capture water and energy aspects of species niches. These aspects are arguably the most important to understand the distribution of species in general (Hawkins et al., 2003; Currie, 1991; Tingley et al., 2009; Gouveia et al., 2014; Pie et al., 2017; Cooper et al., 2011) and, therefore, precipitation and PET are among the best variables to identify global climate regions (Thornthwaite, 1948), which is our final goal.</p><p>Finally, we believe there are reasons for not considering elevation and latitude as plausible variables in our analysis. Elevation and latitude are indeed important correlates of tetrapods diversity. Yet, it is widely accepted that they can only be correlates, but not drivers, of such diversity because these variables <italic>per se</italic> do not have direct biological meaning in most instances. Latitude and elevation are biologically indirect topo/geographical variables that can inform about variations in biologically direct environmental ones such as PET, precipitation, temperature, atmospheric pressure, and so on. The latter directly shape species niches and derived diversity patterns. Thus, while latitude and elevation may work as surrogates of climatic variables, they are not climatic variables (Körner, 2007).</p><p>Since we aim to describe climate regions, we think direct climatic variables are superior to latitude and elevation. Indeed, to our knowledge, there is no any previous study where these variables have been used or considered when delimiting climate regions and, thus, we are not totally convinced on the need of explaining their potential for our purposes.</p><p>We hope you find this arguments convincing. Otherwise we are open to further suggestions to improve our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other aspects that might be worth incorporating or at least discussing is how other regionalizations such as the recent update of Wallace's zoogeographic regions by Holt et al., 2013, fit into the climate niches identified in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this comment, which helped us to improve the discussion. Combining information from previous regionalizations based on species or lineages pools with the climate regions we proposed can definitively be a fruitful exercise. We added some sentences on the potential of such a combination in the Discussion section:</p><p>“Moreover, combining niche domains with bioregions based on pools of species (Bernardo-Madrid et al., 2019) or lineages (Holt et al., 2013) can also help answer several relevant questions: Are introductions more common between bioregions with the same climate types? To what extent does the current climate govern bioregions? Do ecological and evolutionary processes differ between different bioregions with same climate types (Moncrieff et al., 2015)?”</p><p>We did not directly compare these regionalizations with the climate regions, as this would require a battery of analyses and interpretations far beyond this study’s scope.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How can they inform conservation in the real-world?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good question. To be more conservative regarding using the climatic regions for conservation planning in the real world, we rephrased the paragraph related to it. We changed “conservation plannings” to “conservation studies” since there are direct applications of the climatic regions for such studies. We also reformulated the question related to conservation that using the climatic regions can be answered and cited a relevant study on the topic.</p><p>“…the niche domains and their associated species pools and climatic regions can be used as a basis for ecological, evolutionary and conservation studies concerning Tetrapoda. …Are the species belonging to different niche domains similarly conserved or protected or both (Hanson et al., 2020)? …”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also provide some suggestions for improvement throughout the manuscript as detailed below.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>Please remove the comparison to plants to avoid any controversy on whether or not plants capture the climate of a region than animal taxa or vice versa.

Indeed, we were very cautious when dealing with potential scales issues at all relevant points of our analyses.</p><p>First, we explained the potential commission issues related to the grain size used to characterize the species climatic niches:</p><p>“… Extracting the climatic values that a species range covers from a high resolution climatic raster (such as 0.08°) may reduce commission errors at the species range’s borders but otherwise increases this error.

However, a few other comments were not well addressed at least not entirely:</p><p>1) The issue of scale: The authors acknowledge incorporating how they have dealt with sensitivity of the analyses to the scale of measure in the Materials and methods. However, not only did I feel like my comments were not well understood, these were also not discussed in the Discussion. How do the findings vary across grain sizes or spatial extents?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for raising this issue again and for the detailed explanation. We must admit that we were surprised by your concerns about scale issues during the first revision round because thorough sensitivity analysis is at the core of our work. For example, our statistical assessments go beyond those in recent studies on related topics and data (e.g. Daru et al., 2017; Holt et al., 2013; Ficetola et al., 2017; Gardner et al., 2020). With your expanded explanation and detailed examples, we realized that we had been victims of the curse of knowledge with unclear descriptions on how we dealt with scale issues. As explained below, we clarified these points throughout the text and included several lines about scale issues in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For instance, the authors stated that &quot;Extracting the climatic values that a species range covers from a high-resolution climatic raster (such as 0.08°) may reduce commission errors at the species range's borders, but otherwise increases this error. Extracting the climatic values that a species range covers from a high-resolution climatic raster (such as 0.08°) may reduce commission errors at the species range's borders, but otherwise increases this error.&quot;</p><p>While this assumption may be true to some extent, however, the authors did not test this empirically.</p></disp-quote><p>Correct, we have not explicitly and empirically tested this argument because it aimed to alleviate uncertainties related to range maps based on most species’ theoretically expected situation. We have rewritten the paragraph to clarify this point, adding some citations to studies with similar reasoning:</p><p>“Because range maps typically represent the species’ maximum geographical extent (Rondinini et al., 2006; La Sorte and Hawkins, 2007), extracting the climatic values that a species range covers from a well-fitting 0.08° high-resolution climatic raster can reduce commission errors at the species range’s borders. But with many pixels inside the species range, the noise from extreme and unrepresentative climatic values can increase the error (La Sorte and Hawkins, 2007). Conversely, extracting climatic values from a coarser raster can reduce the commission errors inside a range by averaging out extreme values at the cost of increasing commission errors over the borders.”</p><p>Finally, we now mention this uncertainty issue in the Discussion:</p><p>“…our domains represent portions of the realized climatic niche space, which entails two sources of uncertainty. On the one hand, the estimation of realized niches depends on the data quality, scale, and treatment choices. On the other hand, the realized niche space may be influenced by historical, geographical, and biotic factors beyond pure climate (Warren et al., 2014; Calatayud et al., 2019b; Soberón, 2007). Hence, using fundamental rather than realized niches may also improve the accuracy of defining climatic regions.”</p><p>Please notice that most of the apparent issues of scale effects we are discussing are related to the estimation of realized niches. Hence, using the fundamental rather than the realized niche would be the best way to overcome them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another example of the need to test for scale effects is how the authors stated that: &quot;To alleviate the effects of these potential errors, we first extracted the climatic values from the high-resolution rasters (0.08°). Then, we computed the average climatic values among selected raster pixels located within cells of 0.5 degrees. In this way, we reduced the effects of commission errors both at the borders of and inside species ranges. We also conducted a bootstrap significance test that takes the uncertainty of species ranges into account (see below).&quot;</p><p>In terms of grain size for instance, it is well known that significant climate variation can exist even within a 0.5 degree cell (equivalent to ~50 km) that spans mountain peaks and valleys, and where temperatures can vary over 20°C. In a case where the average of 0.08 degree cells are taken within a 0.5 degree cell, is it unlikely that the average represents the climatic conditions of the grid cell. I imagine this will also be quite different at a grid resolution of 1.0 degree, 2.0 degrees, and/or 5 degrees etc. It is not clear how this was addressed in the Materials and methods and discussed in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a potential issue in the many biogeographical and macroecological studies using grid cells with the mentioned grain sizes. While averaged climatic values might not represent well the climates of such large cells, it is generally accepted that the effects of this misrepresentation mostly vanish at large scales. For example, cells in the tropics are on average warmer than cells close to the poles such that the climatic variability between cells at large scales is high enough to override the effects of the within-cell variability. But even when taking this difference into account, we agree that it is crucial to test the impact of distorted climatic means in coarse-grained grids. Using different grid resolutions and comparing the results is one way to test the robustness. To measure the effects of not only within-cell climatic variability but also non-normal distributions, instead, we used non-parametric bootstrap resampling: We resampled climatic values within cells with replacement, reclassified the data, and estimated the probability of obtaining similar climatic regions. Overall, we found high bootstrap probabilities showing that the effects of distorted climatic means from coarse-grained grids are small in our case.</p><p>We now explain this sensitivity analysis better in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“… mean climatic values may not accurately represent the cells’ climates when there is high climate variability, or the values are non-normally distributed. Comparing results obtained from different cell sizes is an indirect way to assess the influence of distorted mean values. Instead, we chose to directly explore the effects of high climatic variability and non-normal distributions with nonparametric bootstrap analysis: We resampled climatic values within 0.5<sup>◦</sup> cells with replacement (see below).”</p><p>“… we conducted a bootstrap analysis. For each species, we resampled with replacement from the distribution of climatic values within species ranges at a resolution of 0.08°. We averaged climatic values occurring within 0.5<sup>◦</sup> cells and calculated the proportion of occurrences in each climatic bin. With resampled data from all species, we generated a bootstrapped network and clustered it with Infomap 1000 times. We repeated this procedure for 100 bootstrap networks and followed the community-stability approach proposed in Calatayud et al., 2019a, to calculate the niche domains’ support.”</p><p>Finally, since this issue is also related to the estimation of realized niches, we now mention them together in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In terms of the spatial extent, will the findings still hold up if this was analyzed at a regional continental scale or local country level (and varying along the grain sizes mentioned above)? Adding a test and a discussion along these lines would be important.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that delineating climate regions at smaller extents can be of interest. However, such an analysis is beyond the scope of our manuscript’s global perspective. As explained above, the bootstrap analysis more directly assesses the issues that would motivate the analyses at different grain sizes. Taken together, and following the first revision round’s suggestions, we have mentioned this idea in the Discussion rather than adding more tests.</p><p>“…the geographical signal idea could also help unravel idiosyncratic processes occurring at smaller scales by comparing local climate regions with global or regional ones.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Climatic transition zones</p><p>The authors analyzed an important issue about climate transition zones which can represent places where different climate regimes admix and potentially provide source for novel species interactions, and potentially high diversity. However, the authors miss a great opportunity to return to this aspect later in the Discussion. I was hoping for some real discussion about this where you discussed regions of milder climates. Do the transition zones correspond to these regions of milder climates, and/or what do they mean?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this new comment as it allows us to clarify the meaning of the transition zones. We have reworded the text to explain the transition zones’ importance in our study. Specifically, we make the connection between “specificity” and “transitivity” more transparent. We believe the Results and Discussion now provide clear answers to your questions:</p><p>“Climatic conditions corresponding to diffuse transitions should present low specificity levels to the domain where they belong (Figure 1). Hence, we can consider specificity as the opposite of transitivity… As expected, lower specificity values were in general associated with the boundaries of the climatic regions (Figure 4A and Appendix 1—figure 2). Beyond boundaries, our results also revealed that harsh conditions, such as desert and continental-polar climates (E<sup>H</sup>W<sup>L</sup> and E<sup>L</sup>W<sup>L</sup>), present the highest specificity levels, regardless of the group (Figure 4A and Appendix 1—figure 2), reflecting the difficulty of colonizing these climates. Conversely, temperate regions showed the lowest levels of specificity.”</p><p>In the Discussion, we now write:</p><p>“Conversely, milder climatic conditions, especially temperate climates, showed the lowest statistical support and congruence across groups, as well as the highest transitivity. These results indicate that temperate climates are more difficult to classify (low support and congruence) due to the overlap in the climatic space of species pools with different climatic optima (high transitivity).”</p><p>Finally, we mention that:</p><p>“…the exact causes and consequences of the climatic transition zones call for</p><p>future investigation.”</p><p>We prefer to be conservative and avoid a detailed but speculative discussion about the causes and consequences of transition zones. Such claims would require an in-depth empirical evaluation of different causal factors beyond the scope of this study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
