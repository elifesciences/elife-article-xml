GnRH stimulates follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) synthesis via a G-protein-coupled receptor, GnRHR, in the pituitary gland. In mammals, GnRHR lacks a C-terminal cytosolic tail (Ctail) and does not exhibit homologous desensitization. This might be an evolutionary adaptation that enables LH surge generation and ovulation. To test this idea, we fused the chicken GnRHR Ctail to the endogenous murine GnRHR in a transgenic model. The LH surge was blunted, but not blocked in these mice. In contrast, they showed reductions in FSH production, ovarian follicle development, and fertility. Addition of the Ctail altered the nature of agonist-induced calcium signaling required for normal FSH production. The loss of the GnRHR Ctail during mammalian evolution is unlikely to have conferred a selective advantage by enabling the LH surge. The adaptive significance of this specialization remains to be determined.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gonadotropin-releasing hormone</kwd><kwd>pituitary</kwd><kwd>reproduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-123447 and PJT-252739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernard</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mexican National Counsel of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CONACYT 273513</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fiordelisio</surname><given-names>Tatiana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National University of Mexico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PAPITT IN227416</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fiordelisio</surname><given-names>Tatiana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008582</institution-id><institution>McGill University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Canadian Pacific Chair in Biotechnology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hébert</surname><given-names>Terence E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The absence of a carboxy-terminal tail in the GnRH receptor is not required for the preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge and fertility in mammals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The propagation and survival of all species depend on reproduction. In vertebrates, the process is controlled by hormones in the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. Arguably, the hypothalamic decapeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the most important brain hormone regulating reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Whitlock et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maggi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown and Roberson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conn et al., 1987</xref>). Disruption of GnRH synthesis, secretion, or action can delay or prevent puberty or cause infertility. GnRH acts via its receptor, GnRHR, in pituitary gonadotrope cells. GnRHR agonists and antagonists are used clinically in assisted reproductive technologies and to treat hormone-dependent diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maggi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huirne and Lambalk, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huerta-Reyes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Corona et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>GnRH is released in pulses from neuron terminals in the median eminence into the pituitary portal vasculature. The hormone binds GnRHR on the plasma membrane of gonadotropes, stimulating the synthesis and secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bouligand et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wolczynski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Costa, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Topaloglu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cattanach et al., 1977</xref>). LH and FSH are heterodimeric glycoproteins composed of the gonadotropin α subunit (product of the <italic>Cga</italic> gene) noncovalently linked to hormone-specific β-subunits: LHβ (<italic>Lhb</italic>) or FSHβ (<italic>Fshb</italic>), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Combarnous, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pierce and Parsons, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cahoreau et al., 2015</xref>). GnRH stimulates the expression of all three gonadotropin subunit genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thompson and Kaiser, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaiser et al., 1997</xref>) as well as its own receptor (<italic>Gnrhr</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaiser et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Loumaye and Catt, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hazum and Keinan, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clayton et al., 1980</xref>).</p><p>LH and FSH regulate gonadal function, most notably steroidogenesis and gamete maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Layman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumar et al., 1997</xref>). Gonadal sex steroids negatively feedback to the hypothalamus to control their own synthesis by inhibiting GnRH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Smith et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Smith et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pielecka-Fortuna et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, in females, in the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle in primates or in the afternoon of proestrus in the rodent estrous cycle, high estrogen levels stimulate GnRH secretion through positive feedback, generating a high amplitude, long duration surge of LH, which triggers ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Richards et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The type 1 GnRHR is a rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sealfon et al., 1997</xref>). Remarkably, in mammals, GnRHR lacks the intracellular carboxyl-tail (Ctail) that is characteristic of most GPCRs, including GnRHRs in nonmammalian vertebrates like birds, amphibians, and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blomenröhr et al., 2002</xref>). The Ctail plays important roles in GPCR function. Agonist binding to many GPCRs leads to receptor internalization and homologous desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sun and Kim, 2021</xref>). These processes are often mediated by the phosphorylation of the Ctail by G-protein receptor kinases, recruitment of adaptor proteins such as β-arrestins 1 and 2, and receptor endocytosis via a clathrin-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hilger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Magalhaes et al., 2012</xref>). Upon ligand binding, the mammalian GnRHR is not phosphorylated, does not recruit arrestins, and is internalized slowly and with poor efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vrecl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castro-Fernández and Conn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Willars et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davidson et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, the mammalian GnRHR is not subject to homologous desensitization in the conventional sense. As a result, the receptor has the potential to continue signaling during times of protracted GnRH secretion, as occurs prior to ovulation. Some have speculated, therefore, that the loss of the Ctail during evolution may have conferred an ability to the mammalian GnRHR to broker long duration, high-amplitude LH surges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davidson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Perrett and McArdle, 2013</xref>), but this was never before addressed directly in vivo. It is notable, however, that LH surges are observed in nonmammalian vertebrates with GnRHRs containing Ctails, such as birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, GnRHRs lacking Ctails have been observed in some nonmammalian vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Williams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sefideh et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To gain greater insight into the potential significance of the loss of the Ctail in the mammalian GnRHR, we generated a knockin mouse model that expresses a chimeric GnRHR in which the chicken GnRHR Ctail was fused in frame to the C-terminus of the murine GnRHR. Importantly, the addition of a chicken Ctail altered, but did not prevent LH surges. Unexpectedly, the data provide novel insight into mechanisms of GnRH-stimulated FSH synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of knockin mice expressing a chimeric murine/chicken GnRHR</title><p>Using gene targeting in embryonic stem cells, we generated knockin mice in which the endogenous exon 3 of <italic>Gnrhr</italic> was replaced by a modified exon 3 encoding the C-terminus of murine GnRHR fused in-frame with the intracellular Ctail of the chicken GnRHR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).

The data presented here challenge this idea. Addition of the chicken GnRHR Ctail to the endogenous murine GnRHR blunted but did not block the LH surge. With few exceptions, females expressing the mouse-chicken chimeric GnRHR (GnRHR-Ctail) were fertile, but with smaller litter sizes compared to WT mice. Reductions in FSH rather than perturbations of the LH surge likely explain their subfertility. The FSH impairment appears to derive from alterations in GnRH-induced calcium signaling.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Effects of the chicken Ctail on gonadotropin synthesis and secretion</title><p>Serum FSH and pituitary <italic>Fshb</italic> mRNA levels are lower in GnRHR-Ctail than WT mice. In males, this is associated with small, but significant decreases in testis mass and spermatogenesis. There is a direct relationship between Sertoli cell number and spermatogenic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Griswold, 1998</xref>). Sertoli cell number is regulated by FSH during early postnatal development in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumar et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allan et al., 2004</xref>). Though we did not quantify Sertoli cells in GnRHR-Ctail males or their FSH levels prior to weaning, it seems likely that the FSH deficiency observed in adulthood also occurs earlier in life in these animals. Indeed, depleting FSH in young but not adult mice reduces testis size and sperm counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumar et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2018</xref>). In females, reduced FSH levels are associated with decreased numbers of preovulatory follicles. Because most GnRHR-Ctail females exhibit LH surges and/or corpora lutea, it is clear that the majority could and did ovulate. Therefore, the most parsimonious explanation for the subfertility in these females is impaired follicle development secondary to FSH deficiency.</p><p>Though present, LH surges are altered in most GnRHR-Ctail females. Unfortunately, we were unable to fully characterize the nature of the changes, as we had difficulty capturing surges in these animals when sampled on presumptive proestrus. Therefore, we could not measure the dynamics (the precise time of onset, maximum amplitude, or duration) of their LH surges relative to those of WT mice. Nevertheless, with our modified sampling protocol, we did observe LH surges in GnRHR-Ctail females, which were reduced in amplitude. It is unlikely that this contributed to their subfertility, however, as there are several mouse models with reduced LH surge amplitudes that do not exhibit fertility defects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Toufaily et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herbison et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, the amplitude of the surge varies dramatically between mice within a given strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Czieselsky et al., 2016</xref> and our unpublished observations). Though we only detected LH surges in ~50% of GnRHR-Ctail mice, it is unlikely that they were truly blocked or absent in half of the animals. In the fertility trial, only one of eight animals was sterile. Similarly, in only one of six GnRHR-Ctail mice did we fail to observe corpora lutea in their ovaries. Thus, the complete absence of LH surges appears to be a rare event in these mice, most likely explained by inadequate FSH-stimulated follicle development and estrogen positive feedback. The cause of the variable (and low) penetrance of the infertility phenotype is presently unclear, but the animals were notably on a mixed genetic background.</p><p>The blunted LH surges in GnRHR-Ctail mice may derive, at least in part, from homologous receptor desensitization. The effects of adding Ctails to mammalian GnRHRs have been thoroughly investigated in vitro. In most cases, these manipulations are associated with agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation, arrestin recruitment, and receptor internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vrecl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Willars et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pawson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 1998</xref>). We similarly observed that the mouse-chicken chimeric GnRHR used here acquired the ability to recruit arrestin in response to GnRH. It is therefore likely that GnRHR-Ctail is rapidly internalized in response to agonist, but we did not assess this directly. Though arrestin recruitment to the chimera’s Ctail did not appear to explain the altered calcium signaling or retained ERK activation in HEK 293 cells, we acknowledge that multiple GPCR/arrestin conformations, including differences between the receptor core and/or Ctail, can have distinct functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cahill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baidya et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dwivedi-Agnihotri et al., 2020</xref>). Regardless, if we were able to measure the duration of LH surges in GnRHR-Ctail females, we predict that it would be shorter than in WT mice. However, as most of these mice ovulated, the amplitude and duration of these surges were clearly sufficient. We recently reported that kisspeptin-54 induces surge-like LH release in juvenile mice. Although the duration of the LH increase is shorter than natural surges, these mice still ovulate efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Owen et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, both the amplitude and duration of natural LH surges are greater than actually needed to induce ovulation in mice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Effects of the chicken Ctail on GnRH signaling</title><p>The reductions in gonadotropin production in GnRHR-Ctail mice indicate that the addition of the chicken Ctail altered GnRH signaling. In heterologous HEK 293 cells, GnRH stimulation of calcium mobilization was greatly impaired downstream of GnRHR-Ctail. This, in turn, appeared to be explained by attenuated activation of Gα<sub>q</sub> and reduced agonist stimulated inositol phosphate production. As GnRH induction of <italic>Fshb</italic> mRNA expression in homologous LβT2 cells is calcium dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lim et al., 2007</xref>), it is possible that FSH deficiency in GnRHR-Ctail mice may result from alterations in calcium signaling. In contrast, GnRH induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation is intact downstream of GnRHR-Ctail in HEK 293 cells. In gonadotropes, GnRH promotes ERK1/2 signaling via PKC, which in turn depends on diacylglycerol (DAG) more so than calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). Though GnRH induction of DAG production was attenuated downstream of GnRHR-Ctail in HEK 293 cells, it was sufficient to activate PKC-ERK1/2 signaling. As GnRH regulation of <italic>Lhb</italic> expression is ERK1/2 dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bliss et al., 2009</xref>), this may help explain how LH production was relatively unperturbed in gonad-intact GnRHR-Ctail mice.</p><p>The Gα<sub>q</sub> activation and, in particular, calcium mobilization impairments, downstream of GnRHR-Ctail in heterologous cells do not fully recapitulate changes in GnRH signaling in gonadotropes in GnRHR-Ctail mice. However, in both HEK 293 cells and gonadotropes, the GnRHR-Ctail induced a more sustained calcium profile. Gonadotropes possess L-type calcium channels, which are absent in HEK 293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stutzin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Perez-Reyes et al., 1994</xref>), though the latter do have endogenous calcium currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berjukow et al., 1996</xref>). GnRH-induced calcium oscillations in gonadotropes reflect both mobilization from ER stores and influx via voltage-dependent L-type channels. The calcium signaling (and defects therein) that we examined in HEK 293 cells is limited to mobilization from internal stores. Nevertheless, it is evident that GnRH-induced calcium oscillations also differ between gonadotropes of WT and GnRHR-Ctail mice. In WT pituitaries, we observe the previously reported heterogeneity of responses: oscillatory, biphasic, and transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Catt and Stojilković, 1989</xref>). In contrast, GnRH stimulates a more homogenous calcium response in gonadotropes of GnRHR-Ctail mice and one that is not observed in WT animals. Relative to WT, gonadotropes of GnRHR-Ctail mice show sustained calcium oscillations, which extend well after the GnRH pulse. The mechanisms underlying this sustained activity are not clear but depend to some extent on influx of calcium via L-type channels. Regardless, the changes in calcium signaling from primarily transient intracellular release of calcium to a sustained influx of extracellular calcium may contribute to the observed reductions in FSH synthesis in GnRHR-Ctail mice.</p><p>In contrast, pulsatile LH secretion, which depends upon GnRH-induced calcium mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tomić et al., 1994</xref>), appears to be intact in GnRHR-Ctail males (note that we did not measure pulsatile LH secretion in females because of the high variability between estrous cycle stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Czieselsky et al., 2016</xref>] and the estrous cycle irregularities in GnRHR-Ctail mice). This ‘normal’ LH secretion may be more apparent than real, however. Exogenous GnRH stimulates less LH secretion in male GnRHR-Ctail than WT mice, despite their equivalent pituitary LH contents. GnRH is similarly less effective in stimulating LH release in GnRHR-Ctail females, but they also show marked decreases in pituitary LH content relative to WT, precluding a definitive interpretation of the results. LH secretion is blunted in both sexes following gonadectomy and at the time of the LH surge in females. Therefore, the alterations in GnRH stimulated calcium signaling may also affect LH secretion, which is most evident when GnRH pulse frequency or amplitude is enhanced.</p><p>It is possible that the phenotypes of GnRHR-Ctail mice are explained by reduced receptor expression rather than (or in additional to) altered receptor function. Indeed, <italic>Gnrhr</italic> mRNA levels are reduced in gonad-intact GnRHR-Ctail relative WT mice. We do not know if this translates into differences in GnRHR protein expression. Unfortunately, we were unable to identify reliable antibodies for measurement of GnRHR protein in the pituitary. We also could not validate GnRHR ELISAs used by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Odle et al., 2018</xref>) (data not shown). In vitro ligand binding assays in pituitaries from the two genotypes do not provide a viable alternative means for receptor protein quantification, as <italic>Gnrhr</italic> mRNA levels decrease dramatically in cultured cells relative to in vivo and the genotype difference in <italic>Gnrhr</italic> expression does not persist in culture (data not shown). Regardless, we hypothesize that the reduced <italic>Gnrhr</italic> mRNA levels in GnRHR-Ctail mice are themselves a consequence rather than a cause of altered GnRH signaling. Not only does GnRH positively regulate the expression of its own receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Naik et al., 1985b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Naik et al., 1985a</xref>), but the WT and Ctail forms of the murine GnRHR are expressed at equivalent levels when transfected in heterologous cells. Thus, there does not appear to be any inherent difference in the stability of WT and Ctail forms of the receptor.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Evolutionary significance of the loss of the Ctail</title><p>Finally, in light of all of the results, it is tempting to speculate that the loss of the Ctail from the mammalian GnRHR may have conferred a selective advantage by augmenting G-protein coupling, leading to enhanced calcium mobilization, FSH production, folliculogenesis, and fertility. However, more recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that the loss of the Ctail may be an ancient event in jawed vertebrates, predating mammalian evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). It is unclear what advantage this may have conferred when it first emerged and why it has only been retained in mammals and a small number of other vertebrates. We are limited in what we can conclude or interpret from the one mouse model we examined here. While adding the chicken Ctail decreased FSH production, this may not have been the case if we had instead fused the <italic>Xenopus</italic> or <italic>Clarias</italic> Ctails, which do not appear to perturb GnRH signaling in vitro. Therefore, the presence of a Ctail, in and of itself, does not necessarily impair or alter G-protein coupling to the GnRHR. The specific sequence of the tail is relevant. It could be informative to reconstruct ancestral GnRHRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hochberg and Thornton, 2017</xref>) and then examine the effects of removing their Ctails on signaling. Though challenging, this may ultimately provide more, or at least parallel, insight into the potential adaptive significance of the loss of the Ctail. Regardless, the data presented here demonstrate that LH surges are possible in mammals in the presence of a GnRHR with a disruptive Ctail and suggest that FSH synthesis is dependent upon the nature of GnRH-dependent calcium signaling in gonadotropes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>GnRH (LH releasing hormone, L7134), nimodipine (66085-59-4), paraformaldehyde (PFA, 158127), bovine serum albumin fraction V (BSA, 10735078001), Triton X-100 (9002-93-1), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 472301), anti-Flag antibody (F7425; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_439687">AB_439687</ext-link>), EZview Red ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (F2426; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2616449">AB_2616449</ext-link>), and 3X FLAG Peptide (F4799) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St-Louis, MO, USA).

We used a two-step process to generate the upstream chromosomal arm (UCA) and the ‘floxed’ exon 3 regions. First, a genomic DNA fragment starting 1 kb upstream of exon 3 and terminating immediately after the stop codon in exon 3 was amplified by PCR using a 5′ primer introducing a <italic>Xma</italic>I restriction site and a <italic>loxP</italic> site, and a 3′ primer introducing a <italic>Pme</italic>I restriction site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The C terminal tail that is present in chicken GnRH receptor into the mammalian GnRH receptor causes significant reduction in the overall gonadal function.</p><p>This is a very well conducted study. The experiments are very well designed and executed, and manuscript is well written.</p><p>The authors have studied the effect of addition of a Ctail to mammalian GNRHR which responsible for agonist induced receptor internalization and desensitization caused by phosphorylation of the Ctail, and recruitment of b arrestin.</p><p>The entire process of characterization of the Ctail GnRH receptor and its responsiveness has been demonstrated quite well and the effects of the Ctail receptor on the reproduction in both female and male mice have been very clearly established. It is evident that while both gonadotropins are affected by the Ctail receptor, it is the decrease in FSH that seem to be affecting the gonadal function, particularly in the females. There is a small decrease in FSHbeta message, as well as decrease in GnRHR expression. Is there a decrease in the total gonadotropin content in the pituitaries? It is also essential to establish the GnRHR density and affinity of the receptor. However, it is understandable that GnRH binding assays are not very reproducible. It is essential that some quantification of the receptor is necessary.</p><p>There is a decrease in antral follicles and corpora lutea in Ctail animals accounting for subfertility. However, the authors have not described in detail the effects on the ovarian histology. Was there any increase in the atretic follicles? With decrease in FSH levels that may be a real possibility. The authors should stain the ovarian section for apoptotic cells.</p><p>The more interesting is the effects on testicular function that have not been documented adequately in the manuscript. There is certainly decrease in serum FSH compared to the LH levels. Although the authors have shown that there is decrease in sperm numbers, there should investigate effects on the germ cell populations by carrying out flow cytometric analysis of the testicular germ cells. Further, they should stain the testicular sections for the apoptotic cells. However, these experiments can be carried out in the future studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting study to understand the function of the C tail, normally found in the GNRH receptor of the non-mammalian vertebrates. To address this the authors have employed a variety of approaches which include generation of mice with a GNRH receptor to which bird's C tail has been fused. Using this model, a variety of parameters have been compared between wild type and animals with GNRH receptor with Bird's c tail is fused. These include fertility status, serum gonadotrpin levels, subunit mRNA levels, and more importantly LH surge levels, (as on the main function of GnRH is to induce LH surge) as well as GNRH stimulated LH levels, and GnRH stimulated calcium mobilization and GNRH stimulated DAG in heterologous cells. It was found that none of the above parameters were affected significantly. These studies permit the authors to conclude that the C terminal tail does not provide any additional advantage to the mammalian system. In addition, the authors conclude that the loss of the C tail may have been an ancient event in jawed vertebrates although it does not offer any special advantage in mammals. This I feel is something similar to the extended C terminal of hCG in humans though both normal LH and CG with additional C terminal bind to same receptor. This extension in CG beta has been attributed to frame shift in the codon. The studies reported in the paper have been carried out very well and the conclusions drawn are well supported by the results obtained. In conclusion I recommend that the manuscript can be accepted in the present form.</p><p>I recommend the manuscript can be accepted in the present form.</p></body></sub-article></article>
