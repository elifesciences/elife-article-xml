Across species, rank within social hierarchy has large effects on health and behavior. To investigate the relationship between social rank and stress susceptibility, we exposed ranked male and female mice to social and non-social stressors and manipulated social hierarchy position. We found that rank predicts same sex social stress outcomes: dominance in males and females confers resilience while subordination confers susceptibility. Pre-existing rank does not predict non-social stress outcomes in females and weakly does so in males, but rank emerging under stress conditions reveals social interaction deficits in male and female subordinates. Both history of winning and rank of cage mates affect stress susceptibility in males: rising to the top rank through high mobility confers resilience and mice that lose dominance lose stress resilience, although gaining dominance over a subordinate animal does not confer resilience. Overall, we have demonstrated a relationship between social status and stress susceptibility, particularly when taking into account individual history of winning and the overall hierarchy landscape in male and female mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>social hiearchy</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>coping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH114882</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Russo</surname><given-names>Scott J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH127820</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Russo</surname><given-names>Scott J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH104559</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Russo</surname><given-names>Scott J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CAPES-Brazil</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Visiting Researcher Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaster</surname><given-names>Manuella P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship 201811MFE-414896-231226</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>Kenny L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007027</institution-id><institution>Leon Levy Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parise</surname><given-names>Lyonna F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Socially dominant mice, unlike subordinates, are protected from displaying a common stress-associated behavioral deficit, social avoidance, following exposure to multiple kinds of chronic stress.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The formation of social hierarchies is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon having been observed across species from insects and fish to rodents, non-human primates, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonabeau et al., 1999</xref>). Position within the hierarchy can determine access to important resources like food, water, and potential mates, with dominant animals gaining preferential access. It has been hypothesized that this predetermination of resource allocation helps to reduce conflicts within the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hausfater et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Savin-Williams, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schülke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In humans, one measure of social hierarchy position is socioeconomic status (SES) which is a relative combined measure of an individual’s income, education and occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shavers, 2007</xref>). Strikingly, SES has been identified as one of the single strongest predictors of mortality and morbidity, with individuals from a low SES having increased incidence of heart disease, stroke, bronchitis, and multiple mental health disorders including major depressive disorder as well as increased incidence of psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler and Ostrove, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calixto and Anaya, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shishehbor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weissman et al., 2015</xref>). This relationship has been seen in multiple countries including those with universal healthcare and when accounting for lifestyle factors associated with SES such as smoking, diet, and physical activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groffen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marmot et al., 1991</xref>). While SES is not equivalent to animal rank—human social rank is the consequence of an interplay between multiple factors, including gender, race, education, and wealth—a similar pattern of deleterious health outcomes associated with low rank has been observed in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Backström and Winberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartolomucci et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavigelli and Caruso, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Czoty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuchs et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gruenewald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sapolsky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schuhr, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sherman and Mehta, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yodyingyuad et al., 1985</xref>). These findings have led to the proposal that differential exposure to psychosocial stress due to one’s social standing could lay the foundation for future health risks. Despite this, little is understood about the etiology driving this relationship between social status and health risks.</p><p>Primate research has identified internal and external factors mediating the relationship between rank and stress response, including the structure of the social hierarchy and how that structure is maintained as well as the availability of mitigating factors like social support in the forms of affiliation and coalition forming, and the coping behaviors of the animals themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchard et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Setchell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vandeleest et al., 2016</xref>). Recent studies in rodents probing the biology underlying the relationship between rank and stress response in mice have garnered conflicting results in the predictive ability of rank on stress susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karamihalev et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Larrieu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Šabanović et al., 2020</xref>). It is likely that similar factors identified in primates also mediate the relationship between social rank and stress response in rodents. Here, we look to characterize the relationship between social rank and stress susceptibility in mice. In particular, we sought to delineate important aspects of both hierarchy formation and maintenance as well as the effects of overall hierarchy landscape on susceptibility to both social and non-social stressors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Social hierarchy characterization in male and female mice</title><p>To assess social hierarchy rank and dynamics over time, we tested same sex tetrads in a round robin of pair-wise tube tests following 3.5 weeks of group housing to allow for initial hierarchy formation.

To do this, we subjected male and female mice from established social ranks to either social (CSDS) or non-social (CVS) stress then evaluated social interaction and coping responses. Next, we manipulated rank by forcing established subordinate or dominant animals to assume a new rank position by recombining them with novel animals with similar rankings. We find that dominant animals, both male and female, are resilient to social stress but subordinates are susceptible to social defeat stress only when it is performed with an aggressor of the same sex. We find that rank is not predictive of stress responses to non-social stressors, but the rank which forms under non-social stress conditions is. These results highlight the ability for rank to serve as a predictor for stress outcomes in a stress-specific manner. This is consistent with the proposal that the stress of social defeat is associated with loss of rank and not merely exposure to the agonistic encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larrieu and Sandi, 2018</xref>). Our findings also suggest that social rank viewed as an equivalent measure from cage to cage is likely insufficient to properly capture the predictive ability of rank; instead, both history of winning as well as the hierarchy landscape when forming rank interact to impact stress outcomes.</p><p>Previous work has revealed multiple sex specific differences in hierarchy formation. Examination of agonistic behavior in a semi-naturalistic environment reveals that male social hierarchies are steeper, more linear, and more despotic than female hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karamihalev et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Williamson et al., 2019</xref>). These results align with data indicating that male and female mice rely on extrinsic versus intrinsic characteristics, respectively, to determine rank. While female rank is highly transitive across cages, with outcomes against other mice sufficient to determine within cage rank, male rank is not. Furthermore, rigging of the tube test can form stable, alternate hierarchies in males, while not in females, suggesting that prior experience rather than intrinsic characteristics are utilized in males. Manipulation of gonadal sex was sufficient to reverse apparent strategies employed in hierarchy formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van den Berg et al., 2015</xref>). While relying on different mechanisms to form their social hierarchies, we found that males and females had similar social hierarchies following a 3+ week period of formation with no sex-specific differences in linearity, stability, and distribution of DS. These hierarchies are generally linear on a day-to-day basis but dynamic over time, mirroring prior data that employed tube test to assign rank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Varholick et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, by using DS, we are able to capture aspects of the dynamic hierarchies and weight wins to the strength of the opponent. The positive correlation between rank assigned from DS and time in warm spot underscores the ability for DS calculated across a week of hierarchy testing to separate the ranks of both male and female mice in behaviorally distinct and ethologically relevant ways.</p><p>We employed the social interaction test to define stress susceptible and resilient animals. Here, susceptibility is defined by SI ratio below 1, which means that mice avoid interaction with a social target, while resiliency is defined by SI ratio over 1, which means mice spend more time with the social target. Resilient mice display social interaction levels similar to unstressed control mice. Concern in recent years over the validity of the SI test to evaluate stress response has been raised, as the target animals employed typically resemble aggressor animals from defeat. Thus, it is unclear whether social avoidance reflects a lack of social interest or whether it reflects generalization of fear responses to a perceived aggressor. However, by employing the SI test after both social and non-social stressors, we are able to more broadly assess the role of rank in stress response.</p><p>Broadly, we observed that rank is predictive of stress response to social stress enacted by the same sex, with dominance being associated with resilience and subordination associated with susceptibility. Dominant males were resilient to CSDS while intermediate and subordinate mice showed large deficits compared to their respective unstressed controls. In females, CSDS with a male aggressor caused social deficits across ranks, while inter-female CSDS negatively affected subordinates alone. This striking difference in stress outcomes across female stress models highlights the importance of testing across stress models. To probe the role of socially formed rank as a predictor of stress response, a social stress mirroring prior experience may be the most relevant to reveal social rank-associated differences.</p><p>Coping behavior during the final day of stress correlates with SI ratio across stress types and sex, suggesting that behavioral coping during stress can predict individual stress outcomes. Dominant male mice displayed higher levels of active coping behavior by day 10 compared to subordinate males, reflecting differences in SI ratio, while no differences were seen between dominant and subordinate females following CSDS. However, coping score still correlated with SI ratio across ranks in females. This suggests that coping score most closely reflects the states of susceptibility and resilience in the SI test, as subordinate females showed increased vigilance following inter-female CSDS but did not display reduced coping behavior during their final day of defeat, and vigilance did not correlate with coping. This retention of high levels of active behaviors in response to social aggression may also be reflective of retention of a dominant position by these mice, suggesting they have not yet assumed a subordinate position to the aggressor. Taken together, these results align with prior work investigating the impact of rank on coping behavior, where a positive relationship between active coping behavior and reduced negative stress effects has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heshmati et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Differences in stress experience do not account for rank-specific difference in stress responses. Given that mice of varied ranks may have different prior experience with antagonistic behavior, observations of aggressor behavior during defeat were necessary to rule out the possibility that differences in defeat experience were driving the rank-specific stress effects. We observed no differences between ranks in agonistic behavior received by the experimental animals either in direct measures, aggressive bouts experienced, or indirect measures, wounds received during social defeat. The lack of differences across ranks is likely due to the pathological nature of the aggression displayed by the aggressors that have been selected for extremely high levels of aggression. These results indicate that the differences seen in stress responses are not due to differences in the stress experienced by ranks, but rather are likely reflecting internal differences in response to the social stress.</p><p>In males, individual history of winning impacts stress outcome, while history of winning and manipulations of social rank do not affect stress outcomes in females. In males, high mobility dominants have a strikingly higher SI ratio following social stress than low mobility dominants, suggesting that experiencing mobility may be stress protective. These results may seem unexpected given the primate literature, which has indicated that dominant animals from a stable social hierarchy are less stressed than dominant animals from an unstable social hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sapolsky, 2005</xref>). However, in our study, both high and low mobility dominant mice originated from a mix of stable and unstable cages, indicating that rank stability of dominant mice is not indicative of the overall hierarchy landscape. Furthermore, while some cages displayed periods of identical consecutive tube test results, in no cases were any social hierarchies completely stable over all 18 days of testing.</p><p>The difference between high and low mobility dominant males can be interpreted in several ways. One interpretation is that low mobility dominants were placed in a cage of relatively subordinate animals and did not need to be particularly dominant to retain their position, and therefore were indistinguishable from other ranks when measuring later social stress susceptibility. In contrast, high mobility dominants formed their rank in a highly competitive environment against other dominant animals and thus, the mice that rose to the top are especially dominant, which confers higher levels of stress resilience. Another possibility is that high mobility dominants, while successfully rising to the top of their respective hierarchies, benefited from the winner effect conferring them with biological advantages that set them up for future success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsu and Wolf, 1999</xref>). These advantages could bias dominant animals to continue to fight for a dominant position longer than less dominant animals, and thus protect them from the stress of loss of rank conferred by social defeat. These interpretations are not mutually exclusive and could be occurring in parallel.</p><p>Intriguingly, there are no differences in stress resilience between low and high mobility females across ranks. This lack of difference could be due to the reliance of females on intrinsic characteristics to determine social rank position. This is supported by the fact that the winner effect has only been weakly demonstrated in less aggressive strains of mice, unless supplemented with testosterone following a win (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuxjager et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, winning experience in females may not confer advantage when exposed to later physical aggression during social defeat. Additional work to disentangle the contributions of innate stress susceptibility versus learned resilience in both males and females remains to be completed. However, these results highlight how the history of social rank of a male mouse can be indicative of divergent stress outcomes, especially within the dominant rank. Therefore, our data highlights the need to consider hierarchy formation preceding stress exposure when interpreting the predictive abilities of rank on stress susceptibility.</p><p>The importance of accounting for the hierarchy landscape is further underscored by the lack of differences in stress susceptibility observed between recombined subordinate males or females following CSDS or CVS. SUB - DOM and SUB - SUB animals are indistinguishable in stress outcomes. This is seen in response to both CSDS, which occurred after 1 week of recombination, or CVS which occurred after 5 weeks of recombination, suggesting that giving more time to adjust to a newly dominant position would not increase a previously subordinates animal’s stress resilience. This suggests that initial predisposition for subordination confers susceptibility to stress and it is not from stress experienced while occupying the subordinate rank. This would also align with prior results which found no significant differences between tube test-ranked male C57BL/6 mice in bodyweight, locomotion, anxiety or corticosterone either as preexisting measures or those taken after establishment of hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pallé et al., 2019</xref>). It follows then that a subordinate rank position in a non-competitive environment is not associated with increased stress levels. It is only under high levels of competition, such as in the visible burrow system or frequent cage changes to escalate agonistic behavior, where subordination is stressful and subordinate animals start to show behavioral and biological consequences of stress exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanchard et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horii et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Melhorn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tamashiro et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to subordinate animals where recombination does not alter stress susceptibility, a dominant male must maintain a dominant position to retain stress resilience; DOM - SUBs are significantly more susceptible than DOM - DOMs to social stress alone. This result mirrors prior work in hamsters revealing dominance maintenance is necessary to maintain stress resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morrison et al., 2014</xref>). This effect could be due to the stress of recently losing a social hierarchy position, or because the DOM - SUB animal is inherently less dominant, and thus less resilient, than the other animal. Manipulation before CVS does not cause significant differences between DOM - DOMs and DOM - SUBs in both males and females, suggesting that resilience to social stress seen in dominants may rely on learned experiences during hierarchy formation. Separating the contributions between innate versus acquired stress resilience is a challenging issue that requires additional investigation. Clearly, a dominant animal is not always equivalent to a dominant animal from another cage and therefore accounting for the social landscape in which that dominant animal rose to and subsequently maintained their position is vital.</p><p>Our findings stand in contrast to prior work which revealed an opposite pattern of resilience by rank. Previously it has been demonstrated that the most dominant 50% of male mice are more stress susceptible to social defeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Larrieu et al., 2017</xref>), while others have shown no relationship between rank and social stress susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Šabanović et al., 2020</xref>). Closer examination of the social landscape reveals potential explanations for these differences. The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Larrieu et al., 2017</xref> were performed on a strikingly different social landscape where a majority of cages (90%) had completely stable social hierarchies across all 6 days of testing. Because these hierarchies were completely stable, animals were divided by absolute rank within cage, unlike our divisions which utilized DS calculated over the preceding week to capture aspects of the animal’s dynamic history of winning. Under completely stable social conditions, additional factors may influence both hierarchy formation and social stress responses. This has been demonstrated in humans where under stable or unstable hierarchy situations, different neural regions are engaged when viewing a superior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zink et al., 2008</xref>). The level of despotism of dominant animals and overall levels of agonistic behavior in an established hierarchy can also interact to differentially affect behaviors and hormone levels of dominant and subordinate rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Varholick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williamson et al., 2017</xref>). An additional factor that likely shapes the relationship between rank and stress susceptibility is the length of group housing prior to testing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Šabanović et al., 2020</xref> group-housed mice for 2 weeks before stress exposure, and in this case, they did not find any differences in stress susceptibility between ranks. This result in conjunction with ours importantly argues against innate resilience in dominants for males, but instead suggests there are advantages gained from both acquiring and maintaining a dominant position. However, direct comparison between this research is challenging, as they rely on both different means of testing and categorizing dominant and subordinate animals.</p><p>Environmental stress may also serve as an external factor shaping hierarchy formation or may be acting in combination with stress experience related to hierarchy mobility within the cage. In the case of our CVS data, rank derived from the week prior to stress initiation was insufficient to predict social interaction deficits. Instead, we only reveal susceptibility in both sexes when rank is calculated across the final week of stress. Therefore, it may be the case that rank position assumed under stress is due to the animal’s response to the stress experienced. Dominant animals, which have a smaller stress response to the variable stress, remain in a dominant position, whereas animals with larger stress responses drop to the bottom of the social hierarchy. This effect may take time as a single acute stressor did not alter hierarchy when measuring agonistic behavior in a social box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karamihalev et al., 2020</xref>). In a reverse manner, it may be that subordinate rank associated social avoidance following CVS is reflective of the increased stress associated with acquiring a lower social position. This is supported by the data which shows that previously susceptible animals can still achieve a dominant position within a cage of novel animals; however external environmental stress may still serve to shape the continued dynamics of an established social hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Šabanović et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, close examination of social hierarchy position across time is vital in predicting animals’ stress susceptibility.</p><p>In this study, we have demonstrated a significant role for social rank as a predictor of later stress susceptibility to both social and non-social stress in male and female mice. In both stress domains, dominant rank was associated with resilience and subordinate rank with susceptibility. Furthermore, in males we have highlighted the importance of accounting for not only an individual’s rank, but that individual’s history of winning as well as the social landscape under which rank was formed. Rank-derived stress susceptibility or resilience is likely a dynamic interplay between pre-existing disposition, learned behavioral responses, biological responses to external factors, and the overall social landscape. Further work to tease out the exact biological underpinnings of each of these elements will be crucial to fully understand the link between social rank and stress vulnerability.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57 Mouse (Male and Female)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6 J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_">IMSR_</ext-link>JAX:000664</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CD-1 (Male)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Crl:CD1(ICR)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_">IMSR_</ext-link>CRL:022</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Esr1-cre (Male)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6-Esr1<sup>tm2.1(cre)And</sup>/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_">IMSR_</ext-link>JAX:017913</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Swiss Webster (Female)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Crl:CFW(SW)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_">IMSR_</ext-link>CRL:024</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ethovision</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Noldus Information Technology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 11.0</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal housing and care</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol #: LA10-00266 to S.J.R.)

At 10 weeks of age, 3 days prior to hierarchy evaluation, mice were habituated to handling for 5 min per mouse. On the second day of habituation, cages of mice were allowed to explore the testing arena, a rat cage (26.7 cm width ×48.3 cm depth ×15.2 cm height, Allentown Inc) with a plexiglass tube (3 cm internal diameter x 30 cm length) taped to the bottom. On the final day of training, mice were trained to pass through the tube for a minimum of 5 times in each direction, followed by 20 s of arena investigation. Mice were not permitted to escape backwards out of the tube. The tube was cleaned and dried in between trials. Starting at 10 weeks every other day for 18 days mice were pitted against cagemates in a round robin design randomly ordered. For each trial, two mice were guided simultaneously to opposing ends of the tube and permitted to meet in the middle. The trial ended when one mouse backed up out of the tube ending with all four paws on the outside cage floor; this mouse was considered the trial ‘loser’ and the mouse remaining in the tube was the ‘winner’. The winning mouse was left to leave the tube forwards and not permitted to back out of the tube. If both mice attempted to leave the tube backwards the trial was ended, both mice placed back into the home cage before initiating the trial again. For stressors where mice remained group housed (CVS and female CSDS), hierarchy evaluation was continued every other day for the duration of the stressor until mice were single housed prior to behavioral testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Warm spot test</title><p>The warm spot test was adapted from the protocol as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>).

Under one corner of the cage, a waterproof heating pad was placed to locally heat the floor to 30℃. For male mice, a small plastic hut sufficient to hold a single male mouse was placed over the warm corner. For female mice, no hut was employed. Thirty min prior to trial initiation, mice were transferred from their home cage to an empty cage maintained on ice to cool down. For each trial, mice were placed in the test cage, and behavior was tracked for 20 min for males and 10 min for females by video-tape.

DS is a weighted measure based on results from paired competitions. DS was calculated from the four tube test results preceding stress start, a period spanning 8 days. This approach was chosen because all mice were included in future behavioral testing regardless of original cage hierarchy stability (defined as four consecutive days of identical tube test results.) Dominants were the top 25% of DS (DS &gt;3), subordinates were the bottom 25% (DS <underline>&lt;</underline> –3), and intermediates were the central 50% (-3&lt; DS <underline>&lt;</underline> 3). High and low mobility were defined as upwards or downwards change in hierarchy position based on position from every days’ linear tube test results. Low mobility animals were those with one or fewer changes in rank, whereas high mobility animals were those with two or greater changes in rank. Rank change was calculated over all days preceding stress initiation. Steepness was calculated over seven tube test results (spanning 2 weeks) before or after stress initiation. Steepness is the slope of the linear regression line between ordered normalized DSs. Cages of mice were randomly assigned to stress or control groups for future manipulations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Hierarchy manipulation in dyads</title><p>Male or Female C57BL/6 J mice were recombined into weight-matched dyads ( ± 0.5 grams) with an unfamiliar partner at 9 weeks of age.

These new dyads were then tested for hierarchy for 1 week before being placed into stress.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Carmen Sandi (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In some cases the stats are not appropriate, for example, why did the authors run a correlation for Figures 1E-F? With 3 groups (not individual animal data points), a 1-way ANOVA is the correct analysis. This should be fixed.</p><p>2) Although the social interaction test has been widely used to define stress vulnerability, there have also been several detractors as to its validity in the context of the CSDS model. It would be important that the authors elaborate on this point, how to overcome this critique in the Discussion section. This point is particularly relevant in the context of this study in which social hierarchy is challenged and animals have been exposed to several winning/losing experience/s.</p><p>3) In relation to the previous point, it would be important to discuss the concepts of &quot;susceptibility&quot; and &quot;resilience&quot; in the context of the current experimental design and study.</p><p>4) Finally, it would be relevant to discuss the current findings in the context of earlier proposals in the literature (PMID: 29869396) suggesting that, beyond to rank, it may be the actual consequences of winning or losing what impacts individuals' health.</p><p>5) If you have not already done so, please ensure your manuscript complies with the <italic>eLife</italic> policies for statistical reporting: https://reviewer.elifesciences.org/author-guide/full &quot;Report exact p-values wherever possible alongside the summary statistics and 95% confidence intervals. These should be reported for all key questions and not only when the p-value is less than 0.05.&quot; This includes full reporting of F values and degrees of freedom for ANOVAs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71401.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In some cases the stats are not appropriate, for example, why did the authors run a correlation for Figures 1E-F?

In one of the original publications employing the warm corner test, a similar analysis was employed looking at the relationship between rank and time spent in the warm corner (Zhou et al., 2017). While rank is categorical it is also ordinal, therefore application of a spearman regression across all individual data points is appropriate. We agree that the original visualization showing average + SEM overlaid with the regression line was difficult to interpret and have updated the graph to display individual data points. In addition, we have included a bar graph and performed a one-way ANOVA to enhance the discussion regarding the exact relationship between time spent in the warm spot and each rank.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although the social interaction test has been widely used to define stress vulnerability, there have also been several detractors as to its validity in the context of the CSDS model.

We have highlighted the importance of testing across stress models on lines 306 – 308. As well, we have underscored the necessity for evaluating aggressor behavior during the defeat on lines 338 – 341 to eliminate alternate explanations for differences in SI behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In relation to the previous point, it would be important to discuss the concepts of &quot;susceptibility&quot; and &quot;resilience&quot; in the context of the current experimental design and study.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s point, we have incorporated more direct discussion of operational definitions of susceptibility versus resilience and how they relate to our current experimental design on lines 297 – 303.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Finally, it would be relevant to discuss the current findings in the context of earlier proposals in the literature (PMID: 29869396) suggesting that, beyond to rank, it may be the actual consequences of winning or losing what impacts individuals' health.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that placing the results of this paper in the context of prior proposals in the literature, specifically the role rank loss contributes to stress of social defeat, is highly relevant.
