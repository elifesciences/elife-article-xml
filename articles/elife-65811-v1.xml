These cells form the air-blood interface and secrete surfactant, respectively, and are essential for lung maturation and function. Current protocols to derive and culture alveolar cells do not faithfully recapitulate the architecture of the distal lung, which influences cell fate patterns in vivo. Here, we report serum-free conditions that allow for growth and differentiation of mouse distal lung epithelial progenitors. We find that Collagen I promotes the differentiation of flattened, polarized AT1 cells. Using these organoids, we performed a chemical screen to investigate WNT signaling in epithelial differentiation. We identify an association between Casein Kinase activity and maintenance of an AT2 expression signature; Casein Kinase inhibition leads to an increase in AT1/progenitor cell ratio. These organoids provide a simplified model of alveolar differentiation and constitute a scalable screening platform to identify and analyze cell differentiation mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>organoids</kwd><kwd>lung alveolus</kwd><kwd>cell differentiation</kwd><kwd>lung development</kwd><kwd>tip progenitor</kwd><kwd>alveolar epithelial cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gkatzis</surname><given-names>Konstantinos</given-names></name><name><surname>Panza</surname><given-names>Paolo</given-names></name><name><surname>Peruzzo</surname><given-names>Sofia</given-names></name><name><surname>Stainier</surname><given-names>Didier YR</given-names><suffix>true</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cardio-Pulmonary Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Flexible outbreak project grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panza</surname><given-names>Paolo</given-names></name><name><surname>Stainier</surname><given-names>Didier YR</given-names><suffix>true</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 834</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stainier</surname><given-names>Didier YR</given-names><suffix>true</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Leducq Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stainier</surname><given-names>Didier YR</given-names><suffix>true</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZMOD 694455</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stainier</surname><given-names>Didier YR</given-names><suffix>true</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A serum-free organotypic culture model of mouse lung epithelial progenitors was developed and used to screen WNT modulators for regulators of epithelial differentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung alveolar progenitor cells differentiate at saccular stages (E17 in mouse, 26 weeks in human) into flattened alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells, constituting the surface for gas exchange, and secretory type 2 (AT2) cells, which prevent alveolar collapse by secreting pulmonary surfactant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Morrisey and Hogan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chao et al., 2015</xref>). Fetal distal lung progenitors are thought to be bipotent and they co-express markers of both AT1 and AT2 cells, including Podoplanin/PDPN and Advanced Glycosylation End product-specific Receptor/RAGE as well as Prosurfactant Protein C/SFTPC, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Treutlein et al., 2014</xref>). Differentiation of progenitors into AT1 and AT2 cells is regulated by multiple signals including WNT (Wingless and Int-1) and FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) from the mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Volckaert and De Langhe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2018</xref>), mechanical forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2018</xref>), epigenetic modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), and the extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In particular, WNT signaling was shown to promote the expansion of <italic>Axin2</italic>+ AT2 cells during alveologenesis and prevent their conversion to the AT1 lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frank et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, WNT activity marks lung progenitors in homeostasis and regeneration, and WNT inhibition leads to AT1 differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nabhan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zacharias et al., 2018</xref>). During mouse fetal development, β-catenin is required for the maintenance of distal lung progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ostrin et al., 2018</xref>); however, a mechanistic understanding of how WNT signaling controls AT1/AT2 cell differentiation or fate selection is currently lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aros et al., 2021</xref>). A more detailed picture of how WNT/β-catenin signaling influences early alveolar differentiation could lead to better derivation protocols for alveolar cells and reveal new ways to stimulate differentiation in the fetal lung.</p><p>3D cultures of lung- or iPSC-derived alveolar progenitor cells have been used to model respiratory cell fate specification and signaling/cell interactions (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gkatzis et al., 2018</xref>). However, these models fail to recapitulate the defined epithelial architecture of the mouse lung at canalicular and saccular stages, with HOPX<sup>+</sup> cells residing in the stalk and SOX9<sup>+</sup>/SFTPC<sup>+</sup> cells in the tip region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frank et al., 2019</xref>). Until recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vazquez‐Armendariz et al., 2020</xref>), most models have displayed a spheroid or unpatterned morphology, making it difficult to assess localized differentiation from progenitors to alveolar cells. In addition, despite the central role of AT1 cells in lung development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zepp et al., 2021</xref>), AT1 cell isolation and generation in vitro have been longstanding obstacles, and the efficiency of AT1 cell generation in vitro, or the properties of the cells obtained in these cultures, have not been analyzed in detail, limiting the relevance of these models for cell differentiation studies. These shortcomings highlight the need for an alveolar organoid model with morphological and cellular features as observed in vivo, which would accelerate the identification of differentiation-promoting factors.</p><p>To help address these questions, we developed a serum-free, rapid, and scalable distal lung progenitor organotypic culture system that recapitulates both AT1 cell differentiation and the endogenous tissue architecture of the alveolizing lung, which will facilitate mechanistic investigations of alveolar development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mouse fetal alveolar epithelial progenitors are maintained in 3D serum-free cultures</title><p>To generate alveolar organoids by self-organization of endogenous progenitors, we manually dissociated E14.5 mouse lungs and collected distal epithelial fragments.

Three main soluble growth factors have been implicated in distal lung growth and differentiation: FGF7, FGF10, and BMP4 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellusci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weaver et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Weaver et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Danopoulos et al., 2019</xref>). We tested combinations of these factors and observed that treatment with FGF7 and FGF10 led to epithelial growth and lumenization over three days without inducing hyperproliferation of residual mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). We further found that cryopreserved epithelial tips could be expanded in culture and formed organoids in FGF-supplemented medium (52% efficiency compared with 75% using freshly dissociated tissue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), thereby allowing for more experimental flexibility.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lung distal progenitor marker expression is progressively lost in 3D explant cultures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the organoid establishment procedure.

This reduction slowed down organoid expansion and promoted an increase in the number and density of epithelial branches. Morphologically, on day 1, the epithelial tips reorganized to form a closed system (cyst) and began a process of lumen expansion. On day 2, a single large lumen was observed, along with newly formed epithelial branches. By day 6, many epithelial branches had extended into the surrounding matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Although at this stage mesenchymal cells can be observed, organoid morphogenesis did not appear to depend on their prevalence. A role for interstitial cells in local matrix remodeling and/or epithelial cell proliferation or migration, however, cannot be excluded.</p><p>To determine the location and dynamics of progenitor cells in the organoid cultures, we assessed the expression of SOX9, a transcription factor restricted to the distal progenitor population in mouse and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rock et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alanis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nikolić et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frank et al., 2019</xref>), and which is required for lung epithelial differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rockich et al., 2013</xref>). SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells were prevalent in isolated structures on day 0, and SOX9 expression was maintained throughout organoid lumenization until day 2. During this process, the majority of cells in the organoids were proliferating. By day 6, the tips of newly formed epithelial branches contained fewer SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells and also fewer proliferating cells as assessed by KI67 immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These data indicate that the distal progenitor state is initially maintained in the 3D cultures.</p><p>Next, we assessed progenitor marker mRNA levels in organoids by comparing multiple culture stages with distal epithelial tips collected at E13.5, one embryonic day prior to sample collection for organoid culture. The distal epithelial markers <italic>Id2</italic>, <italic>Bmp4</italic> and <italic>Etv5</italic> displayed higher expression levels on day 0, possibly reflecting the enrichment in distal characteristics or the endogenous activation of a distal developmental program between E13 and E14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frank et al., 2019</xref>). A marker of the proximal epithelium, <italic>Sox2</italic>, showed variable expression on day 0, suggesting that a variable number of proximal epithelial cells was isolated in the different experiments. <italic>Sox2</italic> was downregulated by day 2, suggesting that FGF10-supplemented media selectively support distal epithelial progenitors, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellusci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Danopoulos et al., 2019</xref>). Although SOX2 expression could be identified in the organoid core throughout the six-day culture period, suggesting that proximal airway cells can be maintained in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>), this region did not appear to expand compared to the distal SOX9 expression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which may explain the progressive reduction in <italic>Sox2</italic> mRNA levels. Conversely, other markers of distal lung progenitors, such as <italic>Id2</italic>, <italic>Bmp4</italic>, and to a lesser extent <italic>Sox9</italic>, displayed upregulation by day 2, which may indicate expansion or conversion into distal progenitor cell identity. By day 6, all analyzed distal progenitor markers, as well as <italic>Sox2</italic>, were downregulated compared with E13.5 epithelial tips, suggesting that the distal progenitor cell identity is progressively lost during culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Since on day 6 epithelial branches appear to be patterned in the proximo-distal axis, are morphologically elongated, and have lost most proliferative capacity, similar to distal lung epithelium at late gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frank et al., 2019</xref>), we hypothesized that distal epithelial progenitors undergo differentiation in culture.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Collagen I promotes AT1 cell differentiation in culture</title><p>To assess epithelial differentiation, we performed whole-mount organoid immunostaining for SFTPC and RAGE, marking AT2 and AT1 cells, respectively.

By immunostaining, we found that SFTPC<sup>-</sup>/RAGE<sup>+</sup> cells displayed exclusive basolateral localization of RAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>) and apical localization of Podocalyxin (PODXL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), similar to observations in intact lung tissue at E19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). SFTPC<sup>-</sup>/RAGE<sup>+</sup> cells were also marked by uniform plasma membrane expression of Podoplanin/T1alpha (PDPN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Immunostaining for Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1), a marker of tight junctions, labeled intercellular adhesions at the luminal/apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that the epithelial branches form an intact cellular monolayer and display barrier function. In addition, we found that Lysosome-Associated Membrane glycoProtein 3 (LAMP3), a lysosomal marker localized to lamellar bodies in differentiated AT2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desai et al., 2014</xref>), was localized in apical secretory organelles in SFTPC<sup>+</sup> cells, indicating that these cells can differentiate into AT2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Altogether, these data show that cultured alveolar progenitors differentiate morphologically and molecularly into AT1 and AT2 cells, suggesting that fetal mouse alveolar organoids maintain the distal airway architecture found at late gestation stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frank et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Casein Kinase modulates epithelial differentiation in lung organoids</title><p>We used fetal alveolar organoids to dissect the mechanisms by which WNT signaling controls the differentiation of AT1 and AT2 cells. To this end, we performed a chemical screen of WNT modulators from days 6 to 8 in the absence of supplemented growth factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and determined the relative alveolar cell composition by immunostaining for SFTPC and RAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Belonging to this group are first-in-class WNT pathway inhibitors such as IWR-1, IWP-2, and XAV-939 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). Active WNT signaling is a feature of alveolar progenitors in homeostasis and regeneration, and blocking the WNT pathway by <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> knockout in AT2 cells was shown to induce AT1 differentiation at postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frank et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nabhan et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, an expansion of the AT1 cell population was observed in vitro after treatment of hiPSC-derived AT2 cells with XAV-939 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kanagaki et al., 2021</xref>). Differentiation of cultured adult human alveolar progenitors (TM4SF1<sup>+</sup>) also showed WNT responsiveness, with the AT1 fate induced after XAV-939 treatment. In contrast with these data, the results of our chemical screen suggest that WNT inhibition via Axin stabilization is not sufficient to alter fate selection or cell differentiation of mouse fetal distal lung progenitors in our organoid cultures. This discrepancy with previous findings could be explained in part by differences in the phenotypic outcome of pharmacological versus genetic inhibition of WNT signaling, or by distinct regulation of the WNT pathway between pre- and postnatal stages. Limitations in our screening approach and the cellular composition of the organoid cultures could have influenced the results, as follows. First, a single concentration of 10 µM was used for all tested compounds, possibly leading to false negatives. Second, the heterogeneous cell composition of the organoids, in particular a variable number of mesenchymal cells, may have contributed to some of the variability in the data. Indeed, mesenchymal cells are fundamental players throughout lung development and engage in signaling crosstalk with epithelial cells, notably through FGF and WNT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McCulley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Volckaert and De Langhe, 2015</xref>). Because of this variability in the relative cell composition of the organoids, four biological replicates were used for the screening experiments. Six compounds led to an increase in SFTPC<sup>+</sup>/RAGE<sup>+</sup> BP cells (yellow highlight), including several Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitors such as CHIR-99021, and a natural flavonoid, Wogonin. In line with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ostrin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Carvalho et al., 2019</xref>), we found that sustained WNT activity was associated with progenitor maintenance. Finally, three compounds induced a greater percentage of AT1 cells (SFTPC<sup>-</sup>/RAGE<sup>+</sup>) at the expense of bipotent progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Mechanistically, these compounds inhibit Casein Kinase (CK) 1 (IC261) and CK2 (CX-4945, DMAT), central regulators of WNT signaling and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">St-Denis and Litchfield, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cruciat, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Venerando et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Casein Kinase inhibition leads to downregulation of AT2 marker gene expression and WNT-dependent transcription</title><p>Casein Kinase (CK) acts in stem cell maintenance by phosphorylating transcriptional regulators, WNT signaling components, and cell cycle factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">St-Denis and Litchfield, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cruciat, 2014</xref>). We found that CK inhibition by IC261, CX-4945, and DMAT led to the downregulation of markers of the AT2 fate, including <italic>Sftpc</italic> and <italic>Abca3</italic>, compared with control organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that upon CK inhibition, progenitor cells lose AT2 fate potential and convert to AT1 cells. Similarly, WNT signaling activation was reduced in organoids treated with the same CK inhibitors for 6 h as assessed by measuring mRNA levels of <italic>Axin2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), a β-catenin-dependent WNT target gene. Pharmacological CK inhibition could also significantly reduce the transcriptional response to WNT/β-catenin signaling in HEK293T cells, as shown by SuperTOPFlash luciferase reporter assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that progenitor cells convert to AT1 cells by combined loss of β-catenin-dependent WNT activity and AT2 marker expression, and suggest that Casein Kinases antagonize cell differentiation by modulating WNT signaling transduction and transcriptional regulation. However, since Casein Kinases mediate a plethora of housekeeping cellular functions, determining which specific CK targets are involved in alveolar differentiation requires further investigation. Recently, CK2 has emerged as a prominent target of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung, and its overactivation was associated with increased viral transmission by cytoskeletal remodeling and formation of cell protrusions mediating virus budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouhaddou et al., 2020</xref>). Combined with our data, these recent findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection could affect lung cell fate establishment and regeneration of the alveolar compartment directly by targeting CK2 activity.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Compounds promoting AT1 cell differentiation lead to concomitant loss of AT2 marker gene expression and WNT-dependent transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) IC261, CX-4945, and DMAT treatments (48 h) lead to downregulation of AT2 cell markers.

By modulating the concentration of supplied growth factors, distal lung progenitor cells could branch and then gradually differentiate into AT1 and AT2 cells, a process very similar to alveolar development in mice. The authors also found that collagen I could significantly promote progenitor cells to differentiate into AT1 cells. Based on this culture system, the authors performed a Wnt signaling-related-drug screening and identified that casein kinases are essential for the specification of alveolar epithelial cells.

By modulating the concentration of supplied growth factors, these distal progenitor cells could branch and then gradually differentiate into AT1 and AT2 cells, a process is very similar to the alveolar development process in mice. The authors also found that collagen I could significantly promoted progenitor cells to differentiate into AT1 cells. Based on this culture system, the authors performed a Wnt signaling-related-drug screening and identified that casein kinases are essential for the specification of alveolar epithelial cells. Modeling alveolar development <italic>in vitro</italic> is very important to facilitate future studies on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of alveolar development.</p><p>1. In this culture system, the authors found that distal progenitor cells could expand and become alveolar lineage epithelial cells (bipotent cells, AT1 and AT2). Considering that distal progenitor cells at E14.5 also could also differentiate into proximal airway lineage cells, the authors should provide information on whether these cells could differentiate into <italic>Sox2</italic><sup>+</sup> proximal progenitor cells and other proximal cell types.</p><p>2. Based on their dissection method, the distal progenitor cells-derived organoids may contain mesenchymal cells or other non-epithelial cell types, which may significantly influence the proliferation and differentiation of distal progenitor epithelial cells. The authors should at least consider this possibility and discuss whether these drug-induced phenotypes are caused by modulation of mesenchymal cells or other non-epithelial cell types.</p><p>3. The electron microscopy analysis can better demonstrate the cell identity of bipotent cells, AT1 and AT2 cells in the organoids.</p><p>4. Using this culture system to perform a Wnt signaling-related drug screening experiment, the authors found that Wnt inhibitors do not affect the cell fate specification, which does not agree with previous results. The authors should provide a discussion. Further details of this drug screening experiment should be provided in the manuscript.</p><p>5. The link between Casein Kinase (CK) inhibition and Axin2 mRNA expression is not strong enough. The authors should provide more evidence to support their observed relationship between CK and Wnt signaling. Furthermore, the authors should discuss and propose the mechanisms of CK in regulating alveolar epithelial cell fate specification.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have developed an ex vivo organoid culture system using distal epithelial fragments from the mouse lung that permits investigation of studied cell type differentiation and that can be manipulated to evaluate the role of signaling pathways on the process of alveolization. The organoid cultures were established using manually dissected and dissociated distal epithelial fragments from E14.5 mouse lungs. At this point of development, pseudoglandular development is almost complete and alveolar progenitors have been specified. In this manuscript the authors have defined culture conditions under which the tissue fragments can develop in three-dimensional culture to form an epithelial structure with a lumen. Within 6 days of culture the organoids formed from the distal lung epithelial fragments are capable of forming epithelial branches and undergo cell type differentiation similar to what is observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. The observed epithelial growth and lumenization occurs in the absence of hyperproliferation of mesenchymal cells. Of interest is the observation that tissue that has been cryopreserved can also be expanded to form organoids, albeit with a reduced efficiency.</p><p>During the six day culture period, the organoids assume lung-like structures and display epithelial buds and branches. Sufficient details are provided to permit others to establish the lung organoids in their own labs. Morphological analysis of these structures demonstrates that the distal fragments are able to reorganize to form a closed lumen and expand the number of epithelial branches within an individual organoid. Throughout the culture period, the differentiation status of cells within the organoids were assayed using immunofluorescence to identify SOX9 +ve progenitor cells and differentiated alveolar Type 1 and Type 2 cells and quantitative RT-PCR to measure changes in expression levels of distal epithelial markers. Expression of SOX9 and ID2 were analyzed to identify the distal tip progenitor population. SOX9 +ve progenitors were initially observed at the tips on day 0, became widespread by day 1 and localized to discrete patches on day 2 before becoming once again restricted to the distal tips of the epithelial branches on day 6. The increased number of cells expressing SOX9 is supported by the increase in <italic>Sox9</italic> mRNA expression observed at day 2. It is not clear if the changes in expression and localization of SOX9 positive cells reflect the reorganization of cells when the distal tips are place in organoid culture, a general transient increase in cells assuming a progenitor cell phenotype or if they reflect differences in the proportion of progenitor cells in the tissue used for the organoid culture versus the E13.5 lung distal tips.</p><p>Gene expression analysis of the differentiation of alveolar cell types AT1 and AT2 in the distal epithelium organoids and show similar gene expression levels as compared to E18.5 embryonic lungs. The cells in the organoid epithelium express AT1 and AT2-specific marker proteins and are polarized with apical localization of tight and adherens junction proteins. The presence of collagen clearly promotes the differentiation of bipotential progenitors to differentiate into AT1 cells. There also appears to be an increase in AT2 positive cells but these are a much smaller proportion of the total cell population.</p><p>The effect of altering WNT signaling on cell type differentiation is determined using the organoid cultures in a chemical screen. Chemicals are categorized based on their ability to shift the proportion of bipotential progenitors versus differentiated AT1 cells or their toxicity. The effects on cell type differentiation were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. The principal findings from this study is that sustaining WNT activity promoted maintenance of the progenitor population. In contrast, compounds that inhibit Casein Kinase 1 or 2, central regulators of WNT signaling and cell cycle progression pushed differentiation of the progenitor population in the direction of AT1 cells. This was associated with an inhibition of expression of genes associated with AT2 cell fate and decreased WNT signaling, as assessed by decreased mRNA expression of the Β-catenin target gene Axin2.</p><p>In summary, this manuscript describes the development of an organoid culture method for distal lung epithelium and demonstrated its applicability for understanding the role of ECM and WNT signaling in differentiated cell types. The branching process was not examined in detail but this culture system should permit further analysis of the molecular and morphological events that underlie this process and to compare to what has been determined <italic>in vivo</italic> and perhaps identify treatments that have important implications for lung development in premature babies.</p><p>Specific points to address:</p><p>1. Expression of SOX9 and ID2 were analyzed to identify the distal tip progenitor population. SOX9 +ve progenitors were initially observed at the tips on day 0, became widespread by day 1 and localized to discrete patches on day 2 before becoming once again restricted to the distal tips of the epithelial branches on day 6. The increased number of cells expressing SOX9 is supported by the increase in <italic>Sox9</italic> expression observed by QRT-PCR at day 2. It would be helpful to further expand on this to discuss the potential implications for the transient widespread expression of SOX9. Is this an artifact of culture? Is this associated with proliferation and growth of the organoid? Or is it that the cells placed in culture have a higher percentage of SOX9 +ve cells and only those at what becomes the equivalent of the distal tip retain SOX9 expression? Did ID2 show the same expansion of expression domains before becoming restricted as suggest to the increase in Id2 expression? Does the relative decrease in mRNA expression at day 6 reflect a more limited number of SOX9 +ve cells as compared to the percentage of SOX9 +ve cells in the distal tips cells in the E13.5 population?</p><p>2. In addition to the % of bipotential, AT1 and AT2 cells in Figure 2B, the absolute numbers for the cells that were counted in each population should be included either in the text or in the figure legend. There also seems to be an increase in the percentage of AT2 cells but it is not clear if this is a significant increase.</p><p>3. The authors state that the proportion of bipotential progenitors and AT1 and AT2 cells do not change in a 30-day culture. Addition of a figure showing this would be great.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Gkatzis and colleagues have developed a method for the expansion and cell fate specification of fetal lung alveolar progenitor cells from the developing mouse lung. Their refined methods focus on a serum free approach and they find that culture in collagen I promotes the differentiation to alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells with a typical flattened morphology. They also found, through a chemical screen, that Casein Kinase was a critical component of the media to maintain alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells and when it was inhibited, the AT2 cells differentiated to AT1 cells. The authors have successfully described a simple model system that can be used to characterize mechanisms regulating cellular stemness and cell fate decisions during fetal lung development. The data also provide and increased understanding of WNT signaling pathways in the support of distal airway specification. The paper provides a new model that has potential for screening of compounds regulating alveolar development and maturation.</p><p>The conclusions of the paper are supported by the data; however, it would benefit from some functional validation, increased characterization and further evaluation and mechanistic follow through on the chemical screen.</p><p>Strengths of the manuscript</p><p>The manuscript presents solid data evaluating the growth conditions essential to stimulate fetal organoid budding and branching elongation that maps nicely to E18.5 of fetal mouse development. They show good images of AT1 and AT2 cell differentiation and evidence of more primitive bipotent progenitors expressing both RAGE and SFTPC. To confirm maturity, nice apical and basolateral localization of alveolar cell markers including podoplanin, LAMP3, RAGE and ZO1 in differentiated AT1 cells. The authors demonstrate the utility of the model by performing a chemical screen of WNT modulators identifying compounds that increase the bipotent progenitors and compounds that increase AT1 cell specification.</p><p>Major points to consider:</p><p>It is unclear whether by day 6 of ex vivo growth the organoids stop growing and have the branches stopped elongating. If they are still growing, would it not be expected to still observe all the progenitor markers at the tips of the branches? It would be interesting to know what is restricting further growth of the branches and whetehr the progenitor cells are exhausted.</p><p>Only a couple of the markers used for characterization are discussed. While the majority of these genes follow a pattern similar to E18.5, it is notable that ATF3 is considerably higher in day 6 organoids than in E18.5 cells. As ATF3 is a transcription factor that can regulate many downstream pathways, such as epithelial mesenchymal transition and is itself regulated by oxidative stress – is its upregulation a result of artificial stress induced by the organoid system and is its higher expression impacting extended function of these cells?</p><p>There is a lack of data on the functional properties of the cells at Day 6. If these are to be considered mature, it would interesting to know whether they are capable of surfactant secretion, are lamellar bodies present.</p><p>It is interesting that the authors chose to evaluate the wnt modulators on day 6 of their experiment and not before if they were expecting them to impact mature cell formation, which they preciously describe as being at Day 6 with no information on day 8 cultures provided. Some additional rationale as to the choice of timepoint would be helpful to the flow of the paper.</p><p>While the strengths of the manuscript suggest the value of the model in understanding alveolar development, there are a number of points that should be considered in strengthening the impact and robustness of the manuscript.</p><p>In addition to the suggestions above the authors should consider the following additional data:</p><p>The characterization of the WNT signaling is restricted to a small amount of RNA analysis. Can the cultures be pushed toward mature AT2 cells? Can the cells grown in the presence of the modulators that increase the number of BP cells then re differentiate when the modulator is removed? Are the BP cells more proliferative? This would be interesting to study in the context of modulating an airways ability of proliferate and repair.</p><p>How important are the mesenchymal cells in this differentiation? At the beginning of the manuscript the authors state that the tips have mesenchymal and epithelial cells – what happened to the mesenchymal cells and how are they distributed in the day 6 organoids?</p><p>It would be nice to see some colocalization of the markers in panel 1E in addition to the SOX9 staining shown in Panel D.</p><p>As for Figure 1 it would be nice to see more extensive co-staining of the cells such as HTII-280 and SFTPC colocalization of AT2 cells and AQP5, RAGE, HOPX on the AT1 cells.

We refer to work showing that Axin2-positive AT2 cells differentiate into AT1 cells upon blockade of WNT transduction postnatally (Frank et al., 2016; Nabhan et al., 2018). We also mention similar work using hiPSC-derived AT2 cells and cultured human alveolar progenitors (Kanagaki et al., 2020 and Zacharias et al., 2018, respectively). To our knowledge, published data refer to postnatal alveolar progenitors, while the mechanisms underlying fetal progenitor differentiation remain to a large extent uncharacterized. Since Axin2positive AT2 progenitors have been described only in the context of postnatal alveologenesis, the fetal mechanisms of alveolar differentiation may differ at least in part. In addition to differences between the biological systems used in previous publications and our work, potential methodological limitations could also be part of the reasons for the observed discrepancy. We provide a discussion of these issues in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Data/discussion on potential Sox2 differentiation</p></disp-quote><p>To assess whether cells in the organoids can express markers of proximal differentiation, we performed immunostaining for SOX2 and other proximal epithelial cell markers (FOXJ1, KRT5) at several stages of organoid development (Figure 1-Figure suppl. 1C, D). At all stages analyzed, we observed SOX2 expression specifically in the central portion of the organoids (core). In contrast to the distal SOX9<sup>+</sup> region, the proximal <italic>Sox2</italic><sup>+</sup> domain did not appear to expand during culture. Although variable, FOXJ1 and KRT5 expression could be observed in sparse cells in the organoid core on day 6. This result suggests that, to some extent, proximal airway cells can be maintained or differentiate in our organoid model. We do not exclude the possibility that proximal airway cell composition could be enriched under different culture conditions. However, proximal cell marker expression was invariably observed to be localized in the central portion of the organoids, suggesting that distal epithelial branches provide a specific model for alveolar cell differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1. In this culture system, the authors found that distal progenitor cells could expand and become alveolar lineage epithelial cells (bipotent cells, AT1 and AT2).

The treatment of explanted lung tissue with FGF7 and FGF10 promotes distal epithelial expansion (Bellusci et al., 1997), as observed in our model.

This analysis revealed a proximal domain of SOX<italic>2</italic> expression in the organoid core, persisting at all culture stages analyzed (i.e., at least until day 6). In addition, FOXJ1 and KRT5, markers of ciliated and basal cells, respectively, were also variably expressed in sparse cells in the central portion of the organoids on day 6. Since proximal epithelial cells can be maintained and perhaps to some degree differentiate in our organoid model, we mention this point in the revised manuscript (page 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Based on their dissection method, the distal progenitor cells-derived organoids may contain mesenchymal cells or other non-epithelial cell types, which may significantly influence the proliferation and differentiation of distal progenitor epithelial cells. The authors should at least consider this possibility and discuss whether these drug-induced phenotypes are caused by modulation of mesenchymal cells or other non-epithelial cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for bringing up this important point. We now mention in the revised manuscript that mesenchymal cells are associated with the organoid epithelial branches and that a role for these cells in the morphogenesis of our model cannot be excluded. However, since we did not observe any clear correlation between the prevalence of mesenchymal cells and the phenotypes in our screen, we suggest that mesenchymal cells do not contribute significantly to the observed phenotypes. In addition, the reduction in WNT-dependent transcription observed in organoids (Figure 4B) could be recapitulated in cultured epithelial cells (HEK293T) expressing a WNT-reporter construct (Figure 4C), consistent with the model that the drugs are acting at least on epithelial cells (Figure 1-Figure suppl. 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Although WNT activity has been shown to control cell fate establishment in the context of postnatal development, we point out that the role of WNT signaling in alveolar differentiation at fetal stages is incompletely understood and may differ with what happens at postnatal stages.

The link between Casein Kinase (CK) inhibition and Axin2 mRNA expression is not strong enough.

To support our model that CK inhibition can lead to inhibition of β-catenin-dependent transcription, we performed SuperTOPflash-based luciferase assays and determined the effect of CK inhibitor compounds in HEK293T cells (Figure 4C).

The transient widespread increase in SOX9 expression during the first days of culture closely follows cell proliferation dynamics in the organoids.

Relating to this, the lack of impact of many of the wnt signaling regulators on the differentiation is interesting based on current data in the field. Unfortunately, the impact of the wnt screening is still hard to interpret as there is a lack of validation of the compounds on multiple biological and experimental replicates.</p><p>There is also no proof that the inhibitors, at the concentrations used for the screening, were optimal or actively inhibiting wnt signaling in this particular assay (a western to show the level of inhibition would be supportive). The rationale for the different CK2 inhibitors not having the same impact, is described as being due to their potential differences in potency/target affinity – why not perform a dose response curve?</p><p>Finally, the screen is presented as the % of alveolar cells, this population is likely vastly different in each organoid at the start of the assay and thus may have a significant impact on the outcomes. This should at least be described in some of the limitations of the assay and may lead to some regulators being overlooked.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their helpful suggestions. In the revised manuscript, we have included a paragraph outlining the limitations of our screen. We agree that the variable mesenchymal cell content in the organoids and the single concentration used for the compounds could have influenced the results. And while the screened compounds were not pre-validated, the screen was performed in four biological replicates (different pregnant dams), which allowed us to identify compounds that significantly shifted the differentiation of alveolar progenitors. This important information is included in the legend of Figure 3 and we have now also included it in the Methods section, under Chemical screen. We further show that while the relative composition of alveolar cells at the start of the assay (day 6) is variable, it is not vastly different among different replicates (Figure 2B).</p></body></sub-article></article>
