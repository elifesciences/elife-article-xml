repair proteins accumulate at damaged sites, forming membrane-less sub-compartments or foci. Here we explored the physical nature of these foci, using single molecule microscopy in living cells. Rad52, the functional homolog of BRCA2 in yeast, accumulates at DSB sites and diffuses ~6 times faster within repair foci than the focus itself, exhibiting confined motion. The Rad52 confinement radius coincides with the focus size: foci resulting from 2 DSBs are twice larger in volume that the ones induced by a unique DSB and the Rad52 confinement radius scales accordingly. In contrast, molecules of the single strand binding protein Rfa1 follow anomalous diffusion similar to the focus itself or damaged chromatin. We conclude that while most Rfa1 molecules are bound to the ssDNA, Rad52 molecules are free to explore the entire focus reflecting the existence of a liquid droplet around damaged DNA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nuclear sub-compartments</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>single molecule microscopy</kwd><kwd>single particle

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cell nucleus contains membrane-less sub-compartments inside which specific proteins are more concentrated than elsewhere in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meldi and Brickner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miné-Hattab and Taddei, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rippe, 2007</xref>). Such regions of high local protein concentration, called ‘foci’, are hypothesized to help proteins coordinate and collectively perform their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabianca et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chubb and Bickmore, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hübner and Spector, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miné-Hattab and Taddei, 2019</xref>). The formation of these foci at the right place in the nucleus and within a well-defined time window is essential for the functioning of the cell. Here, we focus on repair sub-compartments formed in response to double strand breaks (DBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lisby et al., 2004</xref>). DNA repair is an essential process for preserving genome integrity. Among the different kinds of DNA damages, DSBs are the most genotoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iliakis et al., 2004</xref>). Failure to repair such lesions leads to genomic instability or cell death, and mutations in DNA repair genes lead to diseases such as Werner, Bloom and other cancer predisposition syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rassool, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thorslund and West, 2007</xref>). Eukaryotic organisms use mainly two major mechanisms to repair DSBs: non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wyman and Kanaar, 2006</xref>). HR occurs primarily in S/G2 phase cells and uses an undamaged homologous DNA sequence as a template for copying the missing information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lisby and Rothstein, 2015</xref>). The biochemistry and the genetics of DSB repair by HR have been extensively investigated <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaniecki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miné et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lisby and Rothstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sánchez et al., 2017</xref>). HR is orchestrated by mega-Dalton multi-protein complexes of 500 to 2000 proteins that colocalize with the DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lisby et al., 2001</xref>). In living cells, these protein centers can be visualized as fluorescent foci using tagged HR proteins. Among the proteins occupying these centers are the enzymes of the highly conserved Rad52 epistasis group, including Rad51, Rad52 and Rad54 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Symington et al., 2014</xref>). When a DSB forms, the 5’ ends of the DNA break are resected by nucleases to yield 3’ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails that are rapidly coated by the RPA complex. The Rad52 protein, the functional analog of human BRCA2 in yeast, then stimulates the removal of RPA and recruits the recombinase Rad51 to the ssDNA tail on which it polymerizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Symington et al., 2014</xref>). The Rad51-ssDNA complex, called a nucleo-filament, has the capacity to search and identify a region of homology and to promote strand invasion of the homologous duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bordelet and Dubrana, 2019</xref>). Once homology is found, the invading strand primes DNA synthesis of the homologous template, ultimately restoring genetic information disrupted at the DSB. How repair foci and more generally membrane-less sub-compartments are formed, maintained and disassembled at time scales relevant for their biological function remains unknown. Several models are intensively debated in the literature to understand the nature of membrane-less sub-compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erdel and Rippe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McSwiggen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miné-Hattab and Taddei, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Strom et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, recent works proposed that repair proteins exhibit some properties of liquid-like droplets such as Rad52 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oshidari et al., 2020</xref>) and 53BP1 in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altmeyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kilic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pessina et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present new insights into the dynamics and the nature of repair foci using Single Particle Tracking (SPT) and Photo Activable Localization Microscopy (PALM) in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cells. Watching how proteins move and interact within a living cell is crucial for better understanding their biological mechanisms. SPT is a powerful technique that makes these observations possible by taking ‘live’ recordings of individual molecules in a cell at high temporal and spatial resolution (50 Hz, 30 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dolgin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Manley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oswald et al., 2014</xref>). Based on the way individual molecules move <italic>in vivo</italic>, SPT allows for (i) sorting proteins into subpopulations characterized by their apparent diffusion coefficients, (ii) quantifying their motion, (iii) estimating residence times in specific regions of the nucleus, (iv) and testing the existence of a potential attracting or repelling molecules within distances smaller than the diffraction limit. To complement this approach, PALM allows for measuring the position of molecules at 30 nm resolution to establish density maps of the molecules of interest.</p><p>Using SPT and PALM in the presence or absence of DSB, we have assessed the dynamics, for the first time at the single molecule level, of 2 repair proteins: Rad52 and the ssDNA-binding protein Rfa1, a subunit of the RPA complex. We find that inside repair foci, Rad52 molecules are surprisingly mobile: they diffuse an order of magnitude faster than Rfa1, the whole focus itself, and damaged DNA, indicating that most of the Rad52 molecules are not bound to damaged DNA. Instead, Rad52 explores the volume of the focus through confined motion and exhibits a sharp change of diffusion coefficient when entering or escaping foci. In response to multiple DSBs, Rad52 form larger foci than the ones formed upon a single DSB. When foci size is larger, the confinement radius of individual Rad52 inside the focus scales with focus size. Our statistical analysis of single molecule trajectories reveals the existence of an attractive potential maintaining Rad52 molecules within a focus. Altogether, our results using single molecule microscopy indicate that while Rfa1 diffuses similarly to damaged DNA, Rad52 motion exhibits physical properties consistent with diffusion within a Liquid-Liquid Phase Separated droplet.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rad52 exhibits two diffusive behaviors in the absence of DSB</title><p>We first investigated the mobility of individual Rad52 molecules <italic>in vivo</italic> in the absence of DNA damage by SPT. To image Rad52 without altering its endogenous expression level, we generated haploid cells expressing the endogenous <italic>Rad52</italic> fused to Halo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and Materials and methods). Prior to visualization on a PALM microscope (see Materials and methods), exponentially growing cells were incubated with fluorescent and fluorogenic JF646, a dye emitting light only once bound to Halo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>). We used a low concentration of JF646 allowing for the observation of individual molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ranjan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Rad52-Halo bound to JF646 (Rad52-Halo/JF646) were visualized at 20 ms time intervals (50 Hz) in 2-dimensions during 1000 frames until no signal was visible. A typical individual cell is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. After detection and tracking (see Materials and methods), we calculated density and displacement maps of Rad52 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since Rad52 tracking is performed in 2-dimensions, molecules are observable as long as they stay within the focal plan representing a z-section of about 400 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). After examining 23 cells in S/G2 phase of the cell cycle as assessed by the presence and the size of a bud on the transmission image, we obtained an exponentially decreasing distribution of trace lengths with an average trajectory length of 7.5 frames, the longest trace reaching 65 frames (1.3 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Since the half-life time of JF646 is 2.1 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), the short trace lengths observed here are due to molecules moving out of the observable z-section and not the photo bleaching of the JF646 dyes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rad52 diffusion observed at the single molecule level, in the absence of DNA damage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Design of the experiment.

This method allows us to test whether Rad52 molecules exhibit a single diffusive regime across the nucleus or if they exist in several subpopulations characterized by distinct diffusion coefficients (see Materials and methods). By fitting the displacement histogram with 1- and 2-population fits, we observed that Rad52 exhibits two distinct diffusive behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>, p=0.0001 and p=0.67, two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (KS) test for the 1- and 2-population fits respectively, see Materials and methods). We obtained D<sub>1/S-G2</sub> = 1.16 ± 0.08 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, D<sub>2/S-G2</sub> = 0.28 ± 0.02 μm<sup>2</sup>/s as the best-fit diffusion coefficients (see Materials and methods), with the fraction of slow molecules being 0.62 ± 0.04. To accurately estimate the apparent diffusion coefficient of Rad52, we then calculated the displacement histograms for several frame rates (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 ms time intervals) and fitted these experimental histograms with a 2-population fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). When mobility is observed at larger time intervals, mean square displacement per unit time decreases, which stems from the confinement of molecules within the nuclear space (we checked that confined diffusion explained the trend better than anomalous diffusion, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Fitting these points with a straight line, we extracted the diffusion coefficients to be D<sub>1/S-G2</sub> = 1.16 ± 0.06 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, D<sub>2/S-G2</sub> = 0.29 ± 0.02 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, which agree with the measurements obtained from the displacement histogram with Δt = 20 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the origin of the two Rad52 populations observed in the nucleus in the absence of DBS, we first asked whether the existence of a slower population of Rad52 is due to its transient association with RPA present at replication forks during S phase. To test this hypothesis, we measured Rad52 mobility in G1 cells. We obtained similar displacement histograms and diffusion coefficients in G1 as in S/G2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I, J and K</xref>, D<sub>1,G1</sub> = 1.08 ± 0.07 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, D<sub>2,G1</sub> = 0.27 ± 0.03 μm<sup>2</sup>/s) with similar proportions. Thus, Rad52 diffusion does not change significantly during the cell cycle and the two observed Rad52 populations cannot be simply explained by free <italic>versus</italic> Rad52 molecules transiently associated with the replication fork. We then examined if the two observed populations could correspond to the monomeric and multimeric forms of Rad52 observed <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saotome et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shinohara et al., 1998</xref>). We calculated the predicted diffusion coefficient of Rad52 monomers and multimers using the Stokes-Einstein equation (see Materials and methods). For that, we first estimated the dynamic viscosity inside yeast nuclei by measuring the mobility of free NLS-Halo/JF646 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). We found a diffusion coefficient of D<sub>freeHalo-NLS</sub> = 1.90 ± 0.06 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, consistent with previous studies by FRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larson et al., 2011</xref>). From this measurement, we extracted a dynamic viscosity in the yeast nucleus of 0.122 ± 0.004 Pa.s.

Only the 3-population fit is not rejected. In addition, it allows for recovering the same two populations previously observed in the absence of DSB, but supplemented by a third slow population (with diffusivity D<sub>3</sub>). The value of D<sub>3</sub> obtained in this way is overestimated because of detection noise (for diffusion coefficients D &lt; 0.1 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, we use mean square displacement analysis allowing us to subtract the noise, see Methods and below). A quick inspection of the spatial distribution of step sizes in the nuclear space indicates that the slowest population is found in the zone where Rad52 molecules are dense, that is within the repair focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, displacement map). Using a density threshold to separate the trajectories located within the focus from the rest of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, left), we then calculated the displacement histograms of the corresponding trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, right).

To accurately estimate the diffusion coefficient of Rad52 inside the focus accounting for detection noise, and also to measure the nature of Rad52 motion, we used mean squared displacement (MSD) analysis (see Methods).

Among the first 2 categories of traces, 70% cross a focus boundary at least once during the 20 s movie, while 30% stay inside foci, indicating that Rad52 foci are in constant exchange with the rest of the nucleus. As a comparison, only 33% of Rfa1 molecules cross a focus boundary.

To test whether Rad52 molecules change their diffusive behavior when entering or escaping repair foci, we calculated the displacement histograms of these traces, distinguishing portions inside and outside foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, dotted red and dotted blue traces respectively). We observed that Rad52 molecules change diffusive behavior sharply when crossing the focus boundary. Molecules crossing into foci (category 2) diffuse similarly to molecules staying inside foci, as long as they are in the focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>); when crossing the boundary outward, they start diffusing like molecules outside of foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

In the latter case, different foci merge together giving rise to a larger focus where Rad52 molecules explore the entire space; thus the radius of confinement should scale with the focus size. In the former case, Rad52 molecule should have the same confinement radius as in the situation of single DSB if the clustered foci remain sufficiently distant. If the two foci are sufficiently close for Rad52 molecules to ‘jump’ from a focus to another one, we expect to observe bimodal trajectories, exhibiting confined diffusion in the first focus, followed by one or several larger steps and confined diffusion in a second focus. Since the average residence time inside a focus induced by 1 DSB is 240 ms (12 frames) and traces are often longer than that inside foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), such traces should be easily observable if present. Here, we found that upon 1 DSB, Rad52 diffuse inside foci with smaller confinement radius (124 ± 3 nm) compared to foci induced by 2 DSBs (156 ± 3 nm), supporting the second view where foci fuse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Importantly, this confinement radius found by SPT is very close to the mean size of Rad52 foci previously obtained by live PALM. The correlation between focus size and confinement radius indicates that Rad52 is able to explore the entire focus space. To have a visual representation of Rad52 exploration inside foci, we overlaid a reconstruction of a focus with one of the longest Rad52 trajectories contained inside that focus. The reconstruction of the whole focus is obtained by taking all the detections inside it, except the ones belonging to the overlaid trajectory. These detections are represented by a blurred spot using a Gaussian smoothing kernel around each detection. Two typical foci are shown in this representation: a focus formed in response to a single DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, left panel) <italic>versus</italic> a focus induced by 2 DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, right panel). This representation clearly shows that Rad52 explores the focus and that its confinement radius scales with the focus size. In addition, using this representation, we never observe bimodal trajectories, allowing us to rule out clustered but non-merged foci.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Rad52 shows attractive motion around the focus</title><p>Next, we wanted to estimate whether there was a region of attraction for the molecules of Rad52 inside the focus. For each cell, we considered a set of traces, of which a subset was defined to be inside the focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We quantified the radial movement of molecules relative to the center of the focus in terms of the change in the distance to that center between two subsequent time steps, which we denote Δr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). To obtain this measure we needed to estimate the position of the center of the focus. Since we observed that the focus itself was diffusing ~6 times more slowly than the Rad52 molecules, we approximated the focus as the average particle position in each analyzed trace (see Methods). Concentrating on molecules close to the boundary, we identified a region of attraction with an average movement of molecules towards the center of the focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Rad52 shows attractive motion around the focus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative cell, with traces outside the focus (black) and inside the focus (blue).

The mean radial movement, outside the focus but close to its boundary, has negative values, which is consistent with an attractive force towards the center of the focus. This does not mean that this potential attracts molecules to the center of the focus, but it hinders the escape from the focus region. Inspired by the observation that molecules are attracted to the center of the focus, we computed the difference in the free energy. Using the estimated fraction of molecules belonging to the slow diffusion population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we extracted a change in the Gibbs free energy difference U<sub>0</sub> between the inside of the focus and the surroundings.

Following DSB, HR proteins relocalize from a diffuse nuclear distribution to a sub-nuclear focus at the DNA damaged site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lisby et al., 2004</xref>).

These two populations were observed both in G1 and S phase suggesting that the slower population does not correspond to transient binding of Rad52 at replication forks. Assuming Brownian diffusion, a diffusion coefficient of 1.15 μm<sup>2</sup>/s implies that Rad52 can go across a yeast nucleus in as little as 700 ms. Moreover, tracking free Halo-NLS, we estimate the dynamic viscosity inside yeast nuclei to 0.1 Pa.s, compared to 10<sup>−3</sup> Pa.s for water at 20°C, 0.013 P.s in Hela cells nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liang et al., 2009</xref>) and 6 Pa.s for honey.

These viscosities are respectively 8 to 20 times higher than the nucleus viscosity estimated before damage (ν<sub>yeast nucleus</sub> = 0.122 ± 0.004 Pa.s).

Although human nuclei are ~25 times less viscous than yeast, the viscosity inside repair foci appears similar in yeast and humans.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Different dynamics for Rad52 and Rfa1 within repair foci</title><p>Comparing the dynamics of Rad52 with the single strand binding protein Rfa1, we observed a very different behavior in response to a single DSB. Inside foci, individual Rfa1 molecules move ~6 times slower than Rad52 molecules. Furthermore, individual molecules of Rfa1 and Rad52 exhibit a different type of motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Rfa1 molecules inside foci follow anomalous diffusion with an anomalous exponent (α<sub>Rfa1</sub> = 0.56 ± 0.05) consistent with the Rouse model, a behavior similar to the focus itself (α<sub>focus</sub>0.51 ± 0.05) or to damaged chromatin when imaged at the same frequency (50 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miné-Hattab et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, individual Rad52 molecules are highly mobile and exhibit confined motion inside the focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such differences in diffusion coefficient and type of motion between Rad52 and Rfa1 indicate that most of Rad52 molecules are not bound to the Rfa1-coated ssDNA inside foci, in agreement with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Essers et al., 2002</xref>). In addition to high internal dynamics, Rad52 exhibits a higher rate of exchange than Rfa1with the surrounding nucleoplasm. The rapid exchange rate observed here for individual Rad52 molecules is in good agreement with FLIP (fluorescence loss in photobleaching) experiments in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oshidari et al., 2020</xref>). Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) experiments in mammalian cells also revealed different exchange rates and residence times depending on the repair proteins: Rad54 and Rad52 inside foci rapidly exchange with the rest of the nucleus while Rad51 stays immobilized at the site of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Essers et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The intermediate mobility of Rad52 molecules inside foci (faster than chromatin or Rfa1 molecules but slower than free molecules) could in principle be explained by rapid equilibrium binding of Rad52 to its target, which would effectively decrease its mobility. However, in that case we should be able to capture with SPT some intervals of time where Rad52 is bound. During these bound intervals, Rad52 should diffuse slowly with the same diffusion coefficient as Rfa1 and such events would lead to a strongly multi-modal distribution of displacements inside foci. We do not observe such multi-modal distribution inside foci in our data at 20 ms resolution. To be consistent with the smoothness of our displacement histogram, the binding specificity would have to be very weak, K<sub>d</sub> = 1/(4 D a τ) ≫ 2 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg and Purcell, 1977</xref>), where a ≈ 10 nm is the linear size of the binding site, D ≈ 1 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, and τ is the mean bound time ≪ 20 ms, conservatively assuming diffusion-limited binding. This dissociation constant is 20 to 400 times larger than the values observed <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saotome et al., 2018</xref>). Assuming a realistic range of binding dissociation constants K<sub>d</sub> ~1 nM to 1 μM, the mean bound time of τ = 1/(K<sub>d</sub> D a) would range between 40 ms to 40 s. These values are all larger than our resolution and should be easily observable if we had a binding and free diffusion inside foci. Altogether, our data and analysis rather suggest that most Rad52 freely diffuse inside foci and only a very small fraction of Rad52 molecules are bound to the Rfa1-coated ssDNA. Since with single molecule experiments, we can follow only a fraction of the molecules, it is very unlikely to catch the few bound molecules in our assay.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Rad52, but not Rfa1, behavior inside foci is consistent with LLPS model</title><p>Different models have been proposed to account for the formation of membrane-less compartments. The simplest model is the binding model where molecules bind and unbind their target sites (i.e. ssDNA for Rfa1). In this case, the local concentration of proteins reflects the number of binding sites, the amount of proteins available and their affinity for their binding sites, without phase separation. If the binding sites are present on chromatin or DNA, these binding sites can be close to each other increasing their local density. In a second scenario, some binding proteins can form bridges between different chromatin loci by creating loops or by stabilizing interactions between distant loci along the chromatin fiber. These interactions can be driven by interactions between chromatin binding proteins or chromatin components. In this model, referred to as ‘Bridging’ Model, or Polymer Polymer Phase Separation (PPPS) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erdel and Rippe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miné-Hattab and Taddei, 2019</xref>), the existence of sub-compartments relies on both the binding and bridging properties of these proteins to chromatin. A third scenario is the Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) Model, also referred to as ‘Droplet Model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). Unlike the binding and the PPPS models, in LLPS, proteins self-organize into liquid-like droplets that grow around a nucleation site allowing certain molecules to become concentrated while excluding others. In this framework, one should distinguish proteins able to initiate a liquid phase separation on their own (scaffold proteins) from proteins concentrating and diffusing freely within this droplet without being responsible for its formation (client proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banani et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite a large literature in the field, many <italic>in vivo</italic> tests commonly used to probe the nature of sub-compartments are extremely phenomenological and insufficient to rule out other possible mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McSwiggen et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miné-Hattab and Taddei, 2019</xref>). In addition, most of the optical methods used to discriminate models are at the limit of the diffraction and suffer from severe artefacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McSwiggen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miné-Hattab and Taddei, 2019</xref>). Overall, there is a lack of solid experimental criteria to confirm one model <italic>versus</italic> another in living cells, in particular at the microscopic level.</p><p>Our results reveal that Rad52, but not Rfa1 motion shares several properties of LLPS models which are conserved from haploid to diploid cells:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>First, in the LLPS model, even in the presence of a nucleation core, the large majority of proteins are not bound to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erdel and Rippe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miné-Hattab and Taddei, 2019</xref>). Consistent with the LLPS model, Rad52 molecules inside foci exhibit high mobility compared to the focus itself, and the statistics of confined diffusion with a confinement radius of the same size as the whole focus. In contrast with Rad52, the motion of Rfa1 molecules, which coat ssDNA, have similar diffusion coefficient and type of motion as the focus.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Second, LLPS are characterized by a change of motion upon entering or escaping the sub-compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McSwiggen et al., 2019a</xref>). Here, we observed a sharp change in the diffusion coefficient of Rad52 molecules crossing foci boundary.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Third, in the LLPS model, it is energetically more favorable for molecules to stay inside the sub-compartment than to leave because of the presence of an energetic potential maintaining the sub-compartment. Here, we observed the existence of an attractive potential maintaining Rad52 molecules inside the focus even if molecules are not physically bound to a polymer substrate. However, given the noise and the variable size of foci, we cannot currently describe the shape of the potential.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fourth, an important hallmark of LLPS is their ability to fuse, two droplets for radius R leading to a bigger droplet of doubled volume. Fusion of repair foci has been previously observed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oshidari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Waterman et al., 2019</xref>) and in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kilic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pessina et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schrank et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sollazzo et al., 2018</xref>) by tracking repair foci at larger time scales (several minutes). Here, using live PALM, we further show that foci resulting from 2 DSBs are 1.99 ± 0.2 larger in volume than those formed by a single DSB (156 ± 3 nm <italic>versus</italic> 124 ± 3 nm respectively), and present similar Rad52 densities. Moreover, focus sizes measured by PALM agree with the confinement radius of individual Rad52 molecules inside foci, showing the ability of Rad52 to explore the whole sub-compartment. Thus, our results indicate that upon 2 DSBs, Rad52 foci do not merely cluster, but form a focus of size consistent with the fusion of two foci inside which molecules explore the entire larger sub-compartment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fifth, at the macroscopic level, aliphatic alcohol hexanediol, a component proposed as a tool to differentiate liquid-like from solid-like assemblies, partially dissolves Rad52 foci and P-bodies while Rfa1 foci remains as abundant. Of note, Rad52 foci as well as P-bodies (Edc3 foci) are not visible after fixation (see Materials and methods), whereas Rfa1 foci resist to the same fixation treatment, suggesting that paraformaldehyde might not be able to fix LLPS.</p></list-item></list><p>Other predictions of the LLPS <italic>versus</italic> PPPS properties have been proposed in the literature, in particular when over-expressing a protein able to form a nuclear sub-compartment. In a simple LLPS model where a sub-compartment is formed by a single species, increasing protein amounts should increase the focus size while concentrations remain the same inside foci and in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erdel and Rippe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miné-Hattab and Taddei, 2019</xref>). When a LLPS is formed but the observed molecule is not the main species driving the LLPS (referred as a ‘client’ of a LLPS), the concentration inside foci and in the background increases linearly with over-expression of the observed molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we found that upon different levels of Rad52 over-expression, the background concentration increases as predicted for a ‘client’ (see Appendix 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1- figure 1</xref>) suggesting that Rad52 might not be the main driving molecule responsible for the LLPS formed at the damaged site. This is in agreement with the observation that several DSBs coalesce and dissociate independently of Rad52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Waterman et al., 2019</xref>). However, a recent study pointed out that LLPS composed by multiple proteins with heterotypic multicomponent interactions do not exhibit a fixed saturation concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Riback et al., 2020</xref>). Since sub-compartments are formed by a complex mixture of proteins, it is possible that the formation of a LLPS is not driven by a single species defined as a driver, but rather by the combination of several interacting proteins.</p><p>Recent studies across different model systems proposed that repair foci are LLPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altmeyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kilic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oshidari et al., 2020</xref>). In human cells, it has been suggested that DSB-induced transcriptional promoters drive RNA synthesis and stimulate phase separation of repair proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pessina et al., 2019</xref>). As mentioned in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McSwiggen et al., 2019b</xref>, some of the criteria used to define a LLPS are at the limit of the optical resolution or are not sufficient to distinguish between a LLPS and a PPPS. For example, sub-nuclear compartments can phase separate by PPPS and collapse of such foci is sometimes wrongly interpreted as a fusion of liquid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erdel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McSwiggen et al., 2019a</xref>). Here, by quantifying the physical properties of Rad52 foci at the single molecule level, our study confirms that Rad52 diffusion is consistent with a LLPS at damaged sites, although Rad52 might not be the main driver of droplet formation.</p><p>Finally, we found that SUMOylation modulates the physical nature of Rad52 foci. First, the mobility of SUMOylated Rad52 molecules inside foci remains confined but becomes significantly slower than wild type Rad52 (D<sub>Rad52-Sumo, inside</sub> = 0.009 ± 0.002 μm<sup>2</sup>/s compared to D<sub>Rad52 inside</sub> = 0.032 ± 0.006 μm<sup>2</sup>/s). Second, SUMOylated Rad52 foci are 3.4 times smaller in volume but exhibit similar intensity than wild type foci, indicating that they are denser. We propose that when all Rad52 molecules are SUMOylated, Rad52 foci transition to a gel-like sub-compartment where most of the molecules are still free to explore the whole focus but much slower than in wild type cells. Since SUMOylated Rad52 foci are smaller, it is possible that the formation of LLPS around damage sites is a mechanism to increase the pull of molecules at the DSB.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Working model for Rad52 foci</title><p>Summing up all our observations, we propose the following model. In response to a DSB, Rad52 diffusion is not altered in the nucleus, thus Rad52 molecules likely do not exhibit a strong collective or directive motion toward the damaged DNA site. They rather arrive by simple diffusion at the DSB where they bind ssDNA coated by the RPA complex. The focus is then formed by a small seed of Rad52 molecules bound to RPA coated ssDNA, around which a large cloud of Rad52 rapidly diffuse exploring the whole focus. Similar to LLPS, Rad52 foci are dense but surprisingly dynamic: Rad52 molecules inside foci are ~6 times more mobile than ssDNA-binding proteins Rfa1 and exhibit permanent exchange with the rest of the nucleus. When escaping foci, Rad52 molecules change their diffusion behavior outside foci, suggesting that their diffusive behavior is defined by its environment. Rad52 molecules are retained inside the focus by a potential. The existence of such attractive potential supports a model where DNA is dispensable to maintain the phase separation once a given saturating concentration of multivalent binder molecules is reached. Overall, our results at the single molecule level reveal that Rad52 foci exhibit many features of LLPS at the microscopic level, consistent with recent studies using macroscopic criteria both in yeast and in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altmeyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kilic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oshidari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pessina et al., 2019</xref>). Our results provide a quantitative measurement of Rad52 behavior once the focus is formed and future studies will be necessary to investigate Rad52 foci formation.</p><p>In the future, single molecule microscopy combined with genetics will be a powerful method to shed light on the role of mutants affecting diffusion, residence time, focus size and the type of motion. In particular, further studies in different genetic backgrounds might reveal which exact mechanisms drive the formation and the physical nature of Rad52 foci. More generally, applying single molecule microscopy to other biological processes may reveal that nuclear sub-compartments with very similar aspects and sharing some macroscopic features of LLPS are in fact formed by other alternative mechanisms. For example, silencing sub-compartments resemble Rad52 foci: they fuse and disassemble in specific metabolic conditions. However, single molecule microscopy reveals that Sir3 proteins diffuse very differently than Rad52 (our unpublished results) and do not behave as expected in a LLPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miné-Hattab and Taddei, 2019</xref>). In human cells, Herpes Simplex Virus appears to share many properties commonly attributed to LLPS, but SPT measurements have recently shown that they are formed through a distinct compartmentalization mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McSwiggen et al., 2019b</xref>). Similarly, although several studies proposed that heterochromatin sub-compartments are LLPS, recent results question a simple LLPS mechanism and are consistent with a collapsed chromatin-globule model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erdel et al., 2020</xref>). As the list of proteins that can undergo phase separation is growing in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mészáros et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">You et al., 2020</xref>), it will be essential to confirm the nature of sub-compartments using <italic>in vivo</italic> single molecule approaches. As we obtain higher-resolution biophysical insight, what appear to be droplets at first glance might in fact follow more complex models. Therefore it is becoming necessary to define solid criteria and observables at the microscopic level to distinguish between different models and to develop alternative models of membrane-less sub-compartments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All strains used in this work are isogenic to RAD5+ W303 derivatives (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain constructions</title><p>Strain harboring Rad52-mMaple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McEvoy et al., 2012</xref>) or Rad52-Halo are constructed using crisper-Cas9 technic: the fusion is made at the Rad52 N-terminus with a 48 bases linker (<named-content content-type="sequence">CGTACGCTGCAGGTCGACGGAGCAGGTGCTGGTGCTGGTGCTGGAGCA</named-content>) or a 15 bases linker (<named-content content-type="sequence">AGTGGAGGCGGAGGT</named-content>), respectively.

We counted the number of detected data points, as a function of the size of the time window using time windows of ts = 5–100 ms. We found the number of detected data points decayed exponentially for all diffusion coefficients, but the magnitude of the decay rate grew as a function of the real diffusion coefficient. Therefore we took all of the computed decay rates, and fitted them to a power law, giving us an expression for the rate at which the number of observed molecules decays as a function of the time window and the true diffusion coefficient. We do not know the total number of particles in each population and we cannot determine this relation directly. We use this empirical scaling of the relation between the two populations.</p><p>In the same manner, we estimated (2) how the diffusion coefficients were affected. We measured the MSD and found that the diffusion coefficient obtained from this measure decayed as a function of the true diffusion coefficient. We directly calculated the diffusion coefficient from the maximum likelihood, and measured the gradient in the increase of the diffusion coefficient, assuming the considered time window is constant. By doing this we could fit the gradient and determine the expected diffusion coefficient.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Estimation of radial motion</title><p>We used data cropped to movement inside the focus to estimate radial motion. We used all traces longer than 30 points and estimated the center of the focus by calculating their mean value for each trace in the x-direction and y-direction.

We grouped data points from all traces and compared the statistics with a random walk with no attraction but with a similar diffusion coefficient (dashed lines <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, E</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Live PALM</title><p>For live PALM experiments, we used strains harboring Rad52-mMaple as well as 1 or 2 I-<italic>Sce</italic>I cut-sites inducible under galactose.

the nucleoplasm for different levels of Rad52 over-expression. We built two haploid strains expressing Rad52 under the ADH or TEF1 promoters (5 and 12 times over-expression respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hocher et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, a single I-<italic>Sce</italic>I cut site allows the induction of a single DSB under the galactose promoter. Cells were grown at 25°C due to a slight growth defect of cells overexpressing Rad52. A single DSB was induced for 2 hr; during the last hour of induction, cells were incubated with JF646 dyes at 50 nM, a concentration 10 times higher than the one used for single molecule tracking. Such concentration allows the observation of the entire Rad52 focus as a single spot.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript by Miné-Hattab and colleagues, the authors use single-molecule imaging approaches to investigate local dynamics of Rad52 foci at DSBs in budding yeast, which is an important area of investigation. They show that the dynamics of Rad52 molecules inside foci are consistent with protein movement within LLPS domains, while Rfa1 dynamics are not. Their data also provide supporting evidence to previous observations that repair sites cluster within the nuclei, and suggest that clustered foci behave as larger phase separated structures. While the idea that Rad52 and other repair proteins form phase separated domains is not novel, this study presents higher resolution data in support of this model. The reviewers generally agree that the study is interesting and well conducted, but the conceptual advancement is limited and a significant revision is needed for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Specifically, more convincing experiments demonstrating that the observed Rad52 dynamics reflect LLPS are required. Evidence that the dynamics are relevant for DNA repair and genome stability should also be provided. Additionally, the study should be better integrated with previous studies, statistical analyses need to be more rigorous/better presented, and a revisions of the text should include a clearer separation between observations and speculations.</p><p>The following is a summary of the main points brought up by the reviewers, including after consulting with each other.</p><p>Experimental revisions:</p><p>1) Additional data need to be provided to draw conclusions about whether or not the authors' observations are reflective of phase separation. Specifically, additional mobility studies in conditions that disrupt LLPS (chemical treatments and mutations) are needed, both for the individual protein and for the foci.</p><p>2) Regarding the possible categories of traces evaluated, one category is not included in the study. The surface tension that defines LLPS-dependent bodies is known to both help maintain focus integrity and partly counter LLPS body fusions. So if the foci represent true phase-separated bodies, have the authors then observed traces where Rad52 molecules interact with yet fail to enter the larger Rad52 foci?</p><p>3) How is it possible to distinguish a cluster of binding sites from liquid-liquid phase separation? In the absence of breaks, there are two Rad52 diffusion populations (D=1.2 and 0.3 um2/s), which the authors attribute to monomers and multimers. They don't verify these multimers by alternative approaches (say number and brightness analysis), but it seems like a reasonable possibility. After a break, a third component – slower than the previous two – becomes evident. This slow population coincides with the break. In the vicinity of the break, there is now only 1 component diffusion (D=0.03 um2/s). Also, the motion is now more confined, but not absolutely so. Also, Rad52 diffuses faster than Rfa1, which is bound to ssDNA. At this point, there is no data to distinguish between two possibilities: slow diffusion *or* diffusion + binding. Except, if it were diffusion + binding, one might perhaps expect to still see the free diffusion component.</p><p>The authors then turn to diffusion at the boundary (Figure 5), which I agree can be a more informative measure. Here, they see changes in the diffusion estimator for trajectories which cross the boundary, using displacement which they argue is more robust for slow diffusion. The problem is that the “boundary” is determined by the very thing they are trying to measure, not some independent marker of the compartment. In other words, Rad52 defines the compartment, unless I missed something fundamental in the experimental design. Ideally, the way such an experiment would be done to test the hypothesis that Rad52 is forming a LLPS compartment is to look at the diffusion of an inert tracer as it comes in and out of the compartment. As designed, I frankly do not see how the observation of different diffusivities in and out of the compartment distinguishes between a cluster of binding sites and an LLPS. If you accept that DNA-binding is in no way biasing the kinetics, then the authors' interpretation seems like the most sensible one. But the fact that Rad52 is involved in DNA repair makes that a hard assumption to swallow.</p><p>Furthermore, I'm not sure I entirely grasp the significance of Figure 6. Since Rad52 can easily escape one focus and enter another, regardless of whether it is a cluster of binding sites or a phase, I don't see how the radius of confinement measurement distinguishes between these two alternatives. The observation that the foci are 2x larger in diploids but at similar density is compelling, although recent data from the Brangwynne lab point out that conserved density need not be the case (PMID: 32405004).</p><p>4) In the syntax of this paper, Rad52 is a client in the LLPS, leaving the question of the scaffold unaddressed. After all, the Rad52 focus ultimately disappears, meaning that something caused this phase to be dispersed. So is RPA the scaffold? It might be possible to address both this point and point #3 knowing what is responsible for forming the LLPS in the first place.</p><p>Along the same lines, how do the authors reconcile previous findings indicating that recombinant DNA repair proteins phase separate in vitro with their claim that &quot;Rad52 acts as a client of the LLPS but does not drive its formation&quot;?</p><p>5) What is the evidence that the biophysical properties observed are of direct relevance to DNA repair? For example, is the mobility of Rad52 within the repair focus important for repair? Is the difference in diffusion kinetics within and outside of the repair focus important for genome stability? What could the authors do to alter that diffusion profile and what would be the consequence on repair? Also, addressing this point implies the need to use a more physiologically relevant system with repairable DSBs, and not the irreparable DSB system used here.</p><p>One should easily compare wild-type Rad52 to known Rad52 mutants (that partly or fully abrogate function) to see if there is any correlation between intra-focus mobility profiles and repair. In other words, experiments along these lines may indicate whether a particular intra-focus mobility profile consistently correlates with repair, while this profile is absent in non-functional mutants, or a particular type of mutant. These experiments should be very feasible.</p><p>6) Can the authors visualize the fusion of the Rad52 foci/DSBs in live cells within their experimental systems?</p><p>7) The statistical significance of most presented data is either lacking or unclear. This needs to be carefully addressed. Providing additional data files may also help the authors strengthen their findings.</p><p>Text revisions:</p><p>– Several statements made are not supported by the data and without clearly stating that the statements represent speculations. E.g. longer tail is due to Rad52 molecules diffusing slowly inside the focus; observing the 2 populations also in G1 does not necessarily mean that the 2 populations in S/G2 do not reflect replication forks at all. The authors need to carefully revise their claims/statements and consider alternative explanations. Also, the writing is often unclear or confusing and the authors should consider substantially revising it to clarify their claims, clearly indicate speculations that are not supported by the data, and make the text as accessible as possible to non-specialists.</p><p>– How was the cell cycle stage determined? This should be better explained.</p><p>– Figure 1—figure supplement 1 data appear to show the existence of a partial loss of Rad52 function in the Rad52-Halo cells. This should be clearly stated in the Results and consequent limitations/caveats discussed. Also, please clarify whether Figure 1—figure supplement 1 shows the viability of Rad52-Halo cells in the presence or absence of JF646.</p><p>– The authors present no direct evidence for an &quot;attractive potential&quot; that drives molecules towards the centre of the focus. For example, what if the “attractive potential” is simply the focus' boundary surface tension creating a barrier against which some of the molecules inside the focus bounce back towards the centre of the focus?</p><p>– The authors state that &quot;Here, we found that upon different levels of Rad52 over-expression, the background concentration increases (Appendix 1—figure 1) suggesting that Rad52 might not be the driving molecule responsible for the LLPS formed at the damaged site.&quot; The logical transition here is unclear.</p><p>– It is difficult to judge the novelty of this work, as key papers that showed similar conclusions or datasets are not cited. Without direct comparison with other data sets, it is difficult to see exactly where this paper goes beyond published studies.</p><p>Here are a few key examples:</p><p>a) In the last year the Haber lab published a very similar study in Plos Genetics (Waterman et al., 2019). Although they tracked Ddc2 and Rad51, they also looked at the behavior of separate foci and this paper is not even cited. The data should be compared at the very least.</p><p>b) The characteristics of 53BP1 foci have been extensively studied by many labs including those of Altmeyer, Scherthan, DeLange and others, with very similar findings as Miné-Hattab reports for Rad52 (for example, Kilic et al., 2019; Sollazzo et al., 2018, as well as the single molecule work of the lab of Eric Greene). Moreover both rad52 and PCNA foci were studied by Essers et al. (Kanaar and Vermeulen) MCB 2005. 25(21): 9350-9359 and EMBO J. 2002 Apr 15. Comparisons with these studies needs to be made.</p><p>c) A number of earlier studies followed Rad52 foci in budding yeast on induced double strand breaks (even using the I-Sce1-cut system used here) that are not taken into consideration. The diffusion coefficients presented here have to be compared with these earlier studies and differences should be resolved by comparing techniques and conditions of imaging. For instance, Dion et al., 2012).</p><p>– It is unclear if the “absence of DNA damage” condition discussed in the first section of the Results is the non-induced version of the system described in the second section of the Results. Also regarding these sections, it seems that the “absence of DNA damage” control conditions were not conducted as part of the same experiments with the I-SceI DSB.</p><p>– Figure 2C is a little underwhelming. I would like to see one data panel in the main text with the cumulative distribution +/- DSB.</p><p>– &quot;in the case of diffusion coefficients D&lt;0.1 μm2/s, we use mean square displacement analysis allowing us to substrate the noise.&quot; Subtract the noise.</p><p>– One technical point. The fluorescence lifetime of a freely diffusing fluorophore (reported half-life of JF646 is 2.1 sec) is not the same as if it is bound to a protein; in the latter context the fluorophore would diffuse more slowly in the illumination path and be subjected to more rapid photobleaching, making 2.1 sec an overestimation of the half-life/underestimation of the decay rate. At a frame interval of 20ms, photobleaching may be a competitive rate for the disappearance of signal and I am not sure the lack of applying photobleaching correction or saying that the short tracks are not affected by that rate is properly justified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60577.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experimental revisions:</p><p>1) Additional data need to be provided to draw conclusions about whether or not the authors' observations are reflective of phase separation.

In the new version of the manuscript, we now provide additional data in conditions that disrupt LLPS, for both Rad52 and Rfa1 foci. We used aliphatic alcohol hexanediol (1.6-hexanediol), a component proposed in the literature as a tool to differentiate between liquid-like and solid-like assemblies in living cells (Kroschwald et al., 2017, Strom et al., 2017, McSwiggen et al., 2019, Oshidari, 2020). In budding yeast, it has been shown that 1.6-hexanediol dissolves dynamic, liquid-like assemblies, such as P bodies, whereas solid-like assemblies, such as protein aggregates and cytoskeletal assemblies, are largely resistant to hexanediol (Kroschwald et al., 2017). We observed a clear difference between Rad52 and Rfa1 foci: following the induction of a single DSB, Rad52 foci were significantly less abundant in cells treated with hexanediol (8 % against 22 %) consistently with a recent report from the Meckhail laboratory (Oshidari et al., 2020), while Rfa1 foci remains stable. These results are presented and discussed in the revised manuscript (see Figure 4F and G and Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>In addition, we also tested the effect of 1.6-hexanediol at the single molecule level: we measured the mobility of individual Rad52 molecules (Rad52-Halo/JF646) following DSB induction and hexanediol treatment using the conditions in which the number of Rad52 foci is significantly decreased. However, comparing the histogram of Rad52 displacements in the nucleus with and without 30 minutes of hexanediol treatment, we did not observe any significant change in Rad52 mobility neither in the nucleoplasm nor in the few cells still harboring a Rad52 focus (2-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test, p=0.995).</p><p>Finally, we also found that Rad52 foci are destabilized after fixation (10 minutes with 4% paraformaldehyde), as well as P bodies (Edc3 foci) described in the literature for their LLPS properties. However, Rfa1 foci resist to the same fixation treatment, suggesting that paraformaldehyde might not be able to fix LLPS (see Figure 4F and G and Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding the possible categories of traces evaluated, one category is not included in the study. The surface tension that defines LLPS-dependent bodies is known to both help maintain focus integrity and partly counter LLPS body fusions. So if the foci represent true phase-separated bodies, have the authors then observed traces where Rad52 molecules interact with yet fail to enter the larger Rad52 foci?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and something we have investigated heavily, but this is something that is not possible for two reasons. First, the focus is diffusing as well, and therefore in order to find a specific trace at the boundary of the focus, one would need to know the exact position of the center of the focus, which due to movements can be shifted during the time steps considered. Secondly, and most importantly, the noise level in the experimental observations are of the order 25 nm, and since the estimated radius of the focus is around 100 nm, it is impossible to show if one particular trace has been repelled at the surface in the time between two successive observations. However statistically we have grouped observations based on their relative change in radial distance to the centre of the focus (this is shown in Figure 7). Here we have tried to measure exactly the presence of these events, but data-points of traces just outside the focus, are quite scarce and not something we have been able to draw any conclusions about.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How is it possible to distinguish a cluster of binding sites from liquid-liquid phase separation? In the absence of breaks, there are two Rad52 diffusion populations (D=1.2 and 0.3 um2/s), which the authors attribute to monomers and multimers. They don't verify these multimers by alternative approaches (say number and brightness analysis), but it seems like a reasonable possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>The principle of single molecule microscopy is to observe one molecule at a time, this molecule being bound to a single dye. In this study, we used flurogenic JF646 dyes (dye emitting light only once bound to Halo) that are not photo-activable. To reach the single molecule regime (as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2), we use an extremely low concentration of JF646 allowing us to obtain 0, 1 or maximum 2 detections per nucleus in the same frame. Thus, only a small fraction of Rad52-Halo molecules are bound to a JF646 dye and in case of multimer, the JF dye binds only 1 molecule of a multimer.</p><p>Thus, we cannot observe a difference in brightness: all detections have the same intensity regardless of whether they are monomeric or part of bigger multimeric complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>After a break, a third component – slower than the previous two – becomes evident. This slow population coincides with the break. In the vicinity of the break, there is now only 1 component diffusion (D=0.03 um2/s). Also, the motion is now more confined, but not absolutely so. Also, Rad52 diffuses faster than Rfa1, which is bound to ssDNA. At this point, there is no data to distinguish between two possibilities: slow diffusion *or* diffusion + binding. Except, if it were diffusion + binding, one might perhaps expect to still see the free diffusion component.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that in principle, our observations could be consistent with both hypotheses of “slow diffusion” or “diffusion + binding”. However, in the second case, we would expect to capture with SPT some intervals of time where Rad52 is bound. During these bound intervals, Rad52 should be immobile or diffuse slowly with the same coefficient as Rfa1. This would lead to a strongly multi-modal distribution of displacements inside foci, corresponding to 3 populations of freely-diffusing, bound, and mixed states (intervals in which the particle may bind or unbind). We do not observe such multi-modal behavior at our resolution of 20 ms intervals. This does not rule out “diffusion + binding”, but it puts hard constraints on the rates of binding and unbinding, which must be much faster than 20ms to explain the smoothness of the displacement histogram.</p><p>We can try to quantify this by making the conservative assumption that binding is diffusion limited, with diffusivity D = 1 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, and a linear binding size a = 10 nm. In that case the binding rate of individual molecules to a given target is k<sub>on</sub> = 4Da (Berg and Purcell, 1977). Assuming a realistic range of binding dissociation constants K<sub>d</sub> ~ 1nM to 1μM and using the relation K<sub>d</sub> = k<sub>off</sub> / k<sub>on</sub>, this implies a mean bound time of 1/k<sub>off</sub> = 1/K<sub>d</sub>/k<sub>on</sub> ~ 40 ms to 40 s, values which are all larger than our resolution. In fact, to explain the smoothness of our displacement histogram, the binding specificity would have to be very weak, Kd &gt;&gt; 2 μM, which is far above values observed in vivo.</p><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, we now discuss this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors then turn to diffusion at the boundary (Figure 5), which I agree can be a more informative measure. Here, they see changes in the diffusion estimator for trajectories which cross the boundary, using displacement which they argue is more robust for slow diffusion.

If you accept that DNA-binding is in no way biasing the kinetics, then the authors' interpretation seems like the most sensible one. But the fact that Rad52 is involved in DNA repair makes that a hard assumption to swallow.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this remark because it is an important point to clarify. A repair focus is defined by a high concentration of repair proteins at a site of DNA damage. In our experiments, we first detect all the Rad52 molecules in our videos, and calculate a density map showing the number of Rad52 neighbours inside a sphere of 50 nm in radius (Figure 1B and 2B, third panels). At this stage of the analysis, the tracking is not performed yet: we simply localize molecules and we have no information yet on Rad52 mobility. The focus is then determined by a density threshold as it corresponds to the region in the nucleus where repair proteins are highly concentrated. The program calculated the coordinates of a polygon, which defines the focus boundaries. Then, we realized the tracking step to connect Rad52 detections and draw a displacement map (Figure 2B, forth panel): the traces inside a focus are obtained by overlying the polygon on the displacement map. Thus, in this method, the determination of the focus is independent of Rad52 mobility. We then found that inside foci, Rad52 mobility is slower, and that traces crossing the focus boundary sharply change mobility as they come in and out the sub-compartment. We now clarify the method (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><p>To estimate the mobility of Rad52 molecules within foci, we also used a second method to identify the traces inside foci: since no trace longer than 70 time-points were found in the absence of DSB, we selected traces longer than 70 time-points and define these ones as the ones belonging to the focus. Both methods give similar distribution of step sizes and fitting the probability density function leads to the similar diffusion coefficient, as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><p>We agree that looking at the diffusion of an inert tracer as it comes in and out of the compartment would be interesting. However, we have not found yet an inert tracer that penetrates into repair foci and that we can follow at the single molecule level. Further assays would need to be developed to go in this direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, I'm not sure I entirely grasp the significance of Figure 6. Since Rad52 can easily escape one focus and enter another, regardless of whether it is a cluster of binding sites or a phase, I don't see how the radius of confinement measurement distinguishes between these two alternatives.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We agree that this point needs clarifying. In a simplified view where multiple DSBs cluster and stay close without merging, we expect to observe the same confinement radius than following a single DSB. In another extreme view, multiple DSBs fuse, giving rise to a large single droplet, and Rad52 confinement radius increases.</p><p>Since exchange is important, we now discuss a third intermediate view in which DSBs cluster without merging, but we include a high rate of exchange making possible for a Rad52 molecule to “jump” between a focus to another one. In this view, we should observe bimodal trajectories, exhibiting confined diffusion in the first focus, followed by a confined diffusion in the second focus. Such traces should be observable since the mean residence inside a focus is 240 ms (12 frames) and traces are often longer than this (we added the histogram of Rad52 traces length inside foci, see new Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>After examining carefully individual trajectories inside a focus induced by 2 DSBs, we never observe bimodal trajectories. Instead, in typical trajectories (Figure 6F, right panel), Rad52 is homogenously distributed in time within a larger focus. In the revised version of the manuscript, we now comment on this point. In the limit case where the two foci are so close that we can’t visualize jumps the second and third views are effectively the same.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The observation that the foci are 2x larger in diploids but at similar density is compelling, although recent data from the Brangwynne lab point out that conserved density need not be the case (PMID: 32405004).</p></disp-quote><p>First, we would like to clarify this point: in Figure 6, we observed that foci induced by 2 DSBs are 2x larger than those induced by a single DSB. We have not performed experiments in diploid cells in the first version of the manuscript.</p><p>Then, we explain that 2 droplets of radius R would lead to a bigger droplet of doubled volume when they fuse, with no significant difference in density (see p 13). We thank the reviewer for bringing our attention to the recent study by the Brangwynne lab. In the experiment following 2 DSBs, there is no change of Rad52 concentration in the nucleus, so we believe the recent study by the Brangwynne lab is of no direct relevance for these results. However, this study led us to revisit our results following Rad52 over-expression. We now comment this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the syntax of this paper, Rad52 is a client in the LLPS, leaving the question of the scaffold unaddressed.

Recent studies have shown that the physical nature of proteins complexes can differ from in vitro to in vivo assays. In a recent publication on the nature of heterochromatin (Erdel <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020), the authors confirm that the HP1α can form droplets in vitro as also observed by Larson <italic>et al.</italic>, Nature 2018. However, HP1α droplets formation in vitro requires a high protein concentration (&gt; 40 μM): it is not certain that the in vitro behavior of highly concentrated and phosphorylated HP1 accurately recapitulates the in vivo biology with physiological HP1 level (~ 1 μM). Indeed, the results in vivo presented by Erdel et al., 2020, clash with a simple LLPS mechanism for heterochromatin subcompartments; instead, they are more consistent with a collapsed “chromatin-globule model” (or polymer-polymer phase separation model, PPPS).</p><p>As underlined in the recent literature (Gitler <italic>et al.,</italic> Mol Cell 2020 Previews, McSwiggen <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019), with the advances in super resolution microscopy and biophysical approaches, what appear to be droplets at first glance might in fact follow more complex models.</p><p>Taking into consideration the work from the Brangwynne lab showing that LLPS composed by multiple proteins with heterotypic multicomponent interactions do not exhibit a fixed saturation concentration, we propose that the formation of repair foci could be driven by a combination of several interacting proteins including Rad52.

To verify if our observations are conserved in a system with repairable DSBs, we measured Rad52 mobility in diploids cells, after the induction of a single DSB at the same locus as in haploids (<italic>LYS2</italic>). We obtained results very similar to the one obtained in haploid cells: with Rad52 molecules exhibiting: (i) 3 populations, (ii) confined motion inside foci, (iii) a difference in diffusion coefficient of 8 between internal Rad52 mobility inside foci and the whole focus mobility. It is important to note that all our experiments in haploid cells where performed 2 hours after induction which correspond to the step of search for an ectopic homologous sequence (Piazza et al., 2019). This could explain why Rad52 has the same behavior in the presence and in the absence of a donor sequence.</p><p>We now present the results in Figure 2—figure supplement 5, and we discuss this point in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One should easily compare wild-type Rad52 to known Rad52 mutants (that partly or fully abrogate function) to see if there is any correlation between intra-focus mobility profiles and repair.

We agree that testing different Rad52 mutant will be very interesting but this will be the subject of another manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Can the authors visualize the fusion of the Rad52 foci/DSBs in live cells within their experimental systems?</p></disp-quote><p>The fusion of repair foci has been already observed both in yeast (Oshidari et al., 2020 and Waterman et al., 2019) and in human cells (Altmeyer et al., 2015) by tracking repair foci at larger time scales (several minutes). We now comment this point in the Discussion. Here we focused on foci size and internal dynamics inside foci in response to 1 <italic>versus</italic> 2 DSBs, which brings new information that are only accessible by single molecule microscopy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The statistical significance of most presented data is either lacking or unclear. This needs to be carefully addressed. Providing additional data files may also help the authors strengthen their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this remark. We have added statistical tests throughout the revised manuscript. To be more specific, we added:</p><p>– goodness of fit for all the MSD fit, indicating the Pearson's chi-squared (see revised Table 1)</p><p>– the p-values of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for the data with over-expressed levels of Rad52 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Text revisions:</p><p>– Several statements made are not supported by the data and without clearly stating that the statements represent speculations. E.g. longer tail is due to Rad52 molecules diffusing slowly inside the focus; observing the 2 populations also in G1 does not necessarily mean that the 2 populations in S/G2 do not reflect replication forks at all.</p></disp-quote><p>We now modulate our interpretation of the 2 populations in S/G2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors need to carefully revise their claims/statements and consider alternative explanations. Also, the writing is often unclear or confusing and the authors should consider substantially revising it to clarify their claims, clearly indicate speculations that are not supported by the data, and make the text as accessible as possible to non-specialists.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version, we made the text more accessible, for example,</p><p>– we moved in the method or figure legend some technical details explaining how the diffusion coefficient is estimated inside repair foci (see Results and legend of Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><p>– We explained the distribution of traces length in a more accessible manner.</p><p>– We removed some redundancies in the Discussion and discuss the models of sub-compartments in a more accessible manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How was the cell cycle stage determined? This should be better explained.</p></disp-quote><p>Cell cycle stage was assessed by the presence and the size of a bud on the transmission image. We now clarified this point in the text (figure legend of Figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1—figure supplement 1 data appear to show the existence of a partial loss of Rad52 function in the Rad52-Halo cells. This should be clearly stated in the Results and consequent limitations/caveats discussed. Also, please clarify whether Figure 1—figure supplement 1 shows the viability of Rad52-Halo cells in the presence or absence of JF646.</p></disp-quote><p>We have commented on this point in the legend of Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors present no direct evidence for an &quot;attractive potential&quot; that drives molecules towards the centre of the focus. For example, what if the “attractive potential” is simply the focus' boundary surface tension creating a barrier against which some of the molecules inside the focus bounce back towards the centre of the focus?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment that definitely needs clarification. When we refer to an attractive potential, we do not mean a potential that attracts the molecules towards the center of the focus, but a potential that, exactly like it would be the case for surface tension, hinders the passage out of the focus for the molecules. To clarify this important passage, we have updated the text, in the last paragraph of the Results part, following text for Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors state that &quot;Here, we found that upon different levels of Rad52 over-expression, the background concentration increases (Appendix 1—figure 1) suggesting that Rad52 might not be the driving molecule responsible for the LLPS formed at the damaged site.&quot; The logical transition here is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified this point and added a reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is difficult to judge the novelty of this work, as key papers that showed similar conclusions or datasets are not cited. Without direct comparison with other data sets, it is difficult to see exactly where this paper goes beyond published studies.</p><p>Here are a few key examples:</p><p>a) In the last year the Haber lab published a very similar study in Plos Genetics (Waterman et al., 2019). Although they tracked Ddc2 and Rad51, they also looked at the behavior of separate foci and this paper is not even cited. The data should be compared at the very least.</p></disp-quote><p>The work by Waterman et al., 2019 is actually different from our present work although complementary. Waterman et al. did not monitor the dynamics of single molecules but the dynamics of repair foci decorated either by Rad51 or Ddc2 in a strain experiencing 3 DSB. They monitored the aggregation and mobility of DSBs into a single focus and show that these events were independent of Rad52.</p><p>This is paper is now cited in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The characteristics of 53BP1 foci have been extensively studied by many labs including those of Altmeyer, Scherthan, DeLange and others, with very similar findings as Miné-Hattab reports for Rad52 (for example, Kilic et al., 2019; Sollazzo et al., 2018, as well as the single molecule work of the lab of Eric Greene). Moreover both rad52 and PCNA foci were studied by Essers et al. (Kanaar and Vermeulen) MCB 2005. 25(21): 9350-9359 and EMBO J. 2002 Apr 15. Comparisons with these studies needs to be made.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we added these references and discuss them in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) A number of earlier studies followed Rad52 foci in budding yeast on induced double strand breaks (even using the I-Sce1-cut system used here) that are not taken into consideration. The diffusion coefficients presented here have to be compared with these earlier studies and differences should be resolved by comparing techniques and conditions of imaging. For instance, Dion et al., 2012).</p></disp-quote><p>We now compare the diffusion coefficient of the whole focus measured here with the one obtained in Dion et al., 2012.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is unclear if the “absence of DNA damage” condition discussed in the first section of the Results is the non-induced version of the system described in the second section of the Results.</p></disp-quote><p>The “absence of DNA damage” condition is indeed the same experiment described in the second section of the Results and referred as “no DSB” in the figures. For this condition, we used a strain without a I-<italic>Sce</italic>I cut site and grown in the same conditions as the strain used to induce a DSB to ensure a fair comparison between the two conditions (with or without DSB). We now clarify this point in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also regarding these sections, it seems that the “absence of DNA damage” control conditions were not conducted as part of the same experiments with the I-SceI DSB.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, experiments performed in the absence or in the presence of DNA damage uses a different strain and were done separately. We have repeated these experiments 3 to 6 times, and one set of data includes the experiments with and without DSB done the same day. We also use the “absence of DNA damage” condition as a control experiment for the stability of our set-up: this experiment has been systematically performed and analysed once a year and similar diffusion coefficients were obtained.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2C is a little underwhelming. I would like to see one data panel in the main text with the cumulative distribution +/- DSB.</p></disp-quote><p>We now present the cumulative distribution of traces length for Rad52-Halo/JF646, in the absence and in the presence of a DSB (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;in the case of diffusion coefficients D&lt;0.1 μm2/s, we use mean square displacement analysis allowing us to substrate the noise.&quot; Subtract the noise.</p></disp-quote><p>We made the correction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– One technical point. The fluorescence lifetime of a freely diffusing fluorophore (reported half-life of JF646 is 2.1 sec) is not the same as if it is bound to a protein; in the latter context the fluorophore would diffuse more slowly in the illumination path and be subjected to more rapid photobleaching, making 2.1 sec an overestimation of the half-life/underestimation of the decay rate. At a frame interval of 20ms, photobleaching may be a competitive rate for the disappearance of signal and I am not sure the lack of applying photobleaching correction or saying that the short tracks are not affected by that rate is properly justified.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this remark. The JF646 used in this study are flurogenic, meaning that they emit light only when they are bound to a Halo molecule. Thus, there is no signal when free JF646 dyes diffuse inside a cell that does not express Halo. To measure the half life time of JF646, we used the strain harbouring Rad52-Halo, in the absence of DSB and we incubated the JF646 with the cells for 1h for 50 nM (a concentration 10 times higher than the one used to be in the single molecule regime). This point is explained in Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</p></body></sub-article></article>
