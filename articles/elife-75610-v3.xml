To achieve this process, osteoclasts form a specific structure called the sealing zone, which creates a close contact with bone and confines the release of protons and hydrolases for bone degradation. The sealing zone is composed of actin structures called podosomes nested in a dense actin network. The organization of these actin structures inside the sealing zone at the nano scale is still unknown. Here, we combine cutting-edge microscopy methods to reveal the nanoscale architecture and dynamics of the sealing zone formed by human osteoclasts on bone surface. Random illumination microscopy allowed the identification and live imaging of densely packed actin cores within the sealing zone. A cross-correlation analysis of the fluctuations of actin content at these cores indicates that they are locally synchronized. Further examination shows that the sealing zone is composed of groups of synchronized cores linked by α-actinin1 positive filaments, and encircled by adhesion complexes. Thus, we propose that the confinement of bone degradation mediators is achieved through the coordination of islets of actin cores and not by the global coordination of all podosomal subunits forming the sealing zone.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>osteoclast</kwd><kwd>nanoscale</kwd><kwd>sealing zone</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>super resolution microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR16-CE13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vérollet</surname><given-names>Christel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRM DEQ2016 0334894</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maridonneau-Parini</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGP0035/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maridonneau-Parini</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cutting-edge super-resolution microscopy methods reveal the architecture and dynamics of the sealing zone formed by human osteoclasts and composed of coordinated groups of podosomal cores encircled by adhesion complexes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoclasts are giant multinucleated cells of the hematopoietic lineage, specialized in the degradation of bone matrix. To do so, protons accumulate into the resorption lacuna thanks to the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (v-ATPase), thus lowering the local pH and facilitating the solubilization of apatite, the main mineral component of bone. This acidic environment is also prone to enhance the digestion of bone organic matrix by proteases secreted by osteoclasts such as cathepsin K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Teitelbaum, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Soysa and Alles, 2016</xref>). The efficiency of this process relies on the ability of the cell to create an enclosed resorption compartment, <italic>via</italic> the formation of a unique cytoskeletal structure, the sealing zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jurdic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Delaisse et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>First described as a subcellular entity made of electron dense material and apparently deprived of any organelle, thus resulting in first denomination as the ‘clear zone’, the sealing zone was then revealed to consist in a dense accumulation of actin filaments forming a circular shape surrounding the resorption lacuna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zambonin-Zallone et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kanehisa et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Teti et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">King and Holtrop, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Han et al., 2019</xref>). Examination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of cells removed of their basal membrane brought to light the peculiar arrangement of actin filaments within this structure, and particularly unveiled the existence of a dense network of podosomes composing this structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luxenburg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akisaka and Yoshida, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akisaka and Yoshida, 2019</xref>). Podosomes are adhesion structures that are generally scattered in macrophages and dendritic cells. Podosome typical components, such as vinculin, paxillin, talin, or cortactin, are also localized in the sealing zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chabadel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Saltel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lakkakorpi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lakkakorpi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pfaff and Jurdic, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hurst et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gil-Henn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ory et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 2010</xref>). In a distinct way compared to single podosomes, vinculin, paxillin, and talin were reported to form a ‘double circle’ flanking the sealing zone on each side, while cortactin mainly colocalized with actin in between (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jurdic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lakkakorpi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pfaff and Jurdic, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lakkakorpi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lakkakorpi and Väänänen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tehrani et al., 2006</xref>). Noteworthy, most of the studies on the bone degradation machinery were carried out based on observations of osteoclasts on glass substrates instead of bone, due to the lack of optical transparency and high auto-fluorescence of the mineralized matrix. As a result, only poor knowledge has been collected about the architecture and dynamics of the functional sealing zone. Indeed, it has been suggested that actin structures on bone differ from the ones formed on glass, mainly in their total width, and the interconnectivity and density of actin cores within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luxenburg et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, only structures formed on bone or bone-mimicking materials are called sealing zone, structures on glass being denominated as ‘sealing zone like’ or podosome belts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jurdic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Saltel et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>How podosomes are organized and coordinated to allow efficient sealing and bone degradation is therefore still unknown. Hence, it appears paramount to develop higher resolution microscopy techniques compatible with observation on bone substrates. This could yield valuable information concerning the spatial distribution of major actin-binding proteins within the sealing zone, otherwise only arduously accessible <italic>via</italic> electron microscopy and correlative microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luxenburg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akisaka and Yoshida, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akisaka and Yoshida, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akisaka and Yoshida, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Geblinger et al., 2009</xref>. Additionally, observation of the sealing zone internal dynamics would provide substantial hints to understand the sealing ability of such a structure. This exploration would require both a spatial and temporal high-resolution microscopy technique.</p><p>In this work, we used cutting-edge super-resolution microscopy methods to reveal the architecture and dynamics of the bone degradation machinery formed by human osteoclasts. First, we examined the three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale organization within the podosome belt thanks to a single-molecule localization method. Then, random illumination microscopy (RIM) acquisitions of human osteoclasts plated on bone allowed to resolve single actin cores composing the sealing zone. RIM technique also proved to be efficient in deciphering this nanoscale organization in living samples. Hence, cross-correlation analysis of the fluctuation of the sealing zone actin content could show that cores were locally synchronized. Further analysis of the organization of adhesion components and actin crosslinkers revealed that the sealing zone is composed of coordinated groups formed by α-actinin1-linked podosomal cores and encircled by adhesion complexes. Therefore, confinement of bone degradation enzymes may be achieved through the alternating contact of functional islets of actin cores.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Three-dimensional nanoscale organization of the podosome belt in human osteoclasts</title><p>The sealing zone formed by bone-degrading osteoclasts is described as a dense network of actin cores that appear fused under conventional microscopy, surrounded by two lines of adhesion sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jurdic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lakkakorpi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pfaff and Jurdic, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lakkakorpi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lakkakorpi and Väänänen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tehrani et al., 2006</xref>). The precise architectural and dynamics of this structure are almost uncharacterized. To address the organization of osteoclast podosomes, a 3D super-resolution method called DONALD was used. DONALD is a single molecule localization method combining direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy for the in-plane detection of proteins, and SAF analysis to gain access to the absolute axial position of fluorophores relative to the glass coverslip. This nanoscopy technique thus benefits from approximately 15 nm localization precision in the three dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bourg et al., 2015</xref>). Human osteoclasts derived from blood monocytes were differentiated for 10 days, plated on glass and observed with this 3D super-resolution technique. On glass, osteoclasts form structures called podosome belts, sharing certain characteristics with sealing zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jurdic et al., 2006</xref>). In particular, podosome belts also exhibit areas where podosome cores appear fused, that is when sets of several cores are brought together inside a single and large ring of adhesion sites, similar to the described structure of the sealing zone. Indeed, this fusion of podosome cores was observed in 9.4+/-3.5% of multinucleated human osteoclasts. We therefore focused on the zones displaying podosome fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>3D nanoscopy of vinculin and talin-C in the osteoclast podosome belt.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative dSTORM images of vinculin (blue) merged with the corresponding epifluorescence images of the F-actin cores (ochre).

SEM acquisitions of unroofed cells confirmed that the sealing zones formed by human osteoclasts are composed of individual F-actin cores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), similarly to what was shown in osteoclasts differentiated from the mouse cell line RAW 264.7 or harvested from rabbit long bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luxenburg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akisaka and Yoshida, 2019</xref>). These cores were nested in a dense network of actin filaments, and appeared connected to their neighbors by filaments running parallel to the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B’</xref>, arrowheads). Morphometric characterization of the podosome network involves defining the podosome density, the position of each podosome core, and their position relative to one another.

RIM consists in illuminating a sample with a series of random speckles and processing the stack of images using signal processing and statistical tools, to gather a lateral and axial resolution of 100 and 300 nm, respectively. This method benefits from similar resolution as with traditional structured illumination microscopy (SIM), while not requiring any initial calibration step. In addition, its super-resolution capability allows for characterization of events within thick samples, until 30 µm in unknown optical medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mangeat et al., 2021</xref>). RIM thus enabled super-resolution imaging of the functional sealing zone. Actin staining showed a dense though discontinuous thick pattern within the sealing zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), in which single actin structures could be spotted. Localization of lysosomal membrane protein LAMP1 in bone-resorbing osteoclasts confirmed the accumulation of LAMP1 compartments in the middle of the sealing zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using this approach, the number of podosomes, the average diameter of their core were determined, and from these parameters, their relative spatial distribution was estimated. More specifically, signal analysis of the actin staining localized local intensity maxima, the geometric features of which were assessed by extracting both the coordinates of the local maxima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C’</xref>), and the signal intensity values along eight directions, evenly distributed from the center. Signal variations were quantified along these 1 µm long segments, the half-width of the peak in each direction was computed after spatial derivation, and the peak radii were computed by averaging the eight values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The radius distribution yielded an average value of 97 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

The distance between every possible core pair was estimated and their respective signals were compared using Pearson cross-correlation analysis. A high positive Pearson coefficient corresponds to acute temporal synchrony for the analyzed pair of actin signals. Highest Pearson coefficient values between 1 and 0.37, corresponding to half of the maximum mean value, were obtained for cores within a 700 nm radius distance. They slowly decreased to approximately 0.10 at longer distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This result hinted at the existence of a spatial synchrony between neighbors within the sealing zone, comparable to observations for podosomes in human macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Proag et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, potential periodicity of actin content fluctuations was examined through analysis of the Fourier spectra corresponding to live acquisitions. This yielded three specific frequencies that seemed to prevail: 0.01 Hz, 0.04 Hz, and 0.15 Hz, corresponding to periods of approximately 100 s, 25 s, and 7 s, respectively. In macrophages, similar oscillation periods had previously been identified by examining the stiffness variations of single podosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Labernadie et al., 2014</xref>). In order to obtain a graphical representation of podosome synchrony, differential films were assembled by subtracting 2 sequential time points, therefore representing local actin intensity gradients. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, orange stands for a positive gradient, that is local polymerization, and blue represents a negative gradient, that is local depolymerization. Strikingly, polymerization and depolymerization regions appeared as clusters with slowly varying areas, containing a few actin cores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>, right). Actin polymerization and depolymerization processes thus appeared to be synchronous within actin core clusters.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed a local synchrony of F-actin oscillations between cores of the same superstructure.

Spatial distributions of the same components of the sealing zone that were imaged with the DONALD technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) were thus explored by RIM, and we developed a quantitative image workflow to analyze the localization of these proteins with respect to the actin cores in human osteoclasts adhering on bone. Protein localizations were evaluated along 1.5 µm long and 100 nm wide lines, in longitudinal and transverse directions relative to the local sealing zone orientation. Because sealing zones were different in terms of actin core density, the actin core width was normalized, allowing for the localization of the target proteins with respect to the core domain (see vinculin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Cortactin was localized within the core domain, as had been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hurst et al., 2003</xref>), and displayed a wider distribution compared to the average core diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). α-actinin1 mostly colocalized with actin at the close periphery of the core, and appeared less present in the most central part of the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

First, we gave a detailed insight into the inner organization of the sealing zone with the 3D localization of major actin crosslinkers inside the podosome belt, and examination of their axial localization hinted at the possible existence of tension within the integrin adhesion sites. Second, using RIM, we showed that podosome cores were within the submicron range from their direct neighbors. Third, by monitoring podosomes in the sealing zone by time-lapse super-resolution microscopy, we characterized the long-term spatial stability of actin cores during bone resorption and we revealed a synchronous behavior for actin cores within a distance of 1 µm. These fluctuations are probably the result of the constant renewal of the actin network in the sealing zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Saltel et al., 2004</xref>), with a likely treadmilling of actin filaments from the plasma membrane towards the apical part of the cell. The Arp2/3 complex and cortactin are central in these dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hurst et al., 2003</xref>), and play a key role in the function of the sealing zone, probably via the generation of a protrusion force applied to the bone substrate, similarly to what was shown for macrophage podosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouissou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Proag et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Labernadie et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, we found that synchronous neighbors were grouped within clusters, which corresponded to islets surrounded by adhesion complexes composed of vinculin, talin, paxillin and filamin A. Overall, these results allow for a new model of the internal architecture, dynamics and functioning of the sealing zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of the organization of the sealing zone into islets.</title><p>(<bold>A-A’</bold>) Osteoclast form an actin-rich superstructure called the sealing zone, in order to confine bone degradation.

Acquisitions were performed with the DONALD imaging technique, which combines dSTORM and SAF analysis for the efficient 3D detection of single fluorophores with a precision of 15 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bourg et al., 2015</xref>). This 3D nanoscopy technique was recently applied in the context of human macrophage podosomes. It allowed for the identification of a close relationship between paxillin, vinculin and talin, and its requirement for efficient protrusion force generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouissou et al., 2017</xref>). In osteoclast podosome belts, vinculin, paxillin, and talin-C were localized in the close vicinity of the ventral membrane. Moreover, vinculin and talin-C appeared to rise when situated closer to the actin cores. This interesting finding could be the first insight into the identification of possible tension within the podosome belt. In fact, in podosome rings of macrophages, it was observed that when talin is stretched, vinculin height is higher, probably because vinculin binding sites are appearing when talin acquires an extended conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouissou et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, cortactin, α-actinin1 and filamin A were mainly localized around 150 nm above the plasma membrane, with a dislocated distribution compared to actin. This suggests the existence of different sets of actin filaments within the sealing zone, those enriched in cross-linkers in an upper layer and those devoid of cross-linkers near the plasma membrane. Cryo-electron tomography analysis of the actin network composing the macrophage podosome suggests not only the central role of the actin core but also the concerted role of radial actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jasnin et al., 2021</xref>). The present manuscript also suggests that, within podosome islets, different populations of actin filaments (actin cores positive for cortactin and lateral filaments positive for actinin or filamin-A) coexist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and are probably mechanically coupled and coordinated to allow force generation and efficient sealing of the bone breakdown zone.</p><p>Importantly, our results with this 3D super-resolution technique were obtained for podosomes belts of osteoclasts plated on glass. While only structures formed on bone or bone-mimicking substrate are called sealing zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jurdic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Saltel et al., 2004</xref>), podosome belts share some characteristics with sealing zones such as the local fusion of podosome cores. The use of RIM allowed for the identification of single actin cores within the sealing zones of human osteoclasts adhering on bone and resorbing. Podosome cores were within the submicron range from their direct neighbors, as already assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deguchi et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, we showed that the sealing zone was composed of sub-structures resembling islets of grouped podosomes within clusters and bordered by a network of adhesion sites. These observations greatly contrasted with the ‘double circle’ distribution (<italic>i.e.</italic> a dense network of actin cores that appear fused surrounded by two lines of adhesion sites) described in earlier works using conventional or confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lakkakorpi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lakkakorpi and Väänänen, 1996</xref>). This difference probably stems not only from the better resolution of the images presented in this manuscript but also from the fact that most of the studies on the organization of sealing zones were performed on mouse osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jurdic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Saltel et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lakkakorpi et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lakkakorpi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lakkakorpi and Väänänen, 1996</xref>), and not on human osteoclasts.</p><p>Benefitting from RIM low toxicity and high temporal resolution, we could picture the sealing zone using time-lapse super-resolution microscopy. The actin dynamics was monitored within the sealing zone of osteoclasts plated on bone slices. Preliminary deconvoluted movies had revealed the apparent spatial stability of actin cores for long time periods. Actin signal processing yielded a time periodicity for these oscillations of approximately 100 s, which is much slower than the actin oscillations observed in scattered macrophage podosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouissou et al., 2017</xref>). Here, local oscillations associated with actin remodeling within the cores were revealed and characterized for the first time in the sealing zone. So far, the mechanisms regulating these oscillations, whether purely mechanical or involving signaling, as well as their importance for podosome and sealing zone function, are not yet understood. It was previously shown that these oscillations in macrophage podosomes depend on myosin IIA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Labernadie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van den Dries et al., 2013</xref>). It would thus be interesting to explore the effects of drugs interfering with actin polymerization on both the periodicity and the spatial synchrony properties of the sealing zone. Furthermore, cross-correlation analysis between signals associated with two cores in the same cell brought to light the existence of a spatial synchrony between neighbors up to an approximate 2 µm distance scale. Interestingly, this distance coincides with the mean neighbor-to-neighbor distance measured by SEM and RIM. Similar observations in human macrophage podosomes were reported, showing that under a distance of 1.8 µm, podosome neighbors oscillated synchronously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Proag et al., 2015</xref>). A role of connecting actin filaments was suggested to be involved in controlling the synchrony between podosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Proag et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Labernadie et al., 2014</xref>). In sealing zones, the spectacularly dense actin meshwork observed between actin cores could be involved in connecting subunits and thus conducting synchronized oscillations of actin within the superstructure. In addition, our previous observations in macrophages revealed that actin oscillations corresponded to oscillations of the protrusion force generated by podosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Proag et al., 2015</xref>). Based on these observations in macrophages, we propose that in osteoclasts, synchrony of actin oscillations in actin core islets could reflect the involvement of oscillating protrusion forces in the sealing process. Actually, we also revealed the existence of intertwined islets of podosomes: some could be involved in sealing, while neighboring islets are concomitantly relaxing. A local co-regulation between actin polymerization in the core and formation of surrounding adhesion proteins was observed, as described in scattered podosomes of macrophages or dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouissou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van den Dries et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, intermittent protrusive and relaxing capacity of podosome islets could enable efficient sealing of the osteoclast plasma membrane to the bone surface and maintaining the resorption lacuna and the diffusion barrier.</p><p>This study consists in the first extensive and quantitative study of the nanoscale organization and dynamics of the sealing zone in human osteoclasts. It proposes precise localization of six major components of the sealing zone: vinculin, paxillin, talin, cortactin, filamin A and α-actinin1. Furthermore, it provides the geometric characterization of the actin core network within this unique and functional superstructure. It also allows identification of dynamic processes related to podosomes during active bone resorption. This work therefore aimed at paving the way for future studies to decipher both the ultrastructural and dynamic properties of this unique osteoclast structure dedicated to bone resorption.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Differentiation and culture of primary monocyte-derived osteoclasts</title><p>Human monocytes were isolated from blood of healthy donors as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Van Goethem et al., 2010</xref>).

Briefly, actin cores in-plane coordinates (x<sub>core</sub>,y<sub>core</sub>) were determined from actin epifluorescence images from the 488 nm channel after Gaussian-filtering. The angle between the podosome belt portion and the horizontal was measured by the user, and the side pointing towards the interior of the cell identified. Then, centered on each core, a rectangle bounding box of length 10 µm and width 200 nm was drawn and the 3D coordinates (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, z<sub>i</sub>) of the molecules inside this box were converted to a local r-z space (r<sub>i</sub>, z<sub>i</sub>) with r<sub>i</sub> being the distance between a molecule and the center of the considered actin core. This operation was repeated twice for each core: once along the structure direction, and once in the transversal direction. This analysis was performed for all cores of a given cell.</p><p>To further the analysis of the spatial organization of molecules within the podosome belt, a dedicated Python script was written to extract statistical information. Each cross-section direction for each cell was treated independently, except for distributions along r-axis and along z-axis for which all molecules detected for all cells were considered. Points were sorted in classes of varying lengths: 100 nm long until 1 µm from the core, 500 nm long further, depending on their distance to the corresponding actin core and whether they were located towards the exterior or the internal part of the cell. The distances were counted as negative when the molecules were located toward the exterior part of the cell. For each r-class, median height of the distribution was estimated cell by cell, by pooling the data for all cores considered within this particular cell. Also, the symmetry between internal and external distribution of proteins in terms of quantity was assessed by comparing the total amount of molecules on the exterior side to the total amount of points on the interior side, normalized by the total amount of points detected for each cell considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Scanning electron microscopy imaging</title><p>Osteoclasts plated on bone slices for 3 days were unroofed as described above and fixed for 10 min in a 0.2 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences 15710) and 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences 16220), then washed with distilled water.

Bone slices were placed on a FluoroDish (WPI FD35-100) with cells facing down and immersed with RPMI without phenol red, supplemented with 10% FCS (Thermo Fisher 32404–014). During observations, samples were maintained at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Images were acquired every 12ms for a total of 211 s (streams) using an inverted microscope (TEi Nikon). A fiber laser combiner with 4 fast diode lasers (Oxxius) with respective wavelengths 405 nm (LBX-405–180-CSB,) 454 nm (LBX-445–100-CSB), 488 nm (LBX-488–200-CSB), and 561 nm (LMX-561L-200-COL) were used to excite fluorophores. A corrected fiber collimator (RGBV Fiber Collimators 60FC Sukhamburg) was used to produce collimated TEM<sub>00</sub> 2.2 mm diameter output beam for all wavelengths. The polarization beam was rotated with an angle of 5 degrees before hitting a X4 Beam Expander beam (GBE04-A) and produced 8.8 mm beam TEM<sub>00</sub> beam. A fast spatial light phase binary modulator (QXGA fourth dimensions) was conjugated to the image plane to make speckle random illumination. The objective lens used in experiments is a ×100 magnification with 1.49 numerical aperture (CFI SR APO 100XH ON 1.49 DT 0;12 NIKON). A band pass filter was used for Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) emission (Semrock FF01-514/30-25). A motorized high-speed wheel filter was used to sequentially turn the two band pass filters in 30ms after each 200 speckle fames. A piezoelectric Z stage (Z INZERT PIEZOCONCEPT) was used for fast z stack acquisition. For triggering, the camera sCMOS was used as master, and a rolling shutter output was used to trigger binary phase sequence to the SLM. The SLM output triggered the laser when binary phase mask was stable. A script from micromanager software was written to select the number of speckles used, the temporal resolution for each frame, the depth of z stack, the step of each z stack and the number of colors used for the acquisition.

Widefield time-lapse acquisitions were also carried out with the same microscope, but using a 60 x objective (CFI PLAN APO LBDA 60XH 1.4/0.13 NIKON).

The number of iterations during the variance matching process is defined by the user, mainly depending on the signal to noise ratio of the raw data.</p><p>Drift correction was performed on z stacks with ImageJ plugin Linear Stack Alignment with SIFT.</p><p>To create images on which to perform further analyses, 3–5 z slices per acquisition stack were selected based on their sharpness, depending on the quality of the original signal, and summed with ImageJ Z Project tool.</p><p>In order to characterize the actin network, actin cores were detected as local maxima using ImageJ Find Maxima tool with the threshold set as half of background intensity. The coordinates of these maxima were weighted considering all pixel intensity in a 200 nm radius, and exported in a text file. These points were positioned both on RIM reconstructed image and on its spatial derivative version created thanks to ImageJ Find Edges tool. From these locations, 8 radius profiles were traced with length 1 µm and width 100 nm on both images, and intensity values along each line were extracted and stored in a text file for each image. A dedicated Python script was then written to extract statistical data. Core radii were computed by detecting the first intensity maximum along the Find Edges profile. Inter-core distances were computed thanks to weighted coordinates following the same Delaunay algorithm already described in the SEM analysis section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>For the analysis of two-color acquisitions, actin cores were detected following the same procedure as described for the analysis of the actin network. Then, signals were extracted along 1.5 µm long and 100 nm wide lines drawn so that each core coordinates were placed at the middle of the line, and their orientation either followed the local curvature of the sealing zone, or was perpendicular to it. This process was repeated on the reconstructed actin image, the actin image after spatial derivation with ImageJ Find Edges tool and the protein image. All data were extracted and stored in a text file to be read by a dedicated Python script. This script computed the median core size for all data thanks to Find Edges signals, in order to establish a normalized profile length. This step was aimed at gaining independence from the specific geometric characteristics of each core, in order to propose a normalized profile for each signal and thus increasing the relevance of comparing data between cells from different blood donors. As a consequence, the x-axis for data displayed as signal profiles is shown as a non-unit scale based on the computed median core radius. Then, both actin- and protein-associated signals were interpolated along this new axis to yield comparable intensity profiles. Median profiles were eventually computed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analysis of RIM live acquisitions</title><p>Reconstruction of raw images was carried out as described previously. To combine robust statistical estimation of object and temporal resolution, an interleaved reconstruction method was made as previously proposed for SIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma et al., 2018</xref>). A total of 800 speckles were grouped to reconstruct one time slice, and the time step between two images corresponds to 200 speckles. Drift correction was performed on stacks with ImageJ plugin Linear Stack Alignment with SIFT, with the same parameters as for fixed samples. Actin intensity levels were normalized throughout the stack by using ImageJ Bleach Correction tool, with the correction method set to histogram matching.</p><p>To detect the single actin cores, all the time slices were summed with ImageJ Z project tool and the coordinates were extracted according to the same procedure as for fixed samples. The dynamic characteristics of actin were assessed by extracting the time-dependent signals in a circular selection of radius 100 nm around each core, and storing them in a text file. A dedicated Python script was developed to compute the distance between all core pairs in the same cell, the Fourier spectrum associated with each signal and the Pearson cross-correlation between two signals in the same cell. Natural frequencies were identified as the frequencies associated with Fourier coefficients greater than a threshold value proportional to the median value for Fourier coefficients over the spectrum. Pearson coefficients were eventually sorted according to the distance between the core pair coordinates.</p><p>In order to obtain graphical representations of the local evolution of fluorescence over time, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>, the films were processed using ImageJ as follows. First, the films were registered using the StackReg ImageJ plugin. Then, 2 sequential time points were subtracted to obtain a new film representing the rate of change of fluorescence. Finally, a Gaussian filter (2 pixel radius, <italic>i.e.</italic> 64.5 nm) and a time average on three consecutive images were applied to this film to help reduce local noise and visually highlight local variations in intensity changes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All box-and-whisker plots show the median, lower and upper quartiles (box) and the 10th and 90th percentiles (whiskers).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Resource availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files; Source Data files have been provided for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Monocytes from healthy subjects were provided by Etablissement Français du Sang (EFS), Toulouse, France, under contract 21/PLER/TOU/IPBS01/20130042.

structure of human osteoclast podosomes at the nanoscale, combining microscopy methods to reveal the architecture and dynamics of the sealing zone on the bone surface. Through random illumination microscopy, the live imaging of densely packed actin cores within the sealing zone shows that these cores are locally synchronized, connected by α-actinin filaments, and surrounded by adhesion complexes. The authors propose a model in which the function of podosomes during bone resorption is accomplished through the coordination of islets of the actin core and not through the global coordination of all podosome subunits that form the sealing zone. This article has the potential to generate a significant impact in the field of osteoclast biology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75610.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Grano</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/027ynra39</institution-id><institution>University of Bari</institution></institution-wrap><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Holliday</surname><given-names>L Shannon</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.12.09.471901">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.09.471901v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Introduction. In the manuscript the author's fail to cite King, GJ and Holtrop ME.1975. Actin-like filaments in bone cells of cultured mouse calvaria as demonstrated by binding to heavy meromyosin. J. Cell Biol. 66(2):445-451. Because this manuscript was literally more than a decade ahead of its time it is often missed, but using traditional TEM provides a very nice picture of the actin rings of resorbing osteoclasts. It would be interesting perhaps to compare the models of the structures established in this study to the structures described in this manuscript. Pretty similar I think.</p><p>2. A key point that has been made about actin rings is the extreme dynamics of driven by polymerization of the filaments near the sealing zone membrane and depolymerization toward the middle of the cells. This was described elegantly by Saltel and colleagues (ref 23). In the current manuscript the persistence of podosomes in examined but the idea that actin is flowing through the filaments by polymerization and depolymerization, and is probably pushing the network into the membrane is not well described, and provides important context for the study. For example, the authors note that cortactin is in the core of the podosomes as opposed to other proteins. A description of why, because cortactin is associated with the n-WASP/ARP2/3 complex that regulates actin polymerization would help to bring the story together.</p><p>3. Figure 2. (A) The pit formed by the osteoclast is not very convincing. It would be more convincing to show bone slices on which the cells were removed were pitted extensively. Since this part of the study involves resorbing osteoclasts, it would also be helpful if the ruffled membrane was shown, using appropriate antibody markers.</p><p>B) It was not clear to me what I am looking at, it looks like that if it is an actin ring there is very little ruffled membrane area. This happens as resorption complexes form or end their time. Maybe a little schematic?</p><p>C) I was not entirely clear how the heights being measured were established. Better description would be helpful. Maybe it is present in the Methods but it is not presented very clearly.</p><p>4. Please provide in the manuscript a bit more detail regarding the actin and paxillin constructs that were transduced. Do we know that the actin and paxillin function normally in cells? If so, please state and cite appropriate sources. Also, how much of the exogenous protein is being expressed? Is it enough to cause changes in the normal protein balances and in cell behavior?</p><p>5. In Figure 6, which is a nice figure, but please explain in more detail what is being shown. For example, I think A&quot; is the square from A but please be clear. The color coding I assume indicate islets within the sealing zone. The synchronized actin fluctuations seem to reflect the persistence of the cores, not necessarily the speed of actin polymerization and depolymerization.</p><p>What do the little circles with the arrows mean in the bottom figure? Different synchronization?</p><p>In the model, integrins and associated proteins are attached to the core podosome, and the podosomes are connected through non-podosomal microfilaments. This seems reasonable but it is not clear how these attachments occur since the individual monomers in the podosome cores are flowing through the podosomes, entering at the membrane and exiting when the filaments depolymerize. This would exert tension, but it seems these must be transient, or subsets of the filaments might get stuck under the traction and not display the dynamics of the overall podosomes. The study in reference 23 looked at osteoclasts on apatite, so specific integrin ligand interactions presumably were not occurring. It would be perhaps interesting to do similar studies to what you describe on bone, on hydroxyapatite, to see if there were changes in the filament dynamics if integrin ligands were not readily available (though not for this manuscript).</p><p>In general, I think this is an excellent manuscript and will be a valuable contribution to the literature.

Our recent work on the structure of the actin network of the macrophage podosome (Jasnin et al., Nat. Commun. 2022, in press, available at BioRxiv) suggests not only the central role of the actin core but also the concerted role of radial actin filaments. The present manuscript also suggests that, within modules that we call podosome islets, different populations of actin filaments coexist: actin cores positive for cortactin and lateral filaments positive for actinin or filamin-A, and it seems logical that these different networks are mechanically coupled and coordinated to allow force generation and efficient sealing of the bone breakdown zone. We now discuss this P6, L245.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 2. (A) The pit formed by the osteoclast is not very convincing.

In addition, as requested by the reviewer, we made some experiments and now provide pictures of immunostainings of LAMP1 positive compartments that confirm the accumulation of secretary lysosomes in the middle of the sealing zone (new Figure 2supplemental figure 2C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) It was not clear to me what I am looking at, it looks like that if it is an actin ring there is very little ruffled membrane area.

As noted by the reviewer, there is no ruffled membrane visible in the middle of the sealing zone. The reason is that the plasma membrane at the ruffled border could not be preserved by the unroofing procedure, since we can directly observe the bone under the cell, with it typical cracks. We now clarify that the ruffled membrane is not visible in the corresponding Figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) I was not entirely clear how the heights being measured were established.

Each plane of this z-stack has been colored with a different color. Video 1 shows the entire z-stack while Figure 2C shows the z projection of the stack. This is now better explained in the corresponding Figure legend and Video 1 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The inter-podosome distance in osteoclasts (705 nm for direct neighbors (Figure 2E) and 443 nm for first neighbors (Figure 2F)) was also reduced, compared to macrophage podosomes (1770 nm for direct neighbors, Proag et al., ACS Nano 2015) and similar to what was measured in osteoclasts by (Deguchi et al., J Phys D Appl Phys 2020).
