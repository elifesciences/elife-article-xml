underdeveloped and dysfunctional ovaries. Modeling of the human mutation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> or specific knockdown of Nup107 in the gonadal soma resulted in ovarian-dysgenesis-like phenotypes. Transcriptomic analysis identified the somatic sex-determination gene <italic>doublesex (dsx</italic>) as a target of Nup107. Establishing Dsx as a primary relevant target of Nup107, either loss or gain of Dsx in the gonadal soma is sufficient to mimic or rescue the phenotypes induced by <italic>Nup107</italic> loss. Importantly, the aberrant phenotypes induced by compromising either <italic>Nup107</italic> or <italic>dsx</italic> are reminiscent of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP signaling hyperactivation). Remarkably, in this context, the metalloprotease AdamTS-A, a transcriptional target of both Dsx and Nup107, is necessary for the calibration of BMP signaling. As modulation of BMP signaling is a conserved critical determinant of soma–germline interaction, the sex- and tissue-specific deployment of Dsx-F by Nup107 seems crucial for the maintenance of the homeostatic balance between the germ cells and somatic gonadal cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Nucleoporin107</kwd><kwd>sex differentiation</kwd><kwd>ovarian development</kwd><kwd>Dpp pathway</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1788/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zangen</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Gerlitz</surname><given-names>Offer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2295/19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zangen</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Gerlitz</surname><given-names>Offer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>093913</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deshpande</surname><given-names>Girish</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003711</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levi</surname><given-names>Tgst</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Aliyah and Integration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levi</surname><given-names>Tgst</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A housekeeping nuclear transport regulator moonlights as a critical determinant of sex-specific regulation of a somatic stem cell niche during the development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Germline–soma communication lies at the heart of proper gonad development, and thus is essential for formation and coalescence of the primitive embryonic gonad until generation of the adult gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Doren, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staab et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wawersik et al., 2005</xref>). Gonadogenesis also relies upon coordination between cell autonomous and nonautonomous mechanisms that direct correct specification, patterning, and subsequent morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeFalco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nöthiger et al., 1989</xref>). Furthermore, the developmental program culminating in proper gonad formation must integrate both nonsex-specific ‘housekeeping’ functions and sex-specific signals to establish and maintain sexually dimorphic traits. Therefore, functional aberrations that affect individual molecular components, either sex- or nonsex-specific, result in various clinical disorders and infertility.</p><p>XX-ovarian-dysgenesis (XX-OD) is a rare, genetically heterogeneous disorder that is characterized by underdeveloped, dysfunctional ovaries, with a subsequent lack of spontaneous pubertal development, primary amenorrhea, uterine hypoplasia, and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes, 2008</xref>). We recently identified a recessive missense mutation in the nucleoporin107 (<italic>Nup107</italic>) gene (c.1339G &gt; A, p.D447N) as the causative mutation for isolated XX-OD (without other developmental deficits) in five female cousins from a consanguineous family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weinberg-Shukron et al., 2015</xref>). All men in the family had normal pubertal development and those married have multiple children, indicating a female-specific nature of the functional consequences induced by the specific point mutation.</p><p>Nup107 is an essential component of the nuclear pore complex, enabling both active and passive transport in every nucleated cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Walther et al., 2003</xref>). In light of this ubiquitous and vital function, the sex-specific and tissue-restricted nature of the <italic>Nup107</italic> XX-OD phenotype is highly intriguing. Of note, Nup107 and other NPC proteins were recently shown to have nuclear transport-independent activities including genome organization and tissue-specific regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guglielmi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gomar-Alba and Mendoza, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuhn and Capelson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pascual-Garcia and Capelson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raices and D’Angelo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D’Angelo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gozalo et al., 2020</xref>). Taking into account the high conservation of the aspartic acid residue altered by the mutation, we used a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model to assess Nup107 function in human female gonadal development. Our previous studies demonstrated that RNAi-mediated knockdown (KD) of <italic>Nup107</italic> in somatic gonadal cells led to female-specific sterility due to defective oogenesis, while male flies developed normally and remained fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weinberg-Shukron et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, generating a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of the human mutation by introducing an <italic>RFP-Nup107<sup>WT</sup></italic> transgene in <italic>Nup107</italic>-null flies rescued both lethality and fertility of female flies. Intriguingly, however, introduction of an <italic>RFP-Nup107<sup>D364N</sup></italic> transgene essentially recapitulated the familial XX-OD mutation. While it rescued lethality, the mutation resulted in severely reduced female fertility, ovariole disintegration, and extensive apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weinberg-Shukron et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A second mutation in <italic>Nup107</italic> (c.1063C &gt; T, p.R355C) has since been independently identified as a cause of XX-OD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ren et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, our analysis had predicted salt bridge interactions between the altered Aspartic Acid 447 in our study and the Arginine 355 altered in the second family, strengthening the notion that Nup107 performs an essential and conserved ovary-specific function during female gonadogenesis. Here, to uncover the molecular underpinnings of Nup107’s function, we analyzed the ‘loss of function’ phenotypes of <italic>Nup107</italic> at both the cellular and transcriptional levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Nup107</italic> mutant ovaries display an ovarian-dysgenesis-like phenotype</title><p>A closer inspection of <italic>Nup107<sup>D364N</sup></italic> adult ovaries revealed that the female gonads displayed phenotypic traits closely resembling human ovarian dysgenesis.

In which somatic cell type, the activity of Nup107 is necessary? The fact that KD of Nup107 using the <italic>tj-Gal4</italic> driver resulted in larval and adult aberrant phenotypes indistinguishable from those induced by the Nup107 loss of function mutation, indicates that the ovarian function of Nup107 is primarily required in the Tj-expressing cells. Notably, the <italic>tj-Gal4</italic> driver is not expressed in TF cells either at larval or adult stages. TF cells together with the CCs constitute the ovarian stem cell niche. During larval ovarian development, Tj is expressed in the ICs, CCs, and FSC progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knauff et al., 2009</xref>). CCs, which are derived from the ICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D’Angelo, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), are formed at the base of fully formed TFs at the transition from the third larval instar to prepupal stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ren et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levi et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the aberrant PGCs and ICs observed in the larval gonads are not due to impairment of Nup107 or Dsx activities in CCs. Likewise, FSC progenitors are also not the candidate cells for the site of action of Nup107 activity as they reside posterior to ICs with a minimal physical contact with only a few posteriorly located PGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Slaidina et al., 2020</xref>). Together these data imply that Nup107 acts specifically in ICs enabling them to effectively interact with the PGCs. Consistent with this notion, loss of <italic>Nup107</italic> affected the behavior of ICs such that these cells showed varying degrees of failure to mingle with the PGCs. A severe failure of ICs and PGCs to interact in the larval gonad is expected to cause an ovarian-dysgenesis-like phenotype as it is essential for the germarium development and ovariole formation. Likewise, a milder failure of intermingling in the larval gonad would allow for the formation of adult ovaries. However, in the adult ovary Nup107 activity is further required in ECs for the formation of their cellular extensions and regulation of differentiation of the GSCs. Thus, it will be important to determine in future studies the functional relationship between Nup107 and the signaling pathways which previously were shown to regulate the formation of these cellular extensions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>How does Nup107 execute its ovarian function?</title><p>Our studies have revealed that Nup107, a ubiquitously expressed nuclear envelope protein, is a crucial player during female gonad formation. How does an essential housekeeping protein critical for nuclear transport, perform such a sex- and tissue-specific function(s)? We envisage two possible scenarios, not necessarily mutually exclusive, to explain how the specific mutation in <italic>Nup107</italic> results in ovary-specific aberrant phenotypes. In the first scenario, Nup107 would specifically mediate nucleocytoplasmic translocation of factor(s) or downstream effector(s) required for ovarian development. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that Nup107 is involved in translocation of specific factors. For instance, in the event of DNA damage, Nup107 directly interacts with the apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1 also known as <italic>Drosophila</italic> ARK) and mediates its transport into the nucleus to elicit cell-cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jagot-Lacoussiere et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown in tissue culture that specific Nucleoporins, including Nup107, are required for nuclear translocation of SMAD1, an important downstream effector of the Dpp/BMP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Xu, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, accumulating evidence has documented that in addition to their primary function in regulating the exchange of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, NPC components may contribute to genome organization and tissue-specific regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raices and D’Angelo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D’Angelo, 2018</xref>) in a nuclear transport-independent manner. Consequently, such moonlighting activities may not be confined to the nuclear envelope which is the primary native location of these proteins. For instance, mammalian Nup107–160 complex (a subcomplex of the NPC of which Nup107 is a key component) has recently been shown to shuttle in and out of GLFG nuclear bodies containing Nup98, a nucleoporin that regulates multiple aspects of gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morchoisne-Bolhy et al., 2015</xref>). Consistently, Nup107 was shown to regulate levels of specific RNAs through gene imprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sachani et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, using an <italic>RNAi</italic>-based assay, Nup107 was identified as a positive regulator of OCT4 and NANOG expression in human ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Onal et al., 2012</xref>). In this regard, it is noteworthy that the recently published chromatin-binding profile of Nup107 suggested that Nup107 specifically targets active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gozalo et al., 2020</xref>). Altogether these data support the possibility that Nup107 affects transcription of specific target genes in a tissue- and sex-specific manner either directly or indirectly.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Master regulator Dsx acts downstream of housekeeping gene Nup107</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, Sex-lethal (Sxl) is the master determinant of somatic sexual identity, regulating a splicing dependent regulatory cascade resulting in the presence of alternatively spliced sex-specific isoforms of Dsx protein, Dsx-F and Dsx-M, in females and males, respectively. Subsequent dimorphic sexual development including sex-specific gonad morphogenesis is under the control of these Dsx isoforms. Consistently, Dsx proteins deploy components of the housekeeping machinery to achieve sex-specific development of the gonads. Thus, such ‘maintenance’ factors are unlikely to be involved in any regulatory capacity. Our data challenge this notion and demonstrate the presence of sexually dimorphic circuitry downstream of a ‘housekeeping’ nuclear envelope protein, Nup107, which regulates the expression the female form of <italic>dsx</italic>.</p><p>The similar sex-specific and ovary-restricted phenotype associated with compromised Nup107 activity in both humans and flies implies common underlying molecular mechanisms. We have identified Dsx as the primary target acting downstream of Nup107 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovarian development. The mammalian homologues of Dsx, the Dmrt family of transcription factors, also function during sex-specific gonad development. However, in mammals the main function of <italic>Dmrt</italic> genes in the gonad is to promote male-specific differentiation. While detailed functional analysis is not available, it is plausible that in mammals, another key female-specific transcription factor, like <italic>Foxl2</italic> (<italic>female-specific forkhead box L2</italic>) may act downstream of Nup107 to substitute for DsxF in flies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Dsx is essential for proper ovarian development</title><p>An interesting study by Van Doren et al. showed that the key components of the stem cell niche, that is the hub in males and the TFs in the case of females, are still formed in the absence of <italic>dsx</italic>, but this happens in a stochastic manner in both XX and XY <italic>dsx</italic> null mutant individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camara et al., 2019</xref>). These results indicate that in the context of the developing stem cell niche, Dsx may not act in an instructive manner, but is instead required to ensure that the proper program (male or female) is selected, which does not require Dsx activity for the execution of subsequent sex-specific development. Nevertheless, their findings clearly demonstrated that the resulting adult ovaries and testes are improperly formed, consist of aberrant structures, arguing that Dsx activity, is critical for proper gonad development outside of the stem cell niche. Our observations are consistent with this suggestion. Moreover, our experimental strategies and results differ in two important ways. First, our experiments have relied on reduction of only the female form of <italic>dsx</italic> that is <italic>dsx-F</italic> which allowed for sex determination and thus we did not observe ‘male’ structures or cellular identity transformations. Second, in our experiments we use <italic>tj-Gal4</italic> driver which is not expressed in the stem cell niche (TF cells) but in other somatic gonadal cells. This experimental design enabled us to uncover a novel developmental function of Dsx-F in ICs and their adult descendants, ECs. Supporting this notion Van Doren and Oliver labs showed that <italic>RNAi</italic> KD of <italic>dsx</italic> also resulted in small ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clough et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>AdamTS-A modulates BMP signaling via regulation of EC extensions</title><p>We have found that the secreted metalloprotease AdamTS-A is an important downstream component in the Nup107–Dsx axis, as KD of <italic>AdamTS-A</italic> results in phenotypes similar to those elicited by loss of either <italic>Nup107</italic> or <italic>dsx</italic>. In the adult ovary, these aberrant phenotypes include loss of EC membrane protrusions and expanded BMP signaling. This raised the question of how AdamTS-A regulates the range of BMP signaling. The ECM, which is produced and secreted by cells, has the structure of a complex fibrillar meshwork and provides structural support and tissue integrity, playing an active role in regulating cell behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rozario and DeSimone, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wolf and Friedl, 2011</xref>). ECM proteoglycans sequester and modulate chemical signals, including growth factors and guidance molecules. Furthermore, type IV collagens, major components of the ECM, were shown to restrict Dpp signaling in the ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). This is particularly intriguing, since in <italic>C. elegans</italic> Gon-1, the homolog of AdamTS-A, was shown to genetically interact with a type IV collagen (EMB-9) in the regulation of gonadogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubota et al., 2012</xref>). This raised the possibility that AdamTS-A, secreted by ECs, restricts Dpp movement in the germarium through cleavage of ECM components. However, by knocking down <italic>coracle</italic> in ECs, we have shown that disruption of their cellular protrusions, which encapsulate the germ cells, leads to expansion of BMP signaling. This implies that the activity provided by these cellular extensions is necessary and sufficient for restricting the BMP signal.</p><p>Thus, Nup107, Dsx, and AdamTS-A all function in ECs and are necessary for the formation and maintenance of the cellular protrusions which are required for restricting the BMP signal emanating from the GSC’s niche. Further, it appears that Adam-TS-A activity in the ECM is required for the formation and/or maintenance of these cellular protrusions. Our results indicate that in this context AdamTS-A regulates BMP signal distribution indirectly via regulation of the cellular protrusion maintenance. It is also possible that AdamTS-A utilizes these cellular extensions in order to reach the ECM away from the ECs in the GSC region, where it acts to restrict Dpp trafficking.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, our results support a model where Nup107 regulates the expression of <italic>dsx</italic>, either directly or indirectly, while Dsx directly regulates the transcription of multiple target genes including <italic>AdamTS-A</italic>. Our observations have also uncovered that Dsx<sup>F</sup> controls somatic niche function by calibrating the range and/or strength of Dpp/BMP signaling, possibly via modulation of the level and/or activity of the ECM components. Thus, it will be critical to elucidate how activities of nonsex-specific components such as Nup107 are coordinated with sex-specific regulation to achieve the precise specification and patterning underlying gonad development. This is of particular significance since modulation of BMP signaling circuitry is inextricably linked with the establishment and maintenance of stem cell fate. Importantly, as in the case of Nup107, BMP signaling is also required in a nonsex-specific manner in a variety of developmental contexts.These observations therefore open new avenues toward the critical examination of how a productive molecular dialog is established between nonsex-specific housekeeping machinery and versatile intersecting developmental pathways, in order to ultimately achieve proper sex-specific gonadogenesis crucial for fertility, and transmission of genetic information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>Flies were raised and maintained at 25°C on cornmeal yeast extract media (6 g methyl paraben, 24 g bactoagar, 3200 ml water, 78 g Brewer’s yeast, 224 g cornflour, 75 g sugar, 165 ml molasses, 48 ml propionic acid). <italic>yw</italic> was used as a wild-type strain.

RNA purity and concentration were determined by T-042 NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA, USA) and integrity by 2100 Bio-analyzer (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). Total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using SENSE Total RNA-Seq Library Prep Kit for Illumina (Lexogen, Vienna, Austria), according to the manufacturer’s protocol, with poly-A selection. Libraries were multiplexed and sequenced on Illumina’s NextSeq 500 machine, with a configuration of 75 cycles, single read. Raw reads were processed to remove low quality, error prone, and adapter sequences, according to Lexogen’s SENSE libraries recommendations. High-quality reads were aligned to the fly genome, assembly BDGP6, that was supplemented with the sequences of <italic>GFP</italic> and the <italic>RFP-Nup107</italic> constructs. Alignment was performed with TopHat, allowing for up to 5 mismatches per read. Differential expression analysis, for all genes from release 84 of the Ensembl database, was performed with the DESeq2 package, using default parameters, including the threshold for significance that was p<sub>adj</sub> &lt;0.1. Significant genes were further filtered to include only genes whose up- or downregulation was greater in the mut/yw comparison than in the wt/yw one. For that end, a difference of at least 0.1 between the absolute log2FoldChange (mut/yw) and absolute log2FoldChange (wt/yw) was used as the filtering threshold.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yukiko M Yamashita (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript uses genetics, cell biology and genomics tools to study the loss-of-function phenotypes of the Nucleoporin107 (Nup107) gene. This work showed that Nup107 acts in the somatic gonadal cells to regulate BMP signaling and proper germline differentiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries. Interestingly, these phenotypes resemble the syndromes in human XX-ovarian-dysgenesis patients. Using RNA-seq, the authors identified targets genes whose transcript levels changes in the nup107 mutants. Among them, two are considered as key targets, including <italic>dsx</italic> and AdamTS-A. Genetics analyses demonstrate similar phenotypes when compromising <italic>dsx</italic> or AdamTS-A in somatic gonadal cells; and for <italic>dsx</italic>, overexpression of it can rescue Nup107 knockdown phenotypes. Overall, these results should be of interest to researchers in germ cell biology and developmental biology fields. The presented results are well done and the data analyses are proper. However, at several places in order to reach the conclusions, more rigorous experiments should be performed (see revision details). This study, at the current format, is short of mechanistic insight how Nup107 function in the ovaries. In addition, the reviewers noticed inconsistent results in this work compared to previous published studies, such as the roles of <italic>Dsx</italic> and the consequences caused by high BMP signaling in the ovaries. In conclusion, this work has the potential but requires essential additional data to support the central claims.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Shore et al. studied nup107 mutant and somatic knockdown phenotypes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries. Most of the data of this manuscript are presented in a clear and logic manner. The major concerns include:</p><p>1. The major concern is the lack of mechanistic insight of Nup107. For example, how does Nup107 regulates <italic>dsx</italic> and AdamTS-A transcription? Is this role related to being part of the nuclear pore complex or in an unconventional manner?</p><p>2. Another major concern is the inconsistency with published studies for <italic>Dsx</italic>, where <italic>dsx</italic> mutant or knockdown show sex determination defects with intersexual phenotypes vs. in this paper no such phenotype was detected (Figure 5).</p><p>3. Some of the presented results are confusing: for example, data shown in Figure 6F indicate quite normal egg chambers therefore little differentiation defects, which are in contrary with their previous conclusion that Nup107 is required for proper female GSC differentiation. All these places need further clarifications.</p><p>4. Most of the phenotypes use RNAi, however, more controls are needed to show the efficiency of the RNAi. For example, in the germline, the authors should show nanos-Gal4 driven RNAi does knockdown target gene expression. In the somatic cells, the authors should add the temporal control of the knockdown experiments to understand the developmental stage when Nup107 is needed.</p><p>5. Similarly, for the rescuing experiments, which are critical for drawing quite a few critical conclusions for this paper, proper control to avoid interpretation caveats should be included.</p><p>6. The reviewers also noticed quite some critical literatures regarding female gonadal development are missing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall the studies were well done and the analyses are rigorous, here are some suggestions that will hopefully improve this study and make some conclusions more solid:</p><p>General suggestions:</p><p>1. For the cell type specificity for Nup107, I think in addition to the cell type-specific RNAi experiments, it would be more complete to add the cell type-specific rescuing experiments and results. For example, expression of Nup107 in Tj-positive somatic gonadal cells in the nup107 mutant background.</p><p>2. In several figures, nos-Gal4 driving RNAi does not yield to significant phenotype but tj-Gal4 does, I think it is important to show that the germline RNAi does lead to reduced levels of the target genes in germ cells.</p><p>3. It has not been mentioned about the basic cellular mechanism of the functions of Nup107. For example, which cell type is Nup107 expressed and what is its subcellular localization? Does these patterns change in the mutant background? In the Discussion, it was mentioned that Nup107 is a &quot;ubiquitously expressed nuclear envelope protein&quot;, but please show the results.</p><p>Specific suggestions on results and data analyses:</p><p>4. Figure 1, Nup107 RNAi, need to quantify the KD efficiency. Also, in Figure 1G, what do the average and deviation stand for as the Y-axis is for the percentage, is it from a number of independent experiments? Also, in the figure legend, need to clarify what statistical method was used for the P values. Scale bars are also needed for panel B, C, D, E, and F.</p><p>5. Regarding this statement &quot;Thus, GSCs can be readily identified by the presence of a round fusome, whereas their differentiated daughter cells display extended, branched fusomes.&quot; In fact, both GSCs and CBs have a round spectrosome, while more differentiated cystocytes have branched fusomes.</p><p>6. Given both GSCs and CBs have spectrosomes and each ovariole contains 2-3 GSCs and probably around 2-3 CBs, I wonder whether for this statement: &quot;Ovary staining revealed that unlike yw and Nup107WT germaria, which contained 2-3 spherical fusomes&quot;, the number would be a big larger than 2-3, and if this is true, then &quot;an average of 6 spherical fusomes per germarium&quot; may not be a phenotype?</p><p>7. Figure 3G quantifies germaria with few/no Cora extensions, as few is kind of subjective, it would be clearer to clarify the threshold for calling &quot;few&quot; in the figure legend. The same comments apply for Figure 5D quantification.</p><p>8. Please add more statistical analyses for panel 4D and 4J.</p><p>9. For RNA-seq, please show more analyses including biological replicates of the three different genotypes. Also, the authors mentioned that they used &quot;LL3 larval gonads&quot; for RNA-seq, I assume they mean larval ovaries but please specify it in the Results.</p><p>10. Regarding the experiments to show &quot;<italic>Dsx</italic> overexpression rescues the phenotypes induced by Nup107 loss&quot;, I think it is better to rescue driving <italic>Dsx</italic><sub>F</sub> using tj-Gal4 at the nup107 mutant background. The co-expression of both <italic>Dsx</italic><sub>F</sub> and nup107 RNAi using the same tj-Gal4 driver could result in a &quot;rescue&quot; due to competition for the same driver. Therefore, either rescue using the nup107 mutant background or for the rescue using tj&gt; <italic>Dsx</italic><sub>F</sub> + nup107 RNAi, provide the control with tj&gt; lacZ (or another non-specific UAS-transgene) + nup107 RNAi.</p><p>11. Regarding &quot;AdamTS-A acts downstream of Nup107 and <italic>Dsx</italic>&quot;, does overexpression of AdamTS-A also rescue nup107 mutant phenotypes?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors perform somatic cell manipulation using tj-Gal4 for a large majority of their experiments and observe defects in 3-to-5-day old females. Therefore, defects that are observed in the ovary could be due to transgene expression during adulthood (which the authors acknowledge in lines 388-392) of the manuscript. A simple test would be to combine tj-Gal4 with tubPGal80ts (a temperature-sensitive allele of Gal80) and perform the Nup107 knockdown and determine whether there are ectopic GSCs similar as without the temporal control.</p><p>2. It was previously shown that loss of Tkv in the developing soma results in ectopic GSCs in the adult ovary (Tseng et al., 2018), similar to results observed with loss of Nup107, <italic>dsx</italic>, and AdamTS-A (this study). Is BMP signaling in the developing gonad also disrupted?</p><p>3. The authors propose that Nup107 is required for proper differentiation of escort cells. How is that determined when there were similar numbers of escort cells in tj-Gal4 &gt; Nup107 RNAi compared to control. Loss of escort cell protrusions may not directly impact differentiation as there are many additional factors that can influence escort cell protrusions such as defects in EGFR signaling and changes in diet.</p><p>4. The authors show images for cleaved caspase (Figure 6F-G), but there is not any explanation in the text. Are the authors proposing an additional requirement for Nup107 in older egg chambers?</p><p>5. The conclusion that AdamTS-A is a direct target of Nup107 and <italic>dsx</italic> would be greater strengthened by rescue analysis (overexpression of AdamTS-A in a tj-Gal4 &gt; Nup107 or <italic>dsx</italic> RNAi).</p><p>6. The authors should indicate how region 2a in the germarium is being determined.</p><p>7. The 1B1 staining in Figure 2E is hard to see. Is there a better representative image that could be used?</p><p>8. It should be indicated throughout the text that BMP signaling and other defects observed in the adult germaria and ovary could be due to either developmental defects or adult-specific defects.</p><p>9. What are &quot;high&quot; spherical fusomes (line 276)?</p><p>10. There isn't a &quot;standard cornmeal yeast extract media&quot; (see Lesperance and Broderick, 2020). Please provide the ingredients and recipe used for food. Also, please indicate whether standard food was supplemented with wet yeast paste.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Nup107 and <italic>Dsx</italic> mutants show degenerated ovary, and they show that this is likely due to differentiation block (with high pMad in many germ cells). However, as can be seen in Figure 2, the ovarioles seem to have normal-looking assembly lines of egg chamber, and I wonder what is the exact cause of ovary degeneration. Can you please add a bit more details of exactly how stem cell differentiation defects lead to ovary degeneration in Nup107 or <italic>Dsx</italic> depletion?</p><p>– One cannot call <italic>Dsx</italic> as a 'target' of Nup107. What is the mechanism by which <italic>Dsx</italic> expression is changed in nup107 mutant?</p><p>– Is RNAi efficiency validated for all RNAi lines?</p><p>– What I am most confused about is the apparent inconsistency of the <italic>Dsx</italic> mutant phenotype described in this study vs. previous studies (Erika Bach, Mark van Doren and Erika Matunis' lab). Perhaps the data are not inconsistent, but previous work focused on sex transformation, and I am puzzled why the ovary of <italic>Dsx</italic> mutant described here looks quite normal in terms of sex identity. And it would be extremely helpful if the authors can place their data in the context of the previous work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72632.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Shore et al. studied nup107 mutant and somatic knockdown phenotypes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries.

Is this role related to being part of the nuclear pore complex or in an unconventional manner?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point and we thank the editors and reviewers for highlighting this issue concerning mechanism. It is important to remember that our studies have identified <italic>Dsx</italic>-F as an important and biologically relevant target/mediator of a nuclear envelope protein Nup107 which is part of the housekeeping machinery primarily required for nuclear transport. Recent studies have also ascribed a non-canonical role in transcriptional regulation to some of the members of this family of proteins including Nup-107. And thus, it will be of great interest to elucidate the precise function of Nup107 in regulating transcription and understand the possible direct as well as indirect ways it may employ to influence transcription of different genes including <italic>Dsx-F</italic>. As the reviewers correctly pointed out, we have not yet uncovered the specific molecular/biochemical activity that enables Nup107 to execute this function. However, we have identified <italic>Dsx</italic>-F as a critical, and sex-specific mediator of Nup107 function. We believe that this is an important and novel point of general significance and future experiments should focus on elucidation of precise mechanism underlying this regulatory activity of Nup107. These efforts will hopefully also shed light on ‘direct’ vs. ‘indirect’ nature of its function, Accordingly, we have elaborated on some of these possibilities in the discussion.</p><p>In sum, while our data do not describe the mechanistic underpinnings of this transcriptional regulation, we have uncovered the genetic network which explains how Nup107 executes its ovarian function/activity via <italic>Dsx</italic> and other related ‘targets’ discovered in our analysis including <italic>adamTS-A</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Another major concern is the inconsistency with published studies for Dsx, where dsx mutant or knockdown show sex determination defects with intersexual phenotypes vs. in this paper no such phenotype was detected (Figure 5).</p></disp-quote><p>This is another important concern expressed by both the editor and the reviewers. In our view, these differences in the outcomes are most likely a result of design of the individual experiments. In this regard, it is critical to consider the pleiotropic and complex requirement of ‘master’ switch genes such as <italic>Dsx</italic>. Consequently, compromising the activity of such regulators in a tissue-cell type specific manner can result in superficially inconsistent, and at times, even contradictory consequences. In the following we will consider a few scenarios previously reported in the literature that appear to be disparate (and were referred to by the reviewers). It should be noted that this description is somewhat anecdotal and not exhaustive but we hope that the explanation should suffice to alleviate the important concern regarding the discrepancies that confounded the reviewers and editor alike.</p><p>Camara et al. demonstrated that <italic>Dsx</italic> is required at the cellular level i.e. in a cell autonomous manner to prevent random switching of the sexual identity of the individual stem cell niches. Consistently, loss of <italic>dsx-F</italic> resulted in inappropriate specification/conversion of “male” cells in female ovaries. Reciprocally, compromising <italic>dsx-M</italic> led to switching of sexual identity in the male gonads (Camara et al., 2019).</p><p>However, their findings demonstrated that <italic>Dsx</italic> is critical for proper gonad development since <italic>dsx</italic> mutant adult ovaries (of either XX or XY flies) are clearly defective and underdeveloped (please see figure 1 C, E, H and I in their paper).</p><p>Altogether, their findings clearly demonstrated that the resulting gonads are improperly formed i.e. adult ovaries and testes consist of cells of mixed sexual identity arguing that both <italic>dsx-F</italic> and <italic>dsx-M</italic> activities are critical for proper gonad development in both sexes, a finding that is broadly consistent with our data.</p><p>Our results, however, differ in two aspects. First, Camara et al. used the dsx1 allele, an amorphic/null allele, which completely removes the function of <italic>Dsx</italic>. In contrast, compromised Nup107 or KD of <italic>dsx</italic> only reduced the levels of <italic>Dsx</italic>, thus allowing for sex determination and this is likely the reason that we observe no “male” structures or cellular identity transformation.</p><p>Second, in our experiments we have employed <italic>tj-Gal4</italic> driver which is not expressed in the stem cell niche (TF cells) but is able to drive transcription in other subtypes within somatic gonads. This specific manipulation allowed us to uncover a cell type specific developmental function of <italic>Dsx</italic> in the intermingled cells and their adult descendants<italic>.</italic> Supporting this notion studies from the Van Doren and Oliver labs showed that RNAi KD of <italic>dsx</italic> using <italic>dsx</italic>-Gal4 results in small ovaries. These data are cited in our manuscript (Clough E. et al., Dev Cell. 2014).</p><p>By contrast, the results regarding chinmo obtained by the Matunis lab, (Ma et al., Dev Cell. 2014) are not especially relevant to our studies (see below). This is in part due to the fact that loss of <italic>chinmo</italic> leads to generation of female splice isoform of <italic>tra</italic> (tra-F) which in turn leads to production of <italic>dsx-F</italic> and elimination of <italic>dsx</italic>-M, resulting in sex reversal, as shown by Bac lab (Grmai L. et al., PLoS Genet 2018).</p><p>Ma et al. engineered RNAi KD of <italic>dsx</italic> only in adult males in the Cyst stem cells (CySC) of the testes (Figure S3). They found that after knocking down <italic>dsx</italic>-F expression for two weeks, the morphologically normal looking testes contained over-proliferating early germ cells which were arrested as early spermatogonia. In addition, these testes contained abnormal aggregates of FasIII positive cells at the periphery that resemble follicle cells in this regard. So unlike loss of <italic>chinmo</italic>, loss of <italic>dsx-F</italic> in CySC did not lead to sex transformation of adult stem cells, i.e, feminization of CySC cells and their descendants. It is also noteworthy that the changes they observed were in the ‘male to female’ direction. Our studies differ in fundamental ways compared to these observations. First, we have analyzed and reported consequences of <italic>dsx</italic> knock down only in females. Also we did not observe any male-like sex transformations or structural alterations and thus we did not probe this issue further by specifically examining for male-specific molecular or protein markers. Rather, our study explores the roles of Nup107 and <italic>Dsx</italic>-F in female ovarian development and deployment of BMP signaling, thus in our opinion the issue of maintenance of sexual identity in adult testes is not pertinent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Some of the presented results are confusing: for example, data shown in Figure 6F indicate quite normal egg chambers therefore little differentiation defects, which are in contrary with their previous conclusion that Nup107 is required for proper female GSC differentiation. All these places need further clarifications.</p></disp-quote><p>The effect of loss of <italic>Nup107</italic> activity on the ovarian morphology and function is complex and it leads to highly variable phenotypic consequences. We still don’t fully understand why this is the case and more in-depth analysis will be necessary to explain the variable penetrance and/or expressivity. Supporting this conclusion, we have presented a detailed quantitative analysis of different phenotypes induced by the loss of Nup107 function (Figure 1). These include a variety of ovarian abnormalities ranging from severe dysgenesis (up to 50%) to normal sized ovaries (mild infertility) likely due to defective oogenesis.</p><p>However, it should be noted that the relatively normal looking ovaries still consist of several defects which is revealed upon closer examination. Consistently, in our previous publication we showed that the ovarioles from such infertile females with relatively normal sized ovaries are in fact full of aberrant egg chambers. As a result, such ovaries exhibit extensive disintegration of the individual egg chambers, unlike the wild type controls. The other phenotypes seen include condensation of DNA in the nurse cells which is accompanied by apoptotic cell death (Weinberg-Shukron et al., “A mutation in the nucleoporin-107 gene causes XX gonadal dysgenesis.” J Clin Invest. 2015).</p><p>In figure 7F we show an example of excess apoptosis in Nup107 KD ovarioles and in figure 7G we show how <italic>Dsx</italic> overexpression rescues this phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Most of the phenotypes use RNAi, however, more controls are needed to show the efficiency of the RNAi. For example, in the germline, the authors should show nanos-Gal4 driven RNAi does knockdown target gene expression. In the somatic cells, the authors should add the temporal control of the knockdown experiments to understand the developmental stage when Nup107 is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a useful suggestion and all the reviewers wanted us to confirm this. We have now demonstrated the efficiency of target genes KD using qRT-PCR (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><p>In addition, in order to identify the developmental stage where Nup107 activity is required, we performed temporal knockdown of Nup107 using a combination of <italic>tj-Gal4</italic> and a temperature sensitive form of the Gal4 repressor, Gal80ts: We allowed for normal ovarian development until hatching, at a non-permissive temperature, and only then knocked down Nup107 in ECs. Subsequent analysis of 4-5 days old female flies was performed. See new addition to manuscript, “Nup107 activity is continuously required in ECs for the formation of cellular extensions and regulation of GSCs differentiation” and new Figure 5 (line number 271).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Similarly, for the rescuing experiments, which are critical for drawing quite a few critical conclusions for this paper, proper control to avoid interpretation caveats should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and in our rescue experiments, we have provided the control with UAS-GFP.

For the cell type specificity for Nup107, I think in addition to the cell type-specific RNAi experiments, it would be more complete to add the cell type-specific rescuing experiments and results. For example, expression of Nup107 in Tj-positive somatic gonadal cells in the nup107 mutant background.</p></disp-quote><p>This is very complicated and cumbersome since we don’t have UAS-Nup107 flies, and in our mutant fly model, chromosomes 2 and 3 are occupied.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In several figures, nos-Gal4 driving RNAi does not yield to significant phenotype but tj-Gal4 does, I think it is important to show that the germline RNAi does lead to reduced levels of the target genes in germ cells.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer we have now performed this experiment and have verified, using qRT-PCR, the efficiency of the germline KD using nos-Gal4 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It has not been mentioned about the basic cellular mechanism of the functions of Nup107. For example, which cell type is Nup107 expressed and what is its subcellular localization? Does these patterns change in the mutant background? In the Discussion, it was mentioned that Nup107 is a &quot;ubiquitously expressed nuclear envelope protein&quot;, but please show the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We explain in the introduction that “Nup107 is an essential component of the nuclear pore complex, enabling both active and passive transport in every nucleated cell” (line number 61).</p><p>In addition, in our previous paper we showed the ubiquitous expression of WT RFP-Nup107 and that the mutation does not affect this expression.

Also, in Figure 1G, what do the average and deviation stand for as the Y-axis is for the percentage, is it from a number of independent experiments? Also, in the figure legend, need to clarify what statistical method was used for the P values. Scale bars are also needed for panel B, C, D, E, and F.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have quantified the efficiency of the Nup107 KD in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.

Regarding this statement &quot;Thus, GSCs can be readily identified by the presence of a round fusome, whereas their differentiated daughter cells display extended, branched fusomes.&quot; In fact, both GSCs and CBs have a round spectrosome, while more differentiated cystocytes have branched fusomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and have corrected the manuscript as follow: “Thus, GSCs and their undifferentiated cystoblasts can be readily identified by the presence of a round fusome, whereas their differentiated daughter cells display extended, branched fusomes (line number 168).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Given both GSCs and CBs have spectrosomes and each ovariole contains 2-3 GSCs and probably around 2-3 CBs, I wonder whether for this statement: &quot;Ovary staining revealed that unlike yw and Nup107WT germaria, which contained 2-3 spherical fusomes&quot;, the number would be a big larger than 2-3, and if this is true, then &quot;an average of 6 spherical fusomes per germarium&quot; may not be a phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our observations, normal germaria contain &lt;milestone-start /&gt;3&lt;milestone-end /&gt;-&lt;milestone-start /&gt;4&lt;milestone-end /&gt; spherical fusomes which include the GSCs and the CBs. Therefore, an average of 6 spherical fusomes per germarium is an aberrant phenotype. Our findings are in agreement with previous studies. See for example (Casanueva and Ferguson, 2004) who report “…we found that wild-type ovarioles have an average of 2.3±0.9 putative GSCs, and 1.2±0.8 putative CBs”. We are fully aware of other studies that report of 5.5 spectrosome containing cells per germarium (see for example: (Kirilly et al., 2011)). It is also possible that differences in diet or rearing conditions cause the observed differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 3G quantifies germaria with few/no Cora extensions, as few is kind of subjective, it would be clearer to clarify the threshold for calling &quot;few&quot; in the figure legend. The same comments apply for Figure 5D quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>In the main text, we write: &quot; In contrast, these cellular extensions were either dramatically reduced or completely lost&quot;. While we agree that the word &quot;few&quot; is subjective, in our case the majority of germaria are missing the extensions completely. Additionally, the comparison between those defined as having &quot;few&quot; and the amount in the controls is unequivocal: The difference between the two is obvious. Regardless, to resolve this issue, we have changed the figure legend to read: &quot;Adult ovaries demonstrate missing EC extensions&quot; (line number 241).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

Regarding the experiments to show &quot;Dsx overexpression rescues the phenotypes induced by Nup107 loss&quot;, I think it is better to rescue driving Dsx<sub>F</sub> using tj-Gal4 at the nup107 mutant background. The co-expression of both Dsx<sub>F</sub> and nup107 RNAi using the same tj-Gal4 driver could result in a &quot;rescue&quot; due to competition for the same driver. Therefore, either rescue using the nup107 mutant background or for the rescue using tj&gt; Dsx<sub>F</sub> + nup107 RNAi, provide the control with tj&gt; lacZ (or another non-specific UAS-transgene) + nup107 RNAi.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, this is very complicated since in our mutant fly model chromosomes 2 and 3 are occupied.</p><p>We have provided the control requested using UAS-GFP, which is now clarified in figure legend 7 (line number 389).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.

We have now tested this and discovered that, unlike <italic>dsx-F</italic>, overexpression of AdamTS-A is insufficient to rescue the phenotypes induced by Nup107 (or even <italic>Dsx</italic>) loss. This result corroborates the central conclusion of our manuscript regarding <italic>dsx-F</italic> being a crucial downstream effector of Nup-107 function. This information has been included in the manuscript (line number 428).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors perform somatic cell manipulation using tj-Gal4 for a large majority of their experiments and observe defects in 3-to-5-day old females. Therefore, defects that are observed in the ovary could be due to transgene expression during adulthood (which the authors acknowledge in lines 388-392) of the manuscript. A simple test would be to combine tj-Gal4 with tubPGal80ts (a temperature-sensitive allele of Gal80) and perform the Nup107 knockdown and determine whether there are ectopic GSCs similar as without the temporal control.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. We have performed this experiment and have included the data in the revised version. Specifically, in order to identify the developmental stage where Nup107 activity is required, we performed temporal knockdown of Nup107 using a combination of <italic>tj-Gal4</italic> and a temperature sensitive form of the Gal4 repressor, Gal80ts: We allowed for normal ovarian development until hatching, at a non-permissive temperature, and only then knocked down Nup107 in ECs.

It was previously shown that loss of Tkv in the developing soma results in ectopic GSCs in the adult ovary (Tseng et al., 2018), similar to results observed with loss of Nup107, dsx, and AdamTS-A (this study). Is BMP signaling in the developing gonad also disrupted?</p></disp-quote><p>This issue is very important that deserves a separate study. As such we believe that it is outside the scope of this particular manuscript however, we plan to address it in the future and thank the reviewer for this useful suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors propose that Nup107 is required for proper differentiation of escort cells. How is that determined when there were similar numbers of escort cells in tj-Gal4 &gt; Nup107 RNAi compared to control. Loss of escort cell protrusions may not directly impact differentiation as there are many additional factors that can influence escort cell protrusions such as defects in EGFR signaling and changes in diet.</p></disp-quote><p>This was also an insightful suggestion. We have considered all these possibilities to the extent possible while revising the manuscript. We found that knockdown of Nup107 in ECs, with either tj-Gal4 or c587-Gal4, in fact, did not affect their visibility/presence compared to control (Figure 4A-D; line number 240, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1; line number 983), implying that the observed effects are not due to cell loss.</p><p>By knocking down Nup107 in ECs, we show that the resulting ECs are defective in their ability to form the cellular extensions. Importantly, we also performed new experiments, where we knocked down coracle expression using the c587-Gal4 driver, showing that indeed loss of ECs protrusions per se is sufficient to cause dysregulation of BMP signaling and impairment of germline differentiation (Figure 4—figure supplement 2; line numbers 993 and Figure 4—figure supplement 3 and line number 1004).</p><p>It should be noted that we did not manipulate the diet or compromised other signaling pathway such as EGFR. More studies will have to be conducted to assess if Nup107 also affects EGFR pathway directly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors show images for cleaved caspase (Figure 6F-G), but there is not any explanation in the text. Are the authors proposing an additional requirement for Nup107 in older egg chambers?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not explaining this adequately in the previous version. In fact, this experiment was conducted as a follow up to our previous published findings, which showed abnormal cell death in egg chambers upon Nup107 loss (Weinberg-Shukron et al., 2015). Here, we show that <italic>dsx</italic> overexpression is able to rescue that phenotype as well. We have now clarified this point in the revised version (line numbers 370-373).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The conclusion that AdamTS-A is a direct target of Nup107 and dsx would be greater strengthened by rescue analysis (overexpression of AdamTS-A in a tj-Gal4 &gt; Nup107 or dsx RNAi).</p></disp-quote><p>This was an excellent suggestion. As recommended, we have now performed this experiment and found that overexpression of AdamTS-A is, in fact, insufficient to rescue the phenotypes induced by either Nup107 or <italic>Dsx</italic> loss, suggesting that other critical targets are also regulated by the Nup107-<italic>Dsx</italic> axis. We have incorporated these results into the manuscript (line numbers 428-435). Importantly, the negative outcome of this experiment establish that <italic>dsx-F</italic> is likely mediating effects of Nup-107 in this context and thus is a major mediator of this function. It is also consistent with the fact that both Nup-107 and <italic>Dsx</italic>-F share significant number of transcriptional targets and AdamTS-A is one such example.</p><p>Consistently, transcription factor <italic>Dsx</italic> has been previously shown to bind to AdamTS-A locus (Clough et al., 2014). As suggested by their findings, we found that loss of <italic>Dsx</italic> leads to a significant reduction in adamTS-A expression (Figure 8G). Taken together, these results indicate that <italic>Dsx</italic> regulates AdamTS-A directly. Overall, our results support a model where Nup107 regulates the expression of <italic>Dsx</italic>, either directly or indirectly, while <italic>Dsx</italic> directly regulates the transcription of multiple target genes including AdamTS-A. This important detail is now clarified in the revised manuscript (line number 586).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Can you please add a bit more details of exactly how stem cell differentiation defects lead to ovary degeneration in Nup107 or Dsx depletion?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this thoughtful remark by the referee. To clarify this point further, we have added the to the discussion the following explanation.</p><p>“… Together these data imply that Nup107 acts specifically in ICs enabling them to effectively interact with the PGCs. Consistent with this notion, loss of Nup107 affected the behavior of ICs such that these cells showed varying degrees of failure to mingle with the PGCs. A severe failure of ICs and PGCs to interact in the larval gonad is expected to cause an ovarian dysgenesis-like phenotype as it is essential for the germarium development and ovariole formation. Likewise, a milder failure of intermingling in the larval gonad would allow for the formation of adult ovaries.
