tumor suppressor. At the molecular level, Banp regulates transcription of metabolic genes via a CGCG-containing motif called the Banp motif. However, its physiological roles in embryonic development are unknown. Here, we report that Banp is indispensable for the DNA damage response and chromosome segregation during mitosis. Zebrafish <italic>banp</italic> mutants show mitotic cell accumulation and apoptosis in developing retina. We found that DNA replication stress and tp53-dependent DNA damage responses were activated to induce apoptosis in <italic>banp</italic> mutants, suggesting that Banp is required for regulation of DNA replication and DNA damage repair. Furthermore, consistent with mitotic cell accumulation, chromosome segregation was not smoothly processed from prometaphase to anaphase in <italic>banp</italic> morphants, leading to a prolonged M-phase. Our RNA- and ATAC-sequencing identified 31 candidates for direct Banp target genes that carry the Banp motif. Interestingly, a DNA replication fork regulator, <italic>wrnip1,</italic> and two chromosome segregation regulators, <italic>cenpt</italic> and <italic>ncapg</italic>, are included in this list. Thus, Banp directly regulates transcription of <italic>wrnip1</italic> for recovery from DNA replication stress, and <italic>cenpt</italic> and <italic>ncapg</italic> for chromosome segregation during mitosis. Our findings provide the first in vivo evidence that Banp is required for cell-cycle progression and cell survival by regulating DNA damage responses and chromosome segregation during mitosis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In order for a cell to divide, it must progress through a series of carefully controlled steps known as the cell cycle. First, the cell replicates its DNA and both copies get segregated to opposite ends. The cell then splits into two and each new cell receives a copy of the duplicated genetic material. If any of the stages in the cell cycle become disrupted or mis-regulated this can lead to uncontrolled divisions that may result in cancer.</p><p>Researchers have often used a structure within the eye known as the retina to study the cell cycle in zebrafish and other animals as cells in the retina rapidly divide in a highly controlled manner. A protein called Banp is known to help stop tumors from growing in humans and mice, but its normal role in the body, particularly the cell cycle, has remained unclear. To investigate, Babu et al. studied the retina of mutant zebrafish that were unable to make the Banp protein.</p><p>The experiments revealed that two stress responses indicating DNA damage or defects in copying DNA were active in the retinal cells of the mutant zebrafish. This suggested that Banp allows cell to progress through the cell cycle by repairing any DNA damage that may arise during replication. Banp does this by activating the gene for another protein called Wrnip1. Babu et al. also found that Banp helps segregate the two copies of DNA during cell division by promoting the activation of two other proteins called Cenpt and Ncapg. Further experiments identified 31 genes that were directly regulated by Banp.</p><p>These findings demonstrate that Banp is required for zebrafish cells to be able to accurately copy their DNA and divide in to two new cells. In the future, the work of Babu et al. will provide a useful resource to investigate how tumors grow and spread around the body, and may contribute to the development of new treatments for cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Banp</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd><kwd>tp53</kwd><kwd>cenpt</kwd><kwd>ncapg</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004199</institution-id><institution>Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Masai</surname><given-names>Ichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Banp is a transcription activator of cell cycle genes like <italic>cenpt</italic>, <italic>ncapg,</italic> and <italic>wrnip1</italic> to prevent genotoxic stress during rapid cell division and its repercussions on development and disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>BTG3-associated nuclear protein (BANP) (also known as Scaffold/matrix attachment region binding protein 1 (SMAR1)) was identified as a nuclear protein that binds to the matrix-associated region (MAR) of the Î²-locus of murine T cell receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birot et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chattopadhyay et al., 2000</xref>). MARs are often found near gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Scheuermann and Garrard, 1999</xref>) and constitute a periodic loop domain, through which chromosomal DNA is topologically organized inside the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blasquez et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hart and Laemmli, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, BANP functions as a tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaul Ghanekar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kaul Ghanekar et al., 2005</xref>). In humans, the <italic>BANP</italic> gene is located on chromosome 16q24, the genomic region of which often suffers from loss-of-heterozygosity in cervical and breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tsuda et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 1999</xref>). BANP interacts with tumor suppressor tp53 to modulate its functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaul Ghanekar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pavithra et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sinha et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sinha et al., 2010</xref>). Overexpression of BANP suppresses cancer growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhagat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Taye et al., 2018</xref>). However, these proposed cellular functions of BANP were based mostly on in vitro studies, and genetic deletion of <italic>Banp</italic> was reportedly unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grand et al., 2021</xref>), whereas <italic>Banp</italic> knockout mice show embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chemmannur et al., 2015</xref>), which makes in vivo analysis difficult. Thus, physiological functions of BANP, especially in cell-cycle regulation and tumor suppression, are still unknown. Very recently, it was reported that BANP binds to the nucleotide sequence TCTCGCGAGA, called the âBanp motifâ, which is enriched near the transcription initiation site of CpG island promoters, a genomic region in which it is difficult to replicate and repair DNA, and which regulates gene transcription in a DNA methylation-dependent manner. BANP promotes transcription of essential metabolic genes in pluripotent stem cells and terminal differentiated neuronal cells in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grand et al., 2021</xref>), indicating that BANP functions as a transcription factor at the molecular level. These findings raise the question, âHow is the BANP-mediated transcriptional network involved in cell-cycle regulation and tumor suppression?â.</p><p>The vertebrate retina is composed of six major classes of neurons and one type of glia (retinal ganglion cells [RGCs], three types of interneurons [amacrine cells, bipolar cells, and horizontal cells], two types of photoreceptors [rods and cones], and MÃ¼ller glia). These retinal cells are assembled to form the neural circuit responsible for phototransduction and visual processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dowling, 2012</xref>). During development, retinal progenitor cells are multipotent and give rise to all seven retinal cell types in response to extrinsic and intrinsic cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boije et al., 2014</xref>). An important characteristic of retinal development is that retinal neurogenesis is linked to cell-cycle regulation. In zebrafish, cell-cycle length of retinal progenitor cells is around 32â49 hr from 6 to 25 hpf, but shortened to 8â10 hr once retinal neurogenesis starts at 25 hpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that activation of cell-cycle progression is associated with neurogenesis. It is generally accepted that active cell proliferation may increase DNA replication errors, which induce DNA replication stress and subsequent DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blackford and Jackson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Waterman et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, factors involved in DNA replication checkpoint and DNA damage response are essential to ensure genomic integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murga et al., 2009</xref>). Otherwise, retinal progenitor cells accumulate genetic defects leading to apoptosis. Consistently, in zebrafish, retinal apoptosis occurs in the absence of DNA damage response regulators such as DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yildirm et al., 2015</xref>), Fanconi anemia group D2 (Fancd2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2003</xref>), and Ku80 (Xrcc80) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bladen et al., 2005</xref>). We also showed that retinal apoptosis occurs in zebrafish <italic>prim1</italic> mutants, in which DNA replication stress is chronically elevated. In this mutant, a central regulator of the DNA replication checkpoint, Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR), is activated, which subsequently activates DNA damage response regulators, Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and Chk2, leading to tp53-mediated apoptosis. Thus, DNA replication checkpoint and DNA damage response function as safeguards to ensure integrity of retinal cell proliferation and neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yamaguchi et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, developing retina is a highly proliferating tissue, in which a spatiotemporal pattern of neurogenesis is tightly coordinated by cell-cycle regulation. So, vertebrate retina provides a great model for studying how cell-cycle regulation, including DNA damage response, ensures neurogenesis and subsequent cell differentiation.</p><p>In this study, we identified zebrafish <italic>banp</italic> mutants, which show mitotic cell accumulation and apoptosis in the developing retina. DNA replication checkpoint and tp53-dependent DNA damage response are activated to induce apoptosis in <italic>banp</italic> mutant retinas. Thus, Banp is required for regulation of DNA replication and DNA damage repair. Furthermore, consistent with mitotic cell accumulation in <italic>banp</italic> mutants, our live imaging revealed that chromosome segregation fails to proceed smoothly during mitosis in <italic>banp</italic> morphants, resulting in a prolonged M-phase. Our RNA-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing enabled us to identify 31 candidates for direct Banp target genes that carry the Banp motif near their promoters. Interestingly, both zebrafish and human genes encoding two chromosome segregation regulators, <italic>Cenpt</italic> and <italic>Ncapg</italic>, and a DNA replication fork regulator, <italic>Werner helicase interacting protein 1</italic> (<italic>Wrnip1</italic>) are included in this list. Thus, Banp regulates transcription of <italic>cenpt</italic> and <italic>ncapg</italic> to promote chromosome segregation during mitosis, whereas Banp maintains transcription of <italic>wrnip1</italic> for recovery from DNA replication stress during S phase. Taken together, these data suggest that Banp is required for cell-cycle progression and cell survival in zebrafish retinas by regulating DNA damage response and chromosome segregation during mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Zebrafish <italic>rw337</italic> mutants show mitotic cell accumulation and cell death in the retina after 2.5 dpf</title><p>We performed large-scale mutagenesis using zebrafish and identified a zebrafish mutant, <italic>rw337. rw337</italic> mutants have smaller eyes and a smaller optic tectum at 4 days post-fertilization (dpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Around 6â7 dpf, <italic>rw337</italic> mutants die, indicating that this mutation is lethal. Next, we examined retinal phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At 1.5 dpf, the retina consists of retinal progenitor cells and early differentiating neurons. There was no difference in retinal morphology between <italic>rw337</italic> mutants and wild-type siblings. However, at 2 dpf, mitotic-like round cells had accumulated in the apical region of the retina in <italic>rw337</italic> mutants, suggesting mitotic arrest or prolonged duration of mitosis. At 2.5 dpf, in wild-type retinas, three nuclear layers, the RGC layer, the inner nuclear layer (INL) and the outer nuclear layer (ONL), and two plexiform layers, the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and the outer plexiform layer (OPL), had formed. In <italic>rw337</italic> mutants, only the RGC layer was observed; however, many pyknotic nuclei were observed in the outer retinal region. At 3 dpf, the RGC layer, IPL and INL appeared in <italic>rw337</italic> mutants. However, pyknotic nuclei were densely packed in the outer region of <italic>rw337</italic> mutant retinas. At 4 dpf, most dead cell debris had decreased in <italic>rw337</italic> mutants. The RGC layer, IPL, and INL were formed; however, no ONL was observed, despite very small, patchy photoreceptor-like cells. At 3 and 4 dpf, the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ), where retinal stem and progenitor cells are located, was observed in <italic>rw337</italic> mutants. Thus, RGCs differentiate, but cell death occurs after 2.5 dpf in <italic>rw337</italic> mutants.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Zebrafish <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutants show mitotic cell accumulation and cell death in the developing retina.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Morphology of wild-type and <italic>rw337</italic> mutant embryos at 4 dpf. <italic>rw337</italic> mutant embryos have smaller eyes compared to wild type at 4 dpf (red arrow).

However, many round cells reminiscent of mitotic cells are accumulated in the apical region of <italic>rw337</italic> mutant retinas at 2 dpf (open green arrowheads), suggesting mitotic defects in retinal progenitor cells. In wild-type retinas, three nuclear layers (RGCL, INL, and ONL) and two plexiform layers (IPL and OPL) are formed at 2.5 dpf. INL consists of amacrine cells (ACs), bipolar cells (BPs), and horizontal cells (HCs). ONL consists of two types of photoreceptors (PRs), rods and cones. However, only RGCs appear near the lens and the outer region was occupied by pyknotic nuclei, indicating dead cells in <italic>rw337</italic> mutants. At 3 dpf, INL is formed, but the outer region is still occupied by pyknotic nuclei in <italic>rw337</italic> mutants. At 4 dpf, pyknotic nuclei are reduced in <italic>rw337</italic> mutants; however, ONL and OPL are absent despite the small number of photoreceptor-like columnar cells in putative INL (PR, asterisks). At 3 and 4 dpf, the CMZ is maintained in <italic>rw337</italic> mutants (green double asterisks). (<bold>C</bold>) The <italic>rw337</italic> mutation is mapped in the genomic region flanked by two polymorphic markers, 070702B and zC93F2D, on chromosome 25.

In <italic>rw337</italic> mutants, T at the donor splice site of the intron between exons 4 and 5 (intron4/5) is converted to G, leading to the insertion of 52 nucleotides (red region) from intron 4/5. A new stop codon appears within this insertion. (<bold>E</bold>) Wild-type Banp protein has a coiled-coil domain, a BEN domain and a DNA-binding domain.

We cloned all these cDNAs from mRNA prepared from <italic>rw337</italic> homozygous mutants, sequenced them, and found that part of the intron sequence between exons 4 and 5 (intron 4/5) failed to be spliced out of the <italic>banp</italic> cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A nucleotide T at the exon-intron junction of exon 4 is converted to G, which alters the donor splice site of exon 4 from GT to GG.

The <italic>banp</italic> gene encodes a protein containing a coiled-coil domain, a BEN domain, which was identified as a novel domain found in chromatin associated factors and DNA viral proteins and proposed to mediate protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions during chromatin organization and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abhiman et al., 2008</xref>), and a DNA-binding domain, which includes a MAR-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Overall, zebrafish Banp protein shows high similarity to those of humans and mice, especially in the BEN domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). This mutation is predicted to generate nonfunctional, truncated Banp protein in <italic>rw337</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

First, we examined another nonsense mutation allele, <italic>banp<sup>sa12976</sup></italic>, which has a premature stop codon in exon 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>).

Second, we inhibited Banp using ATG-morpholino (MO) antisense oligos against Banp (banp MO). We confirmed MO specificity, because banp MO inhibited translation of mRNA encoding C-terminal EGFP-tagged wild-type Banp (banp(wt)-EGFP), whereas the control, 5-mismatch banp MO (banp 5misMO) did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4A and B</xref>). <italic>banp</italic> morphants phenocopied <italic>rw337</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Third, we overexpressed wild-type Banp in <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutants. We injected mRNA encoding Banp(wt)-EGFP into wild-type embryos at the one-cell stage. In developing retinas, Banp(wt)-EGFP protein was localized in the nuclei during interphase, whereas it spread into the whole cell region during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4C and D</xref>), confirming nuclear localization of zebrafish Banp. We expressed Banp(wt)-EGFP, N-terminal EGFP tagged wild-type (EGFP-Banp(wt)) and the <italic>rw337</italic> mutant form of Banp (EGFP-Banp(rw337)) in wild-type retinas. Only EGFP-Banp(rw337) was not stably maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4E</xref>).

Both caspase 3+ and pH3+ cells were increased in <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Furthermore, caspase 3+ cells were mostly located in the intermediate zone of the neural retina along the apico-basal axis, whereas pH3+ cells were localized at the apical surface of the neural retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1G</xref>), suggesting that apoptosis occurs mostly in retinal progenitor cells undergoing G1, S, or G2 phase, or differentiating neurons. Next, we examined whether apoptosis occurs in early differentiating retinal neurons, using double labeling with anti-activated caspase 3 antibody and ath5:EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1H</xref>). The percentage of ath5:EGFP- and caspase 3-double-positive cells to the total number of caspase 3+ cells was 9.44% Â± 13.1% in <italic>banp</italic> mutants at 48 hpf and higher than that of wild-type siblings (0.00% Â± 0.00%), although the difference was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1I</xref>). Next, we examined whether apoptosis occurs in mature retinal neurons. HuC/D is expressed in maturing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Park et al., 2000</xref>). At 48 hpf, anti-HuC/D antibody labeled RGCs in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1J</xref>). The fraction of caspase 3- and HuC/D-double-positive cells among total caspase 3+ cells was almost zero in both wild-type and <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1K</xref>), suggesting that apoptosis does not occur in maturing retinal neurons. Taken together, in <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutants, retinal progenitor cells primarily show mitotic defects at 48 hpf. On the other hand, apoptosis is likely induced in retinal progenitor cells at interphase or in newly differentiating retinal neurons, although apoptosis in newly differentiating retinal neurons is minor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1L</xref>). Since mitotic cell accumulation was transiently observed in the central retina at 53 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Bâ</xref>), and apoptosis was not overlapped with this mitotic cell accumulation area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1G</xref>), it is less likely that mitotic cells undergo permanent mitotic arrest leading to apoptosis. Rather, mitotic cell accumulation seems to be caused by prolonged mitosis.

Illumina sequencing generated more than 50 million paired-end reads from cDNA libraries. 27,771 protein-coding genes were detected. Among them, 258 genes were upregulated, and 81 genes were downregulated in <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The top 15 upregulated genes contained a significant fraction of tp53 dependent-DNA damage response regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that four tp53 target genes: <italic>p21(cdkn1a), puma (bbc3</italic>), <italic>ccng1</italic>, and <italic>mdm2</italic> are significantly upregulated in <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

We previously showed that the ATR/ATM-Chk2-tp53 DNA damage pathway induces retinal apoptosis in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yamaguchi et al., 2008</xref>).

Importantly, in zebrafish, the isoform â113tp53 is generated from the alternative transcription start site in intron 4. It was reported that FL tp53 initially activates transcription of â113tp53 after tp53 protein is stabilized in response to cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). â113tp53 preferentially activates transcription of target genes related to cell-cycle arrest to promote DNA repair and cell survival, whereas FL tp53 preferentially activates transcription of target apoptotic genes to eliminate severely DNA-damaged cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gong et al., 2020</xref>). Differential expression of tp53 isoforms is thought to regulate the balance between cell survival and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Indeed, quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that only â113tp53 was upregulated in <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

(<bold>G</bold>) Possible role of Banp in tp53-mediated DNA damage response pathway. DNA replication stress activates ATR, which subsequently promotes DNA replication fork recovery. Failure of stalled fork recovery causes DSBs, which activate ATM-dependent DNA damage repair. ATR and ATM inhibit Mdm2-mediated tp53 degradation. Stabilized tp53 initially promotes transcription of the â113tp53 isoform, which activates cell-cycle arrest genes and promotes DNA damage repair. Chronic activation of tp53 promotes transcription of apoptotic genes to induce apoptosis. Banp may normally suppress DNA replication stress by promoting DNA replication fork recovery or DNA damage repair. Banp may suppress genotoxic stress-mediated activation of DNA replication stress and DSB formation.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig4sdata1"><label>Figure 4âsource data 1.</label><caption><title>Data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4ADEF</xref>.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="elife-74611-fig4-data1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-74611-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig4s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 4âfigure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>DNA damage is induced in retinal progenitor cells in <italic>banp</italic> knockdown.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Labeling of 48 hpf wild-type retinas injected with STD MO and banp MO with anti-Î³-H2AX antibody.

Furthermore, ATR phosphorylates H2AX at stalled replication forks, and later, when single-ended DSBs form at persistent stalled forks, ATM and DNA-PKs act jointly to further propagate Î³-H2AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sirbu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ward and Chen, 2001</xref>). Thus, Î³-H2AX is a global marker of stalled replication forks and DSBs.

First, wild-type and <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutant retinas carrying the transgene <italic>Tg[ath5:EGFP]</italic> were labeled with anti-BrdU and anti-Î³-H2AX antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).

The BrdU+ fraction was significantly higher in Î³-H2AX+ cells than in total retinal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1F</xref>), indicating that S-phase fraction is 4.3-fold higher in DNA damaged retinal cells than in total retinal cells, in <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutants. Thus, replicative DNA damage is abnormally increased in retinal progenitor cells undergoing S phase. Next, we examined the fraction of ath5:EGFP+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1G</xref>). There was no significant difference in the ath5:EGFP+ cell fraction between the total retinal cells and Î³-H2AX+ retinal cells in <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1H</xref>).

There is no significant difference in the pH3+ cell fraction between the total retinal cells and Î³-H2AX+ retinal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1J</xref>). Despite of no statistical significance, interestingly, averaged fraction of pH3+ cells in Î³-H2AX+ retinal cells was lower than that of total retinal cells. Since <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutants show increase in Î³-H2AX+ cells, pH3+ cells and apoptotic cells at 48 hpf, it is likely that DNA damaged cells are eliminated by apoptosis in S phase prior to mitosis. This also suggests that M phase defects is independent of replicative DNA damage introduced in S phase. Although DNA damage may occur in post-mitotic neurons and mitotic cells in <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutants, it is likely that most DNA damage is introduced in S-phase of retinal progenitor cells due to replication fork stalling in the absence of Banp.</p><p>It is generally accepted that tp53 promotes DNA damage repair or eliminates DNA-damaged cells via apoptosis, so we expected that tp53 knockdown might enhance accumulation of DNA damage in <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutants. However, compared with standard-MO injection control (n=120.8 Â± 60.6/section), the injection of FL tp53-MO significantly reduced the number of Î³-H2AX+ cells in <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutant retinas (n=55.9 Â± 15.9/section) at 48 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and F</xref>). Injection of â113tp53-MO mildly reduced the number of Î³-H2AX+ cells (n=85.4 Â± 15.2/section); however, the difference was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and F</xref>). It is likely that neither tp53 nor â113tp53 repairs DNA damage in <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutants. Thus, under normal conditions, Banp probably suppresses DNA replication stress upstream of tp53 by promoting recovery from stalled forks or repair of DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>We already showed that, compared with Standard-MO injection controls (n=174.7 Â± 30.5/section), retinal apoptosis was completely inhibited by FL tp53-MO in <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutant retinas (n=0.50 Â± 0.58/section) at 48 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>; also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Next, we investigated whether retinal apoptosis in <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutants depend on â113tp53-MO, and compared inhibition levels of retinal apoptosis between FL tp53-MO and â113tp53-MO.

However, the number of pH3+ cells was still higher in <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutant retinas injected with FL tp53-MO than in wild-type control retinas injected with FL tp53-MO, indicating that there is a substantial tp53-independent fraction.

In wild-type retinas injected with control banp 5misMO, chromatin starts to be condensed in prophase. Then, kinetochores and a mitotic spindle appear in prometaphase, chromosomes are centrally aligned and start to be pulled toward opposite poles by mitotic spindles in metaphase, sister chromatids move toward the opposite poles in anaphase, and chromosomes arrive at opposite poles in telophase, whereupon cytokinesis starts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5âvideo 1</xref>).

Taken together, these data suggest that Banp regulates transcription of multiple target genes, including these cell-cycle regulators.</p><p>In summary, Banp serves essential functions in cell-cycle regulation in the zebrafish developing retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). During S phase, Banp suppresses DNA replication stress by activating transcription of a DNA replication stress regulator, <italic>wrnip1</italic>, and promotes DNA damage repair in concert with tp53-mediated DNA damage response. In M phase, Banp promotes mitosis by activating transcription of two chromosome segregation regulators, <italic>cenpt</italic> and <italic>ncapg</italic>, most likely via their Banp motifs. Thus, Banp regulates progression in S phase and M phase through transcriptional control of distinct sets of cell-cycle regulators. In <italic>banp</italic> mutants, stalled DNA replication and subsequent DSBs are accumulated in S phase, resulting in increase in apoptosis. In M phase, <italic>banp</italic> mutants show chromosome segregation defects, which prolongs mitosis but eventually complete it. So, DNA damage mostly induced in S phase is likely to be inherited through mitosis by daughter cells, which reenter the cell-cycle or become post-mitotic neurons. Neurons with a high level of DNA damage may undergo apoptosis. Thus, S phase defects and M phase defects influence each other along cell-cycle progression of retinal progenitor cells in the absence of Banp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A possible model of Banp functions in stalled fork recovery, DNA damage repair, and chromosome segregation during mitosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Our study reveals two major roles of Banp in cell-cycle regulation of retinal progenitor cells. In general, DNA replication stress, DSBs, and chromosome segregation defects induce genomic instability, which causes cancer or cell death. In S phase, Banp may suppress DNA replication stress by promoting transcription of the <italic>wrnip1</italic>, which protects stalled replication forks and promotes replication restart after replication stress. Failure of recovery from DNA replication stress induces DSBs, which activate ATM/Chk2/tp53-mediated DNA damage response. Banp may promote DNA damage repair in concert with tp53. ATR also activates tp53 through activation of Chk1 or crosstalk with ATM. Banp may suppress genotoxic stress-mediated DNA replication stress and DSBs. In M phase, Banp is required for chromosome segregation by promoting transcription of two mitotic regulators, <italic>cenpt</italic> and <italic>ncapg</italic>. Since a Banp motif is found near TSSs of the <italic>cenpt</italic>, <italic>ncapg</italic> and <italic>wrnip1</italic> genes, it is likely that these genes are direct targets of Banp.

In <italic>banp</italic> mutants, stalled DNA replication and subsequent DSBs are accumulated, leading to increase in Î³-H2AX+ cells. These DNA damaged cells undergo apoptosis. In M phase, mitosis is markedly prolonged due to chromosome segregation defects; however, almost all mitoses are eventually completed, so it is less likely that M phase defects directly link to apoptosis. It is possible that a fraction of Î³-H2AX+ cells survive and enter M phase, so DNA damage is inherited by daughter cells, which reenter the cell-cycle or differentiate into postmitotic neurons. Neuron with a high level of Î³-H2AX+ signals may undergo apoptosis. Thus, S phase defects and M phase defects influence each other through cell-cycle progression in <italic>banp</italic> mutants.

Very recently, it was reported that BANP binds to the Banp motif enriched near the TSS of CpG island promoters and regulates transcription of metabolic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grand et al., 2021</xref>). However, physiological functions of Banp remained to be discovered. In this study, we identified zebrafish <italic>banp</italic> mutants, in which retinal progenitor cells show mitotic defects and apoptosis during embryonic development. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of tp53-dependent DNA damage response regulators is upregulated in <italic>banp</italic> mutants. In non-stress conditions, tp53 is degraded through ubiquitination by an E3-ubiqutin ligase, Mdm2, and subsequent actions of proteasomes, keeping its protein level very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oliner et al., 1993</xref>). On the other hand, under stress, such as DNA replication stalling or DSBs, ATR, and ATM are activated and phosphorylate the N-terminal serine of tp53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Canman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Siliciano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tibbetts et al., 1999</xref>). This phosphorylation reduces the binding affinity of Mdm2 for tp53, resulting in stabilization of tp53 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shieh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yadahalli et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, the tp53 protein level is increased, and tp53 knockdown effectively suppresses retinal apoptosis in <italic>banp</italic> mutants. Furthermore, the number of Î³-H2AX+ cells is significantly increased in <italic>banp</italic> mutants, suggesting elevation of replicative DNA damage. These data suggest that DNA replication stress is elevated in <italic>banp</italic> mutants, resulting in activation of tp53-dependent DNA damage response, which subsequently induces apoptosis of retinal progenitor cells.</p><p>It is generally accepted that tp53 has dual, but opposing roles: cell survival versus cell death in response to DNA replication stress and DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lees et al., 2021</xref>). In the initial phase of the DNA damage response, tp53 binds to its alternative promoter located in intron 4 and activates transcription of an N-terminal truncated isoform, â113-tp53, which preferentially activates transcription of target genes related to cell-cycle arrest to promote DNA repair and cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). However, if DNA damage fails to be repaired, but accumulates chronically, FL tp53, in turn, activates transcription of apoptotic genes to eliminate DNA-damaged cells. Previous in vitro studies of human <italic>BANP</italic> suggest that BANP interacts with tp53 to promote transcription of cell-cycle arrest genes and to suppress transcription of apoptotic genes, leading to promotion of its cell survival role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sinha et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, our quantitative RT-PCR showed that transcription of â113-tp53 is significantly elevated in <italic>banp</italic> mutants, whereas the mRNA level of FL tp53 is very low. RNA-seq and ATAC-seq also confirmed a higher level of transcription and chromatin accessibility of â113tp53 in <italic>banp</italic> mutants. These data suggest that â113tp53-mediated transcription is selectively activated in <italic>banp</italic> mutants. Thus, it is important to clarify the role of tp53, including â113tp53 in mitotic cell accumulation in <italic>banp</italic> mutants, because pH3+ cells are markedly accumulated in <italic>banp</italic> mutant retinas prior to apoptosis. However, tp53-MO mildly inhibited accumulation of pH3+ cells in <italic>banp</italic> mutants. There is no significant difference in pH3+ cell accumulation between tp53-MO and â113tp53-MO, or between wild-type siblings and â113tp53-MO. So, these data suggest that the contribution of tp53 to mitotic cell accumulation in <italic>banp</italic> mutants is limited, and that a tp53-independent pathway is responsible for mitotic phenotypes. Our live imaging of mitosis in <italic>banp</italic> morphant retinas reveals that mitosis is significantly longer due to chromosome segregation defects; however, importantly, almost all mitoses are eventually completed in <italic>banp</italic> mutants, suggesting that accumulation of pH3+ cells in <italic>banp</italic> mutants is transient and depends mostly on prolonged mitosis, which is caused by chromosome segregation defects. At present, we have not observed S-phase arrest in <italic>banp</italic> mutants, because the fraction of BrdU+ cells in the total retinal region is not increased in <italic>banp</italic> mutants, although it is still possible that <italic>banp</italic> mutant retinal cells are partially arrested in G1 phase, because mRNA expression of a cdk inhibitor, <italic>cdkn1a</italic> (<italic>p21</italic>), is higher in <italic>banp</italic> mutants than in wild-type siblings. Taken together, we conclude that tp53 mainly mediates retinal apoptosis, and that its role in mitotic defects is limited in <italic>banp</italic> mutants.</p><p>Labeling with anti-Î³-H2AX antibody revealed that replicative DNA damage is increased in retinal progenitor cells in <italic>banp</italic> mutants, suggesting that DNA lesions that cause stalled DNA replication are abnormally induced, or stalled DNA replication and DSBs fail to be repaired in the absence of Banp. Importantly, the number of Î³-H2AX+ cells in <italic>banp</italic> mutant retinas was not increased by either tp53-MO and â113tp53-MO, suggesting that tp53 does not repair replicative DNA damage caused by loss of Banp functions. There are two possible functions of Banp in DNA damage regulation. Banp may maintain DNA replication integrity. BANP functions as a transcription factor to regulate expression of essential metabolic genes in pluripotent stem cells and differentiating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grand et al., 2021</xref>). Banp may promote transcription of DNA replication regulators. Our RNA-seq data identified 81 downregulated genes in <italic>banp</italic> mutants, compared to wild-type siblings. Among them, 31 genes have a Banp motif near their TSSs and contain eight cell-cycle regulatory genes. Among these eight cell-cycle regulators, interestingly, we identified <italic>wrnip1</italic>. WRNIP1 protects stalled replication forks, especially fork reversal, from MRE11- and SLX4-mediated degradation and promotes fork restart by cooperating with BRCA2 to stabilize RAD51 on single-stranded DNA of stalled forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leuzzi et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leuzzi et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Porebski et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, <italic>wrnip1</italic> regulates another fork protection mechanism called damage bypass, consisting of translesion synthesis (TLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yoshimura et al., 2019</xref>) and template switching (TS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">JimÃ©nez-MartÃ­n et al., 2020</xref>). WRNIP1 also functions in interstrand crosslink repair (ICR) by promoting the recruitment of FANCD2/FANCI complex at the damaged site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Socha et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, <italic>wrnip1</italic> mRNA expression is markedly reduced in <italic>banp</italic> mutants, suggesting that Banp is required for maintenance of <italic>wrnip1</italic> transcription. In this case, loss of Wrnip1 may cause defects in stalled fork stabilization and ICR repair, leading to genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kondratick et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nickoloff et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scully et al., 2021</xref>). It will be interesting to examine whether knockdown of zebrafish <italic>wrnip1</italic> causes similar defects in DNA replication stress and apoptosis to <italic>banp</italic> mutants. Another possibility is that Banp regulates DNA repair independent of its role as a transcription factor. A previous study using human in vitro culture cells revealed that BANP promotes HDAC6-mediated deacetylation of a DNA end-joining protein, Ku70, which is required for non-homologous end-joining repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chaudhary et al., 2014</xref>). Since Ku70 is recruited to DSB sites after Î³-H2AX accumulation, Ku70 is an interesting candidate. Since knockdown of Ku70 along with radiation-induced DNA damage markedly induces apoptosis in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bladen et al., 2007</xref>), it will be interesting to investigate whether this scenario occurs in zebrafish.</p><p>In addition to the role of Banp in DNA replication stress and DNA repair mechanisms, mRNA expression of two important regulators of chromosome segregation, <italic>ncapg</italic> and <italic>cenpt</italic>, is significantly downregulated in <italic>banp</italic> mutants. ATAC-seq and RNA-seq confirmed that chromatin accessibility is decreased near the TSSs of these genes in <italic>banp</italic> mutants, suppressing transcription of these mRNAs. Our de novo motif enrichment study identified the Banp motif sequence, TCTCGCGAGA, as the most enriched motif of closed chromatin regions of downregulated genes. Thus, it is highly likely that Banp directly binds to the Banp motifs of both <italic>ncapg</italic> and <italic>cenpt</italic>, opens their chromatin, and promotes their transcription. Consistently, as reported in zebrafish <italic>ncapg</italic> and <italic>cenpt</italic> knockdown embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Seipold et al., 2009</xref>), chromosome segregation is compromised in mitosis of retinal progenitor cells in <italic>banp</italic> mutants, suggesting that Banp is an essential regulator of mitosis. Since a Banp motif is found in promoter regions of <italic>Ncapg</italic> and <italic>Cenpt</italic> in mice and humans, and Chip sequencing with BANP antibody validated TSS peaks of both <italic>Ncapg</italic> and <italic>Cenpt</italic> genes in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grand et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mathai et al., 2016</xref>), it will be interesting to confirm whether BANP regulates chromosome segregation during mitosis in mammals.</p><p>Lastly, we identified 26 candidate Banp direct-target genes, including cell-cycle regulators such as <italic>ncapg, cenpt</italic> and <italic>wrnip1,</italic> which carry Banp motifs near their TSSs, and show markedly decreased chromatin accessibility and transcription in the absence of Banp. This gene list will provide a useful starting point to investigate the Banp-mediated transcriptional network. It was reported that binding of BANP to Banp motifs is dependent on DNA methylation of Banp motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grand et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that an epigenetic mechanism regulates Banp-mediated transcription. Thus, zebrafish <italic>banp</italic> mutants provide an excellent new model in which to study how epigenetic factors regulate cellular processes for embryonic development via Banp motifs of CpG island promoter genes. In addition, BANP has been proposed as a tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Malonia et al., 2011</xref>). It is generally accepted that DNA methylation of essential genes is altered in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baylin et al., 2001</xref>), which is expected to modify the pattern of gene transcription through Banp motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grand et al., 2021</xref>). It will be interesting to investigate how the Banp-mediated transcription profile is changed in cancer models of zebrafish. Future research on zebrafish <italic>banp</italic> mutants will provide more in-depth understanding of cancer growth and metastasis, as well as new insights into development of therapeutics for human tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish strains and maintenance</title><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were maintained using standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Westerfield, 1993</xref>).

Seven heads removed from each group were homogenized together in sample buffer (125 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 X Protease inhibitor) and used as one sample. Appropriate volumes of samples were diluted to provide equal protein amounts and used for SDS-PAGE (BIO-RAD, Mini-PROTEAN TGX Gels). Western blot analysis was performed on 3 samples for wild-type and <italic>banp</italic><sup>rw337</sup> mutants, respectively, according to standard protocols using anti-tp53 antibody (GeneTex, GTX128135) at a 1:1000 dilution. Î²-actin protein level was evaluated by western blot analysis of rehybridized membranes with anti-Î²-actin antibody (Sigma, A5441) at a 1:5,000 dilution, and used to normalize tp53 protein level for each sample. For secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Amersham, NA931 and NA934) were used. Enzyme activity was detected using Immunostar LD (Wako) and luminescence was imaged and quantified using iBright 1,500 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Live imaging</title><p>Banp-MO was injected into one-cell-stage eggs of <italic>Tg[h2afv:GFP; EF1Î±: mCherry-zGem]</italic> transgenic line. Banp-5misMO was used as a control. Two-dpf embryos were anesthetized using 5% (v/v) Tricane (3-amino benzoic acid-ethylester) and mounted laterally using 1% low-melting agarose on a depression slide to image retinas without left or right preference. Time-lapse images were obtained every 1.1 min using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM710, Zeiss) with a 40 Ã 0.8/1.0 W Plane Apochromat lens. Data were evaluated using IMARIS software (ver.9.1.2 Bitplane) to calculate the time taken to complete each cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>RNA sequencing</title><p>Embryo heads were homogenized using a Polytron 1,200E homogenizer (KINEMATICA) with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was isolated using a Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Kit (ZYMO RESEARCH) from three replicates of <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutant and wild-type embryos at 48 hpf. Each sample contained a pool of 7 embryo heads. RNA isolation was followed by library preparation for sequencing using an NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina according to the manufacturerâs instructions. 151-base paired-end sequencing was performed using a NovaSeq6000 SP. The quality of sequenced reads was evaluated with FastQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrews, 2019</xref>) and adaptor trimming and quality filtering were done with fastp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Cleaned reads were then mapped to the zebrafish reference genome (GRCz11) using hisat2.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2019</xref>) and mapped reads were counted with FeatureCounts from the Subread package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liao et al., 2014</xref>) using annotation from Ensembl (Danio_rerio.GRCz11.95.gtf). Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis was performed using the EdgeR package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Robinson and Oshlack, 2010</xref>). Genes with false discovery rates (FDR)&lt;0.01 were considered significant DEGs. The EnhancedVolcano package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blighe et al., 2022</xref>) was used to create a volcano plot with Log<sub>2</sub>FoldChange (wildtype â mutant) values and FDR calculated with EdgeR. Differences in alternative splicing between mutant and wild type were tested using the DEXseq package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anders et al., 2012</xref>). Adjusted p-values &lt; 0.01 were considered as significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>ATAC sequencing</title><p>Forty-eight-hpf embryos were used for ATAC sequencing. We used the Kaestner Lab ATAC seq protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackermann, 2019</xref>) until library preparation, followed by sequencing using a NovaSeq6000 SP. We generated reads for three independent <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutant samples, as well as three independent <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> wild-type sibling samples. Each sample contained a pool of 3 embryo heads. A quality check of reads was performed using FastQC. Reads from each sample were adaptor trimmed and aligned using fastp and Bowtie2 to the zebrafish reference genome (GRCz11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) respectively. For quality control, aligned reads were filtered for low-quality reads, non-unique alignments, and PCR duplicates using samtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yan et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, alignment files were peak-called using Genrich, with removal of mitochondrial reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaspar, 2019</xref>). Differences in differentially enriched peaks in wild-type and mutant embryos were identified using the DiffBind R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stark and Brown, 2011</xref>). The obtained peaks were annotated using the annotatePeaks tool of HOMER software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). The findMotifsGenome tool of HOMER was used to find enriched motifs in differentially expressed peaks. To compare coverage tracks across genes of interest in <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutants and wild-type fish in RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, distributions of mapped reads in each replicate were averaged and plotted with SparK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kurtenbach and William Harbour, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistics</title><p>Significant differences between groups (wild type vs mutant) were tested using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Version 9.1.2). The number of samples used per experiment is presented in figures or figure legends. Tests used to calculate statistical significance are mentioned in figure legends.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard White as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sarah R Hengel (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Substantially revise the text. All reviewers agreed that the data could be of potential interest and impact, but raised concerns about the presentation of the results. As such the impact and relevance beyond the biologist in the field of zebrafish eye development was difficult to discern. It needs to be written so that someone outside of the retina field understand the implications.</p><p>2) Add additional experimentation to better illustrate the new Banp functions in replication stress and mitosis. As is the reviewers agreed that in particular the proposed function during mitosis appears internally inconsistent and contradictory. As one example, the term mitotic arrest usually reflects a failure to complete mitosis, typically as a metaphase arrest. Once anaphase is committed to (chromosome segregation), there is no arrest that the reviewers are aware of e.g. in late anaphase.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Banp mutants have numerous defects, and perhaps this is not unexpected for a nuclear matrix protein. I'm left wondering what insights are gained from the study beyond that the nuclear matrix is required for numerous cell cycle events?</p><p>2. Why did the authors focus on the eye? It is unclear whether this study revealed a sensitivity to eye development regarding nuclear matrix function specifically, or it was just a convenient place in the animal to look.</p><p>3. I found the conclusions regarding mitosis to be contradictory. The authors at first emphasize mitotic arrest, but then characterize chromosome segregation defects. How can chromosomes segregate if cells are arrested in mitosis?</p><p>4. It would be important to know whether the authors can rule out that S-phase defects cause the M phase defects, or vice versa. Could there be a primary defect, rather than multiple independent defects as the authors conclude?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To increase the impact of the work, provide a better understanding of how loss of banp leads to induction of DNA damage (currently presented as a question mark in Figure 7).</p><p>Reorganize the figures, the text or both so that the reader can easily recognize all the data that support the same point.</p><p>Make sure that all conclusions are supported by data, either new or published.</p><p>Line 229: 'Histone H3 (pH3) antibody, which labels mitotic cells in pro-metaphaseâ¦' Actually, pH3 is seen also in other stages of mitosis and not just pro-metaphase, so the statement should be corrected.</p><p>Line 375: If 'mitotic arrest in banprw337 mutants is mostly mediated by a tp53-independent mechanism.' Provide an explanation for the reduction in pH3 cells with FL tp53 MO in Figure 4E.</p><p>Line 319: why do the authors suggest that 'FL tp53 triggers Î113tp53 transcription in banprw337 mutants'? Is full length p53 known to promote its own transcription from an alternate promoter? If so, please provide data or a citation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Banp regulates DNA damage response and chromosome segregation during the cell cycle in zebrafish retina&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Richard White (Senior Editor), Katharina Schlacher (Reviewing Editor) and reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers noted that the manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before publication, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Line 288-289: The authors changed 'prometaphase' to 'metaphase', but this is inaccurate. The correct statement should indicate that pH3 is seen at many stages of mitosis including prometaphase, metaphase and early anaphase.</p><p>2) A major concern from the previous version remains to be clarified better, which is the relationship between the DNA damage in S-phase and the mitotic defects. In particular it needs to be stated clearly if these two defects are truly independent or if one precedes the other. If the S phase defects are independent of the mitotic defects, then few PH3+ cells will have foci. The authors state line 419-425 &quot;There is no significant difference in the pH3+ cell fraction between in the total retinal cells and Î³-H2AX+ retinal cells (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1J). While there is no significant difference it is slightly decreased so this data could potentially address this issue, but should be clearly presented and interpreted. E.g. if S-phase defects are independent of M-phase defects but S-phase defects precede mitosis, then what happens to those damaged S-phase cells? A concise clarification in the text can address this issue.</p><p>3) The cartoons/models should be revised into multiple model panels that are each simplified and concentrate on the essential information, as well as a temporal progression be added (e.g. currently it appears that the BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells are derived from M phase cells, is this correct?</p><p>An additional suggestion but not a requirement is to consider adding wrnip1 data to the abstract. The link to DNA damage is one of the key findings of the work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74611.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Substantially revise the text.

Then we introduce the zebrafish retina and its contribution to research on cell-cycle regulation and DNA damage response. We also trimmed some details from the description of mechanisms of retinal development. We believe that these arrangements better emphasize the impact of our findings on Banp and will enable readers to more easily understand the research background of our studies about the role of Banp in cell-cycle and DNA damage response.</p><p>2) In the results, we have combined the paragraph on reduced expression of chromosome segregation regulators <italic>ncapg</italic> and <italic>cenpt</italic> in <italic>banp</italic> mutants with the paragraph on live imaging of chromosome segregation phenotypes in banp morphants. These data are shown in a new Figure 5. Accordingly, the impact of Banp motifs on Banp downstream target genes is summarized in an independent section and shown in a new Figure 6. These rearrangements make the role of Banp in cell-cycle regulation more clear, and should increase impact of our findings.</p><p>To address the concerns above, we have revised the manuscript as follows.</p><p>1) To better illustrate the new Banp functions in replication stress and DNA damage repair, among potential direct targets of Banp, we examined <italic>wrnip1</italic>, which reportedly protects stalled forks from degradation and promotes fork restart after replication stress. We show that loss of Banp compromise expression of <italic>wrnip1,</italic> potentially leading to one cause of replication stress (Figure 6 and Figure 6âfigure supplement 2).</p><p>2) For data consistency, we have changed âmitotic arrestâ into âmitotic cell accumulationâ or simply âmitotic defectsâ in descriptions of <italic>banp</italic> mutant phenotypes, because âmitotic arrestâ may mislead the readers to think that M phase progression is permanently arrested during mitosis, which is contradictory to our live imaging observations that mitosis is markedly prolonged, but eventually completed in <italic>banp</italic> morphants.</p><p>We have provided more detail about these additional experiments in a point-by-point response to each refereeâs comments.

I'm left wondering what insights are gained from the study beyond that the nuclear matrix is required for numerous cell cycle events?</p></disp-quote><p>As we mentioned in the Introduction, BANP was originally identified as a nuclear protein that binds matrix-associated regions (MARs). MARs are regulatory DNA sequences mostly present upstream of various promoters. MAR-binding proteins interact with numerous chromatin-modifying factors and regulate gene transcription. In addition, it was reported that BANP suppresses tumor growth, and that loss of BANP heterozygosity is associated with several cancers in humans. So, before we started this <italic>banp</italic> mutant analysis, we expected that loss of Banp might cause defects in the cell cycle. However, because the majority of prior studies on BANP have been done using in vitro systems, its physiological function was still ambiguous. Very recently, it was reported that BANP functions as a transcription factor that binds to Banp motifs and regulates essential metabolic genes. In this study, rather than focusing on the MAR domain, we used this Banp motif to search for direct transcriptional targets of Banp that may function in cell proliferation and differentiation in zebrafish retina. Our study provides the first in vivo evidence that Banp serves as an essential transcription activator of cell cycle genes, including <italic>cenpt</italic>, <italic>ncapg</italic>, and <italic>wrnip1</italic> via Banp motifs. We believe that such a list of Banp direct target genes provides a new research avenue to discover more precisely how Banp functions in tumor suppression and that it will contribute to medical research on cancer therapy.</p><p>Our study did not investigate how the nuclear matrix itself is involved in Banp mutant phenotypes. However, since it is likely that the interaction between MAR domains and nuclear matrix may influence chromatin organization in the nucleus, BANP functions must depend on nuclear matrix configuration. So, while this question is interesting, we think it is beyond the scope of our current study. In addition, we are afraid that the term âmatrix-associated nuclear proteinâ might mislead people to think that Banp is a regulator of nuclear matrix. To better clarify the relationship between Banp and nuclear matrix, we have revised ânuclear matrix-associated proteinâ -&gt; ânuclear matrix associated region-binding proteinâ in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Why did the authors focus on the eye? It is unclear whether this study revealed a sensitivity to eye development regarding nuclear matrix function specifically, or it was just a convenient place in the animal to look.</p></disp-quote><p>Historically, molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation in the nervous system has been intensively studied using the vertebrate retina, because retinal neuronal cell types are fewer than those of other brain regions and its neural circuits are also simpler than those of other brain regions. Furthermore, many research groups, including us, have identified zebrafish retinal mutants, including mutants that show defects in cell-cycle regulation and DNA damage response. Indeed, our group has investigated this topic using retinal apoptotic mutants for the last 20 years. Thus, we focus on the zebrafish retina, because the retina is an excellent in vivo model system to dissect mechanisms of cell-cycle regulation and DNA damage response.</p><p>To emphasize the importance of this excellent in vivo model system to researchers beyond the retinal community, we have revised in the Introduction as follows.</p><p>The developing retina is a highly proliferating tissue, in which a spatiotemporal pattern of neurogenesis is tightly coordinated by cell-cycle regulation. So, vertebrate retina provides a great model for studying how cell-cycle regulation, including DNA damage response ensures neurogenesis and subsequent cell differentiation. (Line 109-113).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I found the conclusions regarding mitosis to be contradictory. The authors at first emphasize mitotic arrest, but then characterize chromosome segregation defects. How can chromosomes segregate if cells are arrested in mitosis?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion due to our incorrect usage of the term âmitotic arrest.â Mitotic arrest was one of possibilities that we considered when first examining <italic>banp</italic> mutant phenotypes, in which we just observed accumulation of mitotic (pH3+) cells. However, when we examined mitosis in Banp morphants using live imaging, we found that mitosis duration is significantly prolonged because of chromosome segregation defects in Banp morphants, but that all 28 mitoses we examined eventually completed cytokinesis. Thus, we finally concluded that mitotic cells are not permanently arrested in M phase, but that mitosis is prolonged. To prevent confusion, we have changed âmitotic arrestâ to âmitotic cell accumulationâ or simply âmitotic defectsâ in the Results section on <italic>banp</italic> mutant phenotype analysis (shown in Figures 2 and 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It would be important to know whether the authors can rule out that S-phase defects cause the M phase defects, or vice versa. Could there be a primary defect, rather than multiple independent defects as the authors conclude?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #3 for this suggestion. Interdependence between S phase defects and M phase defects is important to correctly interpret the data on cell-cycle regulation, especially cell-cycle checkpoint and DNA damage response. Indeed, there are interesting reports using in vitro cell culture systems indicating that replication stress induces mitotic death, through specific pathways for example, Masamsetti et al., 2019, Nat. Comm. 10.4224. However, this topic is still challenging to dissect in vivo.</p><p>In terms of our findings on Banp functions in zebrafish, we found that two chromosome segregation regulators, <italic>ncapg</italic> and <italic>cenpt</italic>, are direct transcription targets of Banp, and that it is likely that loss of Banp causes mitotic defects through downregulation of <italic>cenpt</italic> and <italic>ncapg</italic>. From this point, we conclude that mitotic defects are primary effects of the loss of Banp. The next question is how the loss of Banp stalls DNA replication forks and causes subsequent cell death. To address this question, we examined whether Banp direct targets include cell-cycle regulators, especially in S phase. We found that <italic>wrnip1</italic> is an interesting candidate, because Wrnip1 reportedly protects stalled replication forks and promotes fork restart after DNA replication stress. In addition, Wrnip1 functions in interstrand crosslink repair (ICR). We found that the mRNA expression level of <italic>wrnip1</italic> is markedly decreased in <italic>banp</italic> mutants, suggesting the possibility that DNA replication stress may be caused by reduction of <italic>wrnip1</italic> expression in <italic>banp</italic> mutants. We present these data in new Figure 6âfigure supplement 2. We have revised the possible role of Banp in cell-cycle regulation in new Figure7. Under this scenario, we consider it likely that loss of Banp may cause DNA replication stress through downregulation of S phase regulators, independent of mitotic defects.</p><p>However, we cannot exclude the possibility that DNA replication stress causes mitotic defects in <italic>banp</italic> mutants. Masamsetti et al., 2019, Nat. Comm. 10.4224. revealed that replication stress induces spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC)-dependent mitotic arrest and subsequent mitotic death when tp53 activity is inhibited. We showed that cell death in zebrafish <italic>banp</italic> mutant retinas was fully suppressed by tp53-MO at 48 hpf, but still occurred at 72 hpf, although there was no significant difference between wildtype and <italic>banp</italic> mutants (Figure 3GH). In the manuscript, we mentioned the possibility that some tp53-independent mechanism induces retinal apoptosis in <italic>banp</italic> mutants after 48 hpf. An alternative possibility is that most cell death in <italic>banp</italic> mutants depends on tp53; however, replication stress persisting in <italic>banp</italic> mutants injected with MO-tp53 may cause SAC-mediated mitotic death, as reported by Masamsetti et al., 2019. Future studies will be necessary to clarify this possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>To increase the impact of the work, provide a better understanding of how loss of banp leads to induction of DNA damage (currently presented as a question mark in Figure 7).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Essential revision #2 and Reviewer 2 point #3.

In particular it needs to be stated clearly if these two defects are truly independent or if one precedes the other. If the S phase defects are independent of the mitotic defects, then few PH3+ cells will have foci. The authors state line 419-425 &quot;There is no significant difference in the pH3+ cell fraction between in the total retinal cells and Î³-H2AX+ retinal cells (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1J). While there is no significant difference it is slightly decreased so this data could potentially address this issue, but should be clearly presented and interpreted. E.g. if S-phase defects are independent of M-phase defects but S-phase defects precede mitosis, then what happens to those damaged S-phase cells? A concise clarification in the text can address this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. We agree that it is important to clarify how S phase defects and M phase defects influence each other. As you suggested, it is interesting that pH3+ cell fraction in g-H2AX+ retinal cells is lower than that of total retinal cells, although there is no statistical difference. At 48 hpf, <italic>banp</italic> mutants show increases in</p><p>1</p><p>g-H2AX+ cells, pH3 + cells, and apoptotic cells, compared with wild-type control. The reduction of pH3+ cell fraction in g-H2AX+ retinal cells suggest that g-H2AX+ retinal cells are eliminated by apoptosis in S phase prior to mitosis. In addition, M phase defects are likely to be independent of replicative damages mostly introduced in S phase.</p><p>We have added the sentences below in the Results section (Line 364-369).</p><p>âDespite of no statistical significance, interestingly, averaged fraction of pH3+ cells in Î³-H2AX+ retinal cells was lower than that of total retinal cells. Since <italic>banp<sup>rw337</sup></italic> mutants show increase in Î³-H2AX + cells, pH3 + cells and apoptotic cells at 48hpf, it is likely that DNA damaged cells are eliminated by apoptosis in S phase prior to mitosis. This also suggest that M phase defects may be independent of replicative DNA damage introduced in S phase.â</p><p>Furthermore, regarding the question on, âif S-phase defects are independent of Mphase defects but S-phase defects precede mitosis, then what happens to those damaged S-phase cells?â, it is difficult to examine S phase defects and M phase defects separately because both defects appear at 48 hpf. However, our observations indicate that mitosis in <italic>banp</italic> mutants is eventually completed, and that apoptosis is not overlapped with accumulated pH3+ cell area, suggesting that M phase defects are not associated with apoptosis but only prolonged mitosis duration. So, DNA damage is likely to be inherited by daughter cells through the mitosis, resulting in apoptosis in immature neurons. To clarify how S- and M-phase defects influence each other in <italic>banp</italic> mutants, we have added the description on the summary of <italic>banp</italic> mutant phenotype in the Results section (Line 502-509) in Figure 7B and its legends (Line 1470-1480), which we hope guide readers to understand how S- and M-phase defects influence each other during cell-cycle progression in <italic>banp</italic> mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The cartoons/models should be revised into multiple model panels that are each simplified and concentrate on the essential information, as well as a temporal progression be added (e.g. currently it appears that the BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells are derived from M phase cells, is this correct?</p></disp-quote><p>We consider that the cartoons/models pointed by editors above are Figures 2EF.

We have revised these two figure panels to clarify what happens at a cellular level: cell-cycle progression and neurogenesis along the apico-basal axis of the neural retina as well as developmental stages.
