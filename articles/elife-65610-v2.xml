dioecious plant on its interaction with pollinating insects and test whether the magnitude of such effects is shaped by plant individual sex and the evolutionary histories of plant populations. We recorded spatial, scent, colour, and rewarding flower traits as well as pollinator visitation rates in experimentally inbred and outbred, male and female <italic>Silene latifolia</italic> plants from European and North American populations differing in their evolutionary histories. We found that inbreeding specifically impairs spatial flower traits and floral scent. Our results support that sex-specific selection and gene expression may have partially magnified these inbreeding costs for females, and that divergent evolutionary histories altered the genetic architecture underlying inbreeding effects across population origins. Moreover, the results indicate that inbreeding effects on floral scent may have a huge potential to disrupt interactions among plants and nocturnal moth pollinators, which are mediated by elaborate chemical communication.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dioecy</kwd><kwd>flower colour</kwd><kwd>floral VOC</kwd><kwd>inbreeding depression</kwd><kwd>sexual dimorphism</kwd><kwd>Silene <italic>latifolia</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Kiel University, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, program for promotion of young female scientists</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schrieber</surname><given-names>Karin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Kiel University, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, program for promotion of young female scientists</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erfmeier</surname><given-names>Alexandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inbreeding compromises floral traits and reduces pollinator visitation rates disproportionally in female relative to male individuals in a dioecious plant and may thus interfere with the equilibrium of a complex co-evolutionary plant-insect relationship.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant-pollinator interactions are of central importance for the emergence as well as the maintenance of global biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crepet and Niklas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ollerton, 2017</xref>) and provide ecosystem services with tangible sociocultural and economic value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Porto et al., 2020</xref>). Global change continues to disrupt these interactions by altering the physiology, phenology, and particularly the spatial distribution of component species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burkle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vanbergen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Glenny et al., 2018</xref>). Habitat degradation and fragmentation reduce the size and connectivity of plant populations, which results in lowered pollinator visitation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguilar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dauber et al., 2010</xref>). Plant population retraction and isolation may also affect interactions with pollinators at the plant individual level by increasing inbreeding rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carr et al., 2014</xref>). The mating among closely related plant individuals may compromise floral traits attracting pollinators and hence cause negative feedback on pollinator visitation. Mechanistic insight into the effects of inbreeding on plant-pollinator interactions and intrinsic factors shaping the magnitude of such effects is limited but urgently required for the conservation of component species.</p><p>Inbreeding increases homozygosity in the offspring generation. This may enhance the phenotypic expression of deleterious recessive mutations (i.e., dominance) and reduce heterozygote advantage (i.e., over-dominance), which can result in severe declines of Darwinian fitness in inbred relative to outcrossed offspring (i.e., inbreeding depression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Charlesworth and Willis, 2009</xref>). Inbreeding may in addition disrupt plant-insect interactions. While it is well established that inbreeding can increase a plant’s susceptibility to herbivores by diminishing morphological and chemical defences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campbell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kariyat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kalske et al., 2014</xref>), its effects on plant-pollinator interactions are less well understood. Inbreeding may reduce a plant’s attractiveness to pollinating insects by compromising the complex set of floral traits involved in interspecific communication. These traits comprise (i) the spatial arrangement of individual flowers (e.g., size, shape) and multiple flowers within an inflorescence (e.g., number, height above ground, degree of aggregation), hereinafter referred to as spatial flower traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dafni et al., 1997</xref>); (ii) the scent bouquet as determined by the composition of floral volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as terpenoids, benzenoids, and phenylpropanoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Muhlemann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borghi et al., 2017</xref>); (iii) flower colour as defined by the composition of pigments with wavelength-selective light absorption and the backscattering of light by petal surface structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">van der Kooi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borghi et al., 2017</xref>); and (iv) the quality and quantity of rewards such as nectar, pollen, oviposition sites, or shelter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Simpson and Neff, 1981</xref>). These cues are particularly efficient in attracting pollinators across either long, medium, or short distances and act synergistically in determining visitation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dafni et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Muhlemann et al., 2014</xref>) . Although in a few cases inbreeding has been shown to alter single floral traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ivey and Carr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ferrari et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Haber et al., 2019</xref>), insight into more syndrome-wide effects is restricted to a single study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kariyat et al., 2021</xref> demonstrated that inbred <italic>Solanum carolinense</italic> <sc>L.</sc> display reduced flower size, pollen and scent production, and receive fewer visits from diurnal generalists. It is necessary to broaden such integrated methodological approaches to other plant-pollinator systems (e.g., nocturnal specialist pollinators) and further floral traits (e.g., flower colour).</p><p>The magnitude and slope of inbreeding effects in plants can vary across environments, since local conditions partly determine the selective value of recessive alleles unmasked by inbreeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fox and Reed, 2011</xref>). While the influence of environmental stress on the expression of inbreeding depression is well studied, the effects of plant sex, which considerably shapes an individual’s interaction with its environment, remain largely unexplored. Individuals of dioecious plant species invest into either male or female reproductive function. This partitioning goes along with different life histories, resource demands, stress susceptibilities, and consequently sex-specific selection regimes in identical habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moore and Pannell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barrett and Hough, 2013</xref>). Sex-specific selection may modify the magnitude of inbreeding depression in dioecious plants. Studies on animals reported higher inbreeding depression in females than males resulting from higher reproductive investment and prolonged life cycles in the former (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ebel and Phillips, 2016</xref>). In plants, such relations have rarely been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Teixeira et al., 2009</xref>), and if so, not with a focus on floral traits. If inbreeding effects on floral traits are more pronounced in female than male plants, the relative frequency of pollinator visits may be biased towards the latter sex, with devastating consequences for the effective size and persistence of populations. Studies on sex-specific inbreeding effects on floral traits are thus needed to improve the risk assessment for the conservation of dioecious plant species.</p><p>Plant populations may escape progressive retractions under increased inbreeding rates by purging. Inbreeding unmasks deleterious recessive mutations, which facilitates their selective removal from the population gene pool and may result in a rebound of fitness when the demographic bottleneck is intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crnokrak and Barrett, 2002</xref>). Plant species that have successfully colonised distant geographic regions provide perfect models for studying the relevance of purging in natural plant populations. As colonisation events are associated with successive demographic bottlenecks, purging is expected to be one determinant for the successful establishment and proliferation of plant populations in novel habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Facon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schrieber and Lachmuth, 2017</xref>). However, only few empirical studies verified the role of purging in plant colonisation success by revealing significantly lower inbreeding depression following experimental crossings in invasive than native plant populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rosche et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schrieber et al., 2019b</xref>). Again, the focus of these studies was on fitness components rather than floral traits. Yet, attractiveness to pollinators is a key for successful colonisation in species introduced into novel communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Morales and Traveset, 2009</xref>), especially if plants are not capable of selfing (e.g., dioecious). Floral syndromes are likely under strong selection in such species, which should rapidly purge deleterious recessive mutations affecting spatial, scent, colour, and rewarding flower traits.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the effects of inbreeding on plant-pollinator interactions and tested whether the magnitude of such effects depends on plant sex and population origin using the <italic>Silene latifolia</italic> <sc>Pior.</sc> (Caryophyllaceae) and its crepuscular moth pollinators. Natural <italic>S. latifolia</italic> populations partly suffer from biparental inbreeding due to limited seed and pollen dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCauley, 1997</xref>). As inbreeding reduces not only fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Teixeira et al., 2009</xref>) but also impairs interactions with herbivorous insects in <italic>S. latifolia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schrieber et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schrieber et al., 2019b</xref>), a disruption of plant-pollinator interactions can be expected for this species. Moreover, the dioecious reproductive system of <italic>S. latifolia</italic> provides the opportunity to quantify variation in the magnitude of inbreeding effects in these traits among females and males. Finally, the species expanded successfully from parts of its native distribution range in Europe to North America in the early 19th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Keller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Keller et al., 2012</xref>), which may have given rise to purging events. We assessed spatial flower traits, headspace floral scent composition, flower colour and rewards, and quantified pollinator visitation in experimentally inbred and outbred male and female <italic>S. latifolia</italic> individuals from European and North American populations. We hypothesised that (i) inbreeding compromises floral traits, (ii) these inbreeding effects are more pronounced in female than male plants, (iii) inbreeding effects are more pronounced in European than North American populations, and (iv) the combined effects of inbreeding, sex, and population origin cause feedback on pollinator visitation rates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study species</title><p><italic>S. latifolia</italic> shows a distinct moth pollination syndrome with large, white, and funnel-shaped flowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dafni et al., 1997</xref>). The flowers open from dusk till mid-morning to release a scent bouquet composed of more than 60 VOC, whereby emission peaks around dusk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dötterl and Jürgens, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dötterl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mamadalieva et al., 2014</xref>). During the daytime, no measurable floral scent is emitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dötterl et al., 2005</xref>). Nectar production peaks 3–4 days after flower opening and is just as floral scent emission reduced after pollination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gehring et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dötterl and Jürgens, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Muhlemann et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>S. latifolia</italic> exhibits various sexual dimorphisms with male plants producing more and smaller flowers that excrete lower volumes of nectar with higher sugar concentrations as compared to females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gehring et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delph et al., 2010</xref>). The quality of floral scent exhibits no clear sex-specific patterns, while male plants have been shown to emit higher or equal total amounts of VOC as compared to females in different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dötterl and Jürgens, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Waelti et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Various diurnal generalist pollinators as well as crepuscular moths visit <italic>S. latifolia</italic> flowers.

All nocturnal pollinators are rewarded with nectar, while the specialist <italic>H. bicruris</italic> is additionally rewarded with oviposition sites. <italic>S. latifolia</italic> and <italic>H. bicruris</italic> form a well-studied nursery pollination system, in which female moths pollinate female plants while ovipositing on the flower ovaries to provide their larvae with developing seeds. Pollination services provided by male <italic>H. bicruris</italic> likely over-compensate the costs of seed predation by their offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Labouche and Bernasconi, 2010</xref>).

The magnitude of these effects depended partially on (ii) plant sex, which demonstrates that the intrinsic biological differences between males and females shape the consequences of inbreeding in dioecious plant species as they are filtered through the selective environment. Inbreeding effects also depended on (iii) origin in a way indicating that divergent evolutionary histories have shaped the underlying genetic architecture. Finally, our study showed that (iv) the effects of inbreeding, sex, and origin on pollinator visitation rates specifically mirrored variation in floral scent, which yields interesting insight into the relative importance of different floral traits in shaping the behaviour of crepuscular moths.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Inbreeding compromises floral traits</title><p>In partial accordance with our first hypothesis, inbreeding compromised several, but not all floral traits in <italic>S. latifolia</italic>. Spatial flower traits suffered most strongly from inbreeding in males and females from both origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>). These results are in line with previous studies on hermaphroditic, self-compatible species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ivey and Carr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Glaettli and Goudet, 2006</xref>) and support that the complex genetic architecture underlying such traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Feng et al., 2019</xref>) gives rise to dominance and over-dominance effects at multiple loci. The chemodiversity and abundance of floral VOC involved in communication with <italic>H. bicruris</italic> moths was reduced in a sex- and origin-specific manner in inbred relative to outbred <italic>S. latifolia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–g</xref>), while the full floral scent profile exhibited no differences among inbreds and outbreds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). So far, lower emissions of floral VOC in inbreds have been reported for only few plant species pollinated by diurnal generalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ferrari et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Haber et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kariyat et al., 2021</xref>). Our study revealed such effects for plants pollinated by specialist moths that use scent as a major cue for plant location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Riffell and Alarcón, 2013</xref>). Dominance and over-dominance may either have directly interfered with genes involved in VOC synthesis and their regulation in <italic>S. latifolia</italic> or unfolded their effects by disrupting physiological homoeostasis and thereby inducing intrinsic stress that came at the cost of scent production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kristensen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fox and Reed, 2011</xref>). A recent study indicates that the effects of inbreeding on the diversity of floral VOC in our study may even have been underestimated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kergunteuil et al., 2021</xref> demonstrated that porous polymers may differ in their affinity with specific VOC and hence in their sensitivity in recording variation in VOC diversity entailing blind spots. They recommend a shift in practice from the use of single to multiple porous polymers (e.g., a combination of PDMS and Poropak Q) for VOC collection in future plant ecological studies, which may uncover the full impact of plant inbreeding on the composition of floral volatiles.</p><p>In contrast to spatial flower traits and scent, flower colour and the total amount of sugar excreted with nectar exhibited no differences among inbreds and outbreds in <italic>S. latifolia</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Flower colour is a trait that has, to our knowledge, not yet been studied in the context of inbreeding, despite its crucial role in flower identification and localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Garcia et al., 2019</xref>). Our data suggest that the flower colour perceived by moths is not altered by inbreeding and generally seems to be a conserved trait in <italic>S. latifolia</italic>. Other species with high intraspecific variation in flower colour may be ideal models to further examine the relationship with inbreeding in the future by combining visual modelling with choice experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kelber et al., 2003</xref>). The independence of sugar excretion from inbreeding in <italic>S. latifolia</italic> indicates that the strong reduction of flower number in inbreds allows compensating the quality of floral rewards via a resource allocation trade-off.</p><p>Overall, the observed inbreeding effects on floral traits were partially small and variable in their magnitude as compared to previous investigations. However, our findings highlight that even weak degrees of biparental inbreeding (i.e., one generation sib-mating) can result in an impairment of multiple flower traits that is detectable against the background of natural variation among multiple plant populations from a broad geographic region. This observation indirectly supports that the selfing syndrome (i.e., smaller, less scented flowers observed in selfing relative to outcrossing populations of hermaphroditic plant species) may not merely be a result of natural selection against resource investment into floral traits, but also a direct negative consequence of inbreeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson, 2012</xref>). Most importantly, we observed that variation in inbreeding effects was consistent in its dependency on plant sex, which gives insight into the role of intrinsic biological differences between males and females in the expression of inbreeding depression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>The cost of inbreeding for floral traits is higher in females than males</title><p>Males outperformed females in all floral traits, except scent production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As such, our study confirmed previously observed sexual dimorphisms in <italic>S. latifolia</italic> (nectar: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gehring et al., 2004</xref>; flower number: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delph et al., 2010</xref>) but also yielded contradicting results. As opposed to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delph et al., 2010</xref>, we observed larger instead of smaller flowers in males. This may base on the use of a size estimate that accounts for variation in flower shape or the comparably large geographic range and higher number of populations covered by our study. Moreover, we discovered a novel sexually dimorphic trait in the colour appearance of <italic>S. latifolia</italic> to crepuscular moths in the UV and blue light spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g–h</xref>). Given that moths use blue light as a major cue to start feeding on nectar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cutler et al., 1995</xref>), the lower light reflectance observed for female flowers is another trait rendering them less attractive than males.</p><p>The evolution of lower female attractiveness to pollinators is driven by sex-specific resource allocation, that is, high costs for production of ovaries and seeds may restrict allocation to floral traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moore and Pannell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barrett and Hough, 2013</xref>). This process may also explain the larger magnitude of inbreeding effects in female plants of <italic>S. latifolia</italic>, which we observed in accordance with our second hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,d</xref>). High reproductive expenditure in females may increase the frequency and intensity of resource depletion stress (e.g., drought) under field conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Obeso, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, females may suffer disproportionally from inbreeding when dominance and over-dominance affect loci mediating resistance to such stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fox and Reed, 2011</xref>). The assumption that sex-specific viability selection plays a role in the expression of inbreeding depression seems likely for <italic>S. latifolia</italic>. Previous research elaborated that females of this species experience resource depletion stress more often than males in the late growing season during fruit maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gehring and Monson, 1994</xref>) and that inbreeding reduces resistance to environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schrieber et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schrieber et al., 2019b</xref>). Another non-exclusive explanation for the different inbreeding effects on female versus male <italic>S. latifolia</italic> may be found in sexual selection. Compared to females, the reproductive success of males is more limited by the availability of mates than by the availability of resources, which results in selection for increased attractiveness to pollinators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moore and Pannell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barrett and Hough, 2013</xref>). Competition for increased siring success among male plant individuals may create strong selection pressures that could rapidly purge deleterious recessive mutations in genes directly linked to attractiveness of male flowers to pollinators. Finally, a proportion of sex-specific inbreeding effects may be attributed to differential gene expression. <italic>S. latifolia</italic> harbours numerous genes with alleles that affect male and female fitness in opposite directions. These sexually antagonistic genes are partly subsumed in non-recombining regions of gonosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Scotti and Delph, 2006</xref>). Those located at the X-chromosome are always effectively dominant in males (XY) but may be recessive and therefore contribute to inbreeding depression in females (XX). The remaining fraction of sexually antagonistic genes is located at autosomal regions but exhibits sex-specific expression as controlled by the gonosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Scotti and Delph, 2006</xref>). These genes may exhibit systematic differences in the abundance and effect magnitudes of deleterious recessive alleles between males and females, thus contributing to sex-specific inbreeding effects.</p><p>Not only floral traits but also plant viability may exhibit sex-specific inbreeding depression in dioecious species. This could result in deviations from optimal sex ratio and, consequently, reductions of effective population sizes that accelerate local extinctions under global change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hultine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rosche et al., 2018</xref>). Future studies should aim at disentangling the relative contribution of sex-specific selection and gene expression to differences in the magnitude of inbreeding depression between males and females and at assessing their feedback on sex ratios to predict and manage these specific threats.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Evolutionary history shapes the genetic architecture underlying inbreeding effects</title><p>Plants exhibited a general difference among geographic origins in merely one floral trait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Indeed, we had not expected broad differences in floral traits among European and North American <italic>S. latifolia</italic> plants (i.e., significant main effects of origin). A sufficient overlap in the composition of pollinator communities (<italic>H. ectypa</italic> replaces <italic>H. bicruris</italic> in the invaded range, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castillo et al., 2014</xref>) and appropriate pre-adaptations in floral traits were probably essential for <italic>S. latifolia</italic> as an obligate outcrossing plant species to successfully colonise North America. As discussed in detail in previous studies, higher flower numbers in North American <italic>S. latifolia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) may result from changes in the selective regimes for numerous abiotic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Keller et al., 2009</xref>) or from the release of seed predation. As opposed to <italic>H. bicruris</italic>, <italic>H. ectypa</italic> pollinates North American <italic>S. latifolia</italic> without incurring costs for seed predation, which may result in the evolution of higher flower numbers, specifically in female plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Elzinga and Bernasconi, 2009</xref>).</p><p>While adaptive differentiation among <italic>S. latifolia</italic> populations from different origins was not in the focus of this study, we hypothesised that North American populations purged genetic load linked to floral traits during the colonisation process (i.e., interaction breeding treatment × origin). In contrast to hypothesis iii, the magnitude of inbreeding effects was not consistently higher in European than North American populations. Instead, it was independent of origin for most floral traits, except flower scent, and either higher or lower in European plants for different scent traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f–g</xref>). These findings provide no support for recent purging events in North American populations. They rather add to evidence that the magnitude of inbreeding effects is highly specific for the traits as well as the populations or population groups under investigation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Escobar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angeloni et al., 2011</xref>). This specifity roots in the composition of gene loci affected by dominance and over-dominance and is determined by the complex interplay of demographic population histories (i.e., size retractions and expansions, genetic drift, isolation, gene flow) and the selective environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Charlesworth and Willis, 2009</xref>). As such, the precise mechanisms underlying variation in inbreeding effects on different scent traits across population origins of <italic>S. latifolia</italic> can only be explored based on comprehensive genomic resources, which are currently not available. Future studies should also incorporate field data on the abundance of specialist pollinators and extend the focus from variation in the magnitude of inbreeding effects among geographic origins to variation among populations within geographic origins and individuals within populations. This would allow a detailed quantification of geographic variation in inbreeding effects and elaborating on the causes and ecological consequences of such variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thompson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schrieber and Lachmuth, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Inbreeding effects on floral traits cause limited feedback on pollinator visitation rates</title><p>Pollinator visitation rates partially mirrored the above-discussed variation in flower traits. They depended on the breeding treatment in a highly sex- and origin-specific manner: In North American populations, inbred females received significantly fewer plant and flower visits than outbreds, whereas flower visits were higher in inbred than outbred males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We conclude that the severe inbreeding effects on spatial flower traits alone do not necessarily reduce moth visitation rates because these effects were observed for both plant sexes and origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b,c</xref>). A floral trait that was negatively affected by inbreeding only in North American female plants, just like pollinator visitation rates, was the abundance of lilac aldehyde A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). The other lilac aldehyde isomers exhibited similar but non-significant trends (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Although these findings provide limited support for our fourth hypothesis, they yield interesting insight into the relative importance of floral traits for the behaviour of a lepidopteran specialist pollinator.</p><p>The seemingly low importance of inbreeding effects on spatial flower traits for pollinator visitation rates may be explained with the limited visual system of nocturnal insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">van der Kooi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sondhi et al., 2021</xref>). Moths can likely perceive differences in the spatial arrangement of flowers on inbred versus outbred plants only when they have already approached close to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnett et al., 2018</xref>). Our setup for pollinator observations had relatively large distances among replicate inbred and outbred plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>) and hence may have not enabled a choice based on spatial flower traits by the moths. In contrast, differences in scent cues should be perceived across large distances. The antennae of <italic>H. bicruris</italic> can detect slight differences in lilac aldehyde concentrations at very low dosages and the compounds elicit oriented flight and landing responses in the moth more than any other VOC in the scent of <italic>S. latifolia</italic> flowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dötterl et al., 2006</xref>). Consequently, a low lilac aldehyde abundance may have resulted in a low attraction of moths to North American inbred female plants from the distance in our experiment. The non-significant trend for higher abundances of lilac aldehydes in inbred than outbred males from North America (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) could also explain the corresponding variation observed in flower visitation rates. However, bioassays under more controlled conditions are needed to further evaluate a mechanistic relationship among pollinator visitation and intensities of lilac aldehydes.</p><p>In summary, our research on <italic>S. latifolia</italic> suggests that in addition to inbreeding disrupting interactions with herbivores by changing plant leaf chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schrieber et al., 2019a</xref>), it affects plant interactions with pollinators by altering flower chemistry. Our observations are in line with studies on other plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ivey and Carr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kariyat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kariyat et al., 2021</xref>) and highlight that inbreeding has the potential to reset the equilibrium of species interactions by altering functional traits that have developed in a long history of co-evolution. These threats to antagonistic and symbiotic plant-insect interactions may mutually magnify in reducing plant individual fitness and altering the dynamics of natural plant populations under global change. As such, our study adds to a growing body of literature supporting the need to maintain or restore sufficient genetic diversity in plant populations during conservation programs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded by the program for the promotion of young female scientists of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of Kiel University.

consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Meredith Schuman as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. A recent study has addressed some of the questions detailed in the manuscript. So, the introduction needs to be tweaked to reflect this.</p><p>2. The authors found stronger effects of inbreeding on pollinator visitation rates in the plants from the North American (Na) origin. However, those plants were only tested in non-native habitat. As the main pollinator is also a seed predator, the Na populations could be released from the selection pressure to avoid attracting the females of this species and thus risking the loss of seeds and fitness. This issue should be addressed in the discussion explicitly and its consequences for the interpretation of the results should be considered.</p><p>3. Please revise the title according to the comments from the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Although in a few cases inbreeding has been shown to alter single components of flower attractiveness (Ivey and Carr, 2005; Ferrari et al., 2006; Haber et al., 2019), insight into syndrome-wide effects is lacking.</p><p>This statement is no longer correct. Please refer https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajb2.1594 where the authors show flower size, pollen content, floral volatiles and floral visits are affected by inbreeding. The introduction needs to be reframed adding this and any additional notes on the novelty if needed.</p><p>2. Diurnal and nocturnal visitors and their rewards, are VOC's different during the day? There seems to be no explanation for this.</p><p>3. Line 111: This is a bit unclear; are the female floral volatiles oviposition attractants? rather than a typical floral scent?</p><p>Again, in line 189 authors discuss EAG data, but not clear whether it is from male or female moths, especially since female moths may have been using these compounds as oviposition cues.</p><p>I understand that this is not directly relevant to the current study, but it is indeed an important part of this system and should be discussed.</p><p>4. 143: What are these biological pest control agents, and for what reason they were used. There is a need to explain this since floral and foliar chemistry can be affected (differentially due to inbreeding) due to any foliar or floral herbivory. I have to say that I am surprised that such a treatment has been carried out before chemistry experiments.</p><p>5. 154: Floral volatiles are collected on a per flower basis, however, there is a huge variation for size and possibly flower mass among the treatments. The authors should explain how that would not have affected their results?</p><p>6. While the study is laser-focused on floral traits, as the authors are aware inbreeding affects the total phenotype of the plants including fitness and defense traits. For example., there are quite a few studies that have shown how inbreeding affects the plant defense phenotype. While this is irrelevant to some of the traits studied in this manuscript, it does matter for floral scent. While the floral scent is usually semi-distinct from foliar volatiles (Baldwin group, Raguso group), the volatiles also shares structural and functional similarities. The authors I think, should address how these effects might be either additive or antagonistic in nature.</p><p>7. 265: If each flower for scent extraction was of the same age (4th day) irrespective of the age of the plant (12-day variation), is it necessary to add that into the model for scent analyses in statistics?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Below, please find my detailed comments in the order of appearance:</p><p>Title (and throughout the manuscript): I am not sure about the term floral attractiveness. Why not &quot;floral traits&quot; or &quot;pollination-linked traits&quot; or something along these lines? You did measure floral attractiveness to pollinators, and for most traits the reduction of the floral attractive traits did not really matter for the pollinator (and Hadena seed predator?) visitation rates.</p><p>Line 24. It is unclear here both what you mean about plant attractiveness and how you mean that it may be affected by inbreeding. I think you need to establish why you think that inbreeding may play a role already here, and that you expect that traits that are involved in pollinator attraction may be negatively affected by inbreeding by citing previous work (e.g. Andersson 2012 Am J Bot).</p><p>Line 33: This sentence is a bit unclear, because you connect (Darwinian) fitness, which is a relative measure varying among individuals within a population, and inbreeding depression, which most often is used as a population measure. I wonder if instead of fitness you are focusing on e.g. population viability?</p><p>Line 43: In many cases it is unclear at what distance the floral scent is actually detected and utilized by the pollinators (cf. examples of e.g. scent nectar guides, scented nectar etc.).</p><p>Line 57-58: I think that it would be better to introduce here the plant examples where inbreeding may affect plant traits, and then make a case why it is important to study the impact of inbreeding on floral traits rather than just justifying the study by saying that it has not been done before.</p><p>Line 114: I would add a &quot;may&quot; between &quot;H. biuris&quot; and &quot;overcompensate&quot;, because the outcome of the Silene-Hadena interaction may very likely depend on the presence (or absence) of alternative, less costly, pollinator species.</p><p>Line 135 and 269-273: Why was the factor &quot;year&quot; not included in these models? Would it impact the results?</p><p>Line 147. The height and number of was scored three times. Once, then again after two weeks and then again after six weeks from the first scoring? Or once, then again after two weeks and then again after six weeks after the second scoring? Please clarify.</p><p>Line 155-190. I am a bit puzzled by the floral scent collections and analyses. Usually, static collection with PMDS absorbents is used qualitatively rather than quantitatively, and in the methods it is mentioned that the compounds were not quantified but that the relative intensity of the different VOC peaks was compared. Hence, you focused on floral scent composition. This is fine, but then in the analyses of the lilac aldehydes (e.g. F), I understand it as you measure the absolute number of counts from the chromatograms.</p><p>Hence, I wonder (i) were these data stilled analysed quantitatively, and, if so, how did you validate that the number of counts was comparable across samples? The traditional method is to use dynamic headspace sampling, and then add a standard volume of a known substance to account for e.g. variable GC-MS sensitivity. Alternatively, (ii) this measure is relative (as indicated by the text and the y-axis label in the figure), but then I would like a better description of how this variable was calculated. For example, if using proportions, two samples could emit the exact same amount of the particular compound, but the proportional contribution of the same compound each overall scent bouquet could be very different, if one of the two samples include large amounts also of other scent compounds. Under such a scenario, it would be misleading to use the relative contribution of one single floral scent compound to try to predict pollinator behaviour. I apologize if I have missed something obvious here, but if so, it still makes sense to clarify how these data were obtained and what may be their limitation.</p><p>Line 335-344: Again, I was confused by the term floral attractiveness, since most traits were not that important for pollinator visitation rates. This was confusing throughout the discussion.</p><p>Line 347: Also &quot;spatial attractiveness&quot; is a bit misleading. Why not talk about the actual traits?</p><p>Line 445-477: I like the discussion about how the inbreeding effects on most traits, with the potential exception of floral scent, did not result in a reduced pollinator visitation rate. I think, however, that there is room for a deeper discussion here. These other traits, are they not important for pollinator attraction at all? Or were they not reduced to a large enough extent to affect pollinator visitation? Also, considering the impressive amount of data produced and the numerous predictor variables, how well can we trust that the floral scent reduction is indeed not just a spurious correlation? This is particularly relevant in the light of the comment above about whether or not we can be sure that you have detected variation in &quot;aldehyde concentrations&quot; (line 460). I was pondering whether there was an additional way to analyze these data by comparing effect sizes (trait variation between inbred and outcrossed plants of the same category) and ask how well these explained the variation in effect size in pollinator visitation rate between inbred and outcrossed plants of the same categories. I could not come up with a straightforward way to do so, so I realize the problem of drawing too strong conclusions based on a single data point (a slight reduction in aldehyde concentration in inbred females from North America and a corresponding reduced visitation rate on inbred North American females). I think that one important take-home message here is the lack of trait-based explanations for pollinator visitation rates (which further emphasizes the need to avoid using &quot;floral attractiveness&quot;).</p><p>Figure S8: I wonder if there is a mistake here, because the two plots in the left panel are identical.</p><p>Finally, I wanted to reiterate the potential to study variation also at smaller scale.

The authors found stronger effects of inbreeding on pollinator visitation rates in the plants from the North American (Na) origin. However, those plants were only tested in non-native habitat. As the main pollinator is also a seed predator, the Na populations could be released from the selection pressure to avoid attracting the females of this species and thus risking the loss of seeds and fitness. This issue should be addressed in the discussion explicitly and its consequences for the interpretation of the results should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, North American populations are tested in their “away”-habitat only and the observed plant performance and pollinator visitation rates can thus provide no direct implications for their “home”-habitat. We state this now more clearly at pp 11-12, ll 283-285. However, our design is appropriate for investigating inbreeding effects on plant-pollinator interactions in multiple plant populations in a common environment. Given the close taxonomic relationship of <italic>H. bicruris</italic> (main pollinator in Europe) and <italic>H. ectypa</italic> (main pollinator in North America), the behavioural responses of the former species to variation in the quality of its host plant was considered to overlap sufficiently with responses of the latter species as outlined at pp 11-12, ll 285-291.</p><p>The hypothesis that North American (NA) <italic>S. latifolia</italic> evolved higher attractiveness to female <italic>Hadena</italic> moths because <italic>H. ectypa</italic> is not able to oviposit on female plants in contrast to <italic>H. bicruris</italic> is indeed a highly interesting one. However, as you have outlined correctly, our study is not designed to elaborate on questions related to adaptive evolutionary differentiation among North American and European plants. Instead of addressing this hypothesis based on our data, we thus take reference to previous studies in the discussion p 17, ll 482-487:</p><p>“As discussed in detail in previous studies, higher flower numbers in North American <italic>S. latifolia</italic> plants (Figure 1b) may result from changes in the selective regimes for numerous abiotic factors (Keller et al., 2009) or from the release of seed predation. As opposed to <italic>H. bicruris</italic>, <italic>H. ectypa</italic> pollinates North American <italic>S. latifolia</italic> without incurring costs for seed predation, which may result in the evolution of higher flower numbers, specifically in female plants (Elzinga and Bernasconi, 2009).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We adjusted the writing in the introduction and the discussion accordingly. Please consider that this article was first published at the 15<sup>th</sup> of January 21, while our manuscript was submitted at the 9<sup>th</sup> of January. Hence, we were not able to account for this study in the first submission. Introduction pp 4-5, ll 48-54:</p><p>“Although in a few cases inbreeding has been shown to alter single components of flower attractiveness (Ivey and Carr, 2005; Ferrari et al., 2006; Haber et al., 2019), insight into syndrome-wide effects is restricted to a single study.

Diurnal and nocturnal visitors and their rewards, are VOC's different during the day? There seems to be no explanation for this.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Hadena bicruris</italic> and other nocturnal moths are the most efficient pollinators of <italic>S latifolia</italic>, and the pollination syndrome of the <italic>S. latifolia</italic> points clearly to nocturnal pollination (p 6, ll 106-109). We therefore focussed on nocturnal pollinators and their specific rewards, which is now stated more clearly in the methods section at p 7, ll 117-120:</p><p>“Various diurnal generalist pollinators as well as crepuscular moths visit <italic>S. latifolia</italic> flowers. The latter, including the specialist <italic>Hadena bicruris</italic> Hufn. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), were shown to be the most efficient pollinators for <italic>S. latifolia</italic> (Young, 2002), which is the reason why we exclusively focus on nocturnal pollination in our study.”</p><p>To keep the focus on what has been done, we do not describe the rewards for diurnal generalists. However, we now give more detail about the rewards for nocturnal pollinators already in the study species section at p 7, ll 120-121:</p><p>“All nocturnal pollinators are rewarded with nectar, while the specialist <italic>H. bicruris</italic> is additionally rewarded with oviposition sites.”</p><p>Moreover, we added more information on changes in scent emission during the day at p 6, ll 107-109:</p><p>“The flowers open from dusk till mid-morning to release a scent bouquet composed of more than 60 VOC, whereby emission peaks around dusk (Dötterl et al., 2005, 2009; Mamadalieva et al., 2014). During the daytime, no measurable floral scent is emitted (Dötterl et al. 2005).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 111: This is a bit unclear; are the female floral volatiles oviposition attractants? rather than a typical floral scent?</p><p>Again, in line 189 authors discuss EAG data, but not clear whether it is from male or female moths, especially since female moths may have been using these compounds as oviposition cues.</p><p>I understand that this is not directly relevant to the current study, but it is indeed an important part of this system and should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified this issue at different occasions in the methods section. Previous studies (and our study) on <italic>S. latifolia</italic> have shown no clear differences in the quality of floral scent between sexes. However, one study found higher total emission of VOC in males, while others found no differences. Hence, females produce no specific VOC that are used as oviposition cues but may be differentiated from males by the total amount of emitted VOC and pronounced differences in spatial flower traits. We highlight this at p 6, ll 111-116:</p><p>“<italic>Silene latifolia</italic> exhibits various sexual dimorphisms with male plants producing more and smaller flowers that excrete lower volumes of nectar with higher sugar concentrations as compared to females (Gehring et al., 2004; Delph et al., 2010). The quality of floral scent exhibits no clear sex-specific patterns, while male plants have been shown to emit higher or equal total amounts of VOC as compared to females in different studies (Dötterl and Jürgens 2005, Waelti et al. 2009)”.</p><p>Both male and female moths show pronounced behavioural responses to lilac aldehyde isomers and other VOC in the floral scent of <italic>S. latifolia</italic> (Dötterl et al., 2006). We therefore treated these VOC as typical floral scent compounds. We clarified this at p 7, ll 125-126:</p><p>“A substantial fraction of floral VOC produced by <italic>S. latifolia</italic> triggers antennal and behavioural responses in male and female <italic>H. bicruris</italic> moths (Dötterl et al., 2006).”</p><p>and p 9, ll 2010-218:</p><p>”For targeted statistical analyses, we focused on those VOC that evidently mediate communication with <italic>H. bicruris</italic> according to Dötterl et al. (2006). […] Furthermore, <italic>H. bicruris</italic> is able to detect the slightest differences in the concentration of these three compounds at very low dosages (Dötterl et al. 2006).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. 143: What are these biological pest control agents, and for what reason they were used. There is a need to explain this since floral and foliar chemistry can be affected (differentially due to inbreeding) due to any foliar or floral herbivory. I have to say that I am surprised that such a treatment has been carried out before chemistry experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for highlighting this point! We used biological pest control agents in a preventive manner because <italic>S. latifolia</italic> is often infested by thrips and aphids under greenhouse conditions. The writing in the previous manuscript version was not clear with this regard and we changed the text at p 8, ll 157-161:</p><p>”Plants received water and fertilisation (UniversolGelb 12-30-12, Everris-Headquarters, NL) when necessary for the entire experimental period and were prophylactically treated with biological pest control agents under greenhouse conditions to prevent thrips (agent <italic>Amblyseius barkeri</italic> and <italic>Amblyseius cucumeris</italic>) and aphid (agent <italic>Chrysoperla carnea</italic>) infestation (Katz Biotech GmbH, GE).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. 154: Floral volatiles are collected on a per flower basis, however, there is a huge variation for size and possibly flower mass among the treatments. The authors should explain how that would not have affected their results?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, flower size and scent emission can be correlated. Although the question whether differences in scent emission were based on a difference in flower size is an interesting one, it seemed less relevant to us because it is unlikely that our pollinators correct their perception of a scent for the size of a flower (see also p 19, 520-526). We were rather interested in whether scent emission differs between the plant treatments and thus pollinators may chemically perceive such differences.</p><p>Moreover, we found it problematic to correct our models for flower size by including it as a covariate, which is the reason why we have not assessed this trait during scent collection. In this case, we would have corrected our scent responses for the effects of inbreeding, sex and population origin (i.e., the predictors we are interested in) because all of them determine the size of a flower (Figure 2 c,d). Hence, the inbreeding, sex and origin effects on flower scent would likely vanish. However, it is highly unlikely that the set of genes contributing to sex-, breeding treatment- and origin-based variation in flower size is exactly the same one that determines variation in scent emission per flower, which is basically the assumption underlying the model that includes flower size as a covariate. We critically mentioned the trade-off relationships and our reasoning to not correct for flower size at 9p ll 208-210:</p><p>“The intensities of VOC were not corrected for flower size because we wanted to capture all variation in scent emission that is relevant for the receiver i.e., the pollinator.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. While the study is laser-focused on floral traits, as the authors are aware inbreeding affects the total phenotype of the plants including fitness and defense traits. For example., there are quite a few studies that have shown how inbreeding affects the plant defense phenotype. While this is irrelevant to some of the traits studied in this manuscript, it does matter for floral scent. While the floral scent is usually semi-distinct from foliar volatiles (Baldwin group, Raguso group), the volatiles also shares structural and functional similarities. The authors I think, should address how these effects might be either additive or antagonistic in nature.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this aspect is important and therefore addressed it in further detail in the introduction at p 4 ll 34-38:</p><p>“While it is well established that inbreeding can increase a plant’s susceptibility to herbivores by diminishing morphological and chemical defences (Campbell et al., 2013; Kariyat et al., 2012; Kalske et al., 2014), its effects on plant-pollinator interactions are less well understood. Inbreeding may reduce a plant’s attractiveness to pollinating insects by compromising the complex set of floral traits involved in interspecific communication.”</p><p>Since other referees suggested to rather tone down than increase the discussion based on floral scent results, we stick to the general feedback relationship among of herbivory and pollination, rather than relating it specifically to volatiles in the discussion at p 19, ll 535-544:</p><p>“In summary, our research on <italic>S. latifolia</italic> suggests that in addition to inbreeding disrupting interactions with herbivores by changing plant leaf chemistry (Schrieber et al., 2018) it affects plant interactions with pollinators by altering flower chemistry. […] As such, our study adds to a growing body of literature supporting the need to maintain or restore sufficient genetic diversity in plant populations during conservation programs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. 265: If each flower for scent extraction was of the same age (4th day) irrespective of the age of the plant (12-day variation), is it necessary to add that into the model for scent analyses in statistics?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this potentially confounding effect explained sufficient variation in one of our scent responses (Table 2, Shannon index) and substantially improved the model fit for lilac aldehydes (see r-script ll 562-818).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Below, please find my detailed comments in the order of appearance:</p><p>Title (and throughout the manuscript): I am not sure about the term floral attractiveness. Why not &quot;floral traits&quot; or &quot;pollination-linked traits&quot; or something along these lines? You did measure floral attractiveness to pollinators, and for most traits the reduction of the floral attractive traits did not really matter for the pollinator (and Hadena seed predator?) visitation rates.</p></disp-quote><p>We now avoid the term floral attractiveness throughout the manuscript and instead refer to “floral traits”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 24. It is unclear here both what you mean about plant attractiveness and how you mean that it may be affected by inbreeding. I think you need to establish why you think that inbreeding may play a role already here, and that you expect that traits that are involved in pollinator attraction may be negatively affected by inbreeding by citing previous work (e.g. Andersson 2012 Am J Bot).</p></disp-quote><p>We rephrased the text at p 4, ll 24-29:</p><p>“Plant population retraction and isolation may also affect interactions with pollinators at the plant individual level by increasing inbreeding rates (Carr et al., 2014).

I wonder if instead of fitness you are focusing on e.g. population viability?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we forgot to set outbred individuals as a reference, when writing about fitness declines in inbreds. We changed the sentence at p 4, ll 30-33 accordingly:</p><p>“This may enhance the phenotypic expression of deleterious recessive mutations (i.e., dominance) and reduce heterozygote advantage (i.e., over-dominance), which can result in severe declines of Darwinian fitness in inbred relative to outcrossed offspring (i.e., inbreeding depression) (Charlesworth and Willis, 2009).”</p><p>Inbreeding depression is defined and quantified as a reduction of fitness in inbred relative to outbred offspring and can be assessed on the family, population or meta-population level (Charlesworth and Willis, 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 43: In many cases it is unclear at what distance the floral scent is actually detected and utilized by the pollinators (cf. examples of e.g. scent nectar guides, scented nectar etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the information in the parentheses at p 4, ll 46-48:</p><p>“These cues are particularly efficient in attracting pollinators across either long, medium or short distances (Dafni et al., 1997; Muhlemann et al., 2014) and act synergistically in determining visitation rates.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 57-58: I think that it would be better to introduce here the plant examples where inbreeding may affect plant traits, and then make a case why it is important to study the impact of inbreeding on floral traits rather than just justifying the study by saying that it has not been done before.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for highlighting this passage! We revised the text to improve the reading flow at p 5, ll 66-70:</p><p>“If inbreeding effects on floral traits are more pronounced in female than male plants, the relative frequency of pollinator visits may be biased towards the latter sex, with devastating consequences for the effective size and persistence of populations.

Would it impact the results?</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the extensive number and extent of measurements, we needed 2 years to acquire the full set of considered traits. However, none of the traits was assessed in both 2019 and 2020. We clarified this at p 8, ll 149-151:</p><p>“Using these individuals, we assessed the combined effects of breeding treatment, plant sex and population origin on different flower traits and pollinator visitation rates over the summers 2019 and 2020”.</p><p>See also Table 1, p 31. Instead, some data (flower number, synflorescence height) were assessed thrice in 2019 to reduce confounding effects of differences in flowering phenology. Indeed, one possible way to analyse such repeated measure data is to include time point as a fixed factor and plant individual as a random factor. An alternative solution is averaging the data over time at the individual level and with this approach it is neither necessary nor possible to account for time point in the model. As stated at p 8, ll 164-167, we used averaged data:</p><p>“We determined the maximum height of synflorescences above ground level and the number of fully opened flowers per individual (Figure 1—figure supplement 4a).

I am a bit puzzled by the floral scent collections and analyses. Usually, static collection with PMDS absorbents is used qualitatively rather than quantitatively, and in the methods it is mentioned that the compounds were not quantified but that the relative intensity of the different VOC peaks was compared. Hence, you focused on floral scent composition. This is fine, but then in the analyses of the lilac aldehydes (e.g. F), I understand it as you measure the absolute number of counts from the chromatograms.</p><p>Hence, I wonder (i) were these data stilled analysed quantitatively, and, if so, how did you validate that the number of counts was comparable across samples? The traditional method is to use dynamic headspace sampling, and then add a standard volume of a known substance to account for e.g. variable GC-MS sensitivity. Alternatively, (ii) this measure is relative (as indicated by the text and the y-axis label in the figure), but then I would like a better description of how this variable was calculated. For example, if using proportions, two samples could emit the exact same amount of the particular compound, but the proportional contribution of the same compound each overall scent bouquet could be very different, if one of the two samples include large amounts also of other scent compounds. Under such a scenario, it would be misleading to use the relative contribution of one single floral scent compound to try to predict pollinator behaviour. I apologize if I have missed something obvious here, but if so, it still makes sense to clarify how these data were obtained and what may be their limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize because the writing definitely required clarification. Performing analyses based on compound proportions was indeed not an option for us, since we expected differences in the amount of emitted VOC among treatments that cannot be detected with these type of data. We used the described technique for a qualitative comparison (scent composition) and in addition, the total ion counts from the chromatograms were compared between samples, which we now define as “intensities”. The definition of this term has been clarified in the text p 9, ll 205-206:</p><p>“Compounds were not quantified but the intensity of the total ion chromatogram of peaks was compared among treatment groups (hereinafter referred to as intensity).”</p><p>A previous study has validated this method (Kallenbach et al. 2014, http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/tpj.12523). Using representative plant VOC (i.e., the same chemical classes as found in this study) in a physiologically meaningful concentration range, the study has shown that the linear relationship among detected peak areas and compound concentration is comparable between VOC that have been passively trapped on PDMS (Figure S4) and the same compounds and concentrations analysed by direct liquid injection. Hence, we assume that the abundance of individual VOC in the floral headspace is correlated with the detected peak area based on passive sampling on PDMS and this justifies our comparison of intensities. We included this information into the methods section p 9, ll 207-208:</p><p>“A linear relationship among peak areas and compound concentrations has been validated for the passive sorption method in Kallenbach et al. (2014).”</p><p>It is correct that we have not added an internal standard to our individual samples. While the lack of an internal standard may cause unexplained variation in the intensity of individual VOC due to variable GC-MS sensitivity, it is highly unlikely that variable technical sensitivity caused the treatment effects illustrated in Figure 2f, as all samples were analysed in one trial in a fully randomised order, which is now stated at p 9, ll 190:</p><p>“All samples were measured in a single trial in a fully randomised order.“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 335-344: Again, I was confused by the term floral attractiveness, since most traits were not that important for pollinator visitation rates. This was confusing throughout the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We now avoid the term floral attractiveness throughout the manuscript and instead refer to “floral traits”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 347: Also &quot;spatial attractiveness&quot; is a bit misleading. Why not talk about the actual traits?</p></disp-quote><p>We need an umbrella term for these traits for headings, tables, graphs and the discussion. “Spatial flower trait” is an umbrella term for traits describing variation in the spatial arrangement of individual flowers (e.g., size, shape, orientation, symmetry) or the spatial arrangement of multiple flowers within the inflorescence (flower number, degree of aggregation, orientation, height relative to surrounding vegetation). This term and the necessity to distinguish between spatial flower traits and flower colour traits (that were previously summarized as “visual traits”) was established in Dafny et al. 1997 “Spatial flower traits and insect spatial vision”. We clarified this definition upon first mention of the term in the introduction at p 4, ll 39-41:</p><p>“…the spatial arrangement of individual flowers (e.g., size, shape) and multiple flowers within an inflorescence (e.g., number, height above ground, degree of aggregation), i.e., spatial flower traits (Dafni et al., 1997)… ”.</p><p>Moreover, we now stick to “spatial flower traits” throughout the entire manuscript and avoided the term “spatial attractiveness”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 445-477: I like the discussion about how the inbreeding effects on most traits, with the potential exception of floral scent, did not result in a reduced pollinator visitation rate. I think, however, that there is room for a deeper discussion here. These other traits, are they not important for pollinator attraction at all? Or were they not reduced to a large enough extent to affect pollinator visitation?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this aspect required deeper discussion and revised the section at p 19, ll 520-526 accordingly. We believe that the limited spatial vision of <italic>H. bicruris</italic> in combination with our experimental setup for pollinator observations increased the relative importance of floral scent for pollinator visitation rates (suggested by referee #3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, considering the impressive amount of data produced and the numerous predictor variables, how well can we trust that the floral scent reduction is indeed not just a spurious correlation?

High sample sizes rather reduce than increase the probability for type 1 errors as generated by randomly increased/decreased response values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I was pondering whether there was an additional way to analyze these data by comparing effect sizes (trait variation between inbred and outcrossed plants of the same category) and ask how well these explained the variation in effect size in pollinator visitation rate between inbred and outcrossed plants of the same categories. I could not come up with a straightforward way to do so, so I realize the problem of drawing too strong conclusions based on a single data point (a slight reduction in aldehyde concentration in inbred females from North America and a corresponding reduced visitation rate on inbred North American females). I think that one important take-home message here is the lack of trait-based explanations for pollinator visitation rates (which further emphasizes the need to avoid using &quot;floral attractiveness&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this question is highly interesting and we have tried to approach this issue before submitting the manuscript to eLive initially. The straightforward solution to this question is confirmatory path analysis or structural equation modelling. With this approach one could ask which floral trait was most strongly affected by which fixed effect (sex*breeding treatment*origin) and which floral trait affected pollinator visitation rates most strongly. With both approaches one basically runs a model over a set of component models (i.e., the ones we presented in Table 2). However, for these approaches one needs exactly the same sample size and random effect structures for all floral trait and pollinator visitation models. As our sample sizes vary among floral traits (Table 1) and pollinator visitation models need to be investigated with other random effect structures (trail, plot, Table 2), we cannot use these approaches. Moreover, these analyses still cannot handle complex zero-inflation formulas, which are, however, necessary to fit appropriate component models that do not seriously violate the underlying assumptions. As such we now highlight that the relationships among pollinator visitation rates and intensities of lilac aldehydes require further investigation p 19, ll 533-534:</p><p>“However, bioassays under more controlled conditions are needed to further evaluate a mechanistic relationship among pollinator visitation and intensities of lilac aldehydes”.</p><p>Furthermore, we use the term “floral traits” instead of “floral attractiveness” throughout the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S8: I wonder if there is a mistake here, because the two plots in the left panel are identical.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for this fatal mistake. We corrected the graph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, I wanted to reiterate the potential to study variation also at smaller scale. How consistent were the trait changes among populations from the same continent. Is it reasonable to lump these into the same category and to compare among continents. It would be very interesting to see some variance partitioning.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it is necessary to put populations from the same continent into one category, since native and invasive plant populations differ significantly in their evolutionary history (p 5, ll 74-81, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05751.x). Origin explained sufficient amounts of variation in several traits including flower number, corolla expansion, VOC diversity, lilac aldehyde A intensity, and pollinator visitation rates (see Figures 2-3; and Table 2) and some variation in in the magnitude of inbreeding effects (Figure 2e, f; Figure 3). Even if we would not be interested in differences among native and invasive populations, we would have to include origin as a fixed effect in our models because: (i) populations within a distribution range are no independent samples, (ii) origin explains sufficient variation in many responses, (iii) origin cannot be fitted as a random factor, since it has only two levels (the minimum number of levels for random effect is 4).</p><p>We agree that it would be very interesting to specifically assess differences in the magnitude of breeding and sex effects among populations within origins. We now discuss this as important future research direction at p 18, ll 500-507:</p><p>“As such, the precise mechanisms underlying variation in inbreeding effects on different scent traits across population origins of <italic>S. latifolia</italic> can only be explored based on comprehensive genomic resources, which are currently not available. […] This would allow a detailed quantification of geographic variation in inbreeding effects and elaborating on the causes and ecological consequences of such variation (Thompson, 2005; Schrieber and Lachmuth, 2017; Thompson et al., 2017)”.</p><p>To empirically address within-origin variation of inbreeding effects with our data, we would have to (i) fit correlated random intercepts and slopes for the interaction breeding*sex on the population random factor (models consume min. 22 DF); or (ii) include population as a fixed effect in our models (models consume min. 67 DF). We have tried both of these approaches when preparing the revision, but unfortunately it turned out that our study is not designed to address this question. The models for both variants only partially converge (see R-script ll. 1568-1580), and even if they do this does not imply that one can draw solid inference from them. Approach i often results in multiple singular convergence warning messages implying that no variance is explained by population-specific reaction norms to the fixed effects specified in the random effects structure. Approach ii results in odd rank-deficient models (I was seriously worried about type I errors here, see our thirteenth response to reviewer #2). We simply have too few replicates (5) per population*breeding treatment*sex combination for both approaches. For solid inference we would need 10<sub>approach i</sub>-40<sub>approach ii</sub> replicates = 640-2600 individuals.</p><p>However, our experimental design is sufficient to address the hypothesis we have raised in the introduction as well as general differences in response variables among populations. We now provide information on variance partitioning for all models that include population as a random effect in S9. As you will see, population explains lower amounts of variation in our responses as the fixed effects in 9 out of 12 models. The random effects maternal and paternal genotype (mother&amp;father) explain more variation than the random effect population in 6 of 12 cases. Thus, these data do not make a strong case for an extensive discussion of population-based differences in floral traits and this was also not a question or hypotheses we wanted to address with our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Line 2: The first sentence of the abstract is difficult to follow, consider rephrasing. In addition, while I would definitely agree that looking at effects of inbreeding on flowers in dioecious plants is most interesting and important because of the obligate outcrossing, this study does not explore whether these effects are &quot;particularly fatal in dioecious&quot; as there is no comparison with a hermaphroditic or monoecious plant.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the first sentence is misleading with regard to what has been investigated and rewrote it accordingly at p 3, ll 2-4:</p><p>“We study the effects of inbreeding in a dioecious plant on its interaction with pollinating insects and test whether the magnitude of such effects is shaped by plant sex and the evolutionary histories of plant populations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I found the term spatial attractiveness (first encounter on line 8) quite confusing (later on also spatial floral traits).

Of course this would not be an appropriate umbrella term considering that you also include number of flowers and inflorescence height.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the term is confusing, as we did not define it in sufficient detail in the text. “Spatial flower trait” is an umbrella term for traits describing variation in the spatial arrangement of individual flowers (e.g., size, shape, orientation, symmetry) or the spatial arrangement of multiple flowers within the inflorescence (flower number, degree of aggregation, orientation, height relative to surrounding vegetation). This term and the necessity to distinguish between spatial flower traits and flower color traits (that were previously summarized as “visual traits”) was established in Dafny et al. 1997 “Spatial flower traits and insect spatial vision”. We could think of no more appropriate term for this set of traits. We clarified this definition upon first mention of the term in the introduction at p 4, ll 39-41. Moreover, we now stick to “spatial flower traits” throughout the entire manuscript and avoided the term “spatial attractiveness”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Considering flower number only as a component of floral attractiveness is not taking full advantage of the measure. This could also be considered an important predictor of fitness and thus quite separate from the other floral morphological traits.

However, as our article focusses on inbreeding effects on plant-pollinator interactions and not on plant fitness, we call them floral traits, which has also been done in numerous other studies on plant pollinator interactions (e.g., https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14479).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 124: Are the inbred crosses between full-sibs or half-sibs?
