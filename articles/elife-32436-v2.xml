Understanding how Ras proteins are regulated is important for elucidating cell signaling pathways and identifying new targets for treating human diseases. Here we report that one of the K-Ras splice variants, K-Ras4a, is subject to lysine fatty acylation, a previously under-studied protein post-translational modification. Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), one of the mammalian nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent lysine deacylases, catalyzes the removal of fatty acylation from K-Ras4a. We further demonstrate that SIRT2-mediated lysine defatty-acylation promotes endomembrane localization of K-Ras4a, enhances its interaction with A-Raf, and thus promotes cellular transformation. Our study identifies lysine fatty acylation as a previously unknown regulatory mechanism for the Ras family of GTPases that is distinct from cysteine fatty acylation. These findings highlight the biological significance of lysine fatty acylation and sirtuin-catalyzed protein lysine defatty-acylation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>K-Ras</kwd><kwd>lysine fatty acylation</kwd><kwd>sirtuin</kwd><kwd>post-translational modification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01GM121540-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linder</surname><given-names>Maurine E</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Hening</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jing</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new post-translational regulatory mechanism of K-Ras is identified, which expands the function of reversible protein lysine fatty acylation and offers new possibility to target the K-Ras oncoprotein.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein fatty acylation facilitates direct association of proteins with particular membranes in cells and plays a vital role in protein trafficking, cell signaling, protein-protein interactions, and protein activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lanyon-Hogg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Peng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tate et al., 2015</xref>). Dysregulation of protein fatty acylation is implicated in human cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lanyon-Hogg et al., 2017</xref>). While early studies have focused on N-terminal glycine myristoylation and cysteine palmitoylation, little is known about lysine fatty acylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lanyon-Hogg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tate et al., 2015</xref>). Although first reported over two decades ago, the biological function of protein lysine fatty acylation is not clear and to date, only a few proteins, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1-α, are known to be regulated by lysine fatty acylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bursten et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hedo et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pillai and Baltimore, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stevenson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stevenson et al., 1992</xref>). The enzymes that catalyze the addition or removal of lysine fatty acylation were not known until recently when we and others found that several sirtuins, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent protein lysine deacylase, could act as lysine defatty-acylase. We have previously reported that TNF-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>) and exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) secretion are regulated by sirtuin 6 (SIRT6)-catalyzed removal of lysine fatty acylation, demonstrating that lysine fatty acylation is reversible and physiologically important. Other sirtuin family proteins, SIRT1-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Teng et al., 2015</xref>) and SIRT7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tong et al., 2017</xref>) have also been found to efficiently remove fatty acyl groups from lysine residues in vitro, suggesting that lysine fatty acylation may be more prevalent. Therefore, we sought to identify other proteins that may be regulated by lysine fatty acylation.</p><p>Ras proteins are small GTPases that play important roles in numerous tumor-driving processes, including proliferation, differentiation, survival, cell cycle entry and cytoskeletal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Malumbres and Barbacid, 2003</xref>). They act as binary switches: they are active when GTP is bound, turning on specific signaling pathways by recruiting effector proteins, and inactive in the GDP-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hancock, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Malumbres and Barbacid, 2003</xref>). Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate Ras by promoting GDP-GTP exchange, whereas GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Ras by promoting intrinsic GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Malumbres and Barbacid, 2003</xref>). In mammals, <italic>HRAS</italic>, <italic>NRAS</italic>, and <italic>KRAS</italic> proto-oncogenes encode four proteins: H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4a, and K-Ras4b. K-Ras4a and K-Ras4b are the two splice variants encoded by the <italic>KRAS</italic> gene. K-Ras4b has attracted most of the attention because it was assumed to be the more abundant and thus the more important K-Ras isoform mutated in human cancers. However, recent studies have revealed that K-Ras4a is widely expressed in many cancer cell lines and its level is similar to that of K-Ras4b in human colorectal tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). A requirement for oncogenic K-Ras4a in lung carcinogenesis has also been demonstrated in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">To et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, there is increasing interest in evaluating K-Ras4a as a therapeutic target and in investigating the regulation of K-Ras4a.</p><p>Ras proteins exert their functions at cellular membranes, where they interact with distinct effectors and activate downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hancock, 2003</xref>). Ras proteins typically have two membrane-targeting signals at the C-terminal hypervariable regions (HVRs). All four Ras proteins are modified by cysteine farnesylation on their CaaX motif. H-Ras and N-Ras contain cysteine palmitoylation as the second membrane targeting signal, whereas K-Ras4b uses a polybasic region (PBR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). K-Ras4a possesses a hybrid membrane targeting motif: multiple lysine residues at the C-terminus (similar to K-Ras4b) as well as cysteine palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). As we set out to identify lysine fatty acylated proteins, the presence of multiple lysine residues in the Ras HVRs caught our attention. If the lysine residues function simply to promote membrane binding by electrostatics, why are there almost invariably lysine but not arginine residues in the HVRs? The prevalence of lysines in Ras HVRs suggests the possibility that lysine residues are post-translationally modified by fatty acylation. Thus, in this study, we set out to investigate whether Ras proteins are regulated by reversible lysine fatty acylation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32436.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>H-Ras and K-Ras4a contain lysine fatty acylation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Amino acid sequences of the HVRs of Ras proteins.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, HEK293T cells transiently expressing FLAG-tagged H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4a, or K-Ras4b were treated with Alk14 (50 μM). We ensured that the overexpression levels of different Ras proteins were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). FLAG-tagged Ras proteins were immunoprecipitated and conjugated to rhodamine-azide (Rh-N<sub>3</sub>) using click chemistry to allow visualization of fatty acylation by in-gel fluorescence. Hydroxylamine (NH<sub>2</sub>OH) was then used to remove cysteine palmitoylation. Ras-related protein Ral-A (RalA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nishimura and Linder, 2013</xref>) and Syntaxin-6 (STX6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kang et al., 2008</xref>) were included as controls for the efficiency of NH<sub>2</sub>OH in removing cysteine palmitoylation. Quantification of the fluorescent signal revealed that NH<sub>2</sub>OH treatment removed over 95% of the fatty acylation from RalA or STX6. However, H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras4a retained 20%, 13% and 47% NH<sub>2</sub>OH-resistant fatty acylation over total fatty acylation, respectively, whereas K-Ras4b did not show Alk14 labeling either before or after NH<sub>2</sub>OH treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). These data suggest that H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras4a might possess non-cysteine fatty acylation.</p><p>To determine whether the NH<sub>2</sub>OH-resistant fatty acylation could be attributed to the lysine residues in the HVRs of H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras4a, we mutated these lysine (K) residues to arginine (R) and examined the fatty acylation of the WT and KR mutants. The H-Ras-3KR (K167/170/185R) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), N-Ras-2KR (K169/170R) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>), and the K-Ras4a-3KR (K182/184/185R) mutant but not K-Ras4a-4KR (K169/170/173/176R) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>) all displayed greatly reduced NH<sub>2</sub>OH-resistant fatty acylation, implying that H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras might be fatty acylated on the lysine residues in their HVRs. Moreover, K-Ras4a-7KR (4KR and 3KR) showed comparable NH<sub>2</sub>OH-resistant fatty acylation level to the 3KR mutant, suggesting that K182/184/185 of K-Ras4a might be fatty acylated. We then utilized mass spectrometry (MS) to directly identify the lysine fatty acylation of FLAG-H-Ras, -N-Ras or -K-Ras4a extracted from Alk14-treated HEK293T cells with tryptic digestion. This allowed us to identify H-Ras K170 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>) and K-Ras4a K182 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>) as being modified, confirming lysine fatty acylation of H-Ras and K-Ras4a. Our attempt to identify N-Ras lysine fatty acylation by MS was not successful possibly because the tryptic peptide with lysine fatty acylation was less abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), too short (MK<sub>acyl</sub>K) or too hydrophobic (K<sub>acyl</sub>LNSSDDGTQGC<sub>cam</sub>MGLPC<sub>prenyl, OMe</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Peng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Swaney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tate et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SIRT2 catalyzes the removal of lysine fatty acylation from K-Ras4a</title><p>Several mammalian sirtuins, including SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, and SIRT6, can efficiently remove fatty acyl groups from protein lysine residues in vitro (SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) and in vivo (SIRT6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Teng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). So we next investigated whether any of these sirtuins could remove lysine fatty acylation from H-Ras or K-Ras4a and therefore regulate their function. We incubated H-Ras or K-Ras4a isolated from Alk14-treated HEK293T cells with purified recombinant sirtuins without or with NAD in vitro and examined the H-Ras or K-Ras4a fatty acylation level by in-gel fluorescence after click chemistry. Incubation of H-Ras or K-Ras4a with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> Sir2A (PfSir2A), a sirtuin family member with robust lysine defatty-acylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>), resulted in the removal of most of the NH<sub>2</sub>OH-resistant fatty acylation from H-Ras and K-Ras4a in the presence of NAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). This result further confirmed that the NH<sub>2</sub>OH-resistant fatty acylation is mainly from lysine residues and indicated that lysine fatty acylation of H-Ras and K-Ras4a is reversible. Furthermore, SIRT2, but not SIRT1, 3, or 6, slightly decreased the lysine fatty acylation signal of H-Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>); SIRT1 and SIRT2, but not SIRT3 and SIRT6, removed lysine fatty acylation from K-Ras4a. Notably, SIRT2 showed better activity than SIRT1 on K-Ras4a lysine fatty acylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In contrast, SIRT1 and SIRT2 showed little effect on the fatty acylation of K-Ras4a-3KR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>), which exhibited significantly lower lysine fatty acylation than K-Ras4a-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), suggesting that SIRT1 and SIRT2 do not possess cysteine defatty-acylase activity. An HPLC-based in vitro activity assay also revealed that SIRT2 was unable to remove the cysteine myristoyl group from a K-Ras4a-C180myr peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown (KD) of SIRT2 in HEK293T cells did not affect lysine fatty acylation of H-Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and f</xref>), whereas KD of SIRT2 but not SIRT1 significantly increased lysine fatty acylation of K-Ras4a compared with control (Ctrl) KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,e and f</xref>). We also noted that SIRT2 KD did not affect fatty acylation of N-Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Taken together, these results illustrate that K-Ras4a is a lysine defatty-acylation substrate for SIRT2 in cells, but H-Ras and N-Ras are not.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32436.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SIRT2 removes lysine fatty acylation from K-Ras4a.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) In-gel fluorescence detection of fatty acylation of H-Ras (<bold>a</bold>) and K-Ras4a (<bold>b</bold>) treated with 5 μM of SIRT1, 2, 3 and 6 without or with 1 mM of NAD in vitro.

We utilized the SIRT2-H187Y (HY) mutant, which has previously been shown to be catalytically dead in lysine deacetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">North and Verdin, 2007b</xref>), as a negative control. An HPLC-based in vitro assay demonstrated that the H187Y mutation dramatically decreased SIRT2 defatty-acylation activity, while it completely abolished its deacetylation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Co-expression of SIRT2 with K-Ras4a in HEK293T cells substantially decreased K-Ras4a lysine fatty acylation, whereas co-expression of SIRT2-HY had much less effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>), suggesting that K-Ras4a defatty-acylation requires SIRT2 catalytic activity. Interestingly, our finding that mutation of the catalytic histidine residue did not completely abolish sirtuin enzymatic activity is not without precedent. For example, mutating the catalytic histidine of bacterial Sir2Tm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoff et al., 2006</xref>), yeast HST2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jackson et al., 2003</xref>), and human SIRT6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) also retained some catalytic activity.</p><p>To investigate whether K-Ras4a could also be regulated by SIRT2 through deacetylation, we examined its acetylation level using a pan-specific acetyl lysine antibody. Acetylation was not detected on K-Ras4a in either Ctrl KD or SIRT2 KD cells without or with histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f</xref>). We also searched our K-Ras4a MS data and did not find any peptides with lysine acetylation, indicating that SIRT2 likely does not regulate K-Ras4a via deacetylation.</p><p>With SIRT2 as a tool, we further confirmed the existence of lysine fatty acylation on K-Ras4a in cells that were not treated with Alk14. We used a previously developed assay that relies on <sup>32</sup>P-NAD to detect sirtuin-catalyzed deacylation reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Du et al., 2011</xref>). When histone H3K9 acetyl (Ac) and myristoyl (Myr) peptides were incubated with SIRT2-WT in the presence of <sup>32</sup>P-NAD, the formation of the acyl-ADPR product could be detected by autoradiography after separation using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>, lanes 6 and 7). In contrast, the SIRT2-HY mutant only generated a tiny amount of the acyl-ADPR product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>, lanes 11 and 12). When K-Ras4a isolated from HEK293T cells was treated with SIRT2-WT in the presence of <sup>32</sup>P-NAD, a spot corresponding to fatty acyl-ADPR but not acetyl-ADPR was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>, lane 9). Control reactions without SIRT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>, lane 4) or with the HY mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>, lane 14) did not generate the fatty acyl-ADPR product. These results demonstrate that K-Ras4a contains lysine fatty acylation that can be removed by SIRT2 in the absence of Alk14 supplementation. A peptide carrying palmitoylation, but not myristoylation, on K182 of FLAG-tagged K-Ras4a was detected by MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1g</xref>), demonstrating that palmitoylation is the major native lysine acylation of K-Ras4a.</p><p>We then investigated whether endogenous K-Ras4a is also regulated by SIRT2-catalyzed lysine defatty-acylation. For this purpose, we used the HCT116 human colorectal cancer cell line, in which K-Ras4a was shown to be expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>). Since the commercial antibody against K-Ras4a did not immunoprecipitate K-Ras4a, we enriched fatty acylated proteins labeled with Alk14 as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>), and detected fatty acylated K-Ras4a via Western blot using a K-Ras4a-specific antibody. HCT116 cells with Ctrl or SIRT2 KD were cultured in the presence of Alk14. Proteins were then extracted and a biotin affinity tag was attached to the Alk14-labeled proteins with click chemistry. The biotin-conjugated proteins were pulled down using streptavidin beads, and subsequently washed with 1% SDS to disrupt protein-protein interaction. Proteins that were only fatty acylated on cysteine residues were then released from the streptavidin beads into the supernatant (Sup) <italic>via</italic> NH<sub>2</sub>OH treatment, while proteins with lysine fatty acylation were retained. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>, RalA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) and transferrin receptor (TfR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Omary and Trowbridge, 1981</xref>), which are predominantly cysteine fatty acylated, were present in the supernatant but barely detectable from the streptavidin beads, indicating that the NH<sub>2</sub>OH treatment was effective. In Ctrl KD cells, K-Ras4a was mainly detected in the supernatant. However, in the SIRT2 KD cells, K-Ras4a was detected both on the streptavidin beads and in the supernatant, indicating that endogenous K-Ras4a possesses lysine fatty acylation that is regulated by SIRT2.</p><p>By immunoprecipitation of total Ras protein from Alk14-treated HCT116 cells using a pan-Ras (Y13-259) antibody, we found that endogenous Ras proteins exhibited NH<sub>2</sub>OH-resistant fatty acylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Moreover, SIRT2 KD increased the NH<sub>2</sub>OH-resistant fatty acylation of Ras proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Since SIRT2 KD did not affect lysine fatty acylation of overexpressed H-Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and f</xref>) and N-Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>), the data suggested that the increase in total Ras lysine fatty acylation observed in SIRT2 KD cells can be attributed to K-Ras4a lysine fatty acylation. This result, together with the detection of K-Ras4a lysine fatty acylation by Alk14 biotinylation, further supports that endogenous K-Ras4a is lysine fatty acylated and is regulated by SIRT2-mediated lysine defatty-acylation. We also performed MS analysis of endogenous Ras immunoprecipitated from HCT116 cells treated with SIRT2 shRNA and Alk14. We identified a peptide with a primary mass matching the Alk14-modified K-Ras4a aa177-185 peptide, whose exact m/z and isotope pattern were the same as those of overexpressed K-Ras4a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>). However, this primary mass did not trigger MS2, which was likely due to low peptide abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c and d</xref>). It has been shown that K-Ras has a much lower expression level than H-Ras and N-Ras because of its rare codon bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lampson et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>SIRT2 was reported to reside predominately in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Inoue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">North and Verdin, 2007a</xref>). The regulation of K-Ras4a lysine fatty acylation by SIRT2 suggested that SIRT2 might also exist at cellular membranes, where K-Ras4a mainly resides. Indeed, by subcellular fractionation, we found that SIRT2 was present in both soluble and membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1h</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) revealed K-Ras4a associated with endogenous SIRT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1i</xref>). These results further support that K-Ras4a is a lysine defatty-acylase substrate for SIRT2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mapping the fatty acylated lysine residues regulated by SIRT2</title><p>MS results suggested that K182 was the preferentially fatty acylated lysine on K-Ras4a. However, the lysine 182 to arginine mutant (K182R) exhibited similar lysine fatty acylation levels to that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). As the 3KR (K182/184/185R) but not the 4KR (K169/170/173/176R) mutant significantly decreased K-Ras4a lysine fatty acylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), we also mutated K184 and K185 to arginine individually. Neither the K184R nor K185R mutation decreased lysine fatty acylation as the 3KR mutant did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). These results suggested that K182, 184 and 185 were likely to be modified redundantly. We suspected that it was hard to pinpoint the exact modification site by mutagenesis because the K182R mutation might enhance fatty acylation on the other two nearby lysine residues. To test this hypothesis, we performed MS analysis of FLAG-K-Ras4a-K182A extracted from Alk14-treated HEK293T cells. We tested the K182A instead of K182R mutant because the K182R mutant would produce a tryptic peptide that is too short to be detected. As expected, the K182A mutation did not affect overall level of K-Ras4a lysine fatty acylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). A peptide (amino acids 177–185) fatty acylated on K184 was detected by MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), which agrees with our hypothesis. It was likely that K185 could also be fatty acylated for the K182R mutant, because the K182/185R mutant slightly but significantly decreased lysine fatty acylation levels compared with the K182R and K185R single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The K185 fatty acylation was not detected by MS most likely because the modified tryptic peptide was too short and hydrophobic (K<sub>fatty-acyl</sub>C<sub>prenyl, oMe</sub>). Overall, these data indicate that K182/184/185 are fatty acylated redundantly and that the 3KR mutation is needed to abolish lysine fatty acylation on the C-terminus of K-Ras4a.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32436.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>SIRT2 regulates lysine fatty acylation of K-Ras4a on K182/184/185.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Fatty acylation levels of K-Ras4a-WT, -K182R, -K184R, -K185R, -K182/185R, and -3KR by in-gel fluorescence (left panel) and quantification of fatty acylation levels after NH<sub>2</sub>OH treatment relative to that of K-Ras4a-WT (right panel).

To examine whether cysteine prenylation or palmitoylation plays a role in lysine fatty acylation, we generated cysteine-to-serine C180S and C186S mutants. Mutation of the prenylcysteine (C186S) completely abolished the fatty acylation of K-Ras4a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), which is consistent with the model that prenylation of the cysteine on the CaaX motif of Ras proteins is required for the subsequent fatty acylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wright and Philips, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, mutation of the palmitoylated cysteine (C180S) led to a substantial, but not a complete, loss of K-Ras4a lysine fatty acylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The fatty acylation on the C180S mutant was NH<sub>2</sub>OH-resistant and was abolished by combining the C180S and 3KR mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), implying that the C180S mutant was fatty acylated on K182/184/185. These data suggest that cysteine palmitoylation might play an important but nonessential role in the occurrence of lysine fatty acylation. It is possible that cysteine palmitoylation facilitates the lysine fatty acyl transfer reaction, or the delivery of K-Ras4a to where lysine fatty acylation occurs.</p><p>We next assessed whether SIRT2 regulates fatty acylation of K-Ras4a on K182/184/185.

A variety of PTMs on Ras proteins, such as cysteine palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rocks et al., 2005</xref>), phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballester et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bivona et al., 2006</xref>), and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jura et al., 2006</xref>), function to deliver the molecule to the right place within the cell. We hypothesized that lysine fatty acylation may also be critical for the correct subcellular distribution of K-Ras4a. To test this hypothesis, we fused <italic>Aequorea coerulescens</italic> Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to the N-terminus of K-Ras4a-WT and the 3KR mutant and performed live imaging with confocal microscopy in Ctrl and SIRT2 KD HEK293T cells to visualize K-Ras4a localization. The levels of over-expressed K-Ras4a-WT and -3KR were equal in Ctrl and SIRT2 KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We also imaged cells with similar GFP intensity under the same settings to avoid potential false positive observations caused by different levels of expression. In Ctrl KD cells, both K-Ras4a-WT and the 3KR mutant displayed predominant localization to the plasma membrane (PM). However, the presence of 3KR on intracellular puncta was noticeably more pronounced compared to WT. SIRT2 KD decreased the intracellular punctate-localized K-Ras4a-WT compared to Ctrl KD, whereas it had no effect on the punctate localization of the 3KR mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>) that did not contain SIRT2-regulated lysine fatty acylation. This result suggests that SIRT2-catalyzed lysine defatty-acylation promotes the intracellular punctate localization of K-Ras4a and that the K-Ras4a-3KR mutant has increased intracellular punctate localization mainly due to the lack of lysine fatty acylation. Consistently, a similar trend was observed in <italic>Sirt2</italic> WT and KO MEF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Moreover, increased intracellular punctate localization of the 3KR mutation were also observed for K-Ras4a-WT and oncogenic K-Ras4a-G12V (K-Ras4a-G12V exhibited a lysine fatty acylation level comparable to K-Ras4a-WT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>) in HCT116 cells and NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d and e</xref>). On the other hand, SIRT2 KD did not affect the intracellular punctate localization of H-Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>), which is consistent with our observation that H-Ras was not regulated by SIRT2 through lysine defatty-acylation. Taken together, these data indicate that lysine fatty acylation inhibits the intracellular punctate localization of K-Ras4a and SIRT2 promotes this localization by defatty-acylation. In addition, the K-Ras4a-C180S mutant that lacks cysteine palmitoylation and the majority of lysine fatty acylation extensively localized to internal membranes, which was distinct from the punctate localization of the 3KR mutant that is deficient in lysine fatty acylation but retains cysteine palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f and g</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>).

Therefore, we next set out to identify the endomembrane compartments where lysine defatty-acylated K-Ras4a is localized. We performed colocalization analyses with a series of membrane compartment markers. Compared with K-Ras4a-WT, the 3KR mutant exhibited more pronounced cytoplasmic colocalization with <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) marker STX6, early endosome marker EEA1, recycling endosome marker Rab11, and lysosome marker LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>), but not with the ER marker Sec61, <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi marker GalT and late endosome marker Rab7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1h and i</xref>).

These results suggest that removal of lysine fatty acylation from K-Ras4a promotes its localization to endomembranes in endocytic pathways, by which it may be routed from early endosome to the lysosome for degradation and to the TGN or recycling endosomes to return to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grant and Donaldson, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Lysine fatty acylation regulates transforming activity of K-Ras4a</title><p>We next investigated whether lysine fatty acylation also affects the function of K-Ras4a. We assessed the ability of constitutively active K-Ras4a-G12V and the K-Ras4a-G12V-3KR mutant to enable anchorage-independent growth, promote proliferation in monolayer cultures, and stimulate migration in Ctrl and Sirt2 KD NIH3T3 cells. In Ctrl KD cells, expression of K-Ras4a-G12V-3KR resulted in significantly more colony formation on soft agar than did expression of K-Ras4a-G12V. Furthermore, Sirt2 KD caused a greater decrease in colony formation induced by K-Ras4a-G12V (75% decrease) than by K-Ras4a-G12V-3KR (45% decrease) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Additionally, Sirt2 KD more potently inhibited K-Ras4a-G12V-mediated colony formation than H-Ras4a-G12V-mediated colony formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), consistent with the fact that SIRT2 regulates lysine fatty acylation of K-Ras4a but not H-Ras or K-Ras4a-3KR. Thus, lysine fatty acylation inhibits the ability of K-Ras4a-G12V to induce anchorage-independent growth of cells and SIRT2 promotes it through defatty-acylation. One caveat of the result, however, was that Sirt2 KD still decreased the colony formation induced by K-Ras4a-G12V-3KR or H-Ras-G12V, whose lysine fatty acylation was not regulated by SIRT2. This is not unexpected because SIRT2 is known to exert tumor-promoting functions by deacetylating various targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">He et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jing et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jing and Lin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>).

Thus, lysine fatty acylation negatively regulates K-Ras4a-G12V-induced cell proliferation under monolayer culture conditions, but the effect was smaller than that on anchorage-independent growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Results from transwell migration assays revealed that the 3KR mutation did not affect the capability of K-Ras4a-G12V to induce cell migration.

Therefore, lysine fatty acylation does not affect the ability of K-Ras4a-G12V to stimulate cell migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Lysine fatty acylation of K-Ras4a affects interaction with A-Raf</title><p>The dynamic regulation of Ras localization is known to be closely coupled to its signaling output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chandra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dekker et al., 2010</xref>). We decided to further explore the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of K-Ras4a-mediated transformation by lysine fatty acylation. We first sought to examine whether lysine fatty acylation affects K-Ras4a activation by a pull-down assay with the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf1, which only binds to the GTP-bound form of Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiu et al., 2002</xref>). Neither the 3KR mutation nor SIRT2 KD affected EGF-stimulated GTP loading of K-Ras4a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>) or the constitutively GTP-loaded state of K-Ras4a-G12V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>). We then determined whether K-Ras4a at endomembranes exists in its GTP-bound state using DsRed-RBD (DsRed fused to the N-terminus of RBD) as a probe. Notably, we observed more colocalization of DsRed-RBD with K-Ras4a on intracellular puncta in cells expressing the 3KR mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1e,f,g</xref>) than in cells expressing K-Ras4a-WT. Furthermore, SIRT2 KD decreased the colocalization of DsRed-RBD with K-Ras4a-WT at intracellular puncta, but not with the 3KR mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1e</xref>).</p><p>The results above suggest that SIRT2-dependent lysine defatty-acylation may promote the localization of activated (GTP-loaded) K-Ras4a at endomembranes, which raises the possibility that lysine defatty-acylation may alter the signaling specificity of K-Ras4a by recruiting different effector proteins to endomembranes. We therefore investigated whether lysine defatty-acylation influenced the binding and activation of the three most well characterized Ras effectors: Raf1, PI3K, and RalGDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berndt et al., 2011</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that neither the 3KR mutation nor Sirt2 KD altered the binding of K-Ras4a-G12V with Raf1, PI3K, or RalGDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a</xref>). We also assessed the capacity of K-Ras4a-G12V and -G12V-3KR in Ctrl and Sirt2 KD cells to activate Raf1, PI3K, and RalGDS signaling pathways using phosphorylated Erk, phosphorylated Akt, and phosphorylated Jnk as reporters, respectively. K-Ras4a-G12V and -G12V-3KR induced comparable levels of Erk activation, which was not affected by Sirt2 KD. Sirt2 KD resulted in a reduction of Akt and Jnk activation, but the effect was similar for both K-Ras4a-G12V and -G12V-3KR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2b</xref>), suggesting that other Sirt2 targets are important for Akt and Jnk activation. These results suggest that SIRT2 catalyzed lysine defatty-acylation of K-Ras4a does not affect the activation of Raf1, PI3K or RalGDS by K-Ras4a.</p><p>To identify proteins whose binding to K-Ras4a is regulated by lysine fatty acylation, we performed a protein interactome study using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3a</xref>). We cultured NIH3T3 cells with stable K-Ras4a-G12V and K-Ras4a-G12V-3KR overexpression in light-isotope- and heavy-isotope-labeled media, respectively. We then performed FLAG IP, mixed the eluted fractions from both IPs, digested with trypsin and analyzed by MS to identify proteins with Heavy/Light (H/L) ratios &gt; 1.3 or &lt; 0.77, which were candidates that would potentially bind to K-Ras4a-G12V and K-Ras4a-G12V-3KR differently. The experiment was also repeated after swapping the heavy and light SILAC labels. Additionally, to confirm that the effect of the 3KR mutation on the K-Ras4a-G12V interactome was due to the lack of lysine fatty acylation, we also examined the K-Ras4a-G12V interactome in Ctrl and Sirt2 KD cells with SILAC, which enabled the identification of proteins (H/L &gt; 1.3 or&lt;0.77) whose binding to K-Ras4a-G12V was regulated by SIRT2. Integration of the three interactome experiments resulted in 175 interacting proteins with at least two unique peptides and H/L ratios (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6s3sdata1">Figure 6—figure supplement 3-source data 1</xref>). Among them, nine proteins exhibited increased binding to K-Ras4a-G12V-3KR compared to K-Ras4a-G12V, and their interaction with K-Ras4a-G12V was inhibited by Sirt2 KD, suggesting that lysine defatty-acylation enhanced K-Ras4a-G12V interaction with these proteins. On the other hand, one protein showed decreased binding to K-Ras4a-G12V-3KR compared to K-Ras4a-G12V, and its interaction with K-Ras4a-G12V was increased by Sirt2 KD, suggesting that lysine defatty-acylation repressed K-Ras4a-G12V interaction with it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3b</xref>).</p><p>Among these 10 proteins, the serine/threonine-protein kinase A-Raf and Apoptosis-inducing factor 1 (Aif), whose interaction with K-Ras4a-G12V might be increased by lysine defatty-acylation, attracted our attention. A-Raf is a member of the Raf family of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases, acts as a Ras effector and plays an important role in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rauch et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2016</xref>) and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Imielinski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nelson et al., 2014</xref>). In response to apoptotic stimuli, Aif is released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol and nucleus, where it functions as a proapoptotic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hangen et al., 2010</xref>). Since suppression of apoptosis is linked to Ras-induced transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pylayeva-Gupta et al., 2011</xref>), it is plausible that A-Raf and Aif are involved in the regulation of K-Ras4a transformation activity by lysine fatty acylation. To test this hypothesis, we first validated the interactome results by co-IP. Although more interaction of Aif with K-Ras4a-G12V-3KR was observed than with K-Ras4a-G12V, Sirt2 KD did not affect the interaction of Aif with either K-Ras4a-G12V or K-Ras4a-G12V-3KR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3c and d</xref>) and was not investigated further. However, a greater interaction of A-Raf with K-Ras4a-G12V-3KR was observed than with K-Ras4a-G12V, and Sirt2 KD significantly decreased the interaction of A-Raf with K-Ras4a-G12V but not with K-Ras4a-G12V-3KR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and b</xref>). Thus, we concluded that A-Raf was an effector protein of K-Ras4a that was regulated by lysine fatty acylation and SIRT2. Unlike the effect of Sirt2 KD on K-Ras4a-G12V-A-Raf interaction, Sirt2 KD did not alter H-Ras-G12V-A-Raf interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and b</xref>). As mentioned earlier, lysine fatty acylation did not affect the binding between C-Raf (Raf1) and K-Ras4a-G12V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a</xref>). We also assessed the interaction of K-Ras4a-G12V with another Raf family member, B-Raf. Co-IP indicated that neither 3KR mutation nor Sirt2 KD altered the binding of B-Raf to K-Ras4a-G12V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2c</xref>). These results collectively demonstrate that removal of lysine fatty acylation from K-Ras4a by SIRT2 results in its preferential association with A-Raf, but not B-Raf or C-Raf.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32436.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A-Raf is involved in the regulation of K-Ras4a transforming activity by lysine fatty acylation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Co-IP of A-Raf with an anti-FLAG antibody in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing Mock, FLAG-K-Ras4a-G12V, FLAG-K-Ras4a-G12V-3KR, or FLAG-H-Ras-G12V with Ctrl or Sirt2 KD.

It has been reported that the efficient activation of certain effector pathways by Ras is dependent on the entry of Ras to the endosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roy et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that lysine defatty-acylation may facilitate the endomembrane recruitment of A-Raf by K-Ras4a, thereby increasing K-Ras4a transforming activity. Live cell imaging revealed that A-Raf colocalized with K-Ras4a-G12V at both the PM and endomembranes. K-Ras4a-G12V-3KR showed more colocalization with A-Raf on the endomembranes than K-Ras4a-G12V did. Sirt2 KD inhibited the endomembrane recruitment of A-Raf by K-Ras4a-G12V but not that by K-Ras4a-G12V-3KR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c and d</xref>). These results are in line with our hypothesis. Thus, it is likely that by regulating endomembrane recruitment of A-Raf, K-Ras4a lysine fatty acylation may alter its signaling output through A-Raf, thereby modulating its transforming activity.</p><p>While the functions of B-Raf and C-Raf in Ras-mediated transformation have been well elucidated, the role of A-Raf in this process remains obscure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2015</xref>). So we next examined whether A-Raf plays a role in K-Ras4a-G12V mediated transformation using the soft agar colony formation assay. Inhibition of A-Raf expression with shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4a</xref>) partially suppressed K-Ras4a-G12V-induced colony formation, indicating that A-Raf is important for K-Ras4a-G12V mediated transformation. Moreover, A-Raf KD abrogated the 3KR mutation-mediated increase and Sirt2 KD-mediated decrease in the transformation activity of K-Ras4a-G12V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4b</xref>), suggesting that A-Raf is important for the regulation of K-Ras4a transforming activity by SIRT2-dependent lysine defatty-acylation. These results further support the model that lysine defatty-acylation by SIRT2 enhances the recruitment of A-Raf to K-Ras4a at endomembranes, thereby promoting transforming activity of K-Ras4a.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Protein lysine fatty acylation was discovered over two decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bursten et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hedo et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pillai and Baltimore, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stevenson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stevenson et al., 1992</xref>). However, very little is known about its functional significance. Our current study furnishes a model where K-Ras4a is fatty acylated on lysine residues at its C-terminal HVR, and the removal of lysine fatty acylation by SIRT2 facilitates its endomembrane localization and interaction with A-Raf, thus enhancing its transforming activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These findings demonstrate that K-Ras is modified and regulated by a previously under-appreciated PTM, lysine fatty acylation, which expands not only the regulatory mechanisms for Ras proteins, but also the biological significance of lysine fatty acylation. Moreover, our study reveals the first lysine defatty-acylation substrate for SIRT2 and uncovers the physiological relevance of SIRT2 as a lysine defatty-acylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Teng et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32436.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for the regulation of K-Ras4a by SIRT2-mediated removal of lysine fatty acylation.</title><p>Removal of lysine fatty acylation by SIRT2 facilitates K-Ras4a to localize to endomembranes and interact with A-Raf, and thus enhances its activity to transform cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-32436-fig7-v2"/></fig><p>We found that H-Ras and K-Ras4a possess lysine fatty acylation that could be hydrolyzed by sirtuins in vitro or in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Although our attempt to detect N-Ras lysine fatty acylation by MS was not successful, the N-Ras-K169/170R (2KR) mutant presented decreased NH<sub>2</sub>OH-resisitant fatty acylation compared with WT, suggesting that N-Ras might be lysine fatty acylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). While cysteine palmitoylation of Ras proteins was discovered almost three decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buss and Sefton, 1986</xref>), lysine fatty acylation of Ras was not identified for several reasons. First, lysine fatty acylation did not emerge as a physiologically significant modification until recent years. Correspondingly, the possibility of lysine fatty acylation on Ras proteins had not been investigated previously. Second, previously people only focused on Ras cysteine palmitoylation because mutations of the palmitoylated cysteine to serine abolished the palmitoylation of H-Ras, N-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hancock et al., 1989</xref>), and K-Ras4a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>) based on <sup>3</sup>H-palmitic acid labeling. Therefore, lysine fatty acylation of Ras proteins might have been missed based on the mutagenesis results. Similar to, but slightly different from these previous reports, we found that mutating the palmitoylated cysteine of K-Ras4a decreased lysine fatty acylation by nearly 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) but not completely. A similar effect of the palmitoylated cysteine to serine mutation was also observed for R-Ras2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Last, although the palmitoylation sites for Ras proteins were characterized with chemoproteomic approaches based on acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drisdel and Green, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kang et al., 2008</xref>) or acyl-resin-assisted capture (acyl-RAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Forrester et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lanyon-Hogg et al., 2017</xref>), these approaches are cysteine-centric and do not allow identification of amide-linked fatty acylation. Direct site identification of palmitoylation has been challenging owing to the low abundance and high hydrophobicity of modified peptides, which are easily lost during sample preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Peng et al., 2016</xref>). Our current study highlights the regulation of Ras proteins by lysine fatty acylation and suggests that additional studies are required to understand the regulation of this important class of proteins. Many members of the Ras superfamily of GTPases contain lysine-rich sequences at their C-termini. It is therefore of great interest to us to investigate whether lysine fatty acylation could act as a general regulatory mechanism for many Ras-related small GTPases.</p><p>The discovery of lysine fatty acylation on K-Ras4a raises the question of the relative abundance of lysine versus cysteine fatty acylation. Semi-quantification of the fluorescence intensity from Alk14 labeling results enables us to roughly estimate the stoichiometry of lysine fatty acylation. Based on this, K-Ras4a exhibits nearly 50% of lysine fatty acylation relative to total fatty acylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Therefore, the ratio of cysteine palmitoylation to lysine fatty acylation may be close to 1:1 on K-Ras4a. The 3KR mutation decreased K-Ras4a lysine fatty acylation by about 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f and 3e</xref>), suggesting that the C-terminal lysine fatty acylation regulated by SIRT2 is around 50% of the lysine fatty acylation and 25% of the total fatty acylation. Regarding endogenous K-Ras4a, by quantifying the K-Ras4a western blot signal from the streptavidin beads and supernatant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>, we estimated that about 28% and 50% of the fatty acylated K-Ras4a is lysine fatty acylated in Ctrl KD and SIRT2 KD HCT116 cells, respectively. Unfortunately, precise quantitation of protein fatty acylation still remains a significant unsolved challenge and we could not determine the ratio of fatty acylated versus unmodified K-Ras4a.</p><p>To study the physiological function of K-Ras4a lysine fatty acylation, we utilized the K-Ras4a-3KR mutant in combination with SIRT2 KD. The lysine-to-arginine mutant maintains the positive charge of the polybasic patch, which makes it a good lysine fatty acylation-deficient mimic. Recently, Zhou <italic>et al.</italic> reported that lysine and arginine residues are not equivalent in determining the membrane lipid binding specificity of K-Ras4b C-terminus, which raises the possibility that the effect of 3KR mutation might not be solely due to lack of lysine fatty acylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, changes in the SIRT2 KD cells could be mediated through other substrates for SIRT2. Therefore, it is critical to employ both the 3KR mutant and SIRT2 KD to rule out these possibilities. SIRT2 KD enhances the lysine fatty acylation of K-Ras4a-WT but not the 3KR mutant. Thus, if a biological effect is due to lysine fatty acylation, SIRT2 should have a greater impact on the effect of K-Ras4a-WT than that of the 3KR mutant. Of note, H-Ras, which shares similar properties with K-Ras4a, but is not a lysine defatty-acylase target for SIRT2, also serves as a good control for the effect of SIRT2 KD. Indeed, SIRT2 KD repressed the endomembrane localization, transforming activity, and A-Raf binding of K-Ras4a-WT more than that of K-Ras4a-3KR or H-Ras, indicating that SIRT2-dependent lysine defatty-acylation facilitates endomembrane localization of K-Ras4a, enhances its interaction with A-Raf, and thus promotes cellular transformation.</p><p>Goodwin <italic>et al.</italic> previously reported that cysteine depalmitoylated H-Ras and N-Ras traffic to and from the Golgi complex by a nonvesicular mechanism, and suggested a model where cysteine palmitoylation traps Ras on membranes, enabling Ras to undergo vesicular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodwin et al., 2005</xref>). In line with this, Tsai <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>) and we observed that the K-Ras4a-C180S mutant, which possesses no cysteine palmitoylation and little lysine fatty acylation, localizes to ER/Golgi-like internal membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f and g</xref>). Differently, we found that removal of the lysine fatty acylation by SIRT2, which results in K-Ras4a with only cysteine palmitoylation, promotes endomembrane localization of K-Ras4a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). This evidence supports the model that cysteine palmitoylation enables K-Ras4a to undergo vesicular transport, whereas lysine fatty acylation blocks K-Ras4a translocation from the plasma membrane to endomembranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Furthermore, the C180S mutant suppressed K-Ras4a-G12V-mediated anchorage-independent growth and activation of MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, the 3KR mutant increased K-Ras4a-G12V-mediated anchorage-independent growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b and c</xref>), exhibited no effect on MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), but activated A-Raf instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Considering the possibility that lysine fatty acylation largely relies on cysteine palmitoylation to occur, it is likely that the reversible lysine fatty acylation adds a layer of regulation for K-Ras4a above that of cysteine palmitoylation.</p><p>We noted that K-Ras4a-G12V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>) exhibits weaker endomembrane localization than K-Ras4a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), which raises questions about the differential regulation of K-Ras4a and K-Ras4a-G12V subcellular localization. K-Ras4a and K-Ras4a-G12V possess comparable total and lysine fatty acylation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>), suggesting that the difference in their subcellular distribution is not due to fatty acylation. It is possible that the activation state of K-Ras4a influences its dynamics on the plasma membrane and endomembranes, the mechanism for which remains to be elucidated in the future.</p><p>In the GTP-bound active form, Ras proteins bind directly to the Ras binding domain (RBD) of Raf, then form secondary interactions with a cysteine-rich domain (CRD). Although the RBD and CRD are highly conserved in all Raf isozymes, there is evidence for different binding affinities for Ras proteins to the individual Raf proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Matallanas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wellbrock et al., 2004</xref>). For example, Weber <italic>et al.</italic> reported that A-Raf presents significantly lower binding affinities to H-Ras-G12V as compared to C-Raf because the Ras-binding interface of C-Raf differs from A-Raf by a conservative arginine to lysine exchange at residue 59 and 22, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Weber et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, Williams <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Williams et al., 2000</xref>) and Fischer <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fischer et al., 2007</xref>) found that farnesylation of H-Ras is required for its binding to C-Raf but not to B-Raf, implying the involvement of Ras C-terminal PTM in regulating Ras-Raf interactions. Based on these previous studies, it is likely that the C-terminal PTM of K-Ras4a regulates its interaction with Raf isozymes and that lysine fatty acylation may inhibit the binding of K-Ras4a to A-Raf but not to B-Raf and C-Raf.</p><p>Mutations that activate Ras are found in about 30% of all human tumors screened. <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations, which affects both K-Ras4a and K-Ras4b, occur most frequently, accounting for 86% of <italic>RAS</italic>-driven cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cox et al., 2014</xref>). Although K-Ras4a is homologous to the transforming cDNA identified in Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shimizu et al., 1983</xref>), its function and regulation is less characterized compared to K-Ras4b. Recent studies showed that K-Ras4a is widely expressed in human cancers, suggesting that K-Ras4a plays a significant role in <italic>KRAS</italic>-driven tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings reveal that K-Ras4a is regulated by SIRT2-dependent lysine defatty-acylation. Depletion of SIRT2 increased lysine fatty acylation and diminished transforming activity of K-Ras4a, suggesting that interference with K-Ras4a lysine fatty acylation could be an approach to anti-K-Ras therapy.</p><p>The seven mammalian sirtuins, SIRT1-7, are implicated in various biological pathways and are considered potential targets against a number of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jing and Lin, 2015</xref>). So far, the known biological functions of sirtuins have been mainly attributed to their deacetylase activities. Although sirtuins are increasingly recognized as lysine deacylases in addition to deacetylases, the biological significance of sirtuins as lysine deacylases remains largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bheda et al., 2016</xref>). Our work here identifies the first physiological defatty-acylation substrate for SIRT2. Since protein acyl lysine modifications likely use acyl-CoA molecules as the acyl donors, the cellular metabolic state can affect acyl lysine PTMs by altering the concentration of acyl-CoA molecules. Sirtuins requires NAD as a co-substrate and the NAD level is regulated by cellular metabolism. Thus SIRT2 may provide an additional link between K-Ras4a signaling and cellular metabolism. Given that Ras proteins play critical roles in many human cancers, SIRT2, as a Ras regulator, may be an important therapeutic target for cancer, which is consistent with several recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jing et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moniot et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shah et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wilking-Busch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">2016</xref>). The physiological and pathophysiological roles of SIRT2 thus merit further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>cell line (human)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td>Cat#: CRL-3216, <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>cell line (human)</td><td>HCT116</td><td>ATCC</td><td>Cat#: CCL-247, <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0291">CVCL_0291</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>cell line (mouse)</td><td>NIH3T3</td><td>ATCC</td><td>Cat#: CRL1658, <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0594">CVCL_0594</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>cell line (human)</td><td>MEF <italic>Sirt2</italic> WT and KO</td><td>Other</td><td>N/A</td><td>Obtained from Dr. Toren Finkel's laboratory at NIH, Bethesda, MD</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct</td><td>pLKO.1-shLuciferase</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>SHC007</td><td/></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (human)</td><td>pLKO.1-shSIRT1-#1</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>TRCN0000018980</td><td/></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (human)</td><td>pLKO.1-shSIRT1-#2</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>TRCN0000018981</td><td/></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (human)</td><td>pLKO.1-shSIRT2-#1</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>TRCN0000040219</td><td/></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (human)</td><td>pLKO.1-shSIRT2-#2</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>TRCN0000310335</td><td/></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (mouse)</td><td>pLKO.1-shSIRT2</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>TRCN0000012118</td><td/></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (mouse)</td><td>pLKO.1-shA-Raf-#1</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>TRCN0000022612</td><td/></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (mouse)</td><td>pLKO.1-shA-Raf-#2</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>TRCN0000022610</td><td/></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (human)</td><td>pCMV5-FLAG-K-Ras4a</td><td>This paper</td><td>N/A</td><td>Cloning described in <italic>Cloning and mutagenesis</italic></td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (human)</td><td>pCMV5-FLAG-H-Ras</td><td>This paper</td><td>N/A</td><td>Provided by Dr. Maurine E.

After washing the FLAG resin five times with IP washing buffer, the resins from ‘heavy’ and ‘light’ cells were mixed. Enriched proteins on the resin were eluted with triple FLAG peptide following the manufacturer’s protocol. Eluted proteins were precipitated with methanol/chloroform/water (4/1.5/3 vol ratio with the sample volume set as 1), and the protein pellets were washed twice with 1 mL ice-cold methanol. The protein pellets were air dried for 10–15 min, and subjected to disulfide reduction and protein denaturation in 100 µL of buffer containing 6 M urea, 10 mM DTT and 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 at room temperature for 1 hr. Then iodoacetamide (final concentration 40 mM) was added to alkylate the proteins at room temperature for 1 hr. Subsequently, DTT (final concentration 40 mM) was added to stop alkylation at room temperature for 1 hr. The samples were then diluted seven times with buffer containing 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and digested with 2 µg trypsin at 37 ˚C for 12 hr.

To detect K-Ras4a lysine fatty acylation, HEK293T cells with stable SIRT2 KD were transfected with pCMV5-FLAG-K-Ras4a for 24 hr and treated with or without 50 µM Alk14 for another 6 hr. Cells were collected and lysed in 1% NP-40 lysis buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail. FLAG IP was then performed with 50 mg of total protein lysate to purify FLAG-K-Ras4a or Flag-H-Ras. After washing the FLAG resin three times with IP washing buffer, H-Ras or K-Ras4a was eluted by heating at 95°C for 10 min in buffer containing 1% SDS and 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. After centrifuging at 15,000 g for 2 min, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and was treated with 300 mM NH<sub>2</sub>OH pH 7.4 at 95°C for 10 min. The Ras protein was then precipitated by methanol/chloroform and processed (disulfide reduction, denaturing, alkylation and neutralization) as described above. The resultant Ras protein was digested with 2 µg of trypsin at 37 ˚C for 2 hr in a glass vial (to avoid absorption of the fatty acylated peptide by plastics). Then desalting was done using Sep-Pak C18 cartridge following the manufacturer’s protocol.</p><p>For the LC-MS/MS analysis of the digested peptides, the same settings described for the SILAC experiment were applied except the LC gradient was 5–95% ACN with 0.1% FA from 0 to 140 min.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study reports the discovery and characterization of Lys-fatty-acylation on Ras small GTPases and their regulation by SIRT2. Using metabolic labeling and click chemistry detection, the authors demonstrate that H-Ras, N-Ras and K-Ras4a are hydroxylamine-resistant and Lys-fatty-acylated. The authors then show that K-Ras4a Lys-fatty-acylation is primarily regulated by SIRT2 deacylase activity by in vitro studies and shRNA-KD. For K-Ras4a, the authors attempt to address endogenous levels of Lys-fatty-acylation by MS/MS experiments and suggests the modification may occur on K182/184/185 and, intriguingly, is coupled to prenylation of C186. Studies with K-R mutants suggest that Lys-fatty-acylation regulates K-Ras4a distribution between PM and endosomes, A-Raf G12V-mediated transformation of NIH3T3 cells and activation of A-Raf effector signaling, which may also be regulated by SIRT2. Collectively, the authors provide intriguing in vitro and cellular evidence that 3/4 Ras-GTPases are Lys-fatty-acylated and that SIRT2 regulates K-Ras4a intracellular localization and downstream signaling functions, particular in cellular transformation. These studies provide a potential link between fatty acid and NAD metabolism in cancer and should motivate additional studies in normal physiology and disease.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The general findings are, in principle, of interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the following points should first be addressed:</p><p>1) The two different assays for localization of K-Ras4a versus K-Ras4a-G12V raise questions about the actual role of fatty acylation in regulating these two proteins. The modest effects in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are based on analysis of punctate signals. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, there is not much intracellular punctate localization for K-Ras4a-G12V, and A-Raf looks colocalized only with membrane-bound K-Ras4a-G12V. These results seem to suggest that there is a difference in fatty acylation levels between K-Ras4a and K-Ras4a-G12V. The authors should account for these discrepancies and provide information on the fatty acylation levels of K-Ras4a versus K-Ras4a-G12V.</p><p>2) The authors have primarily used K-R mutants as &quot;loss of Lys-fatty-acylation&quot; alleles. However, the multiple Arg substitutions have the potential to introduce alternative modes of membrane binding independent of fatty-acylation. Indeed, in several figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>), the effects of the 3KR substitution seemed largely independent of SIRT2. It would be important for the authors to include activity and location data on Lys -&gt; Ala mutants, especially for K-Ras4a, in order to support the conclusions.</p><p>3) The effects of SIRT2 knockdown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, as well as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> are small and thus not entirely convincing. This may be due to an incomplete knockdown, for example as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. More significant effects that may be obtainable by knocking out SIRT2 would make a more convincing case for the role of SIRT2 in regulating K-Ras4a.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32436.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The general findings are, in principle, of interest to the readership of eLife.

However, K-Ras4a and K-Ras4a-G12V possess comparable total and lysine fatty acylation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that the difference in their subcellular localization is not due to different levels of fatty acylation.

However, the multiple Arg substitutions have the potential to introduce alternative modes of membrane binding independent of fatty-acylation. Indeed, in several figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>), the effects of the 3KR substitution seemed largely independent of SIRT2. It would be important for the authors to include activity and location data on Lys -&gt; Ala mutants, especially for K-Ras4a, in order to support the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>3KR mutation may not be solely due to lack of lysine fatty acylation. Therefore, we think it is critical to utilize K-Ras4a-3KR mutant in combination with SIRT2 KD to study the function of K-Ras4a lysine fatty acylation. If a biological effect is due to lysine fatty acylation, SIRT2 KD should significantly affect K-Ras4a WT but not 3KR mutant in the most ideal case. This is indeed what we observed for the endomembrane localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), transforming activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and A-Raf binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>).</p><p>Recently, Tsai et al.<sup>1</sup> and Zhao et al.<sup>2</sup> showed that the lysine to uncharged glutamine mutation (3KQ) decreased transforming activity of K-Ras4a-G12V, suggesting that positive charge is favorable for K-Ras4a activity. Based on these studies, the lysine to alanine mutation (KA), which does not preserve the positive charge, may add more complexity to the membrane binding modes of K-Ras4a than the KR mutation. Any effect caused by the KA mutation may be due to lack of lysine fatty acylation, lack of positive charge, or alternative modes of membrane binding independent of fatty acylation, which will make the interpretation of the results more complicated and therefore will not further support our conclusions. In contrast, with the KR mutant, we only need to consider whether the effect is due to lysine fatty acylation or alternative modes of membrane binding independent of fatty acylation. In other words, we think the KR mutant is the closest to the WT without lysine fatty acylation (i.e. with SIRT2 present) and thus the most logical to use for our purpose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The effects of SIRT2 knockdown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, as well as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> are small and thus not entirely convincing. This may be due to an incomplete knockdown, for example as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. More significant effects that may be obtainable by knocking out SIRT2 would make a more convincing case for the role of SIRT2 in regulating K-Ras4a.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers suggested, we indeed tried to compare the lysine fatty acylation and subcellular localization of K-Ras4a in <italic>Sirt2</italic> wildtype (WT) and knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. Lysine fatty acylation level for K-Ras4a-WT in the KO cells was 1.56-fold of that in the WT cells, whereas lysine fatty acylation of K-Ras4a-3KR was similar in WT and KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>, subsection “Mapping the fatty acylated lysine residues regulated by SIRT2”, last paragraph in the revised manuscript). In <italic>Sirt2</italic> WT MEF cells, K-Ras4a-3KR displayed slightly but significantly more intracellular punctate localization than K-Ras4a-WT. K-Ras4a-WT showed significantly less intracellular punctate localization in KO cells than in WT cells, whereas K-Ras4a-3KR exhibited comparable level of punctate localization in WT and KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, subsection “Lysine fatty acylation regulates subcellular localization of K-Ras4a”, first paragraph). Collectively, these effects of <italic>Sirt2</italic> KO in MEF cells are consistent with that of SIRT2 KD in HEK293T cells, which further strengthens our conclusion that SIRT2-mediated lysine defatty-acylation regulates K-Ras4a intracellular localization. However, we did not observe more significant effects of <italic>Sirt2</italic> KO in MEF cells than that of SIRT2 KD in HEK293T cells, which is likely because we had over 95% of knockdown efficiency (based on quantification of SIRT2 signal intensity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>) with shSIRT2-#2 in HEK293T cells.</p><p>We have also attempted to examine the transforming activities of K-Ras4a-G12V and -G12V-3KR in <italic>Sirt2</italic> WT and KO MEF cells. However, introduction of both K-Ras4a-G12V and -G12V-3KR led to oncogene-induced senescence in both WT and KO cells. Considering that <italic>Sirt2</italic> KO shows similar effects on K-Ras4a lysine fatty acylation and subcellular localization to SIRT2 KD, we believe that our current data obtained from 3T3 cells with near 95% SIRT2 KD efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) is significant enough to support our conclusion.</p><p><bold>References</bold></p><p>1) Tsai, F.D., Lopes, M.S., Zhou, M., Court, H., Ponce, O., Fiordalisi, J.J., Gierut, J.J., Cox, A.D., Haigis, K.M. &amp; Philips, M.R.
