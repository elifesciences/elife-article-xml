diverse cell-matrix adhesion sites? Here, we investigate this question by exploring the cytosolic state of integrin-adhesome components and their dynamic exchange between adhesion sites and cytosol. Using fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) we found that the integrin adhesome is extensively pre-assembled already in the cytosol as multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites. Stationary focal adhesions release symmetrically the same types of protein complexes that they recruit, thereby keeping the cytosolic pool of building blocks spatiotemporally uniform. We conclude a model in which multi-protein building blocks enable rapid and modular self-assembly of adhesion sites and symmetric exchange of these building blocks preserves their specifications and thus the assembly logic of the system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02257.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02257.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02257.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The space between the cells in a multi-cellular organism is filled with a structure called the extracellular matrix. The roles of this matrix vary from tissue to tissue, and include providing the cell with structural support and signalling cues.</p><p>Cells use large multi-protein structures along their plasma membrane, called cell-matrix adhesion sites, to attach to the extracellular matrix and sense its properties. These sites are rapidly self-assembled upon local cues and are dynamically maintained by exchanging their components with the cytosol of the cell. Given the large number of different proteins that can be used to build adhesion sites, and the large number of possible interactions between these proteins, a major question is—how are these structures self-assembled both rapidly and correctly?</p><p>Most research so far has concentrated on the adhesion sites themselves, as it has generally been assumed that their constituent proteins enter and leave these sites individually. However, using fluorescence techniques, Hoffmann et al. have now shown that these proteins are actually pre-assembled in the cytosol into small ‘building blocks’. These can make the construction of cell-matrix adhesion sites quicker and more accurate by reducing the number of steps in the self-assembly process. In addition, under most circumstances, these building blocks do not change when they are exchanged between the cytosol and the adhesion site: this means that they can be re-used repeatedly and accurately. The work of Hoffmann et al. also raises questions about whether similar principles govern the self-assembly of other large intracellular multi-protein structures.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02257.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02257.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>integrin adhesome</kwd><kwd>focal adhesions</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>protein complexes</kwd><kwd>self assembly</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Ministry of Innovation, Science and Research of North Rhine-Westphalia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoffmann</surname><given-names>Jan-Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoffmann</surname><given-names>Jan-Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The International Leibniz Graduate School: Systems Biology Lab on a Chip</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoffmann</surname><given-names>Jan-Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001655</institution-id><institution>The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fermin</surname><given-names>Yessica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0315507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stricker</surname><given-names>Ruth LO</given-names></name><name><surname>Ickstadt</surname><given-names>Katja</given-names></name><name><surname>Zamir</surname><given-names>Eli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the cytosol, the proteins constituting cell-matrix adhesion sites form multi-protein building blocks which enter and leave these sites unaltered, thereby contributing to their rapid and correct self-assembly.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The integrin adhesome contains more than hundred proteins with multiple binding sites for each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zamir and Geiger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zaidel-Bar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Byron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schiller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geiger and Zaidel-Bar, 2012</xref>). Upon local signals, components of the integrin adhesome get self-assembled along the plasma membrane to form nascent adhesion sites and to further mature them to focal complexes and focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zamir and Geiger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cukierman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gardel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zaidel-Bar and Geiger, 2010</xref>). These adhesion sites assemble, disassemble, and change their molecular content by exchanging their components with the surrounding cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wolfenson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lavelin et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, stationary adhesion sites are dynamically maintained by a balanced rapid exchange of constituents with the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lele et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wolfenson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lavelin et al., 2013</xref>). Considering the molecular diversity and complexity of cell-matrix adhesion sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zamir et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zamir and Geiger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cukierman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zamir et al., 2008</xref>), a major question is how can the integrin adhesome form these structures rapidly, locally, and correctly. In order to approach this question it is essential to consider and examine not only the adhesion sites themselves but also the state of their components in the cytosolic pool. However, the study of this fundamental aspect was largely abandoned so far, due to tacitly conceiving the cytosolic pool as a passive supply of individual integrin adhesome proteins. In this work we challenged this view by systematic FCCS and FRAP measurements. Strikingly, we found that the integrin adhesome is actually extensively pre-assembled already in the cytosol, forming multi-protein building blocks that can facilitate rapid and modular assembly of adhesion sites. The physical associations between adhesion site components are spatially uniform around stationary focal adhesions, indicating that these sites exchange their building blocks with the cytosol without altering them (i.e., symmetrically). Together, our results lead to a concept in which self-assembly of adhesion sites involves recruitment of multi-protein modules and symmetric exchange preserves the specifications of these building blocks in the cytosolic pool, thereby facilitating correct self-assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We first asked whether the integrin adhesome forms in the cytosol pre-assembled multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites. To address this question we selected 13 key components of adhesion sites—α-actinin, α-parvin, p130CAS (CAS), CSK, FAK, ILK, paxillin, PINCH, talin, tensin, VASP, vinculin, and zyxin—and quantified systematically all 91 possible pairwise physical associations between them in the cytosol of REF52 cells using FCCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The sensitivity of FCCS enabled to perform these measurements at low concentrations of ectopically expressed proteins, comparable to the range of typical endogenous concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The obtained data was analyzed to derive for each measurement the association score, which weights the cross-correlation amplitude by its noise, and the apparent <italic>Ka</italic> that considers also the auto-correlation curves to quantify the apparent association strength (‘Materials and methods’). The overall distribution of the association scores was skewed to the right as compared to the negative-control measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top), indicating the presence of physical associations between some of the analyzed proteins in the cytosol. These positive measurements resulted from a subset of the 91 protein pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Among the 91 possible pairing combinations, 18 protein pairs were found to be physically associated with a p-value &lt;0.0001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Among these pairs, 15 pairs were found to be physically associated also in the cytosol of another cell line, NIH3T3, with a p-value &lt;0.02 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These results show a strikingly extensive degree of physical associations between adhesion site components in the cytosol. This indicates that the assembly of adhesion sites is plausibly carried out by recruitment of pre-assembled multi-protein building blocks, rather than of individual proteins.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02257.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Extensive physical associations between components of cell-matrix adhesion sites in the cytosol.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pairwise physical associations between proteins tagged with meGFP and TDmKate2 were measured in the cytosol of REF52 and NIH3T3 cells using FCCS (schematized).

These concentrations were derived by fitting the red and green autocorrelation curves to a single component diffusion model and dividing the obtained number of particles by the red and green confocal volumes (‘Materials and methods’). For comparison, the range of typical endogenous concentrations of signalling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moran et al., 2010</xref>) is indicated on the top. Since each integrin adhesome protein typically has multiple different interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zaidel-Bar et al., 2007</xref>), many of them mutually exclusive, the total concentration of all endogenous proteins competing on a given measured A-B association can be approximated as the average of typical endogenous concentrations in cells multiplied by the number of the different competing proteins. This total concentration is therefore considerably larger than the concentrations of the ectopically expressed proteins, as the later ones are within the typical range of single endogenous proteins. Therefore, a given increase in the concentrations of A and B will be distributed over the multiple different competing endogenous proteins. This considerably reduces the sensitivity of the complex concentration to a given elevation of the total levels of its components. The combination of this buffering effect and the low ectopic expression levels minimizes the alteration of the levels of the measured complexes in comparison to non-transfected cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02257.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02257.004</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02257-fig1-figsupp1-v1"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>A network of proteins that have multivalent interactions with each other has the potential to form large, high-order, complexes. Therefore we sought to assess the size of protein complexes formed by the integrin adhesome in the cytosol. If a given high-order protein complex exists, then each pair of its components is expected to exhibit a pairwise physical association. Accordingly, by searching for fully intra-connected sub-graphs in the measured network of pairwise physical associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), two potential ternary complexes can be inferred: an ILK-PINCH-α-parvin complex, which was indeed reported as a ternary complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Legate et al., 2006</xref>), and a CAS-FAK-paxillin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Notably, there is no complex containing more than three of the analyzed proteins. This indicates that despite the abundant multivalent interactions in the integrin adhesome network, its cytosolic complexes are considerably confined due to mutual-exclusiveness between protein interactions and allosteric regulations. For example, paxillin was found to be physically associated with vinculin and FAK, however, no association was found between vinculin and FAK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,G</xref>). This suggests that the associations of vinculin and FAK with paxillin are mutually exclusive and therefore a ternary FAK-paxillin-vinculin complex cannot be formed. This inferred mutual exclusive relation is consistent with studies reporting that common sites along paxillin mediate its interactions with FAK and vinculin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Turner and Miller, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brown et al., 1996</xref>). Similarly, our results suggest mutual exclusiveness between the associations of VASP with zyxin, α-actinin, and vinculin and between the associations of zyxin with VASP and CAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We postulate that the size-confinement of cytosolic complexes reflects a system-level design of interdependencies between protein interactions throughout the integrin adhesome network to prevent stochastic assembly of aberrant large complexes.</p><p>To assess the diversity of integrin adhesome protein complexes that indeed serve as building blocks for adhesion sites, we asked whether each analyzed protein is a component of only one type of building block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In such a case, each two physically associated proteins should exhibit similar dwell time and mobile fraction in adhesion sites, since they are part of only one, same, type of building block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To test this, we measured the mobile fraction and dwell time (<italic>τ</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) of the 13 proteins in focal adhesions by FRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C,E,F</xref>) and quantified the difference in dynamics (co-dynamics distance) between each two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Plotting these co-dynamics distances vs the association scores indicated some protein pairs as prominent building blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), including ILK-α-parvin, ILK-PINCH and α-parvin-PINCH (reflecting the trimetric ILK-PINCH-α-parvin complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Legate et al., 2006</xref>), paxillin-vinculin, CAS-FAK, VASP-zyxin, and α-actinin-VASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Noteworthy, the proteins of each of these pairs have also similar diffusion speeds, as measured by FCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that they are predominantly bound to each other, rather than with other proteins, in the cytosolic pool. However, besides the abovementioned exceptions, our results indicate that in general physical associations in the cytosol do not necessarily imply similarity in dynamics in adhesion sites. Therefore, we conclude that the cytosolic building blocks of adhesion sites are combinatorially diversified and that most proteins can be recruited to these sites as part of different types of building blocks.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02257.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The cytosolic building blocks of cell-matrix adhesion sites are combinatorially diversified.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Not all cytosolic integrin-adhesome complexes are necessarily building blocks for adhesion sites.

Some of the analyzed proteins can be classified into three groups based on their function and their reported vertical position across focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly, FAK and paxillin are located in the integrin-signalling layer, vinculin is in the force transduction layer and zyxin, VASP, and α-actinin are in the actin regulation layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Superimposing this information with the physical associations found in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) shows that such associations occur only between proteins from the same functional group and vertical layer, or between proteins from adjacent vertical layers without including any other analyzed protein in the complex. For example, paxillin and vinculin are physically associated in the cytosol but they do not contain FAK or VASP in their common building block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Therefore, the cytosolic building blocks appear to be modules that are continuous along the functional axis of anchoring-mechanosensing-actin regulation and along the vertical axis across focal adhesions.</p><p>Cell-matrix adhesion sites are dynamically maintained structures that constantly exchange their constituting material with the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lele et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wolfenson et al., 2009</xref>). We pose here two alternative models for the mode of this exchange—symmetric and asymmetric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In a symmetric exchange, proteins exit from adhesion sites with the same state they had upon entering these sites, while in an asymmetric exchange they exit in a different state, termed herein a primed state. This priming can be any change in the post-translational modifications or interactions of the exiting components. The primed state is expected to be unstable in the cytosolic environment, since otherwise it would have been the characteristic state of the protein in the pool. Therefore, an asymmetric exchange, but not a symmetric exchange, would generate a spatial gradient of primed components emanating from adhesion sites. Noteworthy, both symmetric and asymmetric exchanges allow for a spatiotemporal steady state between adhesion sites and cytosol. However, only an asymmetric exchange enables one adhesion site to affect another one, or itself, via the primed components that it releases to the cytosol. An asymmetric exchange would also generate a locally heterogeneous cloud of building blocks around adhesion sites, which may pose an engineering challenge for ensuring correct self-assembly and maintenance of these sites. In contrast, a symmetric exchange ensures a spatially uniform pool of building blocks for adhesion sites and prevents any communication between these sites via primed components.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02257.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Symmetric material exchange between stationary focal adhesions and cytosol.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The symmetric and asymmetric models of material exchange between adhesion sites and cytosol.

We examined this for 28 protein pairs, representing the wide range of association scores exhibited by the 91 protein pairs. For all the 28 protein pairs we found no significant difference in association scores near and far from focal adhesions, supporting the model of symmetric exchange of protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The symmetric exchange model also predicts that even when proteins are directly interacting in adhesion sites, they will not be associated close to adhesion sites unless they are associated also far away from adhesion sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Combining the FCCS measurements with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of four protein pairs, we found indeed that the physical associations near focal adhesions are correlated with their associations far from focal adhesions regardless of their interaction state in focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). These results indicate that there are no spatial gradients of different (i.e., primed) protein complexes around focal adhesions, indicating that stationary focal adhesions release the same types of complexes that they recruited.</p><p>Potential priming of a protein in adhesion sites might also be based on a change in its phosphorylation, rather than in its interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Therefore, we further tested whether tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in adhesion sites, such as FAK, paxillin, and CAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) are recruited and released in different phosphorylation states. To monitor tyrosine phosphorylation in live cells we used a biosensor consisting of two SH2 domains, dSH2, tagged with a fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kirchner et al., 2003</xref>). This reporter is enriched in focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kirchner et al., 2003</xref>), where it also exhibits FRET with FAK, paxillin, and CAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The association scores of all three proteins with dSH2 show no significant difference between the near and far locations, indicating that there is no detectable spatial gradient in the phosphorylation level of paxillin, CAS, and FAK around focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J,K</xref>). Noteworthy, inhibition of phosphatases by vanadate increases the association scores between dSH2 and CAS, paxillin and FAK, indicating the capability of the assay to detect changes in phosphorylation levels of proteins in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). Together, these results support the model of symmetric material exchange for stationary focal adhesions. Accordingly, stationary focal adhesions do not alter the cytosolic pool of building blocks and do not communicate or interfere with nearby adhesion sites via primed components.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We conclude that the integrin adhesome is extensively pre-assembled in the cytosol, thereby forming multi-protein building blocks for cell-matrix adhesion sites. Our results further indicate that these building blocks are size-confined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and are predominantly corresponding to the functional layers across focal adhesions of anchoring and integrin regulation, force transduction, and actin regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2 and 4</xref>). In the cytosol, the building blocks cannot form bigger structures due to dependencies between protein interactions. We propose that at the plasma membrane the system can get locally switched on to self-assemble adhesion sites by passing through checkpoints that induce additional protein interactions in the integrin adhesome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These checkpoints include mechanical stabilization of the active conformation of matrix-anchored integrin by actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Puklin-Faucher and Sheetz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gardel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shattil et al., 2010</xref>), activation of proteins (e.g., vinculin) at the plasma membrane by phosphatidyl-inositol-4-5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gilmore and Burridge, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zamir and Geiger, 2001</xref>), and mechanical stretching of proteins (e.g., talin and CAS) by actomyosin contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Riveline et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sawada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">del Rio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Puklin-Faucher and Sheetz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gardel et al., 2010</xref>). Since adhesion sites are self-assembled structures, a standardized pool of building blocks is essential for their correct and efficient assembly. Symmetric material exchange between adhesion sites and cytosol satisfies this requirement by ensuring that building blocks will enter and exit adhesion sites without being altered.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02257.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>A model of switchable formation of adhesion sites via pre-assembled multi-protein building blocks.</title><p>The integrin adhesome is pre-assembled in the cytosol as multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites. These building blocks are combinatorially diversified but confined in their size. Most of the building blocks form modules that are consistent with the previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</xref>) vertical continuum of anchoring, mechanosensing, and actin regulation layers across focal adhesions. In the cytosol, the pre-assembled building blocks cannot further assemble to form bigger structures due to mutual exclusiveness between protein interactions and allosteric regulations. On the plasma membrane, the system can get locally switched on to assemble an adhesion site by passing through checkpoints that enable additional protein interactions in the integrin adhesome. These checkpoints include anchoring of integrins to the extracellular matrix, mechanical stretching of proteins like talin and CAS by actomyosin contractility, and activation of proteins like vinculin and talin by PIP2 on the plasma membrane. Symmetric material exchange between adhesion sites and cytosol retains the wiring of the building blocks and therefore retains the assembly logic and switchability of the system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02257.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02257.009</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02257-fig4-v1"/></fig></p><p>Interestingly, in contrast to stationary focal adhesions, disassembling focal-adhesions might exchange material with the cytosol in an asymmetric manner. A previous study reported that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts FAK and vinculin associate with paxillin very close to disassembling focal adhesions but not far away from them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Digman et al., 2009</xref>). This study was based on a spatially resolved FCCS technique that gains spatial information on the expense of the sampling rate and integration time spent on each location, hence on the expense of the signal-to-noise ratio. This might underlie the difference from our results, which show the presence of FAK-paxillin and vinculin-paxillin associations far away from focal adhesions in REF52 and NIH3T3 cells. Yet, this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Digman et al., 2009</xref>) importantly indicates a gradient in association strengths between these proteins emanating from disassembling focal adhesions, supporting in this case the asymmetric material exchange model. Asymmetric material exchange by disassembling focal adhesions can enable their rapid destruction by breaking them up to relatively bigger pieces, as well as be a mechanism by which they can affect other adhesion sites.</p><p>The results presented here revise the concept about adhesion sites self-assembly, from a process that is mediated by the recruitment of individual proteins to a process involving pre-assembled multi-protein building blocks. This has implications for broad aspects of cell-matrix adhesion sites formation and regulation. Multi-protein building blocks, in comparison to single-protein building blocks, reduce the number of steps required for self-assembly of adhesion sites. With a properly designed regulation, such a reduction of steps can make the self-assembly of adhesion sites less sensitive to stochastic biochemical noise and therefore also faster. The regulation of adhesion sites assembly should cope with the combinatorial diversity of the building blocks. Since each protein can be a component of different building blocks, this regulation should consider each building block as a whole rather than its constituting proteins as individuals. Otherwise, the self-assembly process would lose control on the identity of the co-recruited proteins when recruiting a protein embedded in a multi-protein building block and thereby will be drifted to form aberrant structures. In order to understand such assembly logic of adhesion sites, it would be important to integrate interaction-dependencies across the integrin adhesome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Köster et al., 2012</xref>) and to comprehensively characterize the diversity of its high-order protein complexes in the cytosol by combining advanced optical and proteomic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heinze et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jain et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ridgeway et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and transfections</title><p>Rat embryonic fibroblasts, REF52 (kindly provided by Joachim Spatz and Benjamin Geiger) and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; PAN-Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany, 4.5 g/l glucose) supplemented with 10% FBS (PAN-Biotech), 2 mM Gln, and 1% non-essential amino acids. 2 days prior experiments, cells were plated in MatTek dishes (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA), incubated for 24 hr, and then transfected with 0.4 μg of each plasmid as indicated using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

After the tenth frame, the fluorescence of a complete, single focal adhesion was bleached by 30 pulses of 100% laser intensity over a period of 1–2 s and image acquisition continued for a period of at least 180 s. The bleaching of a complete adhesion sites was done in order to ensure that the fluorescence recovery is due to exchange of material between adhesion sites and cytosol and not with unbleached parts within the adhesion site itself. Therefore, in different FRAP experiments the size of the bleached area was different.

Proteins were tagged with the fluorescent proteins mCitrine (donor) and mCherry (acceptor) to optimize FRET efficiency. All experiments were carried out at 37°C with a 60x water objective. For imaging, samples were simultaneously excited with 488 (10% laser intensity) and 561 nm (31% laser intensity) light using a 405/488/561/633 dichroic mirror. Excitation light was split with a dichroic mirror at 560 nm and detected between 500–550 nm (green channel) and 580–680 nm (red channel). The pinhole was set to 300 μm. FLIM images were acquired using 470 nm excitation (36% intensity) with a pulse frequency of 40 MHz, a 405/470 dichroic mirror, and a 525/15 band path filter. FLIM images were analyzed using IGOR Pro (Version 6.22 A, Wave Metrics, Lake Oswego, OR) with pFLIM3 as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Walther et al.,

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While both reviewers found merit in the study, there were some concerns expressed. The first reviewer felt that the expression of the interacting proteins may be in excess and this would result in a skewed kinetic landscape. The second reviewer was very enthusiastic about the approach represented in the first three figures but objected to the use of drugs against motility in such high doses that the kinetics of disassembly would be non-physiological. It was suggested that the motility work be left out of the manuscript for this reason. The first reviewer concurs with this opinion.</p><p>We suggest that you revise the manuscripts to incorporate a response to these suggestions, and send it back for re-review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>1:</italic></p><p>This work investigates the components of the adhesome in 91 pairwise combinations using FCCS, FLIM and FRAP, finding 15 that were significant in several cell lines. By measuring the association dynamics of these pairs with the focal adhesion, they can tease out specific “building blocks” of favored protein combinations and determine that their association and dissociation kinetics are symmetric – they go out of the complex with the same associations they go in with. The main conclusion is that the adhesome is assembled from multi protein building blocks and this facilitates the assembly process.</p><p>A lot of speculation then ensues about why this mode of assembly is good, for example rapid and robust responses. It's not clear why this would make such a big difference since the assembly of individual proteins into the complex would also be expected to be fast, and although this is a complex structure, it's not clear that complexity has to come from a subassembly route. Nevertheless, one wonders whether much has been gained conceptually by this work.</p><p>Furthermore, it is concerning that the components are expressed pairwise, probably in excess. In this case, if there is a high concentration of these components compared to endogenous levels, associations may be driven artificially by this overexpression, and form building blocks that would never have existed in vivo. This is particularly true if the adhesome, along with its endogenous assembly has saturated the components in the structural assembly. This is a significant flaw in the approach that I feel compromises the interpretation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes results of careful and elegant biophysical experiments designed to test the hypothesis that focal adhesions form and disassemble from pre-formed, specific macromolecular assemblies. Through thoughtfully designed experiments and brilliant analysis, the results reveal that specific preassembled building blocks incorporate into and disassemble from FAs symmetrically (i.e., without change in composition). Further, the results of their pairwise biophysical analysis reveal both known and new mutually exclusive assemblies, and suggests that specific preformed assemblies are recruited to each ultrastructural layer of the adhesion. In my 20 years of reviewing papers I have never had a paper where I wrote “beautiful” in the margin and “brilliant” after the concluding sentence of each paragraph of the results section so many times. This paper will provide a major, important advance in how we think about how focal adhesions are built.</p><p>In spite of my extreme enthusiasm for the first three figures, I do have a significant beef with interpretations of the experiments involving inhibition of contractility. These cells were hit with a hammer: 100uM of Y-drug for 30-60 minutes. This is problematic for two reasons. First, inhibition of contractility like this is not representative of the physiological mechanism of adhesion disassembly. Adhesions likely disassemble due to actions of calpain on FA proteins. Second, with this high concentration of drug, which is generally used an order of magnitude more dilute, for such a long treatment time, adhesions would be disassembled within 10 minutes. The cytosolic pool likely represents a new steady-state, not the state of recent post-disassembly, as conjectured by the authors. In addition, the length of treatment time also likely induces more plieotropic effects such as complete disassembly of stress fibers and changes in post-translational modification of all kinds proteins that are regulated by contractility-dependent mechano-signalling. I think to perform this experiment properly would require doing analysis at different time points after the addition of different concentrations of drug, finding the interesting candidates, and comparing this to what happens to these candidates in normal adhesions as they are disassembling by endogenously regulated pathways. In this Reviewer's opinion, that is beyond the scope of the current study, and may not even represent a physiologically relevant pathway. I feel that the myosin inhibition experiments could be removed and the figures re-tooled and the rest of the findings of the paper are such an important advance that the manuscript would be acceptable without expansion of the hard-to-interpret myosin inhibition study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02257.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We have found the comments very helpful and revised the manuscript accordingly.

Nevertheless, one wonders whether much has been gained conceptually by this work</italic>.</p><p>Since adhesion sites are self-assembled and heterogeneous structures, it is essential to reveal and consider the nature of their building blocks in order to understand how these sites are formed and regulated. So far this aspect was rather neglected and the cytosolic pool was tacitly conceived as a collection of individual proteins. Conceptually, this work implies that adhesion sites assembly is a process involving in multi-protein complexes as the elementary building blocks. Multi-protein building blocks reduce the number of steps that are needed for self-assembly of adhesion sites and therefore can make this process less prone to errors, thereby also faster. In comparison to a pool of single-protein building blocks, a pool of combinatorial diversified multi-protein building blocks also implies different regulatory principles for the self-assembly of adhesion sites. Therefore, the findings and conceptual novelty that we present in this work are important and relevant for broad aspects of adhesion sites formation and regulation. We learned from the comment that this aspect should be clarified in the text and accordingly we addressed it in a new paragraph added at the end of the Discussion section in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, it is concerning that the components are expressed pairwise, probably in excess. In this case, if there is a high concentration of these components compared to endogenous levels, associations may be driven artificially by this overexpression, and form building blocks that would never have existed in vivo. This is particularly true if the adhesome, along with its endogenous assembly has saturated the components in the structural assembly. This is a significant flaw in the approach that I feel compromises the interpretation</italic>.</p><p>This is indeed an important point that requires a careful consideration. Here below we address the two aspects of (i) the actual levels of the ectopic expressions and (ii) their potency in forming new complexes in the cytosol context.</p><p>(i) The concentrations of the ectopically expressed proteins in the FCS/FCCS measurements are low: FCS/FCCS is a sensitive technique that measures concentrations and associations of labeled proteins at a nanomolar - micromolar concentration scale. Accordingly, in our measurements the concentrations of the ectopically expressed proteins in the cells (as we can quantify from the FCCS data) were almost all (98%) below 500 nM and the majority of them (84%) were also below 200 nM. Such a range of concentrations is comparable to the range of typical concentrations of endogenous proteins (10-1000 nM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moran et al., 2010</xref>, Cell 141:1262-1262 e1261). Therefore, in this work the ectopically expressed proteins are not in excess in comparison to the typical (though wide) range of endogenous protein concentrations.</p><p>(As a side comment: To the best of our knowledge and search, reported information about the absolute endogenous concentrations of each of the measured proteins in fibroblasts is very limited. Due to the sparse information, variability between methods, cell types and cell-volume estimations (Milo, 2013, Bioessays 35:1050-1055) we find it to be ambiguous to infer the endogenous concentrations of the 13 analyzed proteins in REF52 and NIH3T3 cells by integrating across current published information.)</p><p>(ii) The effect of ectopically expressed proteins on their complex concentration is buffered by competition with multiple other different endogenous proteins: Ectopic expression of two proteins (A and B) would lead to a formation of an [AB] complex that was practically absent before in the cytosol if it is in levels that can compete successfully with endogenous proteins that normally prevent the formation of [AB] (by competing with A on B and with B on A). Since each integrin adhesome protein typically has multiple different interactions (Zaidel-Bar, 2007, Nature Cell Biology 9:858-867), many of them mutually exclusive, the total concentration of all endogenous proteins competing on a given A-B interaction can be approximated as the average of typical endogenous concentrations in cells multiplied by the number of the different competing proteins. This total concentration is therefore considerably larger than the concentrations of the ectopically expressed proteins, as we showed that these ectopic expressions are within the typical range of single endogenous proteins. Obviously, not all copies of the competing endogenous proteins will be available for sequestering the ectopically expressed A and B proteins, as they will be also occupied by other interactions. Still, a given increase in the total concentrations of A and B will be distributed over the multiple different competing endogenous proteins. This considerably reduces the sensitivity of the [AB] complex concentration to a given elevation in total A and B concentrations.</p><p>The combination of this buffering effect and the low ectopic expression levels minimizes the alteration of the levels of the measured complexes in comparison to normal in-vivo conditions. Therefore, we expect that the complexes we detected exist in the cytosol of cells regardless of the ectopic expression.</p><p>In order to convey these points, we have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>,, showing the distribution of concentrations of the ectopically expressed proteins in the measurements used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and the range of typical concentrations of endogenous proteins. We summarized the abovementioned explanation in the legend of the figure supplement for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p><italic>This manuscript describes results of careful and elegant biophysical experiments designed to test the hypothesis that focal adhesions form and disassemble from pre-formed, specific macromolecular assemblies.

We initially included this part as it provides helpful information that can guide further exploration of the symmetry of material exchange by disassembling focal adhesions. However, following this comment, we agree with the view of the reviewer that the focus and strength of the manuscript will be benefitted from omitting the actomyosin inhibition part. Therefore, we revised the manuscript accordingly: (1) We removed the figure and text which are related to the Y-27632 experiments. (2) Since we still would like to mention and discuss the issue of material exchange by disassembling focal-adhesions, we have added a paragraph to the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
