whether it possesses an independent endocytic early/sorting compartment that sorts endocytic cargos to the endo-lysosomal pathway or the recycling pathway has long been unclear. The structure and properties of the endocytic early/sorting compartment differ significantly between organisms; in plant cells, the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) serves this role, whereas in mammalian cells a separate intracellular structure performs this function. The yeast syntaxin homolog Tlg2p, widely localizing to the TGN and endosomal compartments, is presumed to act as a Q-SNARE for endocytic vesicles, but which compartment is the direct target for endocytic vesicles remained unanswered. Here we demonstrate by high-speed and high-resolution 4D imaging of fluorescently labeled endocytic cargos that the Tlg2p-residing compartment within the TGN functions as the early/sorting compartment. After arriving here, endocytic cargos are recycled to the plasma membrane or transported to the yeast Rab5-residing endosomal compartment through the pathway requiring the clathrin adaptors GGAs. Interestingly, Gga2p predominantly localizes at the Tlg2p-residing compartment, and the deletion of GGAs has little effect on another TGN region where Sec7p is present but suppresses dynamics of the Tlg2-residing early/sorting compartment, indicating that the Tlg2p- and Sec7p-residing regions are discrete entities in the mutant. Thus, the Tlg2p-residing region seems to serve as an early/sorting compartment and function independently of the Sec7p-residing region within the TGN.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>membrane traffic</kwd><kwd>endosome</kwd><kwd>TGN</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#18K062291</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Toshima</surname><given-names>Junko Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#19K065710</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Toshima</surname><given-names>Jiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Toshima</surname><given-names>Junko Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Toshima</surname><given-names>Jiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012630</institution-id><institution>Life Science Foundation of Japan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Toshima</surname><given-names>Jiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The yeast syntaxin homolog Tlg2p-residing sub-compartment within the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network is the primary endocytic-accepting region that serves as an early/sorting compartment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the best-characterized type of endocytosis in eukaryotic cells and plays crucial roles in many physiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>). After leaving from the plasma membrane (PM), a clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) is uncoated and transported to the early/sorting compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cullen and Steinberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Paez Valencia et al., 2016</xref>). In yeast, the molecular mechanisms regulating this CCV formation and internalization have been well characterized, but it still remains unclear how and where uncoated endocytic vesicles are delivered to the early/sorting compartment. A recent study has reported that budding yeast lacks distinct early endosomes and that the TGN where Sec7p resides is the first destination for endocytic traffic, functioning as an early endosome-like compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Day et al., 2018</xref>). However, several other reports have indicated that yeast has two distinct types of endosomal compartments, one containing yeast Rab5 (Vps21p) and the other containing yeast Rab7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lachmann et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, we have previously demonstrated that endocytosed cargos are only slightly co-localized with Sec7p-containing TGN cisternae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Toshima et al., 2014</xref>), classified into the early-to-late TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>). These inconsistent observations are likely attributable to technical difficulties in visualizing the cargo-sorting process and have complicated our understanding of the properties of the yeast early/sorting compartment.</p><p>The yeast R-SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors), Snc1p and Snc2p, are yeast orthologs of vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) and were originally identified as proteins required for the fusion of secretory vesicles with the PM via Q-SNAREs Sso1p and Sso2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerst et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Protopopov et al., 1993</xref>). Snc1p contains a conserved endocytosis signal, which is recognized by the clathrin adaptor protein and is thereby endocytosed with the CCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grote et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gurunathan et al., 2000</xref>). Disruption of this endocytic signal causes defects in the internalization of Snc1p itself and other endocytic cargos, such as the fluorescent endocytic tracer FM4-64 and the α-factor receptor Ste2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gurunathan et al., 2000</xref>). This result suggests that Snc1p and Snc2p function as R-SNAREs in endocytic pathways by interacting with Q-SNAREs. Tlg1p and Tlg2p have high homology to syntaxins and bind Snc1p and Snc2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeliovich et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holthuis et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paumet et al., 2001</xref>). Since these Q-SNAREs are localized to the TGN and putative early endosomes, these proteins have been considered to play a role in transport between the TGN and endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holthuis et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewis et al., 2000</xref>). Tlg1p and Tlg2p are also known to co-localize with endocytosed FM4-64 soon after internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeliovich et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dobzinski et al., 2015</xref>). From these observations, it has been suggested that Tlg1p and/or Tlg2p are Q-SNAREs-mediating fusion between endocytic vesicles and early endosomal compartments.</p><p>Recent studies using high-speed, high-resolution, and four-dimensional (4D) time-lapse imaging have revealed that in yeast intra-Golgi cargo trafficking from the early Golgi to the TGN is mediated by cisternal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kurokawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Losev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matsuura-Tokita et al., 2006</xref>). Detailed localization analyses of various Golgi/TGN-resident proteins have shown that the Golgi-TGN transition gradually proceeds with sequential recruitment of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>). In this process, Tlg2p appears at the TGN earlier than Sec7p, a marker of the early-to-late TGN, and also disappears before Sec7p from the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>). This observation suggests that endocytic vesicles containing Snc1p R-SNARE might target the TGN compartment where Tlg2p resides, although this has not yet been proven directly.</p><p>In our previous study, we demonstrated that fluorescently labeled endocytic cargo, yeast mating pheromone α-factor (Alexa-α-factor), accumulates at clathrin -coated pits and is internalized with the CCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Toshima et al., 2006</xref>). Within 5 min after Alexa-α-factor internalization, Alexa-α-factor-labeled endosomal compartments become co-localized with the yeast Rab5, Vps21p, and fuse with each other, resulting in the formation of enlarged endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Toshima et al., 2014</xref>). However, it has been unclear whether Alexa-α-factor is directly transported to the Vps21p-residing compartment from the endocytic vesicle. We recently showed that although endocytosis is not essential, post-Golgi vesicle transport is crucial for Vps21p-mediated endosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nagano et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, as the TGN seems to play a key role in endocytic cargo transport, it is important to clarify how the TGN regulates endocytic cargo transport to the Vps21p-residing compartment. Here we succeeded in simultaneous triple-color and 4D (3D plus time) observation to visualize endocytic cargo together with the Tlg2p-residing region by super-resolution confocal live imaging microscopy (SCLIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kurokawa and Nakano, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tojima et al., 2023</xref>). We show that Alexa-α-factor endocytosed by the CCV is incorporated directly into the Tlg2p-residing sub-compartment within the TGN, and then moves on from there when another TGN-representative protein Sec7p appears. Such visualization, along with genetic manipulations of endocytic pathway components, suggests that the Tlg2p-residing sub-compartment within the TGN is the primary endocytic-accepting region that serves as an early/sorting compartment that sorts endocytosed cargo to further destinations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endocytosed α-factor is transported to the Tlg2p-residing sub-compartment within the TGN</title><p>Sec7p, one of the yeast guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Arf GTPases, is known as a representative TGN marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casler et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kurokawa et al., 2019</xref>). A previous study has reported that the Sec7p-residing TGN compartment is the first destination for endocytic traffic and functions as an early endosome-like sorting compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Day et al., 2018</xref>). However, since Tlg2p, which is a putative Q-SNARE for the endocytic vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeliovich et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paumet et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Séron et al., 1998</xref>), exhibits temporal localization patterns distinct from Sec7p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>), the exact timing and locus of endocytic vesicle targeting remained ambiguous. As a first step toward clarifying this, we compared the localization of Alexa594-labeled α-factor (A594-α-factor) with GFP-tagged Tlg2p and Sec7p, whose functionalities have been previously confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Llinares et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Séron et al., 1998</xref>). The yeast Golgi and TGN are highly dynamic organelles whose cisternae rapidly change their composition with an approximate maturation rate of less than 1 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matsuura-Tokita et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we defined ‘overlapping’ as a distance of less than 129 nm (2 pixels) between two peaks of GFP and mCherry/Alexa594 intensity in 2D imaging. At 5 min after internalization, A594-α-factor began to accumulate at several intracellular puncta, although the majority still remained on the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). GFP-fused Tlg2p was detected in several nonuniform structures, such as puncta or tubules, with different sizes and shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and E</xref>), and ~71% of them clearly overlapped with A594-α-factor-labeled puncta at 5 min after A594-α-factor internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A faint fluorescent signal of GFP-Tlg2p was also observed in the cytosol, and we confirmed that this signal was located in the vacuolar lumen by labeling the vacuolar membrane with FM4-64 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This vacuolar localization was not visible in some cells, possibly due to the location of the vacuole. After 10 min, A594-α-factor-labeled puncta had increased in both number and fluorescent intensity, and ~77.7% of GFP-Tlg2p overlapped with them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). In contrast, Sec7-GFP, which was also detected as several punctate structures, showed considerably lower overlap with A594-α-factor signals than GFP-Tlg2p either at 5 min (26.0 ± 9.4%) or 10 min (22.7 ± 6.0%) after A594-α-factor internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). After 20 min, the number of A594-α-factor-labeled puncta decreased as the α-factor was transported to the vacuole via the pre-vacuolar compartments (PVCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Toshima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At this time point, most of the A594-α-factor was localized inside the vacuole and at puncta around the vacuole, and substantial GFP-Tlg2p was also localized at these puncta labeled by A594-α-factor (47.7 ± 3.9%), whereas Sec7-GFP was rarely localized there (5.0 ± 5.4%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These observations suggest the localization of GFP-Tlg2p at the early-to-late stage endosomes, as well as the TGN. We also compared the localization of A594-α-factor with Tlg1p, another putative Q-SNARE for the endocytic vesicle, that is reported to localize mainly at the early endosomes and partially at the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holthuis et al., 1998b</xref>). Similar to GFP-Tlg2p, GFP-Tlg1p highly overlapped with A594-α-factor-labeled puncta (74.4 ± 5.9%) at 5 min after A594-α-factor internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, after 10 min the fraction of A594-α-factor overlapping with GFP-Tlg1p decreased to ~51.1% and further decreased to ~26.1% after 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). GFP-Tlg1p signals overlapped well with mCherry-Tlg2p-labeled puncta, except at puncta around the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that Tlg1p localizes at the TGN and early-stage endosomes, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holthuis et al., 1998b</xref>). To confirm that α-factor overlaps with both Tlg1p and Tlg2p at the TGN just after internalization, we conducted triple-color imaging with GFP-Tlg1p, mCherry-Tlg2p, and Alexa647-labeled α-factor (A647-α-factor). As expected, the majority of endocytosed A647-α-factor localized at the compartments where both Tlg1p and Tlg2p are present at 5 min after internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These observations suggest that α-factor is transported to a region distinct from the Sec7p-residing TGN compartment where Tlg1p and Tlg2p localize, and then from there moves to the PVC via the endocytic pathway.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Localization of endocytosed α-factor at the Tlg2p-residing compartment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 2D imaging of A594-α-factor and GFP-Tlg2p.

To examine whether Tlg2p localizes at a separate region from the Sec7p-residing region within the TGN, we performed simultaneous dual-color 3D analysis of these proteins using SCLIM. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, we observed two types of GFP-Tlg2p localization, one at regions in which only GFP-Tlg2p was visible, and the other at locations adjacent to the Sec7p-residing region. A faint fluorescent signal in the vacuolar lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) was not observed by SCLIM, presumably because the fluorescence signal was too weak. Previous studies have reported that Tlg2p cycles between late Golgi and endosomal compartments, and thus localizes to both compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewis et al., 2000</xref>). It has also been shown that at the TGN Tlg2p appears earlier than Sec7p and also disappears before Sec7p from the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we considered the structures where only GFP-Tlg2p localized to be either an endosomal compartment or the TGN compartment before Sec7-mCherry came in. Localization of GFP-Tlg2p and Sec7-mCherry at the TGN was analyzed by line scan using the xy, xz, or yz planes, which revealed that GFP-Tlg2p signal partially overlaps with the TGN compartment labeled by Sec7-mCherry, but is mostly spatially separated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This observation suggests that the Tlg2p-residing structure exists as a sub-compartment that is distinct from the Sec7p-residing structure within the TGN (hereafter referred to as Tlg2p or Sec7p sub-compartment, respectively). We next performed simultaneous triple-color 3D imaging to determine whether α-factor localized to the Tlg2p or the Sec7p sub-compartment. For triple-color imaging with GFP-Tlg2p and Sec7-iRFP, we labeled α-factor with pHrode Red (pHrode-α-factor), whose fluorescent wavelength can be separated from those of GFP and iRFP. We also confirmed that expression of Sec7-iRFP has no effect on cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). pHrode-α-factor clearly labeled endocytic compartments after internalization to the same extent as A594-α-factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). 3D SCLIM imaging, similar to the 2D analysis, revealed that at 5 min after internalization pHrode-α-factor signals overlapped with the GFP-Tlg2p signals, around half of which were adjacent to Sec7-iRFP-labeled regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Line scan analyses revealed that the peak of pHrode-α-factor signal coincides with that of GFP-Tlg2p signal rather than Sec7p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). To further understand the spatiotemporal relationship between the Tlg2p and Sec7p sub-compartments during α-factor transport, we performed 4D (3D plus time) imaging by SCLIM. Consistent with the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>), we observed that Sec7-iRFP appeared in the vicinity of GFP-Tlg2p, and then the signal of GFP-Tlg2p gradually disappeared, while that of Sec7-iRFP increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). During this process, pHrodo-α-factor became joined to the preexisting Tlg2p sub-compartment and stayed there for several tens of seconds, and then disappeared soon after Sec7-iRFP arrival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Magnified images from the time series shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> indicate that pHrodo-α-factor already co-localizes with GFP-Tlg2p at the time when Sec7p shows up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This observation suggests that the Tlg2p sub-compartment adjacent to the Sec7p sub-compartment plays a specific role in the endocytic pathway.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-84850-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Left: multi-angle 3D reconstructed movie of GFP-Tlg2p (green) and Sec7-mCherry (red) in wild-type cell.</title><p>Right: multi-angle 3D reconstructed movie of GFP-Tlg2p (green), Sec7-iRFP (red), and pHrodo-α-factor (blue).</p></caption></media><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-84850-video2.mp4" id="video2"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Triple-color 4D movie of GFP-Tlg2p (green), Sec7-iRFP (red), and pHrodo-α-factor (blue) in a wild-type cell.</title><p>Arrows indicate examples of the sequential appearance and disappearance of each protein.</p></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Endocytic vesicles interact directly with the Tlg2p-residing sub-compartment</title><p>Co-localization of α-factor with the Tlg2p sub-compartment at the early stage of endocytosis motivated us to examine whether the Tlg2p sub-compartment is a direct target of endocytic vesicles. We had shown previously that endocytic vesicles labeled with the endocytic vesicle markers Sla1- or Abp1-GFP moved to the A594-α-factor-labeled compartment, which is considered to be the early endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Toshima et al., 2006</xref>). We had also demonstrated that Alexa 488-labeled α-factor accumulates at the Abp1p patch on the cell surface and is internalized concomitantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Toshima et al., 2006</xref>). To examine whether endocytic vesicles move to the Tlg2p sub-compartment, we tagged Abp1p with mCherry and observed the dynamics of Abp1-mCherry and GFP-Tlg2p. The functionality of mCherry-tagged Abp1p was confirmed by testing its ability to grow in a <italic>sla1</italic>Δ background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) as a combination of <italic>abp1</italic>Δ and <italic>sla1</italic>Δ mutations results in synthetic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holtzman et al., 1993</xref>).

However, some Abp1-mCherry signals disappeared before reaching the Tlg2p sub-compartments, presumably because F-actin was disassembled from endocytic vesicles before reaching there. We then utilized the <italic>arp3-D11A</italic> mutant, which shows a delay in endocytic vesicle formation and a severe defect in vesicle internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin et al., 2005</xref>), to examine whether we could observe any Tlg2p sub-compartments approaching the endocytic site when endocytic vesicle movement is blocked. As described previously, in the <italic>arp3-D11A</italic> mutant Abp1p’s lifetime was remarkably extended, indicating that the formation and internalization of endocytic vesicles were also severely impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Similar to the previous findings obtained when A594-α-factor was used as an early endosome marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Toshima et al., 2006</xref>), the Tlg2p sub-compartment was observed to approach and make contact with the Abp1-mCherry-labeled vesicle remaining on the PM, and then disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dynamic behavior of the Tlg2p-residing compartment, endocytic vesicles, and cargos.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) 2D imaging of GFP-Tlg2p and Abp1-mCherry in wild-type (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>arp3-D11A</italic> cells (<bold>B</bold>).Kymographs along lines in the upper merged image are shown in the panels below.

Time-lapse imaging of a wild-type cell revealed that an Abp1-mCherry-labeled endocytic vesicle appeared, stayed for 3–6s around the Tlg2p sub-compartment, and then disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). In contrast, in the <italic>arp3-D11A</italic> mutant, an Abp1-mCherry-labeled vesicle stayed around the Tlg2p sub-compartment more than 10s and then disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). Because the temporal resolution of SCLIM is 3s in this observation, we were unable to track all the Abp1-mCherry signals until their disappearance. The timing of dissociation of Abp1p from the endocytic vesicles depends on the speed of actin depolymerization around the vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Toret et al., 2008</xref>) and thus is not constant: some Abp1p signals disappear after reaching the Tlg2p sub-compartment, but others disappear before. Despite this, we observed similar dynamics in at least 18% of Abp1-mCherry-labeled vesicles internalized in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). We also utilized Vps21p as a marker of another endosomal compartment. In contrast to the Tlg2p sub-compartment, GFP-Vps21-labeled endosomal compartments often fused with each other, forming larger structures, and Abp1-mCherry-labeled vesicles rarely coalesced into them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>). To further test if the Tlg2p sub-compartment interacting with Abp1-mCherry-labeled vesicles was within the TGN, we performed triple-color 4D imaging, including Sec7-iRFP. As Abp1-mCherry labels F-actin associated with endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>), Abp1-mCherry signals were not constant and varied in size and intensity according to the degree of actin polymerization, some Abp1-mCherry patches fusing with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). However, we found that some Abp1-mCherry-labeled vesicles stayed and disappeared on the Tlg2p sub-compartment adjacent to the Sec7p sub-compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>).

This overlapping localization was observed at the Vps21p-residing smaller structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, white arrowheads) and the larger Tlg2p sub-compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, yellow arrowheads). We also found that~26% of the Sec7-mCherry-labeled sub-compartment overlapped with GFP-Vps21p signals, suggesting that Vps21p partially localizes around the TGN as well as in endosomal compartments. Interestingly, we observed that mCherry-Vps21p-labeled vesicles associate with and move around the Tlg2p sub-compartment over 10s, and line scan analyses revealed that the Vps21p signal well overlaps with the GFP-Tlg2p signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Triple-color 3D imaging demonstrated that mCherry-Vps21p signals often made contact with the Tlg2p sub-compartment adjacent to the Sec7p sub-compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>).

To confirm this, we examined whether Tlg2p accumulates in endosomal intermediates observed in the mutant lacking the yeast Rab5 paralogs, <italic>VPS21</italic> and <italic>YPT52</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Toshima et al., 2014</xref>). As shown previously, A594-α-factor accumulated in multiple endosomal intermediates in the <italic>vps21</italic>Δ <italic>ypt52</italic>Δ mutant, and Tlg2p was well localized there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J and K</xref>). In the <italic>vps21</italic>Δ <italic>ypt52</italic>Δ mutant, we also observed that A594-α-factor accumulated at endosomal intermediate-like structures that did not contain the GFP-Tlg2p signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>, white arrowhead). It is noteworthy that the number of Tlg2p puncta increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>) while that of Sec7p puncta did not change in the mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Toshima et al., 2014</xref>).

GGA adaptor was also shown to be clathrin adaptor and mediate TGN-to endosome traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black and Pelham, 2000</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that deletion of <italic>GGA1</italic> and <italic>GGA2</italic> might cause accumulation of α-factor at the TGN compartment where α-factor is located. In agreement with previous observations, endocytosed A594-α-factor in the <italic>gga1</italic>Δ <italic>gga2</italic>Δ mutant accumulated at several puncta in the cytoplasm at 20min after internalization, whereas in wild-type cells it was mostly transported to the vacuole at this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). AP-1 complex is another clathrin adaptor, and epsin-related Ent3p/Ent5p act as accessories for GGAs and AP-1 adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Copic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duncan et al., 2003</xref>). Accumulation of A594-α-factor was also observed in cells lacking Ent3p and Ent5p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nagano et al., 2019</xref>), but not observed in cells lacking Apl4p, a subunit of the AP-1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that the AP-1-dependent pathway is not essential for sorting of α-factor to the vacuole. By comparing the localization of A594-α-factor with the Sec7-GFP-labeled sub-compartment, we found that the regions where A594-α-factor accumulated differed between the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Thus, we next investigated the effects of deleting <italic>GGA1</italic> and <italic>GGA2</italic> on the Tlg2p or Sec7p sub-compartment. As the distribution of the Sec7p-residing TGN is known to vary during the cell division cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Preuss et al., 1992</xref>), we first examined the localization of Tlg2p and Sec7p at different cell cycle stages. We found that the number of Sec7p-residing puncta were slightly more abundant in M-phase cells than in S-phase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), but the rate of overlap between GFP-Tlg2p and Sec7-mCherry in the two phases was almost the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Simultaneous dual-color 2D imaging revealed that in the <italic>gga1</italic>Δ <italic>gga2</italic>Δ mutant the Tlg2p and Sec7p sub-compartments were more segregated and that the overlap of GFP-Tlg2p with Sec7-mCherry was markedly decreased (46.3 ± 2.6%), relative to wild-type cells (76.9 ± 7.7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).

The double-color 4D SCLIM observation demonstrated that Sec7-mCherry signals appeared in the vicinity of the pre-existing Tlg2p sub-compartment and then Tlg2p disappeared gradually consistent with the previous report in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>).

The functionality of mCherry-tagged Gga2p was confirmed by testing its ability to complement the growth phenotype of <italic>gga1</italic>Δ <italic>gga2</italic>Δ cells on YPD at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2G</xref>).

To examine the spatiotemporal localization of Gga2p precisely, we performed triple-color imaging of GFP-Tlg2p, Sec7-iRFP, and Gga2-mCherry by SCLIM. As reported previously, we observed that Gga2p appears around the Sec7p sub-compartment and disappears at a similar time as Sec7p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daboussi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>). As expected, a comparison of the spatiotemporal localization of Gga2p, Tlg2p, and Sec7p in the Golgi/TGN revealed that Gga2-mCherry signals co-localize with GFP-Tlg2p-residing sub-compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>).

Thus, Gga2p likely appears at the Tlg2p sub-compartment during the decay phase of Tlg2p and mediates the transport of α-factor and presumably Tlg2p itself from the Tlg2p sub-compartment to the Vps21p-residing endosomal compartment.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-84850-video11.mp4" id="video11"><label>Video 11.</label><caption><title>Triple-color 4D movie of GFP-Tlg2p (green), Sec7-iRFP (red), and Gga2-mCherry (blue) in a wild-type cell.</title><p>Arrows indicate examples of the sequential appearance and disappearance of each protein.</p></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Endocytosed Snc1p is recycled back to the PM via the Tlg2p sub-compartment</title><p>Previous studies have shown that Snc1p, a putative endocytic R-SNARE, transiently localizes to the Sec7p sub-compartment after being endocytosed and returns to the cell surface through the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Robinson et al., 2006</xref>). We have demonstrated in the present study that the compartment where Snc1p’s cognate Q-SNARE, Tlg2p, resides, is the first destination for endocytic traffic, and that endocytic cargo is transported to the Vps21p-residing compartment without passing through the Sec7p sub-compartment. Thus, we next wished to determine whether the pathway of Snc1p back to the PM is also mediated through the Tlg2p and Sec7p sub-compartments. To this end, we utilized fluorescent protein-tagged Snc1p, whose functionalities have been previously confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewis et al., 2000</xref>). We first confirmed that GFP-Snc1p and A594-α-factor are loaded into the same endocytic vesicle.

We also observed vesicles that contained only A594-α-factor or GFP-Snc1p, perhaps because some vesicles do not contain enough A594-α-factor and some contain endogenous untagged Snc1p instead of GFP-Snc1p.

Simultaneous triple-color observation by SCLIM showed that mCherry-Snc1p was localized at the PM and some intracellular puncta, similar to images obtained by 2D epi-fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To detect the localization of Snc1p at these intracellular puncta more clearly, we reduced the fluorescent signals at the PM by contrast modulation, and found that mCherry-Snc1p was localized mostly to the sub-compartment in which GFP-Tlg2p was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Line scan analyses showed that peaks of mCherry-Snc1p and GFP-Tlg2p signal are almost coincident, but that the peak of Sec7-iRFP signal is slightly apart from them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Interestingly, 4D SCLIM imaging demonstrated that the mCherry-Snc1p signal remained in the compartment from which GFP-Tlg2p departed and then disappeared at the similar timing to Sec7-iRFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This observation suggests that Tlg2p and Snc1p are both sorted to this compartment, but then transported by distinct trafficking pathways with different timings. The compartment in which Snc1p remains after Tlg2p leaves appeared to be distinct from the Sec7p sub-compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

Time-lapse imaging showed that mCherry-Snc1p signals were also persistent with GFP-Tlg2 signals after the disappearance of Sec7-iRFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). To further confirm that the Tlg2p sub-compartment is an early/sorting compartment, we utilized mutant lacking the <italic>RCY1</italic> gene because Rcy1p, a F-box protein, has been shown to be required for the transport of Snc1p to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma and Burd, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wiederkehr et al., 2000</xref>).

The functionality of GFP-tagged Ypt31p was confirmed by testing its ability to grow in a <italic>ypt32</italic>Δ background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>) because deletion of both the <italic>YPT31</italic> and <italic>YPT32</italic> genes is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jedd et al., 1997</xref>).

We next compared the localization of A594-α-factor with that of GFP-Ypt31p, and found that Ypt31p showed considerably low overlap with A594-α-factor signals at 5–20 min after A594-α-factor internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>).

Line scan analysis of the TGN, which includes Tlg2p, Sec7p, and Ypt31p, revealed that the mCherry-Ypt31p signal partially overlaps with both the Sec7-iRFP and GFP-Tlg2p signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The mCherry-Ypt31p signal remained after the Sec7-iRFP signal had disappeared, and then gradually disappeared itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). To further examine the localization of Ypt31p/32p in the recycling pathway, we performed 3D SCLIM imaging and found that the peaks of mCherry-Snc1p and Sec7-iRFP were slightly apart, but that the GFP-Ypt31p signal entirely overlapped them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–G</xref>).

A previous observation showed that the TGN where Sec7p resides is the first destination for endocytic traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Day et al., 2018</xref>). Spatially, the Sec7p-residing region is located so closely to the Tlg2p-residing region that previously they were not considered to be distinct compartments. In the present study, we have shown that the Tlg2p-residing structure exists as a sub-compartment distinct from the Sec7p-residing structure within the TGN, thereby revealing that endocytic cargo is incorporated into the Tlg2p sub-compartment within the TGN. Consistent with this result, previous studies using electron microscopy have shown that endocytic cargo is first transported to the tubular/vesicular structure that contains Tlg1p after internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prescianotto-Baschong and Riezman, 1998</xref>). We have also shown that Snc1p, the endocytic R-SNARE that targets Tlg2p, is transiently localized to this sub-compartment and exits from there to the PM, whereas Tlg2p is transported to the PVC via the Vps21p-residing compartment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, Tlg2p appears at the TGN earlier than Snc1p and disappears from the TGN before Snc1p. This suggests that Snc1p binds to Tlg2p that has been recycled back from the PVC and dissociates from Tlg2p at the sub-compartment. Recent studies have revealed that yeast has a direct pathway that recycles cell surface protein back from the endosome to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laidlaw et al., 2022</xref>). In this pathway, unlike Snc1p, cargos are not transported to the TGN, but are incorporated directly into the Vps4p-residing endosome and returned back to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laidlaw et al., 2022</xref>).

Previous studies reported that GGA adaptors-enriched vesicles include Ent3p and Ent5p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daboussi et al., 2012</xref>), and thus Vps9p might be recruited to and transported from the Tlg2p sub-compartment.

A previous study by Day et al. reported that both Tlg1p and Tlg2p shows substantial co-localization with Sec7p (~50% GFP-Tlg1p-labeled puncta overlap with Sec7p-residing TGN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Day et al., 2018</xref>). Holthuis et al. reported that upon subcellular fractionation the two proteins peaked at different densities, leading the authors to propose that the two proteins are found in a putative early endosome, and the Golgi/PVC, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holthuis et al., 1998a</xref>). However, their distribution within the fractions entirely overlapped and Tlg2p is also found in the peak fraction of Tlg1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holthuis et al., 1998a</xref>). Matching these observations, we observed that both Tlg1p and Tlg2p substantially localize at the TGN while Tlg1p localizes at the PVC less than Tlg2p. Thus, Tlg1p seems to localize at the Tlg2p sub-compartment and function together with it.</p><p>By examining the localization, we demonstrated that Alexa-α-factor, transported to the Tlg2p sub-compartment adjacent to the Sec7p sub-compartment, moves to the Vps21p-residing compartment presumably together with Tlg2p. As Tlg2p interacts with Snc2p, a potential endocytic R-SNARE, and its deletion caused a defect in the endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeliovich et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paumet et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Séron et al., 1998</xref>), the primary role of Tlg2p in the endocytic pathway seems to be in mediating fusion of the endocytic vesicle with the early/sorting compartment. Additionally, Tlg2p present in the Vps21p-residing compartment might have a role in endosomal fusion. After being transported to the Vps21p-residing compartment, Tlg2p may be returned to the early/sorting compartment by interacting with Ypt6p (yeast Rab6) and the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Siniossoglou and Pelham, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suda et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Tojima et al. have previously demonstrated that Tlg2p and Sec7p overlap during Golgi/TGN maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>), and Day et al. have reported that the Sec7p-residing TGN serves as an early/sorting endosome, like plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Day et al., 2018</xref>). Our present analysis indicates that Tlg2p partially overlaps with Sec7p, although the major part of the Tlg2p sub-compartment exists separate from the Sec7p-residing one. The clathrin-residing region has also been shown to segregate from the Tlg2p sub-compartment, although it largely overlaps with the Sec7p sub-compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>), supporting the idea that the Tlg2p and Sec7p sub-compartments are segregated spatially. Our model, therefore, is not inconsistent with those built on previous observations, but adds the concept that the Tlg2p-residing region, rather than the Sec7p-residing region, functions as an endocytic early/sorting compartment. In contrast, Best et al. proposed a model in which yeast has a Tlg1p-residing endosome distinct from the TGN, and that this mediates Snc1p recycling via three different routes by Drs2/Rcy1/COPI, Snx4-Atg20, and the retromer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best et al., 2020</xref>). Their observation that Snc1p is mis-localized to the Tlg1p-residing compartment in the <italic>rcy</italic>1Δ cell is in agreement with our result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best et al., 2020</xref>). An Snx4p-dependent route facilitating retrieval of Snc1p from the PVC to the Sec7p-residing TGN is also not inconsistent with our result if the retrieval region is the Tlg2p sub-compartment rather than the Sec7p sub-compartment. Thus, we can consider their model to be compatible with ours, given that the Tlg2p- and Sec7p-residing regions are adjacent but independent sub-compartments within the TGN.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Endocytic recycling compartments in different organisms</title><p>The identity of the sorting/recycling compartment (SE/RE) varies among different organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nakano, 2022</xref>). In plants, the TGN serves as the SE/RE, whereas in mammalian cells the SE/RE functions as a different organelle distinct from the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grant and Donaldson, 2009</xref>). A recent study has reported that, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and microtubule-disrupted HeLa cells, recycling endosomes (REs) present two distinct stages – Golgi-associated REs and Golgi-independent REs – that are interconvertible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fujii et al., 2020a</xref>). Plants have two types of TGN – Golgi-associated TGN and Golgi-independent-TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Uemura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Viotti et al., 2010</xref>) – whose dynamics are similar to REs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fujii et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujii et al., 2020b</xref>). These observations suggest that the properties of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian RE are similar to those of plant cells. In this study, we have shown that yeast has a sorting compartment within the TGN and that this structure seems to be more similar to that of a plant cell. A recent study has demonstrated that in plants the TGN has at least two subregions (zones) responsible for secretory and vacuolar trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nakano, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shimizu et al., 2021</xref>), and that the yeast sorting/recycling compartment might correspond to the latter zone. Interestingly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells markers of the TGN and RE show close localization and even partial overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fujii et al., 2020a</xref>), and these structures appear to have some similarity to the yeast sorting/recycling compartment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Possible mechanism for early/sorting compartment generation</title><p>How the endocytic early/sorting compartment is generated and turned over has been unclear both in plants and mammals. Our findings provide a new insight into the mechanism. Recent studies have demonstrated that the appearance and the dynamic behaviors of Golgi/TGN-resident proteins exhibit a unique order of events during Golgi/TGN maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kurokawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thomas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>). Tojima et al. proposed that the Golgi/TGN maturation process can be classified into three successive stages: the Golgi stage, the early TGN stage, and the late TGN stage; Tlg2p was categorized as an early TGN-resident protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>). Our present results indicate that, after capturing endocytic vesicles, the Tlg2p sub-compartment gradually disappears through export of Tlg2p to the Vps21p-residing compartment. The Tlg2p sub-compartment is presumably regenerated by Sys1p-mediated retrograde transport. Sys1p, a late Golgi-resident protein, recruits GARP complexes through the Sys1-Arl3-Arl1-Imh1 cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Graham, 2004</xref>) and interacts with vesicles containing Tlg1p derived from endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Siniossoglou and Pelham, 2001</xref>). Tlg1p is known to bind directly to the GARP complex and mediates the retrograde transport from the late endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Siniossoglou and Pelham, 2001</xref>). Tlg2p has been also reported to be cycled between the TGN and endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewis et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, a previous study reported that the majority of the Sys1p-residing compartment is not accompanied by clathrin appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that Sys1p resides in a distinct compartment from the Sec7p-residing one. The observation that the Sys1p-residing compartment appears before Tlg2p and matures into the Tlg2p-residing one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>) supports the idea that Sys1p may play a role in generating the early/sorting compartment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Role of GGA adaptors in endocytic cargo transport</title><p>A previous study has suggested the importance of GGA adaptors in the export of α-factor from the Sec7p sub-compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Day et al., 2018</xref>). Black and Pelham reported that Pep12p, a yeast syntaxin localized primarily at the late endosome, is also mislocalized to the Tlg1p high-density membranes in <italic>gga1</italic>Δ <italic>gga2</italic>Δ cell and suggested that an aberrant early endosome structure may cause a defect in the TGN-to-endosome traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black and Pelham, 2000</xref>). Here we have shown that in <italic>gga1</italic>Δ <italic>gga2</italic>Δ cells α-factor accumulates at the Tlg2p sub-compartment. Interestingly, in <italic>gga1</italic>Δ <italic>gga2</italic>Δ cells, turnover of the Tlg2p- and Tlg1p-residing sub-compartment is impaired, and these observations suggest that export of cargos by GGA adaptors is important for normal turnover of the Tlg2p sub-compartment. As GGA adaptors are reported to bind directly to ubiquitin, which function as a sorting signal for lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scott et al., 2004</xref>), the ubiquitination signal could mediate the export of α-factor from the Tlg2p sub-compartment. Several cell-surface proteins, including the α-factor receptor Ste3p, are known to be ubiquitinated, thereby being sorted from the TGN to the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buelto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scott et al., 2004</xref>). The α-factor receptor Ste2p is also ubiquitinated upon ligand binding, promoting incorporation of the α-factor-Ste2p complex into the clathrin-coated vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hicke and Riezman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toshima et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, after being transported to the Tlg2p sub-compartment, the ubiquitinated α-factor-Ste2p complex could be exported to the Vps21p-residing compartment by binding to GGA adaptors.</p><p>Two major clathrin adaptors, GGA adaptors and the AP-1 complex, were implicated to act in TGN-endosome trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Traub, 2005</xref>). Daboussi et al. showed that the major population of Gga2p and AP-1 is separated both temporally and spatially, and that Gga2p arrives earlier than AP-1 at almost the same time point as Sec7p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daboussi et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, Gga1p appears to arrive at the TGN earlier than Gga2p, presumably with similar timing to Tlg2p because it arrives 3 s earlier than Chs5p, a component of the exomer complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anton-Plagaro et al., 2021</xref>). A recent study has reported that GGA adaptors, but not the AP-1 complex, are necessary for the transport of newly synthesized vacuolar protein from the TGN to the vacuole via the VPS pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casler and Glick, 2020</xref>). We previously demonstrated that convergence of the endocytic and VPS pathways occurs upstream of the requirement for Vps21p in the early stage of the endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Toshima et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that the endocytic cargo derived from the PM and the biosynthetic cargo for the VPS pathway both reach the Tlg2p sub-compartment and exit there by a GGA-adaptor-dependent mechanism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, growth conditions, and plasmids</title><p>The yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

For TIRF illumination, optically pumped semiconductor laser (OPSL) (Coherent) with emission of at 488 nm (OBIS 488LS-50) and at 561 nm (OBIS 561LS-50) were used to excite GFP or mCherry/Alexa594, respectively. Simultaneous imaging of red and green fluorescence was performed using an Olympus IX83 microscope, described above, and an image splitter (Dual-View; Optical Insights) that divided the red and green components of the images with a 565 nm dichroic mirror and passed the red component through a 630/50 nm filter and the green component through a 530/30 nm filter. These split signals were taken simultaneously with one CCD camera, described above. 2D triple-color imaging were performed using an Olympus IX81 microscope equipped with a high-speed filter changer (Lambda 10-3; Sutter Instruments) that can change filter sets within 40ms. All cells were imaged during the early- to mid-logarithmic phase. Images for analysis of co-localization of red and green signals were acquired using simultaneous imaging (64.5 nm pixel size), described above. Intensity profiles of GFP-fused protein and mCherry-fused protein or A594-α-factor were generated using the Plot Profile tool (ImageJ v1.53a) across the center of fluorescence signals.

The pixel size corresponds to 0.06 μm on the sample plane. For 3D observations, we collected 21 optical sections spaced 0.2 μm apart (z-range = 4.0 μm).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The yeast endocytic early/sorting compartment exists as an independent sub-compartment within the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see, the reviewers appreciate the quality of your imaging data, and also the significance and importance of the question that you are addressing. However, they also make quite a lot of specific comments and suggestions. Most of these can be addressed with clarifications in the text or more quantitation. There is a specific request for examining further markers such as Ypt31 or Ypt32 (Rab11) and FM-464 so as to clarify the identity of the structures that you observe. This seems reasonable. One reviewer suggests electron microscopy to examine the compartments, but we agreed that whilst this would be ideal, it would be very technically challenging in this system and so beyond the scope of what you have done. Thus the electron microscopy is not required.</p><p>One aspect that is essential to address is to discuss in more depth how your findings relate to the previous studies on this topic. There are several studies that present evidence for endocytic compartments that lie upstream of the Sec7 compartment on the endocytic pathway, and this needs to be properly discussed. The reviewers have indicated the specific papers that need to be covered. This is not a requirement to reach a definitive conclusion about all aspects of the pathway, but rather to fairly acknowledge the views in the field, and summarise what is agreed and what remains to be resolved.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The article is very well written and the findings are well presented. I have the following suggestions:</p><p>1. Because the yeast TGN has been suggested to function not only as an early endosome, but also as the recycling endosome, the study feels incomplete without an analysis and clear discussion of the recycling endosome. The authors should try to place the recycling endosome as well in their model of how the TGN relates to endocytosis by conducting a similar analysis of Rab11 or other markers in relation to Sec7, Tlg2, Snc1 and endocytosed/recycled cargo.</p><p>2. I would suggest not to use the cyan/green color combination to make the point that markers overlap, as this could lead to visual overestimation of that overlap (e.g. Figure 1F, 2J, 3G, 4J, 5K, 6C).</p><p>3. Line 57: &quot;Additionally, we have previously demonstrated that endocytosed cargos are rarely transported to the Sec7p-residing TGN compartment (Toshima et al., 2014).&quot; This needs some better description and context, as the present study shows that endocytosed cargo travels to the Tlg2 sub-compartment, which overlaps with the Sec7 sub-compartment. Should the authors talk about &quot;Tlg2-only&quot; and &quot;Sec7-only&quot; sub-compartments? However, see next point.</p><p>4. Line 140: &quot;In contrast, Sec7-GFP, which was also detected as several punctate structures, did not show significant overlap with A594-α-factor signals either at 5 min (26.0{plus minus}9.4%) or 10 min (22.7{plus minus}6.0%) after A594-α-factor internalization (Figure 1B; Figure S1A).&quot; In what sense are 26.0 % and 22.7 % overlap between Sec7 and α-factor &quot;not significant&quot;?</p><p>5. In the Discussion section called &quot;Integrating the present model with earlier observations&quot;, the authors should discuss the findings on Snc1/Tlg1 in Best et al., 2020, and how they can be integrated with those of Day et al., 2018 and their own.</p><p>6. There is no attempt to put the findings in an evolutionary context. With the exception of some references to their own work in plants, there is no discussion of the implications for other organisms, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> or humans.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>General point throughout – the brightness and number of Sec7 foci varies a lot (not specific to tag or microscope), which is also true in the literature. As whether compartments are either Sec7 + or – is so important for this study can this variability be quantified or discussed in the text. Does it vary based on the cell cycle, age of cell, media conditions, growth phase, etc?</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>The variation in localization of Tlg2 (even using the same 2D imaging technique) is disconcerting. GFP-Tlg2 localises exclusively to discrete foci in Figure 1A but mainly seems to be dispersed in a large diffuse region in Figure 2A. This difference is obvious when only comparing two representative images – how common is that diffuse signal and where in the cell does it represent (maybe intravacuolar? This could be tested with dyes like FM4-64 or CMAC)? These are never observed in the SCLIM micrographs, possibly the contrast from processing enhances bright signal at the cost of molecules from low/diffuse regions?</p><p>Line 145 – &quot;localized at puncta around the vacuole and vacuole&quot; confused me initially, it might read better as &quot;localized inside the vacuole and at puncta around the vacuole&quot;</p><p>Figure 2A – The inset showing 16-24 seconds. Why is Abp1 label pink in A but red in B – this should probably be consistent.</p><p>Figure 2I – Many Abp1+ endocytic carries are very large/bright whilst some are very small. Are they all vesicles or are some indictors of fusion with non-TGN compartments? Also, even without being colour-blind I struggle to distinguish the Sec7-iRFP and GFP-Tlg2 signal, it might be improved to show a third micrograph with only one of them?</p><p>Line 218 – The endocytosis of vesicles to Tlg2+ compartment is very convincing. It seems important for the segue from Figure 1 to also image internalised mating factor in cells with labelled Abp1. I mention this because further clarification about what endocytic carriers do/do not have cargo seems to be an outstanding issue that can be reconciled with this data (see above point relating to figure 2I).</p><p>Line 255 – what is meant by the &quot;early-to-late stage of the endocytic pathway&quot;? There are imaging experiments with predefined criteria, such as the differences in (co)localisation of A647 mating factor at 5 and 15 minutes, maybe these would be more specific reference points?</p><p>Figure 3E – I think the bottom row of micrographs in 3E in mislabelled – it makes more sense for it to be labelled V (in red) and S (cyan)? Instead of T (green) and S (cyan).</p><p>Figure 3J – The bottom left cell in has an obvious 5 min internalised a-factor foci that is distinctly Tlg2-negative. How common is this observation in raw data? Is this a distinct endosomal compartment? If ideas like this based on the representative micrographs are valid, they could be discussed.</p><p>Line 312 – I think the rationale for these experiments is good but not explained sufficiently for non-experts. I think more information and references should be included about Golgi clathrin adaptors (eg Duncan et al. 2003 Nat. Cell Bio.) This will better contextualise the results relating to Gga/Ent/AP mutants and their impact on endocytic cargo trafficking.</p><p>Figure 5A – As mentioned in main summary, there are inconsistent localisations of these important reporter proteins that are not mentioned or explained. GFP-Tlg2 is clearly on the vacuolar membrane in 5A but not 5E. Are the cells grown in different conditions or experiencing stress (e.g. nutrient stress) in certain imaging experiments? A brightfield image could be included to demonstrate that no gross aberrations have occurred prior to imaging.</p><p>Figure 6A – I was a little confused as to whether all the pheromone+ and Snc1+ compartments are all accounted for across time lapse imaging. The TIRF microscopy appears to show both (Tlg2+ pheromone-) and (Tlg- pheromone+) foci. Are these distinct carriers and what drives the cargo partitioning?</p><p>Figure 7 – Although the markers Tlg2 and Snc1 are convenient to label structures being studied, they also represent core machinery and cognate SNARE partners for these trafficking pathways. This could be expounded in the text, both in the results and discussion. Related, does the imaging in Figure 6 fully support the model shown in Figure 7 relating to the SNARE cycle and when Snc1-Tlg2 are, and are not, colocalised?</p><p>Line 435 – Obviously the Day et al. model needs to be discussed here and the inclusion of earlier work regarding Tlg1 (especially that of Howard Riezman) is helpful. This section could also be an opportunity to discuss the yeast endosomal field in more detail. For example, lattice light sheet experiments showing fast-moving peripheral Vps4+ endosome populations are distinct from the TGN and PVC which have been proposed as early/sorting endosomes (PMIDs: 29019322 + 36125415). Could these intermediates be the same as the Tlg2+ compartments uncovered in this study?</p><p>Line 474 – From a semantic point, if endocytosed cargo enters a Tlg2+ compartment en route to later endosomes marked with Vps21 can it be considered an endosome as much a TGN sub-compartment?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84850.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The article is very well written and the findings are well presented.

We first confirmed that Ypt31p and Ypt32p exhibit almost the same localization and dynamics (Figure 7—figure supplement 1, B-D), consistent with previous studies (Gingras et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2022). We next compared the localization of Alexa594-labeled a-factor (A594-a-factor) with GFP-Ypt31p and found that Ypt31p does not highly overlap with A594-a-factor (Figure 7—figure supplement 1, E and F). We also performed triple-color 4D imaging to determine whether Ypt31p localized to the Tlg2p or the Sec7p sub-compartment. As reported previously, in the wild-type cell Ypt31p appears at the TGN after Sec7p (Suda et al., PNAS. 2013; Highland and Fromme, MBoC, 2021). However, the signal partially overlaps with both the Tlg2p and Sec7p signals (Figure 7, A-D). Line scan analysis of the TGN, which includes Tlg2p, Sec7p and Ypt31p, revealed that the mCherry-Ypt31p signal partially overlaps with both the Sec7-iRFP and GFP-Tlg2p signals (Figure 7C). Additionally, 4D SCLIM imaging demonstrated that Ypt31p appears at, and disappears from the TGN, with timing similar to that of Snc1p, indicating that Ypt31p resides in the recycling (or sorting) compartment (Figure 7, E-H). These results suggest that Ypt31p resides in both the Tlg2p and Sec7p compartments, and presumably functions in the secretory and recycling pathways. In contrast, in the <italic>gga1</italic>D <italic>gga2</italic>D mutant, GFP-Ypt31p signals were little overlapped with the mCherry-Snc1p signals (Fig, 7, I-L). Since deletion of Gga1p/2p affects turnover of the Tlg2p sub-compartment (Figure 5, F and G), the recruitment of Ypt31p seems to fail in the mutant. Based on these observations, in the new manuscript we have added Ypt31p localization to the model (Figure 8) and also provided some discussion of these findings (lines 556-569).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

All the data were obtained using cells in the logarithmic growth phase (OD600 = ~0.5). Two different media, YPD and SD (with amino acids), were used in this study, but no obvious difference in the number of Sec7p-residing puncta was observed under the growth conditions employed (data not shown). In contrast, the number of Sec7p-residing puncta were slightly more abundant in M phase cells than in S phase cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1, A and B). However, the rate of Sec7-mCherry overlapping with GFP-Tlg2p was almost the same between S phase and M phase cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1, C and D), suggesting that our present results were not affected by the cell cycle or media conditions. To clarify this, we have added some explanatory sentences on lines 379-385 in the new manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1</p><p>The variation in localization of Tlg2 (even using the same 2D imaging technique) is disconcerting.

These are never observed in the SCLIM micrographs, possibly the contrast from processing enhances bright signal at the cost of molecules from low/diffuse regions?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that GFP-Tlg2p exhibits diffused localization in the cytosol, in addition to punctate localization. In accordance with the reviewer’s suggestion, we labeled cells with FM4-64 and found that the diffuse localization occurred in the vacuolar lumen (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). As previous studies have reported that Tlg2p is cycled between the TGN and the endosome (Lewis et al., MBoC, 2000), we speculate that Tlg2p is partially transported to the vacuole. This vacuolar localization was not visible in some cells, possibly due to the location of the vacuole. Thus, we have added explanatory sentence about this in the new manuscript (lines 139-143). As the reviewer mentions, this diffuse localization in the vacuolar lumen was not evident by SCLIM presumably because the fluorescence signal was too weak. To explain these points, we have added some sentences on lines 180-182 in the new manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 145 – &quot;localized at puncta around the vacuole and vacuole&quot; confused me initially, it might read better as &quot;localized inside the vacuole and at puncta around the vacuole&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer's suggestion, we have changed the sentence “localized at puncta around the vacuole and vacuole” to “localized inside the vacuole and at puncta around the vacuole” in the new manuscript (lines 151-152).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2A – The inset showing 16-24 seconds.

Are they all vesicles or are some indictors of fusion with non-TGN compartments?</p></disp-quote><p>Since Abp1-mCherry labels F-actin associated with endocytic vesicles, the fluorescence intensity depends on the amount of actin polymerization. Additionally, some Abp1-mCherry signals fuse with each other and become large. To explain this, in the new manuscript, we have added the data showing that the Abp1-mCherry signal changes over time and that some Abp1-mCherry patches fuse with each other (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, B-D).</p><p>With regard to the question &quot;are some indictors of fusion with non-TGN compartments?&quot;, since the rate of actin depolymerization is not constant for each endocytic vesicle, it is likely that some Abp1-mCherry signals disappear before reaching the endosome. Therefore, it was difficult to show that all vesicles fuse with Tlg2p-residing compartments. We have added an explanatory sentence about this possibility in the new manuscript (line 233-235).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, even without being colour-blind I struggle to distinguish the Sec7-iRFP and GFP-Tlg2 signal, it might be improved to show a third micrograph with only one of them?</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer's suggestion, we have added single color micrograph to show Sec7-iRFP localization. Additionally, we have changed color of Sec7-iRFP from cyan to blue to clearly separate Sec7-iRFP and GFP-Tlg2 signals (Figure 2, I and J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 218 – The endocytosis of vesicles to Tlg2+ compartment is very convincing. It seems important for the segue from Figure 1 to also image internalised mating factor in cells with labelled Abp1. I mention this because further clarification about what endocytic carriers do/do not have cargo seems to be an outstanding issue that can be reconciled with this data (see above point relating to figure 2I).</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous study, using TIRF microscopy, we have demonstrated that Alexa Fluor 488-labeled a-factor accumulates at the Abp1p patch at the cell surface, and is internalized concomitantly (Toshima et al., PNAS, 2006). However, we have not yet succeeded in capturing an image showing an internalized Abp1p-labeled endocytic vesicle carrying fluorescence-labeled a-factor, presumably because the a-factor fluorescent signal is below the limit of detection. Therefore, we have cited the study and added an explanatory sentence to suggest that the Abp1p-labeled vesicles contain cargos (lines 223-225).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 255 – what is meant by the &quot;early-to-late stage of the endocytic pathway&quot;? There are imaging experiments with predefined criteria, such as the differences in (co)localisation of A647 mating factor at 5 and 15 minutes, maybe these would be more specific reference points?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s helpful suggestion.

How common is this observation in raw data? Is this a distinct endosomal compartment? If ideas like this based on the representative micrographs are valid, they could be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous study, we demonstrated that in the vps21D ypt52D mutant A594-a-factor accumulates at the endosomal intermediates labeled by Vph1-GFP (Toshima et al., Nat Comm, 2014). In the present study, we showed that Tlg2p also accumulated in the endosomal intermediates and that the number of GFP-Tlg2p-labeled puncta increased in the vps21D ypt52D mutant (Figure 3J). As the reviewer points out, A594-a-factor labeled Tlg2-negative puncta are frequently observed in the vps21D ypt52D mutant (Figure 3J), and we speculate that these puncta are probably endosomal intermediates that do not contain GFP-Tlg2p. Thus, in accordance with the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the following sentence: &quot;We also observed that A594-a-factor accumulates at endosomal intermediate-like structures that do not contain the GFP-Tlg2p signal in the vps21D ypt52D mutant (Figure 3J, white arrowhead).&quot; in lines 320-323.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 312 – I think the rationale for these experiments is good but not explained sufficiently for non-experts.

GFP-Tlg2 is clearly on the vacuolar membrane in 5A but not 5E. Are the cells grown in different conditions or experiencing stress (e.g. nutrient stress) in certain imaging experiments? A brightfield image could be included to demonstrate that no gross aberrations have occurred prior to imaging.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer points out, GFP-Tlg2p is slightly localized at the vacuolar membrane in the <italic>gga</italic>1D <italic>gga</italic>2D mutant (Figure 5A), suggesting that retrograde transport of Tlg2p from the endosome to the TGN is partially impaired in this mutant. In the new manuscript, we have added a brightfield (DIC) image (Figure 5A) and mentioned about this (lines 389-391). The vacuolar membrane localization was not observed by SCLIM because the fluorescent signal was too weak to be detected. Therefore, to explain this, we have added a sentence to the new manuscript (lines 399-400).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6A – I was a little confused as to whether all the pheromone+ and Snc1+ compartments are all accounted for across time lapse imaging. The TIRF microscopy appears to show both (Tlg2+ pheromone-) and (Tlg- pheromone+) foci. Are these distinct carriers and what drives the cargo partitioning?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer points out, TIRFM imaging showed that three types of foci (A594-a-factor+/GFP-Snc1p+, A594-a-factor+/GFP-Snc1p-, and A594-a-factor-/GFP- Snc1p+) exist on the cell surface. In the previous study, we demonstrated that A594-a-factor only partially colocalized with GFP-Snc1p when it was endocytosed (Toshima et al., PNAS, 2006). One possible explanation for why not all GFP-Snc1-labeled vesicles include the A594-a-factor signal (A594-a-factor-/ GFP-Snc1p+ foci) is that some vesicles do not carry enough A594-a-factor to allow detection of the fluorescence signals. As for (A594-a-factor+/GFP-Snc1p-) foci, GFP-Snc1p may not be loaded on all endocytic vesicles because GFP-Snc1p is exogenously expressed and endogenous Snc1p exists in the cell. We agree that what drives the cargo partitioning is quite an important issue, but we were unable to address it in this study. Therefore, we have added a sentence to explain why several kinds of foci containing distinct cargo were observed (lines 441-444).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 – Although the markers Tlg2 and Snc1 are convenient to label structures being studied, they also represent core machinery and cognate SNARE partners for these trafficking pathways. This could be expounded in the text, both in the results and discussion. Related, does the imaging in Figure 6 fully support the model shown in Figure 7 relating to the SNARE cycle and when Snc1-Tlg2 are, and are not, colocalised?</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer's suggestion, we have added the explanatory sentence “~ in the present study that the compartment where Snc1p’s cognate Q-SNARE, Tlg2p, resides, is the first destination for endocytic traffic, ~&quot; in results (lines 431-432). We have also added the sentence &quot;We have also showed that Snc1p, endocytic R-SNARE that targets Tlg2p ~&quot; in discussion (lines 542-543).</p><p>In Figure 6D, we showed that Tlg2p appears at the TGN earlier than Snc1p and disappears from there before Snc1p. This suggests that Snc1p binds to pre-existing Tlg2p, which is recycled back from the PVC, and dissociates from Tlg2p at the Tlg2p sub-compartment. This result is also supported by 3D triple-color observation using mCherry-Snc1p, GFP-Ypt31p and Sec7-iRFP (Figure 7F). To explain about the SNARE cycle in Figure 8 (in the new manuscript), we have added sentences &quot;As shown in Figure 6, Tlg2p appears at TGN earlier than Snc1p and disappears before Snc1p from the TGN. This suggests that Snc1p binds to Tlg2p recycled back from the PVC and dissociate from Tlg2p at the Tlg2p sub-compartment.&quot; in the discussion (lines 545-548).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 435 – Obviously the Day et al. model needs to be discussed here and the inclusion of earlier work regarding Tlg1 (especially that of Howard Riezman) is helpful. This section could also be an opportunity to discuss the yeast endosomal field in more detail. For example, lattice light sheet experiments showing fast-moving peripheral Vps4+ endosome populations are distinct from the TGN and PVC which have been proposed as early/sorting endosomes (PMIDs: 29019322 + 36125415). Could these intermediates be the same as the Tlg2+ compartments uncovered in this study?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer kindly providing information regarding papers that we should cite.

We have also discussed about the Vps4+ endosome by citing the studies (Laidlaw et al., JCB, 2022; Adell et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2017) in that section (lines 550-555). We have further added a new Discussion section about early and recycling endosomes in yeast and other organisms in lines 621-640 (please see also the response to reviewer #1’s comment #5). As Vps4-positive endosomes are known to be distinct from Snc1p-positive structure in the study by Laidlaw et al., it is likely that these endosomes are not same as the Tlg2-residing compartment.
