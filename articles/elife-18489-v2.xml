therefore capture the genetic diversity of this disease. We assembled a panel of CRC organoids carrying either wild-type or mutant RAS, as well as normal organoids and tumor organoids with a CRISPR-introduced oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation. Using this panel, we evaluated RAS pathway inhibitors and drug combinations that are currently in clinical trial for RAS mutant cancers. Presence of mutant RAS correlated strongly with resistance to these targeted therapies. This was observed in tumorigenic as well as in normal organoids. Moreover, dual inhibition of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway in RAS mutant organoids induced a transient cell-cycle arrest rather than cell death. In vivo drug response of xenotransplanted RAS mutant organoids confirmed this growth arrest upon pan-HER/MEK combination therapy. Altogether, our studies demonstrate the potential of patient-derived CRC organoid libraries in evaluating inhibitors and drug combinations in a preclinical setting.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18489.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18489.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18489.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Recent technical advances mean that miniature replicas of many tissues can be grown in the laboratory. These so-called organoids provide scientists with model systems that are not as limited as simple, two-dimensional sheets of cells growing in a petri dish, and less labor and resource intensive than studies using laboratory animals. In particular, organoids grown from tumor cells from cancer patients have been suggested as having numerous advantages over both laboratory-grown cancer cells and mice when it comes to testing potential new anticancer drugs.</p><p>Mutations in a gene called <italic>KRAS</italic> are common in many types of cancer including colon cancer. Tumors with these mutations are difficult to treat and so far virtually all attempts to generate compounds that selectively interfere with the KRAS protein encoded by the mutant gene have failed. Instead, drugs that indirectly inhibit this protein’s effects by targeting other proteins in the same signaling pathway are currently being tested on patients. However, there is still a need for better ways to pre-test whether these drugs will be effective in humans without having to expose the patient to side effects or an ineffective drug.</p><p>Now, Verissimo, Overmeer, Ponsioen et al. have tested clinically-used KRAS pathway inhibitors and drug combinations against normal colon organoids and colon cancer organoids derived from patients with colon cancer. Gene editing techniques were used to introduce <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations into some of the normal organoids grown from healthy tissue, and into cancer organoids grown from tumors that had a normal copy of the <italic>KRAS</italic> gene. In all cases, only those organoids with mutant forms of the <italic>KRAS</italic> gene were resistant to the treatments. Furthermore, when organoids with the <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation were treated with some combination therapies that are currently being tested in clinical trials, the tumors stopped growing but the tumor cells failed to die. Similar drug treatments on mice carrying human colon cancer organoids confirmed these results, which is in line with previous studies where tumor tissue from human patients was transplanted into mice.</p><p>These findings show that collections of tumor organoids from multiple patients could help researchers to quickly identify and optimize targeted anticancer therapies before they are incorporated into clinical trials. In the future, clinical studies are needed to verify how accurately the testing of cancer drugs on organoids predicts whether the drug will or will not work in patients.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18489.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18489.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>organoids</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>targeted therapy</kwd><kwd>KRAS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drost</surname><given-names>Jarno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stand Up To Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clevers</surname><given-names>Hans</given-names></name><name><surname>Bos</surname><given-names>Johannes L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004622</institution-id><institution>KWF Kankerbestrijding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Snippert</surname><given-names>Hugo J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Libraries of patient-derived tumor organoids are a reliable and scalable model system that can help identify and optimize targeted therapies in a pre-clinical setting.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the great challenges in targeted cancer treatment has been the development of effective RAS-targeting drugs. RAS mutations occur in about 15% of all human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bos, 1989</xref>) and so far all attempts to selectively interfere in mutant RAS signaling have failed in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stephen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cox et al., 2014</xref>). Progress has long been impeded by the fact that the currently used model systems to pre-test drugs are insufficient: cell lines, on the one hand, have very limited genetic diversity, while mouse models on the other hand, may not represent human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sachs and Clevers, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gould et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, until recently, personalized medicine required large-scale in-vitro screening on short-term cultures of tumor sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Centenera et al., 2013</xref>), or alternatively, resource-intensive in-vivo screens using xenotransplantation of tumors into immunodeficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tentler et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, stem-cell based organoid technology was introduced to establish long-term cultures of both normal and tumor tissues from various organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sato et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartfeld et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karthaus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). The advantage of this technology is that it can capture the genetic diversity of both normal and tumor tissues. Indeed, for colorectal cancer (CRC) a genetically diverse Biobank of patient-derived CRC organoids was established and used to integrate genomic data and monotherapy drug responses at the level of individual patient-derived organoid lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van de Wetering et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We employed this biobank to further explore potential strategies to target mutant RAS, including the combination therapy of pan-HER and MEK inhibition, which is currently tested in clinical trials. We confirm the strong correlation between the presence of mutant RAS and resistance towards EGFR inhibition. Our data reinforce the notion that an oncogenic mutation in <italic>RAS</italic> is sufficient to confer this resistance independent of cellular status, whether it concerns normal or tumorigenic cells. Moreover, real-time imaging of the resistant drug response at the cellular level reveals predominant cell-cycle arrest in RAS mutant organoids, in contrast with the complete induction of cell death in CRC organoids with WT RAS. In vivo drug response of xenotransplanted RAS mutant CRC organoids confirmed the arrest in tumor growth upon dual inhibition of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway. Finally, efficient inhibition by dual targeting of the mutant RAS pathway strongly sensitizes for the induction of cell death, as illustrated by minimal addition of BCL inhibition. Our studies demonstrate the strong potential of patient-derived CRC organoid libraries in evaluating inhibitors and drug combinations in a preclinical setting.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Drug response of patient-derived CRC organoids with and without mutant KRAS</title><p>To explore drug responses of patient-derived CRC organoids towards combination therapies of targeted inhibitors of the EGFR-RAS-ERK pathway, we applied a drug sensitivity screen using EGFR-family and MEK inhibitors (EGFRi and MEKi resp.) either as mono or combination therapy on two cancer organoids from a previously established biobank of CRC organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van de Wetering et al., 2015</xref>). To start, we chose cancer organoids from the individuals P8 and P26, which share a similar composition of frequent cancer mutations such as functionally inactive <italic>APC</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic>.

We observed the expected sensitivity of P8T towards afatinib (irreversible EGFR/HER2 inhibitor) and insensitivity of KRAS mutant P26T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Selumetinib (MEKi) as a monotherapy showed little efficacy in both P8T and P26T, but combination therapy confirmed previous findings that MEKi sensitizes RAS mutant tumor cells to EGFR/HER2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sun et al., 2014</xref>).

We performed EGFR-RAS-ERK pathway inhibition with relatively high concentrations of afatinib (1 µM) in combination with selumetinib (1 µM). In P26T (mutant KRAS) we only observed cell cycle arrest with very limited cell death induction. This was in stark contrast with the very rapid induction of cell death in P8T (WT KRAS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). When we repeated these imaging experiments using much lower drug concentrations, we noticed a general shift to resistance for both organoid lines. Under these conditions, also P8T predominantly showed cell cycle arrest rather than cell death, and the cancer cells in P26T organoids even continued to proliferate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that 72 hr of combination treatment with afatinib and selumetinib (EGFRi/HER2i and MEKi) effectively kills KRAS WT P8T organoids, while the mutant KRAS P26T organoids are significantly less sensitive.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-18489-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18489.006</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Real-time imaging of cellular drug responses in tumor organoids using high concentrations targeted inhibitors.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18489.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18489.006</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-18489-media2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18489.007</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Real-time imaging of cellular drug responses in tumor organoids using low concentrations targeted inhibitors.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18489.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18489.007</ext-link></p></caption></media></p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>In vivo drug response of xenotranplanted patient-derived cancer organoids</title><p>In order to validate the observed drug response of in vitro cultured organoids in an in vivo model, we xenotransplanted P18T and P26T tumor organoids in immunodeficient mice. In line with a previous report where only engineered tumor progression organoids with increasing number of cancer mutations (APC, KRAS, P53 and/or SMAD4) showed efficient engraftment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drost et al., 2015</xref>), we only obtained reliable engraftment using P26T CRC organoids. We initially started using concentration schedules of afatinib and selumetinib that had previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sun et al., 2014</xref>), but we observed no significant effect of the drug combination on tumor growth over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To exclude that the tumors had acquired resistance during the in vivo drug treatment, we isolated the tumors to re-establish secondary organoids and subjected these to identical drug tests. Dose-response curves on these secondary organoids were identical to the parental organoid line P26T, independent of the type of drug treatment that the tumors underwent in the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, in agreement with lower drug concentrations that proved to be ineffective in blocking proliferation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), we speculate that the in vivo drug concentrations were insufficient to effectively block the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway. To confirm this hypothesis, we further increased the drug levels to high but tolerable doses. This indeed induced significant growth stabilization (but no regression) of P26T xenotransplanted tumor in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), in agreement with loss of proliferative activity as was also detected in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Notably, their combined administration is currently used in a clinical trial for patients with <italic>RAS</italic> mutant CRCs (NCT02450656). While the original P18T demonstrated high sensitivity to EGFR/HER2 inhibition by monotherapy, a single introduced oncogenic point mutation in <italic>KRAS</italic> provided resistance to EGFR/HER2 inhibition. Moreover, we analyzed combination effects using the Bliss independence model. Positive Bliss scores indicate combinatorial effects that exceed additive effects. The heat map of Bliss scores for P18T and P18T-KRAS shows that a large range of concentrations for both compounds show positive scores, but that presence of oncogenic KRAS renders the loss of viability and positive Bliss range towards higher drug concentrations indicating resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Next, we again studied the cellular drug response by real-time imaging. Reminiscent of the patient-derived CRC organoid with an endogenous <italic>RAS</italic> mutation (P26T), we noticed that the introduction of oncogenic KRAS renders a CRC organoid less sensitive to the afatinib/selumetinib combination therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). More specifically, quantifications of all mitotic and apoptotic events during the filmed drug response revealed both loss of proliferation and apoptosis induction in P18T, while P18T-KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> only showed reduced proliferation but unchanged apoptosis rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Despite the phenotypic difference in drug response, pERK levels in both tumor organoids were severely reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Since significant differential effects were observed between P18T and P18T-KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> during the matrix screen around 33 nM afatinib + 200 nM selumetinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), we repeated real-time imaging of drug response using these lower drug concentrations. As with P8T and P26T, we noticed a general shift from sensitivity towards resistance when drug concentrations were reduced. More specifically, the RAS WT cancer organoids showed cell cycle arrest rather than cell death, while the RAS mutant organoids appeared unaffected and sustained proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Differential drug sensitivity in CRC organoids with and without mutant RAS upon combination therapies that include EGFR inhibition</title><p>Considering the isogenic CRC organoids P18T and P18T-KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> as our gold standard to reveal the specific effects of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> on drug responses, we expanded our focus at targeting the linear EGFR-RAS-ERK pathway with the ultimate aim to find a targeted therapy that is specifically effective against RAS mutant CRCs.

We screened 10 additional patient-derived CRC organoids for combinatorial therapies against the EGFR-RAS-ERK signaling pathway. Since all the organoid lines are fully characterized in terms of genome information, we could select CRC organoids with and without a mutant RAS pathway. Based on EGFR/HER2 dual inhibition by afatinib, we could clearly discriminate the organoid panel in two types of responders, namely the sensitive versus the resistant ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, green versus red lines respectively). Indeed, drug sensitivity towards all tested EGFR inhibitors clearly correlated with the mutational status of <italic>KRAS.</italic> However, there were two notable exceptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In all seven independent CRC patients with a mutant RAS pathway, we observed synergistic activity when combining EGFRi and MEKi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sun et al., 2014</xref>) or EGFRi and ERKi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Nevertheless, RAS WT organoids, either of CRC or normal origin, reveal higher sensitivities to combination therapies that include EGFR inhibition than RAS mutant CRCs. In contrast, therapies that do not include EGFR inhibition, but target MEK (selumetinib) and ERK (SCH772984), were similarly effective in all organoid lines, regardless of the mutational status of the RAS pathway or cellular state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Another important observation after comparative analysis on this wide CRC panel concerns patient-to-patient variability in the response to anti-EGFR monotherapy, even within the RAS WT and mutant subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, upper left). Combining EGFRi with either MEK or ERKi results in a more consistent inhibitory effect over this set of CRCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lower panels), thereby not only improving individual responses but also augmenting success rates on a population scale. These findings are supportive to the previously published concept that proposes to combine EGFR with MEK inhibition directly at the start of therapy in patients with WT RAS tumors with the rationale of preventing sub-clones with acquired resistance to anti-EGFR monotherapy from reigniting tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Misale et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Therapy-surviving cancer cells quickly restart tumor growth after release from targeted inhibition</title><p>Besides the direct effects of therapeutic treatments on tumor mass, the ability of cancer cells to recover from the treatments and restart tumor growth is of utmost relevance.

Afatinib (EGFR/HER2i), either alone or in combination with selumetinib (MEKi), induced significant degrees of cell death, in line with our 72 hr monitoring of drug response. Similar effects were obtained by combined inhibition of MEK and ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, left panel). Additionally, this experiment shows that the described effects persisted for seven days after drug washout. As expected for P18T-KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>, suppressing EGFR/HER2 activity upstream of mutant KRAS using afatinib proved ineffective, while monotherapy of MEKi or ERKi inhibited proliferation only to a minor extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, right panel). Only the inhibitor combinations EGFRi/MEKi and MEKi/ERKi induced complete proliferative stagnation, albeit with minor induction of cell death. Importantly, independent of a therapeutic strategy, the CRC organoids quickly restored proliferative activity after drug release. Comparable results were obtained in CRC organoids P8T (KRAS WT) and KRAS mutant P26T, with the exception that cell death induction in P8T was less pronounced than in P18T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

As opposed to this, it has been reported that combined inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members and effectors of the RAS pathway can effectively induce cell death in KRAS mutant cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corcoran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hata et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tan et al., 2013</xref>). These results prompted clinical trials to evaluate combined targeting of MEK and BCL2/BCLXL in KRAS mutant solid tumors (NCT02079740). Unfortunately, clinical application of BCL2/BCLXL inhibitors is hindered by on-target toxicity of BCLXL inhibition in blood platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hata et al., 2015</xref>) and might therefore strongly benefit from strategies that allow minimized doses.</p><p>Here, we explored the use of navitoclax, a clinically tested BCL2/BCLXL inhibitor, in targeted therapies against RAS mutant CRC organoids. Indeed, straightforward ATP-based screening confirmed that navitoclax, when combined with afatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, left panel), selumetinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, middle panel), or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, right panel) is far more efficient in antagonizing tumor organoid growth than any of the related monotherapies. Importantly, regarding the dose-limiting effects of navitoclax, we show that robust dual inhibition of the EGFR-RAS-ERK pathway (1 µM afatinib/1 µM selumetinib) is exceptionally potent in sensitizing navitoclax-induced effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, right panel).

In contrast, the addition of low concentrations navitoclax to high concentrations of inhibitor combination afatinib/selumetinib potently induces cell death, as shown by the sustained inhibitory effects on culture growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, black bars).</p><p>In light of the dose-limiting toxicity of navitoclax in blood platelets, we performed full matrix-screens to explore optimal combinations of drug concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>).

Furthermore, venetoclax, a BCL2-specific inhibitor, is unable to reproduce the effects of navitoclax (BCL2/BCLXLi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), suggesting that in agreement with the reported findings in lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corcoran et al., 2013</xref>), it is BCLXL that protects against apoptosis upon targeted inhibition of a mutant RAS pathway in CRC organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Patient-derived CRC organoids were recently introduced as a model system in cancer research that is complementary to cell lines and PDX models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van de Wetering et al., 2015</xref>). We assembled a panel of normal and CRC organoids with either WT or mutant RAS that had been derived from different patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van de Wetering et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, we included normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drost et al., 2015</xref>) and tumor organoids in which the oncogenic G12D mutation was introduced in the endogenous <italic>KRAS</italic> locus by CRISPR-Cas9-induced homologous recombination. These engineered organoid lines, in combination with patient-derived CRC organoids of different genetic backgrounds, allowed us to study the effect of mutant KRAS on drug response to targeted inhibition of the EGFR-RAS-ERK pathway. Moreover, real-time imaging allows the monitoring of exact cellular fates in drug-challenged CRC organoids with spatial (3D) and temporal resolution.</p><p>Using this panel, we show that the presence of mutant RAS is sufficient to confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Moreover, we confirmed the synergistic effect of the clinically tested combination of pan-HER and MEK inhibition on mutant RAS organoids. However, we found that RAS mutant organoids remained largely resistant to apoptosis and became largely arrested in proliferation. Importantly, for KRAS mutant tumor organoid P26T we observed similar drug sensitivities in vitro as in vivo upon xenotransplantation. Moreover, similar growth arrested responses were reported in PDX mouse models of KRAS mutant CRC cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31"> Sun et al., 2014</xref>), underscoring the notion that tumor organoids are a reliable model system to test drug responses.</p><p>We report, for the first time, how normal tissue organoids respond to inhibitors targeting the EGFR-RAS-ERK pathway. Intriguingly, drug effects were almost identical in normal organoids and patient-derived CRC organoids when WT for RAS. This may imply that the sensitivity of RAS WT colon cancer for EGFRi is not an acquired oncogene-addiction, but merely represents the dependency of normal colon (stem) cells on EGFR signaling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wong et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, normal organoids from the human colon consist predominantly of proliferative stem and progenitor cells due to the WNT ligands in the culture medium. Therefore, the observed toxicity in the normal organoids may very well be most representative for direct effects on the stem cell compartments of the normal colon. Indeed, one of the direct side effects of anti-EGFR monotherapy is diarrhea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Miroddi et al., 2015</xref>). In analogy to drug responses with WT RAS, normal organoids harboring a CRISPR-introduced oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation showed resistance profiles towards targeted therapies that closely resemble those of RAS mutant CRC organoids, again underscoring the dominance of the RAS mutational status on drug response.</p><p>Anti-EGFR therapy in patients with KRAS WT colon tumors is standard of care, whereas patients with RAS mutant tumors are excluded. Our results confirm the drug sensitivity profile of colorectal cancers with and without mutant RAS, as has been established both in other model systems as well as in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karapetis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amado et al., 2008</xref>). For RAS mutant tumors, a number of different drugs and drug combinations have been tested, but thus far this has been without significant effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>). Our analyses confirm that drug treatments targeting the EGFR-RAS-ERK and the PI-3K/AKT cascades, including combinations thereof, are largely ineffective in RAS mutant CRC organoids.</p><p>In contrast, for CRC patients with RAS WT tumors combination therapies that target the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway may be an improved alternative over anti-EGFR monotherapy. First, we observed that this combination treatment induced cell death more systematically over a panel of individual patient-derived CRC organoids with WT RAS (i.e. with decreased variability) than monotherapy with a pan-HER inhibitor. Furthermore, combination treatments may decrease the potency of low-abundant RAS mutant subclones to initiate tumor-relapse during therapy against a predominantly KRAS WT tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Misale et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The combined inhibition of pan-HER and MEK is currently tested in patients with RAS mutant cancers in several clinical trials (e.g. NCT02450656, NCT02230553 and NCT02039336). Also in our hands, this combination showed a clear synergistic effect in suppressing growth of RAS mutant CRC organoids, as determined by a straightforward ATP-based assay. Importantly however, our data revealed that this inhibitor combination induced a cell cycle arrest in mutant RAS organoids but no cell death. As a result, the cells rapidly restored proliferative activity after withdrawal of these drugs. The inability to induce cell death likely affects the long-term effectiveness of this combination in CRC patients with mutant RAS.</p><p>An alternative combination that is currently in clinical trials is the combined inhibition of MEK and ERK (NCT02457793). The rationale behind this combination is the notion that resistance to targeted inhibition of RAF and MEK often involves reactivation of ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>), while suboptimal suppression of ERK activity in RAF mutant cancers may underlie the limited efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bollag et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corcoran et al., 2015</xref>). Although our RAS mutant CRC organoids showed sensitivity to dual inhibition of MEK and ERK, also this drug combination induced cell-cycle arrest rather than cell death, questioning whether it will be sufficient for the treatment of RAS mutant CRC.</p><p>With respect to clinical applications, we here report that effective inhibition of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway through combinatorial targeting does significantly prime the cytostatic RAS mutant cancer cells for apoptosis. This can be utilized by low concentrations of navitoclax, one of the most clinically advanced inhibitors of anti-apoptotic BCL family members. Minimizing navitoclax concentrations would be beneficial due to its on-target effects on BCLXL in circulating platelets, thereby causing thrombocytopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hata et al., 2015</xref>). However, triple combination therapy with low concentrations of navitoclax (50 mg/kg; five days on, two days off) proved to be too toxic for the mice (data not shown). Nevertheless, we consider the navitoclax-induced apoptosis as a proof-of-principle that EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway inhibition in combination with alternative signaling nodes holds great promise in identifying therapeutic drug combinations that kill RAS mutant tumor cells while being tolerated by the patient.</p><p>In summary, we show drug responses of a wide panel of patient-derived CRC organoids to multiple clinically advanced targeted inhibitors, either alone or in combinations, against the EGFR-RAS-ERK pathway. Importantly, the drug phenotypes that we observe in the organoids appear representative for previous reported responses in vivo. We believe that organoid collections will facilitate the identification and optimization of effective targeted therapies, since drug screens can be performed at a scale that is currently unprecedented when using resource-intensive PDX models. Due to the reliability and scalability of tumor organoids as a model system, we advocate that novel drugs should be tested on a panel of tumor organoids before their use in clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patient-derived organoid culture and maintenance</title><p>The patient-derived organoids used in this study were previously established and characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van de Wetering et al., 2015</xref>).

A custom-made ImageJ/Fiji macro (see source code files, ‘Macro Drug&amp;Release’) was developed to analyze 12–15 organoids per well/condition in a paired manner, i.e. individual organoids were tracked over the entire experiment (&gt;10 days). Per organoid, a pseudo-quantitative measure for absolute numbers of living and dead cells was established as follows: (1) Thresholding on H2B-Neon fluorescence to select H2B-positive pixels (total). (2) Marking of ‘dead’ pixels in each slice (initially automated, based on particle size and eventually manually by selection). (3) Dividing pixels in dead and alive (total minus dead). (4) Integrating the pixel areas representing alive and dead H2B, respectively, from the slices that make up for the lowest 50% of the organoid volume. This was done to avoid analysis on the upper 50% of the volume, which is inevitably of lower image quality.</p><p>The analysis was performed in 12 to 15 organoids per well/condition. No biological replicates.</p><p>Of note, this method is independent of non-permeable DNA dyes such as PI to avoid their potential long-term effect on organoid growth. In order to validate the current method, a single time point data set was acquired with the use of PI (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), validating the robustness of the strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Medium-throughput drug and release assay</title><p>For the analysis of organoid recovery after drug withdrawal, organoids were treated with the indicated drugs for 72 hr as described. Subsequently, drugs were washed out through aspiration of the drug-containing medium, followed by a washing step (10’ incubation at 37°C with basal DMEM/F12 (+++)). After washing, organoids were incubated with CRC-medium containing 2%BME for recovery. After 48 hr, the medium was replaced by CRC-2%BME combined with 10% AlamarBlue (AB) cell viability reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The increase of AB fluorescence (excitation 544 nm, emission 590 nm) was monitored over a time course of 2 hr (with measurements at 15’ intervals) at 37°C, using a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Fluorescence kinetics were plotted over time (as relative fluorescent units (RFU) per hour) to define the linear range of the assay. Cell viability was then defined as the maximum AB fluorescence (RFUmax, within the linear range of the assay), corrected for background fluorescence (RFU at time point 0). Viability data from drug treated organoids were normalized to vehicle (DMSO) treated controls. Upon the AB time course, organoids were washed two times with basal DMEM/F12 and incubated with CRC-2%BME for another 96 hr, after which the AB assay was repeated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantification in H2B-Neon-expressing organoids using proidium iodide</title><p>H2B-mNeon-expressing organoids were plated in 384-well plates and provided with drugs as described for the viability assay. To selectively stain dead cells, propidium iodide (PI) was added 2 hr before starting imaging (2 µM). 3D stacks of 150 μm (7,5 μm per plane) were acquired on a Leica SP8 scanning confocal microscope, using a 10x dry lens for large field-of-view (3000×3000 pixels). Being an endpoint assay, high laser intensities could be applied for optimal imaging quality (and hence analysis). Green (mNeon) and red (PI) signals were sequentially acquired to avoid spectral mixing. Signals were pooled for 15–20 organoids before ratio calculation, hence no error bars.</p><p>Custom-made software (ImageJ/Fiji, see source code files, 'Macro PI versus H2B') was designed to determine surfaces (i.e. numbers of pixels) representing H2B-mNeon and PI, respectively; the ratio of these surfaces (PI/H2B) is the quantitative measure for cell death in the drug-challenged organoids. Central to the unambiguous determination of these surfaces is setting of the threshold. Our algorithm initially measures surfaces and corresponding mean intensities with ramping threshold, and from these data mathematically derives the threshold-optimum by combining the highest mean signal and most confined surface area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quantification of mitotic and apoptotic events of live-cell imaging data</title><p>Depth-coded projection movies were analyzed for life and death in time: mitotic and apoptotic events were marked with help of custom-made ImageJ/Fiji macro (see source code files, ‘ScoreEvents’). Indicated events were automatically drawn in the movie (essential when aiming to mark all events) and data were automatically sorted into Excel-files containing a (chronologically sorted) list of events.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry</title><p>3 hr prior trypsinization (TriplE, 5 min at 37C) to a single cell, organoids were incubated with 500 nM EdU. Single cells were fixed with ethanol (5%). EdU click-it reaction was performed according to manufacturer's protocol. DNA was stained using 1 µg/ml DAPI. Cells were analysed using a FACSCanto II (BD).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Organoid xenograft experiments</title><p>Approval for this study was obtained by the local animal experimental committee at The Netherlands Cancer Institute (DEC-NKI; OZP = 12012 and WP5727 and WP5689). P26T patient-derived organoids were trypsinized and 200,000 cells were resuspended in 50 µl medium/Matrigel (BD Biosciences) mixture at a 1:1 ratio and injected subcutaneously into NSG mice (JAX stock no: 005557). Mice with established tumors (average volume of 300 mm<sup>3</sup>) were treated with afatinib (12.5 mg/kg; five days on, two days off), selumetinib (20 mg/kg; same schedule) or with a combination of both drugs for four weeks. After three weeks recovery from the drug treatment, mice were sacrificed.</p><p>For the second in vivo experiment, P26T organoids (~300.000 cells) were resuspended in 50% matrigel/medium with 10% collagen type I (BD Biosciences) and injected subcutaneously into NSG mice (JAX stock no: 005557). Mice with established tumors (average volume of 200 mm<sup>3</sup>) were treated with afatinib (20 mg/kg; five days on, two days off), selumetinib (25 mg/kg; same schedule) or with a combination of both drugs for four weeks.</p><p>Tumor volumes were evaluated three times per week by caliper and the approximate volume of the mass was calculated using the formula Dxd<sup>2</sup>/2, where D is the major tumor axis and d is the minor tumor axis. For in vivo dosing, afatinib was dissolved in 1.8% hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (Sigma), 5% of a 10% acetic acid stock and aqueous natrosol (0,5%). Selumetinib was resuspended in 0,5% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (Sigma) and 0.4% Tween-80 in distilled water. All agents were administered via oral gavage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The results presented are representative of three independent experiments run in triplicate, unless otherwise indicated.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Michael Yaffe (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper makes an important contribution to the emerging concept that CRC organoids are useful as a middle ground between 2-D cultures and mouse models. The authors use organoids with wildtype KRAS, organoids with mutant KRAS, and normal organoids engineered to express mutant KRAS, and find that KRAS mutational status determines the sensitivity to HER-RAS-ERK axis targeted therapies. While these observations had been previously described in vitro or in clinical trials, one new result is that MEKi/HERi or MEKi/ERKi combinations induce cell cycle arrest rather than cell death. Importantly, addition of BCLi during HERi/MEKi removal induces death. This could have clinical relevance given the platelet toxicity of BCLi. The paper demonstrates the potential of using patient-derived CRC organoids in testing and evaluating combinatorial drug responses.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that the strength of the paper lies in the extensive data validation and use of patient-derived (and engineered) organoids. The chance of artifacts has been reduced by the use of varied inhibitors against common targets and the different approaches to measure cell death. However, the use of organoids for drug screens is not new, CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of KRAS has been reported, and the efficacy of combinations of EGFRi and MEK/ERKi is well-established. Moreover, the reviewers were concerned that there is limited new biology or molecular mechanisms in the paper. For this reason, the reviewers are only willing to consider the paper for <italic>eLife</italic> if the new findings (of cell stasis rather than death following MEK/EGFRi and of the efficacy of BCLi) are better substantiated.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their findings and agree that the following points must be addressed in a revised submission:</p><p>1) Organoids do not completely reflect the biology of cancer in vivo. The response of CRC organoids to combination therapy should be confirmed in in vivo models such as mouse flank xenograft of kidney capsule (e.g., Fujii et al. 2016 Cell Stem Cell 18:827).</p><p>2) The argument that EGFRi/MEKi and MEKi/ERKi cause cell cycle arrest rather than senescence or death is based on H2B fluorescence and a limited set of other assays. This evidence needs to be bolstered by independent assays, such as caspase-3, annexin V, cell cycle (p21), checkpoint, proliferation and senescence markers. The authors could sort for dead cells and then separate arrested cells by DNA content and identify arrested cells.</p><p>In addition, the authors should consider the other, less major, comments that are listed below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Panel B. A color key should be provided to understand the colored organoids, in order to easily identify a given z-stack depth with a particular color.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, Panel B. The authors claim this full-matrix screen as good illustrator of synergy. Given that the heatmaps have been smoothened with walking (i.e. moving?) averages, it would be good to clarify better the concept.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, Panel C. It looks like the introduction of mutant KRAS in P18T has an effect in cell proliferation even in absence of treatment (organoid size at 65h is clearly smaller that P18T one), which is not commented in the text. Is the data normalized to the starting number of cells?</p><p>4) Also, the authors claim the cells stop proliferating, but no additional validation than cell size is used (i.e. checkpoint activation, p21 expression).</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The authors try to show that the response to targeted therapies is only dependent on KRAS status independently of cellular mutational status, as the results in normal organoids are comparable to cancer ones. I would be more cautious in this respect, as the culture of normal organoids requires high Wnt activity media, growth factors and inhibitors, which may not reflect the normal mucosa in the intestine. Additionally, I find kind of surprising that the introduction of an oncogenic KRAS does not result in oncogenic senescence in a normal organoid. It would be nice to see some organoid pictures in this set of experiments and/or a comparison of WT vs. KRAS-mutant organoids growth curves in absence or treatment.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5. I</xref> find this figure as the major strength of the work, as it validates the organoid lines screening as a real tool to assess drug/drug combination sensitivity. The data here shows a pretty wide range of sensitivities to afatinib alone for both the wt and mutant K-Ras organoids, as the authors note in the subsection “Therapy-surviving cancer cells quickly restart tumor growth after release of targeted inhibition”, second paragraph. Can the authors use the genotypic information they have on the organoids to elucidate any other contributors to the relative monotherapy resistance?</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The authors describe here a novel and smart strategy to track organoid viability in real-time cultures, and developed ImageJ macros to quantify the phenotypes, that might be really useful for other researchers performing 3D cultures (organoids, spheroids, etc.). Nevertheless, they should clarify in the figure legend that cell dead/alive status is identified by nuclear size (red colored nuclei may be associated to π staining, also described in the Methods section and used in following experiments in the manuscript). Also, given the novelty of the method, I would recommend further validation of nuclear size as a proxy of dead/alive status (co-stain with apoptotic markers and/or viability dyes).</p><p>8) The authors conclude that the inhibition of the EGFR/MEK/ERK axis induces mostly a cell cycle arrest that, in absence of drug, can be reverted and cells proliferate again. I would be more cautious in this affirmation, given the data presented. It is not clear from the data presented whether there is a global cell cycle stop (no assessment of G1/S checkpoint activation nor cell cycle progression markers) and the data does not rule out the possibility of a small population of pre-resistant cells within the organoid, which are then able to repopulate in absence of treatment.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, Panel B. – Please add a color code legend.</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, Panel A. I would suggest splitting this graph in at least three different ones, in order to better point out the synergy between targeted drugs and navitoclax. Panel B. PI final concentration is not provided in the methods section, which may impact the threshold applied for the analysis (i.e. π unspecific staining/background). Panel C. The authors claim they need a robust inhibition of both MEK and ERK in order to Navitoclax to be effective at low concentrations. It would be very helpful, to show some western blots of p-EGFR, p-ERK and downstream signaling to demonstrate such inhibition at 1uM of afatinib and selumetinib vs. lower concentrations of them (i.e. 0.065uM).</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> – what is the rectangle code for the inhibitors?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Targeting mutant RAS in patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids by combinatorial drug screening&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Ivan Dikic (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers are now very positive about the paper, but there are some remaining concerns. New experiments are not required, but you may have the data and could add them or discuss. Points 1-3 address whether growth rate differences between WT and mutant KRAS organoids might be detectable in low serum/glucose conditions and whether EGFRi and MEKi are really inhibiting as expected in vivo. Point 4 suggests adding in vivo histology to complement the in vitro histology of the organoids. Point 5 concerns whether the in vivo resistance is due to selection. Point 6 requests statistics for the growth curves and cell cycle and this point must be addressed. Point 7 suggests adding comments about Bcl2 vs. BclXL drugs.</p><p>1) The authors write that &quot;Upon addition of oncogenic KRAS, no overall differences in morphology or growth rates were observed.&quot; (Results). It has been established that Kras mutant cell lines exhibit greater proliferation than Kras wild-type cell lines in low serum or low glucose conditions, and that tumors in Kras genetically engineered mouse models also grow faster than Kras wild-type GEMMs (Yun et al. Glucose deprivation contributes to the development of KRAS pathway mutations in tumor cells Science 2009 and Martin et al. Development of a colon cancer GEMM-derived orthotopic transplant model for drug discovery and validation Clinical Cancer Research 2013). Therefore, it will be of interest to the readership if the authors could assess using CRISPR engineered and/or human CRC organoids how KRAS mutant vs. wild-type organoids grow in vitro under low serum or low glucose conditions, and/or in vivo upon transplantation.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>. The authors performed western blots on Kras mut and WT organoids in response to drug treatment, as requested. The lower P-ERK level in control KRAS MUT organoids vs. control WT organoids may an artifact of the media conditions. The authors should assess P-ERK and/or P-MEK in Low serum / low glucose conditions.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. Western blots for P-ERK and/or P-MEK should be provided for in vivo experiments to demonstrate that tumor growth / stasis is due to the mechanism of action of the drugs. This would easily address the authors' point that they &quot;speculate that the in vivo drug concentrations were insufficient to effectively block the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway&quot; for the low dose combination treatment.</p><p>4) Please provide in vivo histology of the tumors compared to the in vitro organoids, with or without drug treatment.</p><p>5) It would have been more interesting to me to see secondary in vitro passage of the residual in vivo tumors after HIGH dose treatment. This would answer the question of whether a therapeutically relevant drug dose reveals primary resistance or induces secondary resistance in the tumor organoid tissue.

The chance of artifacts has been reduced by the use of varied inhibitors against common targets and the different approaches to measure cell death. However, the use of organoids for drug screens is not new, CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of KRAS has been reported, and the efficacy of combinations of EGFRi and MEK/ERKi is well-established. Moreover, the reviewers were concerned that there is limited new biology or molecular mechanisms in the paper. For this reason, the reviewers are only willing to consider the paper for eLife if the new findings (of cell stasis rather than death following MEK/EGFRi and of the efficacy of BCLi) are better substantiated.</italic> </p><p><italic>The reviewers have discussed their findings and agree that the following points must be addressed in a revised submission:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Organoids do not completely reflect the biology of cancer in vivo. The response of CRC organoids to combination therapy should be confirmed in in vivo models such as mouse flank xenograft of kidney capsule (e.g., Fujii et al. 2016 Cell Stem Cell 18:827).</italic> </p><p>We addressed the in vivo drug response of colorectal cancer organoids (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">figure 2</xref>). Most notably, we have xenotransplanted KRAS mutant P26T whose in vivo drug responses phenocopy the ones we measured in vitro; i.e. upon medium dosage of EGFRi + MEKi there is limited effect, while at the highest dosage we observe stalling of tumor growth, indicating loss of proliferative activity. Moreover, the in vivo drug response (growth stabilization, but no regression) was similar to previous reports of drug response on PDX models of RAS mutant CRC (Sun et al., 2014). By our knowledge, this is the first report that compared drug response of tumor organoids between in vivo and in vitro culture conditions. We agree with the reviewers that this is a very important addition to the manuscript as it underscores the power of tumor organoid libraries to facilitate pre-screening of new drug candidates and drug combinations prior to resource-intensive mouse experiments and clinical trials.</p><p>We included the following addition to the Results section:</p><p><italic>“</italic>in vivodrug response of xenotranplanted patient-derived cancer organoids</p><p>In order to validate the observed drug response of in vitro cultured organoids in an in vivo model, we xenotransplanted P18T and P26T tumor organoids in immunodeficient mice. […] The fact that in vivo xenografted CRC organoids yields similar drug responses as in vitro organoid cultures and identical to previous reported drug response of KRAS mutant PDX models of CRC (Sun et al., 2014), validates the testing and evaluation of targeted inhibitors in CRC organoids.”</p><p>Currently, we are still optimizing reliable engraftment of P8T or P18T tumor organoids as positive controls for EGFRi therapies, in line with a previous publication regarding unsuccessful engraftments of tumor organoids with lower number of cancer mutations (Drost et al., 2015).</p><p>Moreover, we have performed in vivo drug responses using the addition of navitoclax (BCLi) to EGFRi/MEKi combination as well. As expected, low concentration navitoclax (50mg/kg) was well tolerated by the mice, but addition of low concentration of navitoclax to EGFRi/MEKi as a triple combination turned out to be too toxic for the mice in order to complete the experiments.</p><p>We discuss above-mentioned results in the manuscript:</p><p><italic>“</italic>With respect to clinical applications, we here report that effective inhibition of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway through combinatorial targeting does significantly prime the cytostatic RAS mutant cancer cells for apoptosis. […] Nevertheless, we consider the navitoclax-induced apoptosis as a proof-of-principle that EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway inhibition in combination with alternative signaling nodes holds great promise in identifying therapeutic drug combinations that kill RAS mutant tumor cells while being tolerated by the patient.”</p><p>Importantly, we re-established organoids from the different treated tumors in mice. Subsequent drug responses of these secondary post-xenograft organoids were unaltered in comparison with the parental tumor organoids that were xenotransplanted, suggesting that tumor phenotype regarding drug response remains constant independent of in vitro culture or upon xenotransplantation.</p><p>We included the following addition to the manuscript:</p><p>“To exclude that the tumors had acquired resistance during the in vivo drug treatment, we isolated the tumors to re-establish secondary organoids and subjected these to identical drug tests. […] Indeed, in agreement with lower drug concentrations that proved to be ineffective in blocking proliferation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), we speculate that the in vivo drug concentrations were insufficient to effectively block the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway.”</p><p><italic>2) The argument that EGFRi/MEKi and MEKi/ERKi cause cell cycle arrest rather than senescence or death is based on H2B fluorescence and a limited set of other assays. This evidence needs to be bolstered by independent assays, such as caspase-3, annexin V, cell cycle (p21), checkpoint, proliferation and senescence markers. The authors could sort for dead cells and then separate arrested cells by DNA content and identify arrested cells.</italic> </p><p>We strengthened our evidence that KRAS mutant tumor cells are blocked in cell cycle progression upon inhibition of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway. These data are now included as a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><p>First, we performed cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. Most notably, after 72hrs of drug treatment we observed that most cancer cells accumulate in G1 at the expense of tumor cells in S-phase. Indeed, this is in agreement with our live-cell imaging data of the drug response, where virtual no mitotic events were detected towards the end of the treatment.</p><p>We included the following addition to the manuscript:</p><p>“Dual inhibition of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway induces a G1 cell cycle arrest</p><p>To characterize the induced cell cycle arrest in RAS mutant tumor cells in more detail, we performed cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry using a 3hr EdU pulse in combination with DNA staining to discriminate between the different cell cycle phases (G1, S and G2 respectively) in P18T-KRASG12D and P26T. Indicative of a G1 arrest, we observed a sharp decline in the amount of RAS mutant tumor cells in S-phase using inhibitor combinations EGFRi/MEKi and MEKi/ERKi, while a similar fraction of cells accumulated in G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).”</p><p>Subsequently, using functional assays we addressed whether the vast majority of tumor cells re-obtained proliferative activity after drug withdrawal, in contrast to senescence or a minor subpopulation being responsible for tumor relapse. First, we performed EdU incorporations at various time points during the drug response and drug recovery. In agreement with the inhibition of cell cycle progression, there is hardly any EdU incorporation in the presence of the drugs (no cells in S-phase), while the vast majority of the tumor cells incorporated EdU during the first 3 days after drug withdrawal suggesting renewed proliferative activity in virtually all tumor cells.</p><p>Second, we performed real-time imaging of tumor organoids after drug withdrawal (drug recovery) and we quantified the number of mitotic and apoptotic events over time. Indeed, starting at ~20hrs after withdrawal of the drugs, we observed frequent mitotic events again.</p><p>We included the following addition to the manuscript:</p><p>“To further characterize drug-induced arrest, we investigated whether the regrowth after drugs washout involves all therapy-surviving tumor cells or only a minor subpopulation that fuels tumor relapse. For this, we performed two functional assays. […] Indeed, in line with a G1 arrest, we observed a delay of about 20-24hrs after withdrawal of the drugs (EGFRi/MEKi) before observing numerous mitotic events again in all regions of the arrested organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). (Similar results were obtained for MEKi/ERKi, data not shown).”</p><p><italic>In addition, the authors should consider the other, less major, comments that are listed below.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Panel B.

The authors claim this full-matrix screen as good illustrator of synergy. Given that the heatmaps have been smoothened with walking (i.e. moving?) averages, it would be good to clarify better the concept.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the referee that we should have better clarified the concept. To indicate for which concentration ratios the effects are larger than expected, we now provided heat maps with calculated ‘Bliss scores’ where positive scores indicate combinations where the effect is greater than additive.</p><p>We made the following addition to the manuscript and included an extra supplemental figure:</p><p>“Moreover, we analyzed combination effects using the Bliss independence model. Positive Bliss scores indicate combinatorial effects that exceed additive effects. The heat map of Bliss scores for P18T and P18T-KRAS show that a large range of concentrations for both compounds show positive scores, but that presence of oncogenic KRAS renders the loss of viability and positive Bliss range towards higher drug concentrations indicating resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, Panel C. It looks like the introduction of mutant KRAS in P18T has an effect in cell proliferation even in absence of treatment (organoid size at 65h is clearly smaller that P18T one), which is not commented in the text. Is the data normalized to the starting number of cells?</italic> </p><p>The depicted movie is just an example representing several organoids. In general, for all drug responses that were measured, either by ATP assays or by real-time imaging, the size and growth of organoids were synchronized by tripsinization 5 days prior drug response and size filtering just prior drug response. Although variability between individual organoids existed, overall no differences in growth speed were observed.</p><p>We made the following addition to the manuscript:</p><p>“Upon addition of oncogenic KRAS, no overall differences in morphology or growth rates were observed.”</p><p>Moreover, we quantified mitotic and apoptotic events during the 72hrs live-cell imaging of the drug response over multiple organoids and added panel D to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>:</p><p>“More specifically, quantifications of all mitotic and apoptotic events during the filmed drug response revealed both loss of proliferation and apoptosis induction in P18T, while P18T-KRASG12D only showed reduced proliferation but unchanged apoptotis rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).”</p><p><italic>4) Also, the authors claim the cells stop proliferating, but no additional validation than cell size is used (i.e. checkpoint activation, p21 expression).</italic> </p><p>We indeed claimed that cells stop proliferating, which we mainly based on the live-cell imaging data of various drug responses where only relatively few mitotic events were observed during the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> day of the drug response (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).</p><p>In short: We now substantiated the evidence that KRAS mutant cells loose proliferative activity upon combination therapy against the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway. Please see rebuttal regarding the second main point for comments and additions to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The authors try to show that the response to targeted therapies is only dependent on KRAS status independently of cellular mutational status, as the results in normal organoids are comparable to cancer ones. I would be more cautious in this respect, as the culture of normal organoids requires high Wnt activity media, growth factors and inhibitors, which may not reflect the normal mucosa in the intestine. Additionally, I find kind of surprising that the introduction of an oncogenic KRAS does not result in oncogenic senescence in a normal organoid. It would be nice to see some organoid pictures in this set of experiments and/or a comparison of WT vs. KRAS-mutant organoids growth curves in absence or treatment.</italic> </p><p>“This may imply that the sensitivity of RAS WT colon cancer for EGFRi is not an acquired oncogene-addiction, but merely represents the dependency of normal colon (stem) cells on EGFR signaling activity (Wong et al., 2012). Indeed, normal organoids from the human colon consist predominantly of proliferative stem and progenitor cells due to the WNT ligands in the culture medium. Therefore, the observed toxicity in the normal organoids may very well be most representative for direct effects on the stem cell compartments of the normal colon. Indeed, one of the direct side effects of anti-EGFR monotherapy is diarrhea (Miroddi et al., 2015).”</p><p><italic>Additionally, I find kind of surprising that the introduction of an oncogenic KRAS does not result in oncogenic senescence in a normal organoid. It would be nice to see some organoid pictures in this set of experiments and/or a comparison of WT vs. KRAS-mutant organoids growth curves in absence or treatment.</italic></p><p>In contrast to overexpression of oncogenic KRAS, activation of oncogenic KRAS from its endogenous locus in mouse colon does not lead to senescence (Snippert et al., EMBO rep 2014). In that respect, our organoid models where we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination to introduce oncogenic KRAS at its endogenous locus are in agreement with mouse studies.</p><p>In order to strengthen the manuscript regarding this point, we have now included an extra supplemental figure comparing morphology and cell cycle of normal organoids and normal organoid with KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>. Moreover, we have added the following statement in the manuscript:</p><p>“In analogy with mouse studies (Snippert et al., 2014), we observed no morphological alteration nor induction of senescence upon introduction of oncogenic KRAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5. I</xref> find this figure as the major strength of the work, as it validates the organoid lines screening as a real tool to assess drug/drug combination sensitivity. The data here shows a pretty wide range of sensitivities to afatinib alone for both the wt and mutant K-Ras organoids, as the authors note in the subsection “Therapy-surviving cancer cells quickly restart tumor growth after release of targeted inhibition”, second paragraph. Can the authors use the genotypic information they have on the organoids to elucidate any other contributors to the relative monotherapy resistance?</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting remark of the referee. As indicated, we have been able to use the genetic information of the organoids to understand the most dramatic ‘KRASwt’ outliers, i.e. resistant organoid lines P19T and P25T respectively. Both turned out to contain alternative well-known oncogenic mutations in the downstream EGFR signaling pathway, i.e. BRAF (V600E) and NRAS (Q61H). It will be much more challenging in order to find mutations that do not confer complete resistance such as oncogenic KRAS, NRAS or BRAF, but do contribute to such a phenotype. We therefore hesitate to speculate about possible resistance mechanisms imposed by low frequency cancer mutations due to the relative small sample size of organoids. Indeed, we do agree that mechanistic studies on these lower abundant mutation frequencies in relation to drug sensitivity are very interesting, but we consider it beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The authors describe here a novel and smart strategy to track organoid viability in real-time cultures, and developed ImageJ macros to quantify the phenotypes, that might be really useful for other researchers performing 3D cultures (organoids, spheroids, etc.). Nevertheless, they should clarify in the figure legend that cell dead/alive status is identified by nuclear size (red colored nuclei may be associated to PI staining, also described in the Methods section and used in following experiments in the manuscript).</italic> </p><p>We have now clearly indicated in the figure legend that cell dead/alive status is identified by nuclear size.</p><p>“Live nuclei and dead nuclear remnants were marked for each z-plane, as identified by nuclear size (3rd panel, see methods section), measured …”</p><p><italic>Also, given the novelty of the method, I would recommend further validation of nuclear size as a proxy of dead/alive status (co-stain with apoptotic markers and/or viability dyes).</italic> </p><p>Well taken. We have now analyzed a specially acquired training set to demonstrate the feasibility of our ImageJ scripts. We have now included this analysis as a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) to which we refer from the Methods section</p><p>“Of note, this method is independent of non-permeable DNA dyes such as PI to avoid their potential long-term effect on organoid growth.

I would be more cautious in this affirmation, given the data presented. It is not clear from the data presented whether there is a global cell cycle stop (no assessment of G1/S checkpoint activation nor cell cycle progression markers) and the data does not rule out the possibility of a small population of pre-resistant cells within the organoid, which are then able to repopulate in absence of treatment.</italic> </p><p>Most importantly, in order to discriminate between a small population of pre-resistant cells versus all cells that contribute to tumor growth in the absence of treatment, we have now assessed the loss and gain of proliferative activity using two functional assays.</p><p>First, we performed EdU incorporation at various time points during the recovery phase after the drug withdrawal.

New experiments are not required, but you may have the data and could add them or discuss. Points 1-3 address whether growth rate differences between WT and mutant KRAS organoids might be detectable in low serum/glucose conditions and whether EGFRi and MEKi are really inhibiting as expected in vivo. Point 4 suggests adding in vivo histology to complement the in vitro histology of the organoids. Point 5 concerns whether the in vivo resistance is due to selection. Point 6 requests statistics for the growth curves and cell cycle and this point must be addressed. Point 7 suggests adding comments about Bcl2 vs. BclXL drugs.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors write that &quot;Upon addition of oncogenic KRAS, no overall differences in morphology or growth rates were observed.&quot; (Results). It has been established that Kras mutant cell lines exhibit greater proliferation than Kras wild-type cell lines in low serum or low glucose conditions, and that tumors in Kras genetically engineered mouse models also grow faster than Kras wild-type GEMMs (Yun et al. Glucose deprivation contributes to the development of KRAS pathway mutations in tumor cells Science 2009 and Martin et al. Development of a colon cancer GEMM-derived orthotopic transplant model for drug discovery and validation Clinical Cancer Research 2013). Therefore, it will be of interest to the readership if the authors could assess using CRISPR engineered and/or human CRC organoids how KRAS mutant vs. wild-type organoids grow in vitro under low serum or low glucose conditions, and/or in vivo upon transplantation.</italic> </p><p>At the moment, we haven’t studied morphology and proliferation in alternative culture conditions. Organoid culture conditions are determined per tissue type and optimized for normal organoids that are derived from healthy tissue.

The authors performed western blots on Kras mut and WT organoids in response to drug treatment, as requested. The lower P-ERK level in control KRAS MUT organoids vs. control WT organoids may an artifact of the media conditions. The authors should assess P-ERK and/or P-MEK in Low serum / low glucose conditions.</italic> </p><p>We agree that it might be interesting to examine P-MEK and P-ERK levels under different conditions, but for this paper the in vitro conditions used for the screens are in our opinion the most appropriate (see also comments in 1).</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.
