Despite its success, the duration of response is often limited. For previous antiandrogens, one mechanism of resistance is mutation of the androgen receptor (AR). To prospectively identify AR mutations that might confer resistance to enzalutamide, we performed a reporter-based mutagenesis screen and identified a novel mutation, F876L, which converted enzalutamide into an AR agonist. Ectopic expression of AR F876L rescued the growth inhibition of enzalutamide treatment. Molecular dynamics simulations performed on antiandrogen–AR complexes suggested a mechanism by which the F876L substitution alleviates antagonism through repositioning of the coactivator recruiting helix 12. This model then provided the rationale for a focused chemical screen which, based on existing antiandrogen scaffolds, identified three novel compounds that effectively antagonized AR F876L (and AR WT) to suppress the growth of prostate cancer cells resistant to enzalutamide.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00499.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00499.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00499.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men, and the second most lethal. All stages of prostate cancer depend upon male sex hormones, also known as androgens, to grow because these hormones bind and activate androgen receptors. A class of drugs termed ‘antiandrogens’ can effectively treat prostate cancer because they bind to androgen receptors without activating them, thereby preventing androgens from binding. However, the efficacy of even highly potent antiandrogen drugs, such as enzalutamide is short-lived in many patients, and understanding the biological mechanisms that cause drug resistance is one of the major objectives in translational prostate cancer research.</p><p>Resistance can arise through mutations of the androgen receptor that result in the receptor being activated, rather than inhibited, by antiandrogen drugs. However, no such mutations are known yet for enzalutamide, and researchers are keen to understand whether they exist and, if so, to generate new drugs for prostate cancer that overcome them. To identify mutations that may lead to resistance, Balbas et al. designed a new screening method in human prostate cancer cells and showed that androgen receptors with a specific mutation (called F876L) can be activated by enzalutamide. More comprehensive biological studies showed that prostate cancer cells harboring the mutation continued to grow when treated with the drug. Balbas et al. also showed that this mutation can arise spontaneously in human prostate cancer cells treated long term with enzalutamide.</p><p>Balbas et al. reasoned that the mutation likely altered the way enzalutamide binds to the androgen receptor, and used computer-guided structural modeling of the complex formed by the receptor and the drug to investigate how this might occur. These studies indicated that the region of the androgen receptor containing the F876L mutation comes into direct contact with the drug, and provided a structural explanation for the loss of inhibition. Because these studies showed how enzalutamide might bind to the androgen receptor, they also suggested ways in which enzalutamide could be chemically modified to restore its inhibitory activity against the mutant receptor.</p><p>Balbas et al. then designed and synthesized a set of novel compounds, which the modeling data suggested could act as inhibitors of the mutant receptor. Several of these compounds inhibited the activity of both mutant and wild-type forms of the androgen receptor, and suppressed the growth of both enzalutamide-resistant and nonresistant prostate cancer cells.</p><p>The work of Balbas et al. outlines a general screening strategy for the discovery of clinically relevant mutations in cancer genes, and shows how in silico technologies can accelerate drug discovery in the absence of a crystal structure of a protein–drug complex. It also emphasizes how understanding the manner in which a drug binds its target can stimulate rational design of improved drug candidates.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00499.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00499.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>androgen receptor</kwd><kwd>drug resistance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA155169</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawyers</surname><given-names>Charles L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R25-CA096945</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA089489</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greene</surname><given-names>Geoffrey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Virginia and D.

In spite of these promising results, patient responses to enzalutamide are varied and often short lived. Reactivation of AR signaling has been implicated in resistance to previous antiandrogen therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Linja et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2004</xref>), and one well-documented mechanism of reactivation is point mutation in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergerat and Ceraline, 2009</xref>). Many of these mutations broaden ligand specificity, and some confer resistance by converting the AR antagonist into an agonist of the mutant receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Veldscholte et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haapala et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hara et al., 2003</xref>). Because previous work with targeted therapies that inhibit oncogenic kinases has shown that unbiased mutagenesis screens in preclinical models can identify a priori clinically relevant mutations that alter drug activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess et al., 2005</xref>), we designed a novel screening method to prospectively identify AR mutations that confer resistance to enzalutamide.</p><p>Mutagenesis screens to identify kinase inhibitor-resistant alleles of kinase targets such as BCR-ABL have relied upon cytokine-dependent test cells that become cytokine independent after introduction of the target kinase. Cells expressing drug-resistant kinase alleles selectively expand in the presence of drug, allowing rapid identification of mutations that confer drug resistance. There is no comparable strategy available for antiandrogens because introduction of AR does not confer a comparable growth advantage in AR-negative cells. We instead chose to identify and select cell populations with persistent AR transcriptional activity in the presence of enzalutamide. We reasoned that targeting the biological process of interest (transcriptional activation of a target gene), rather than a distal symptom of resistance to drug (i.e., persistent viability, elevated proliferation) might identify resistant clones more quickly. To this end, an AR-regulated EGFP reporter, with a probasin promoter and PSA enhancer elements driving EGFP expression (Pb.PSE.EGFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chapel-Fernandes et al., 2006</xref>), was used to screen for and enrich cell populations bearing biologically active mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00499.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mutagenesis screen for enzalutamide resistance identifies novel AR mutation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A cartoon of the AR mutagenesis screen developed to identify enzalutamide resistance mutations.

With starting ratios of 1:100 and 1:1000 cells overexpressing AR W741C to wild-type AR, respectively, we sorted cells with FACS that maintained EGFP expression after acute bicalutamide exposure. After four rounds of bicalutamide ‘selection’ and sorting, LNCaP cells expressing AR W741C dominated the final populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We next conducted the enzalutamide resistance screen with the Pb.PSE.EGFP reporter and a randomly mutagenized AR library. After five iterations of enzalutamide exposure and FACS sorting, we identified a population of cells with durable EGFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, enzalutamide promoted AR transcriptional activity in these cells, reflected by induction of EGFP expression compared to vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Analysis of endogenous AR target gene expression confirmed that enzalutamide behaved as an agonist in the enriched cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and siRNA knockdown of AR showed that these pharmacologically induced changes remained AR dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>).</p><p>To identify AR mutations in these cells, we amplified the exogenously expressed AR cDNA, and Sanger sequenced the PCR product. In two of three replicates, a single dominant point mutation emerged, resulting in the amino acid substitution F876L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, this mutation clearly enriched throughout the selection process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>To validate the results of the screen, an AR F876L vector was engineered and transduced into parental LNCaP cells expressing the Pb.PSE.EGFP reporter. Treatment of these cells with enzalutamide resulted in a dose-dependent induction of EGFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also introduced AR F876L cDNA into AR-negative CV1 cells along with an AR-dependent luciferase construct, and upon enzalutamide treatment, luciferase activity was induced ∼50-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results were comparable to those seen with the previously reported AR mutations T877A and W741C, which confer agonism to hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide, respectively. Moreover, enzalutamide treatment potently induced nuclear localization of AR F876L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed that enzalutamide recruited AR F876L to the enhancers of AR target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Consistent with these results, endogenous AR target gene expression was either no longer repressed by enzalutamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left) or strongly induced by enzalutamide in cells expressing AR F876L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right). A competition assay with 16β[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-5α-DHT (18F-FDHT), to measure relative AR binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tran et al., 2009</xref>), showed that enzalutamide binds with higher affinity to AR F876L than wild-type AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), similar to what has been shown for hydroxyflutamide and the AR T877A mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ozers et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, F876L similarly impacted the pharmacology of ARN-509 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clegg et al., 2012</xref>), a structurally discrete antiandrogen sharing the bisaryl-thiohydantoin core motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4 fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplements 4, 5</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00499.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>AR F876L mutation converts enzalutamide into an agonist and rescues enzalutamide-induced growth inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A representative FACS histogram shows the induction of AR-dependent EGFP expression by enzalutamide in LNCaP-Pb.PSE.EGFP cells ectopically expressing AR F876L. The magnitude of induction by enzalutamide (10 μM) is comparable to that conferred by the endogenous androgen DHT (1 nM). Enzalutamide treatment of LNCaP-Pb.PSE.EGFP cells ectopically expressing AR WT effectively suppressed EGFP expression. Geometric-mean fluorescence intensity for WT treated cells: vehicle (348), enzalutamide (66.4), DHT (1554); for F876L cells: vehicle (345), enzalutamide (1051), DHT (1699). (<bold>B</bold>) Cotransduction of CV1 cells with an AR-regulated firefly luciferase construct, a constitutive Renilla luciferase construct, and one of the indicated AR constructs, recapitulates the pharmacology observed in the EGFP reporter system. These cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO), antiandrogens (1 μM), or the synthetic androgen R1881 (1 nM). A dual luciferase assay was conducted on cell lysates, the firefly signal was normalized to the constitutive Renilla activity, and the data are reported as relative light units (RLUs). Notably, the bisaryl-thiohydantoin antiandrogens (enzalutamide and ARN-509) effectively induce AR F876L transcriptional activity, while structurally discrete antiandrogens (hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide) do not impact AR F876L activity in this assay. As expected, the transcriptional activity of AR W741C or AR T877A was induced by bicalutamide or hydroxyflutamide, respectively. (<bold>C</bold>) Quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction analysis of LNCaP/AR F876L cells shows that enzalutamide (1 μM) can induce the expression of canonical AR-regulated gene products (i.e., <italic>PSA</italic>, <italic>TMPRSS2</italic>, <italic>SGK1</italic>, and <italic>FKBP5</italic>).

(<bold>F</bold>) A time to progression study for mice bearing subcutaneous LNCaP/AR-WT (solid lines) or LNCaP/AR-F876L (dashed lines) xenografts further highlights the genotype-dependent pharmacology of enzalutamide. Inoculated animals were treated once daily through oral gavage with either vehicle or enzalutamide (30 mg/kg), and tumor size was monitored weekly (11–16 tumors per treatment group). While enzalutamide potently suppressed the growth of LNCaP/AR-WT tumors, LNCaP/AR-F876L tumors exposed to enzalutamide grew with kinetics roughly equivalent to either vehicle treatment arm.

A conservative F876Y substitution did not alter the pharmacology of either drug, but aliphatic substitutions structurally similar to F876L, such as F876I (also found in one xenograft with acquired resistance), conferred agonism to both enzalutamide and ARN-509 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>).</p><p>Notably, we observed that bicalutamide did not induce AR F876L transcriptional activity in our luciferase reporter assay, either at low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) or at high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>) concentrations, suggesting that it retains weak antagonist activity against this mutant. We conducted EGFP reporter assays to determine if AR F876L transcriptional activity is inhibited by bicalutamide, and found that while at low doses, it is an effective inhibitor of AR F876L, it loses potency at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>). We also observed only minimal growth inhibition in CWR22Pc cells expressing AR F876L with bicalutamide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A</xref>). These data, along with the knowledge that AR overexpression is a common resistance mechanism in patients with CRPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Linja et al., 2001</xref>) and confers partial agonism on bicalutamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2004</xref>), suggest that bicalutamide is not a viable treatment option for patients who fail on enzalutamide due to AR F876L mutation.</p><p>That F876L so dramatically impacted the pharmacology of enzalutamide and ARN-509 suggested that a clear structural change in the drug–receptor complex might be occurring. This consideration prompted us to investigate the structural basis of this antagonism-to-agonism conversion.

As seen in the MD simulations using the WT receptor with enzalutamide and ARN-509 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref> [in red], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), accommodation of the C-ring in this region is coupled to significant conformational rearrangements of residues on H11 and the H11–H12 connecting loop that prevents H12 from adopting the agonist conformation required for efficient coactivator recruitment. To investigate how the F876L mutation might alleviate antagonism, we performed similar MD simulations using the F876L receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref> [in cyan], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). For WT receptors in complex with enzalutamide and ARN-509, the average RMSDs to the crystal agonist conformation for the helix 11 terminus (residues 875–882) were measured at 2.24 and 1.94 Å, respectively, and those for the helix 12 terminus (residues 893–900) were 1.81 and 2.08 Å, respectively. For the F876L mutants, in comparison, the average RMSDs for helix 11 were somewhat lower at 1.01 and 1.70 Å for enzalutamide and ARN-509, respectively, and those for helix 12 went down to 1.37 Å for both ligands. The results demonstrate that despite inducing similar dislocations in the H11 pocket, the mutation allows the receptor to reposition H12 in a more agonist-like conformation that is compatible with coactivator recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). A close look in the H11 pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>) indicated the following: (1) F876 in AR WT likely interacts with the C-ring end of enzalutamide or ARN-509 through favorable pi stacking or van der Waals contacts, and (2) the loss of such favorable contacts upon F876L mutation concurrently affects the conformational choices of helices 11 and 12, which interact through both bonded and nonbonded forces. Importantly, these structural modeling results are consistent with the differential resistance profiles for enzalutamide and bicalutamide involving residues 741 and 876, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Another notable insight from these simulations was that the substituent on position 4 of the B-ring (i.e., the geminal [gem]-dimethyl group on enzalutamide, the spirocyclobutyl ring on ARN-509; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) was predicted to lie in close proximity to residues on H12 of the mutant receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Moreover, the steric girth of the substituent appeared to impact the positioning of H12, as the bulkier spirocyclobutyl moiety on ARN-509 elicited greater H12 displacements in AR WT than did enzalutamide's gem-dimethyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00499.022</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>A focused chemical screen identifies novel antagonists of AR F876L.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A tabular summary of the bioactivity of the novel antiandrogens in the LNCaP/AR/Pb.PSE.EGFP cell-based assay shows the importance of a carefully designed D-ring for competent inhibition of AR F876L.

We defined these ring extensions on the B-ring as the D-ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The merit of this approach was also supported by prior medicinal chemistry, which had shown that discrete bisaryl-thiohydantoin compounds bearing similar D-rings, were effective antagonists of AR WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jung et al., 2010</xref>). In this regard, we were optimistic that, minimally, the larger inhibitors we designed should be tolerated within the ligand-binding pocket.</p><p>Consistent with this precedent, the DR100-103 series inhibited the transcriptional activity of AR WT in the EGFP reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Whereas DR100-102 behaved as strong agonists for AR F876L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), (±)-DR103 potently inhibited the mutant receptor and antagonized DHT induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1 fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>). We also found that (±)-DR103 was a more potent inhibitor of AR F876L than AR WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), a phenomenon we are currently working to understand.</p><p>This striking structure–activity relationship prompted us to empirically investigate the significance of the position of the gem-dimethyl group on the D-ring of (±)-DR103. Remarkably, a compound with the gem-dimethyl group on position 4 (rather than 3/5) of the D-ring (DR104) was a modest agonist of AR F876L (albeit an antagonist of AR WT). Moreover, a compound with gem-dimethyl groups at the 3 and 5 positions of the D-ring (DR105) inhibited AR F876L (and AR WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), further underscoring the biological importance of the steric interactions brought about by these moieties in the context of the mutant receptor. Encouragingly, transplanting the D-ring from (±)-DR103 onto the ARN-509 scaffold ([±]-DR106) also resulted in AR F876L inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We interpret this result to be supportive of the model advanced by the previous MD simulations, as the F876L substitution appeared to impact the ability of enzalutamide and ARN-509 to induce H12 conformational choices in a roughly equivalent manner. Finally, to underscore the importance of the steric interactions conferred by the D-ring, we synthesized DR107, a compound built on the enzalutamide scaffold bearing only hydrogen atoms at position 4 on the B-ring. This molecule was an agonist both for AR WT and AR F876L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), pointing directly to the pharmacological significance of interactions between H12 and the substituent at the position 4 of the B-ring.</p><p>In line with this pharmacology, (±)-DR103 inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cell lines expressing both the WT and mutant receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). (±)-DR103 also inhibited endogenous AR signaling and induced PARP cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). DR101, a close structural analogue that behaved as an agonist for AR F876L, did not inhibit cell growth at equivalent doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Finally, the dose of (±)-DR103 required to observe antiproliferative effects (10 μM) did not impact the growth of DU145 (an AR-null human prostate cancer cell line), supporting the specificity of the antiandrogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>Structural modeling studies for (±)-DR103 reinforced our pharmacological model for AR antagonism by bisaryl-thiohydantoins. Unlike the results for enzalutamide and ARN-509, MD simulations using (<italic>S</italic>)-DR103 suggested that an agonist-like conformation of H12 cannot be achieved for either WT or mutant AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>). The modeling study instead showed that the D-ring on (<italic>S</italic>)-DR103 was capable of directly displacing the N-terminal residues of H12. A magnified view of the H12 pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>) shows that (<italic>S</italic>)-DR103 occupies a region in the H12 pocket that neither enzalutamide nor ARN-509 can access, thus imposing antagonist-like dislocation of helix 12. Whereas in the H11 pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>), (<italic>S</italic>)-DR103 did not show a significant difference in binding with residue L876 compared to either enzalutamide or ARN-509, which suggests that the restored antagonism was not achieved by simply regaining interactions at the mutation site in AR. Similar MD simulations for the complex of AR F876L and (<italic>R</italic>)-DR103 showed a slightly less pronounced H12 dislocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>), suggesting that the two enantiomers might cause different levels of antagonism.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>As is evident from previous work with ABL kinase inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukemia and antivirals for HIV and hepatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shah et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glickman and Sawyers, 2012</xref>), understanding mechanisms of drug resistance is a crucial first step in developing strategies to prevent or overcome it. With its recent approval, the case for defining mechanisms that overcome enzalutamide therapy is timely and compelling. Because AR mutations are a cause of clinical resistance to antiandrogens (flutamide and bicalutamide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Veldscholte et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haapala et al., 2001</xref>), and previous work has shown that clinically relevant mutations can be discovered from screening platforms in preclinical models, we prospectively searched for such mutations in the context of enzalutamide using a novel saturation mutagenesis approach. This screen revealed that mutation of Phe 876 to Leu converts enzalutamide and ARN-509 into AR agonists and confers resistance to drug-induced growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, this mutation was also recovered ‘spontaneously’ from enzalutamide-sensitive cell line and xenograft models treated with prolonged enzalutamide therapy.</p><p>That prostate cancer can spontaneously acquire gain-of-function mutations in AR (rather than acquiring mutations that simply preclude inhibitor binding) underscores the special challenge in pharmacologically overcoming this mechanism of resistance. By borrowing insight from studies of the progesterone receptor, showing that a single amino acid can determine sensitivity to RU486, and structural analyses of the estrogen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benhamou et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shiau et al., 1998</xref>), our attention was immediately directed to establishing and testing a structural model of the AR/enzalutamide complex to explain enzalutamide's curious pharmacology in the context of AR F876L. Using MD simulations, a novel binding mode for the drug was identified, which provided a compelling explanation for how antagonism is retained against the bicalutamide-resistant Trp 741 mutation. More importantly, the MD simulations argued that an altered spatial orientation of enzalutamide within the AR LBD might explain the onset of agonism, as the F876L mutation appeared to reposition the drug to eliminate steric clashes that promoted H12 dislocation in AR WT. Reassuringly, several larger compounds that the MD simulations predicted could restore H12 dislocation (the ‘D-ring’ series) effectively antagonized AR F876L.</p><p>Because the discovery of this mutation and its companion pharmacology provided the basis for our structural model, it is difficult to envision how the importance of the D-ring might have otherwise emerged from previous (and ongoing) chemical screening efforts. Among the ∼100 bisaryl-thiohydantoins published to date, several compounds bearing structurally similar moieties to our bioactive series were essentially indistinguishable from enzalutamide, ARN-509, or other leading agents in conventional cell-based assays. Our own focused chemical screen further speaks to the unusually complicated pharmacobiology of AR F876L, as subtle changes in the position of geminal dimethyl moieties on DR103-5 radically impacted the respective bioactivity of the drugs.</p><p>Our success predicting the pharmacology of candidate inhibitors with MD simulations argues for a novel workflow by which in silico screening could guide future antiandrogen drug discovery (pending a cocrystal structure of an AR/antagonist complex). The data indicating that ∼50% of patients fail to respond to enzalutamide has somewhat overshadowed the importance of the discovery of the bisaryl-thiohydantoin chemotype for AR, and the ongoing enthusiasm for developing better drugs based on this motif is most visibly reflected by the clinical trial with ARN-509. In this regard, our structural model provides a powerful tool to further refine the chemotype into drug candidates with improved properties.</p><p>Collectively, these findings demonstrate the importance of coordinated mutagenesis, structural modeling, and medicinal chemistry studies in designing drugs against an important cancer target for which appropriate drug affinity and binding conformation are mutually indispensible for competent inhibition. We are optimistic that discovery of the AR F876L mutation will facilitate solution of the enzalutamide/AR complex by X-ray crystallography. As for the potential clinical impact of a priori discovery of drug–resistance mutations to novel cancer drugs, our previous experience with the ABL kinase inhibitor dasatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia serves as an example. Within 2 years of reporting dasatinib-resistant mutations in BCR-ABL in a preclinical model, analogous mutations were recovered from dasatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shah et al., 2007</xref>). We hope that this report will guide a similar search for AR mutations in prostate cancer patients who develop clinical resistance to enzalutamide. Routine rebiopsy of tumor tissue in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer is challenging due to the high frequency of osteoblastic bone lesions consisting primarily of stromal tissue. Blood-based assays for AR mutation detection may be a compelling alternative, based on recent success in detection of tumor-specific mutations in circulating plasma DNA from patients with other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diehl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leary et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials and cell lines</title><p>Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and charcoal-stripped dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (CSS) were purchased from Omega Scientific (Tarzana, CA).

We then designed and optimized quantitative PCR primers across these mutation sites, so that they specifically amplified AR W741C. We overexpressed AR WT or AR W741C in our LNCaP-Pb.PSE.EGFP reporter cells, mixed different ratios of cells expressing either WT or W471C, treated these cells with 1 µM bicalutamide for 4 days, and FACS-sorted the cells that maintained/induced EGFP expression. Gates for EGFP positivity were set using WT or W741C expressing cells treated with bicalutamide.

Therefore, three-dimensional structures of antiandrogens were first built using the computer program Gaussview (version 4.1.2; part of the computer program Gaussian 03) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frisch et al., 2004</xref>) and then geometrically optimized in a quantum mechanical force field at the level of restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) 6-31g* using the program Gaussian 03. The partial atomic charges were derived from the optimized structures by Restrained ElectroStatic Potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayly et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cornell et al., 1993</xref>) (RESP) fitting to the RHF/6-31g* potentials. The other parameters modeling the antiandrogens were taken from the CHARMm22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Momany and Rone, 1992</xref>) force field after assigning CHARMm22 atom types to antiandrogens with an in-house program.</p><p>The initial AR–antiandrogen complex structures were then modeled with the molecular modeling program CHARMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2009</xref>). Starting with the atomic coordinates of AR WT and the A-ring of S1 in the template crystal structure (PDB accession code, 2AXA), the side chain of residue F876 was replaced with CHARMm22-parameterized side chain of a leucine when needed and the CH group on the A-ring was replaced with a nitrogen in cases of ARN-509. The rest of each antiandrogen was ‘grown’ from the A-ring using the ideal unbound structures solved by geometry optimization. Missing side chain atoms were built using standard CHARMm22 parameters and hydrogen atoms were added with the HBUILD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunger and Karplus, 1998</xref>) module of CHARMM. All these newly introduced atoms without three-dimensional crystal coordinates treated flexible and the rest under harmonic constraints with the force constant of 100 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup>, each AR–antiandrogen complex structure was energetically minimized with one round of 100-step steepest decent followed by two rounds of 100-step Adopted-Basis Newton–Raphson (ABNR) energy minimization. Harmonic constraints were reset at the beginning of each round of minimization. No nonbonded cutoff was used. Solvent effects were implicitly modeled in this stage with a distance-dependent dielectric constant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>The all-atom MD simulations were performed with explicit solvent atoms using the program CHARMM (version 36a1). Each initial AR–antiandrogen model was first centered and overlaid with a rhombic dodecahedron-shaped water box (edge length being 88 Å) of approximately 47,000 equilibrated water molecules. Any water molecule whose oxygen atom was within 2.8 Å away from any non-hydrogen atom of AR or antiandrogen was removed. Proper amount of sodium and chloride ions were automatically added to achieve overall charge neutrality and physiological level of ion concentration (0.145 M). Their positions were optimized with 10 independent trajectories of randomly replacing water molecules and performing 50 steps of steepest decent and 125 steps of ABNR energy minimization.</p><p>The molecular system including AR, antiandrogen, water, and ions was heated to 300 K and equilibrated with two rounds of 0.1-ns MD simulations under successively weaker harmonic constraints on AR or antiandrogen atoms. After the MD equilibration, three sets of random velocities were assigned to initiate three independent 10-ns MD productions. The MD equilibration and production were performed using the crystal form of rhombic dodecahedron (RHDO) and the canonical ensemble (NVT). A nonbonded cutoff of 14 Å, periodic boundary conditions in conjunction with Ewald summation method, the leapfrog Verlet integrator, and the Hoover thermostat for pressure and temperature were used. The timestep was set at 2 fs. Parallel jobs for MD simulations were run on a computer cluster of Intel Xeon X5650 series (2.66 GHz and 4 GB memory per CPU).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Molecular visualization</title><p>Structural models were visualized in a molecular graphics program, UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and one of whom, John Katzenellenbogen, wants to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript describes the structural and molecular mechanism of AR resistance to enzalutamide, a second generation of anti-androgen used for treating castration resistant prostate cancer. The authors discovered that AR mutation in F876 results in converting enzalutamide from an AR antagonist to an AR activator. Using structural modeling and simulation, the authors design a series of compounds, some of which show inhibitory activity against the mutated form of AR, and could have potential as new anti-androgen drugs.</p><p>All three reviewers found the manuscript to be of high interest and importance. One reviewer stated, “Overall, the data is convincing and comprehensive, and is of high quality. The results presented here are important and have clinical implications as enzalutamide has been recently approved by FDA for treating hormone resistant prostate cancer.” A second reviewer stated, “This is a study of remarkable interest and impact, both from a conceptual, mechanistic, and potentially clinical point of view. It is well conceived, well organized, well presented, and well documented.”</p><p>1) From a biological standpoint, the only significant experiment considered to be missing was a test of one of the novel antagonists for suppression of tumorigenicity of the F867L prostate cancer cell lines in the xenograft model. This experiment would complete the thought that the rational drug design process ends with the predicted anti-tumor effect in vivo. After deliberation, this experiment was considered not necessary for publication given the overall depth of the studies, but it would further strengthen the manuscript if available.</p><p>2) All three reviewers thought that despite the nice rendering of AR-ligand structures after MD simulations, it is not clear exactly in what way the F876L change results in altered interaction with the ENZ and ARN ligands, and where on the ligand the contact is occurring. A figure illustrating an enlargement of this region would add to the paper and perhaps enable a cogent discussion of the specific contacts the enables antagonism to is restored by altering the ligand structure.</p><p>3) The paper would be strengthened by evidence that the F876L mutation does indeed occur in PCa patients undergoing ENZ therapy, and, although it may be too soon for ENZ-resistant patients to have emerged, it would be worth discussing this as a future direction, because these patients would obviously be candidates for treatment with the second-generation drug reported in this paper.</p><p>4) In Figure 3, the distance of residues 876 to the bound enzalutamide need to be carefully measured and illustrated in both WT and mutated receptors. The implication of this distance needs to be discussed within the contact of receptor-ligand interactions.</p><p>5) Again in Figure 4, panel A, the distance of residues 876 to the bound compounds needs to be carefully measured and illustrated in both WT and mutated receptors. The implication of this distance needs to be discussed within the context of receptor-ligand interactions.</p><p>6) Results section: there is often interplay between the degree of antagonism and affinity/potency, with introduction of larger substituents engendering greater antagonism, but in most cases also lowering potency. It looks like the two new antagonists are equipotent with their ENZ and ARN parents, but this should be stated more clearly. Also, it would be reassuring and potentially interesting to have binding affinity measurements of the parent compounds, the new antagonists on both WT and F876L AR.</p><p>7) In considering the value of this work as a framework for future studies, it would be useful to know what other AR mutations, if any, were identified in the drug resistant tumors listed in Table 1. Why not just sequence drug resistant tumors rather than go through the mutagenesis step. If other mutations were identified, are they also sensitive to the novel antagonists? Some additional consideration of this point is needed.</p><p>8) Bicalutamide appears to be an antagonist on F876L AR in some Figures (such as Figure 2B) but an agonist in others. This should be commented upon.</p><p>Additional comment</p><p>9) It would be of interest to separate the enantiomers of the two new antagonists, DR103 and 106. They likely have different potencies and efficacies, and if one is more potent and more agonistic than the other, it might limit the activity measured for the racemic. The authors may wish to comment on this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00499.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) From a biological standpoint, the only significant experiment considered to be missing was a test of one of the novel antagonists for suppression of tumorigenicity of the F867L prostate cancer cell lines in the xenograft model.

We have included additional figure panels (new figures: Figure 3–figure supplement 2, and Figure 4–figure supplement 8) and discussion of specific AR-ligand contacts in the results to further clarify the possible mechanisms underlying the antagonism-to-agonism switch for ENZ and ARN, and the restored antagonism for newly developed ligands.</p><p><italic>3) The paper would be strengthened by evidence that the F876L mutation does indeed occur in PCa patients undergoing ENZ therapy, and, although it may be too soon for ENZ-resistant patients to have emerged, it would be worth discussing this as a future direction, because these patients would obviously be candidates for treatment with the second generation drug reported in this paper</italic>.</p><p>We agree that our paper would be strengthened by clinical evidence of the mutation and we are working hard to obtain relevant clinical material. This is challenging for two reasons:</p><p>First, enzalutamide was FDA approved only five months ago, so very few patients have been treated outside the original clinical trials, and, for the most part, trial investigators did not obtain tumor tissue or plasma.</p><p>Second, CRPC presents unique clinical challenges in obtaining tumor tissue that have led us to focus on developing blood-based assays to detect AR mutations (CTCs and ctDNA). We are actively pursuing these studies with collaborators.</p><p>We have updated the text to discuss this future direction.</p><p><italic>4) In Figure 3, the distance of residues 876 to the bound enzalutamide need to be carefully measured and illustrated in both WT and mutated receptors. The implication of this distance needs to be discussed within the contact of receptor-ligand interactions</italic>.</p><p>We have included the measurements requested (new figure: Figure 3–figure supplement 2), and we have added discussion of these data within the text.</p><p>We have indicated the distances between residues 876 on AR WT or AR F876L to the bound enzalutamide and ARN-509. The C rings are in close proximity (less than 4 Å) to position 876. Moreover, F876 (WT) was slightly closer to the C rings than L876, and clearly formed more pairwise atomic contacts with the C rings. We have added to the Discussion as described above. Meanwhile, we avoid over-interpreting the exact values of these distances, as positions of C rings in simulated structures were seen to vary even though they remained approximately at the same spot near residues 876.</p><p><italic>5) Again in Figure 4, panel A, the distance of residues 876 to the bound compounds needs to be carefully measured and illustrated in both WT and mutated receptors. The implication of this distance needs to be discussed within the context of receptor-ligand interactions. We have included the measurements requested (new figure: Figure 4–figure supplement 8), and we have added discussion of these data within the text</italic>.</p><p>We have indicated the distances between residues 876 on AR WT or AR F876L to the bound DR103. We emphasize here that the restored antagonism was not due to recovering receptor–ligand interactions at the mutation site (residue 876 on helix 11) but rather pushing helix 12 to adopt an antagonist-like conformation as our design rationale, the D-ring hypothesis, intended. The newly added inset also indicated that there is no proof of receptor–ligand interactions at the mutation site being recovered, which might be the only implication these distances provided. For the reasons above, we chose to not discuss these distances further.</p><p><italic>6) Results section: there is often interplay between the degree of antagonism and affinity/potency, with introduction of larger substituents engendering greater antagonism, but in most cases also lowering potency. It looks like the two new antagonists are equipotent with their ENZ and ARN parents, but this should be stated more clearly. Also, it would be reassuring and potentially interesting to have binding affinity measurements of the parent compounds, the new antagonists on both WT and F876L AR</italic>.</p><p>This is an important point that we have investigated with additional experiments. Under conditions of relatively low androgen concentrations (10% FBS), DR103 is equipotent to enzalutamide and ARN-509. However, as predicted by the reviewers, DR103 is less potent against WT AR under conditions of high androgen concentration as measured by reporter assays (new figure: Figure 4–figure supplement 3). As for binding affinity, we have included a competitive binding experiment with radiolabeled DHT in cells expressing the WT or mutant receptor, showing increased affinity of enzalutamide for F876L (comparable to DHT affinity), consistent with conversion to agonism (new figure: Figure 2– figure supplement 3).</p><p><italic>7) In considering the value of this work as a framework for future studies, it would be useful to know what other AR mutations, if any, were identified in the drug resistant tumors listed in Table 1. Why not just sequence drug resistant tumors rather than go through the mutagenesis step. If other mutations were identified, are they also sensitive to the novel antagonists? Some additional consideration of this point is needed</italic>.</p><p>We chose the mutagenesis screen strategy based on our prior success with kinase inhibitor mutagenesis screens (imatinib, dasatinib) and the speed with which mutations can be recovered relative to waiting for outgrowth of drug-resistant xenografts. We also believe this could be a general methodology for other NHRs.</p><p>Although we cannot say that we screened to saturation, F876L is the only mutation we recovered and we recovered it multiple times. A few additional AR mutations emerged in the drug resistant xenograft tumors, but F876L was one of only 2 mutations that occurred in multiple tumors, and the only mutation that arose in both the LNCaP/AR xenograft and CWR22Pc systems. The second mutation (isolated multiple times in the xenograft model) has been reported in association with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and is therefore predicted to yield a functionally impaired AR. We are in the process of characterizing this one further.</p><p><italic>8) Bicalutamide appears to be an antagonist on F876L AR in some Figures (such as Figure 2B) but an agonist in others. This should be commented upon</italic>.</p><p>As noted by the reviewers, the pharmacology of bicalutamide against the mutant varies depending on the context. For example, bicalutamide is clearly not an agonist for F876L under the androgen-deprived conditions in which enzalutamide is. However, in the presence of androgen, bicalutamide at low concentrations has modest antagonist activity (as measured by our GFP reporter) that is lost at higher concentrations, presumably due to the well-documented agonism of bicalutamide against WT AR when expressed at high levels. Finally, bicalutamide has minimal antagonist activity against mutant-expressing cells in growth assays. These data are now added in a new figure (Figure 2–figure supplement 8) and in a new paragraph in the Results. Our conclusion from all of this is that bicalutamide is highly unlikely to provide a clinical solution to the F876L mutant; hence, the rationale for DR103.</p><p><italic>Additional comment</italic>:</p><p><italic>9) It would be of interest to separate the enantiomers of the two new antagonists, DR103 and 106. They likely have different potencies and efficacies, and if one is more potent and more agonistic than the other, it might limit the activity measured for the racemic. The authors may wish to comment on this</italic>.</p><p>This is an important point with clear implications for future drug design, as suggested by the modeling reported in this paper. While work has begun to address this issue by chromatographically separating the enantiomers, we are not in a position to include pharmacological data associated with the enantiomers until their absolute conformation has been defined. We are actively working to crystallize the compounds to define the (S) and (R) enantiomers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
