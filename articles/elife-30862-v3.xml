(PPARs). Analysis from TCGA raised the possibility that hyperactive PPAR signaling, either due to PPAR gamma gene amplification or RXRA hot-spot mutation (S427F/Y) drives 20–25% of human bladder cancers. Here, we characterize mutant RXRA, demonstrating it induces enhancer/promoter activity in the context of RXRA/PPAR heterodimers in human bladder cancer cells. Structure-function studies indicate that the RXRA substitution allosterically regulates the PPAR AF2 domain via an aromatic interaction with the terminal tyrosine found in PPARs. In mouse urothelial organoids, PPAR agonism is sufficient to drive growth-factor-independent growth in the context of concurrent tumor suppressor loss. Similarly, mutant RXRA stimulates growth-factor-independent growth of <italic>Trp53/Kdm6a</italic> null bladder organoids. Mutant RXRA-driven growth of urothelium is reversible by PPAR inhibition, supporting PPARs as targetable drivers of bladder cancer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30862.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bladder cancer is the sixth most common type of cancer in the United States. At the moment, treatment options for advanced bladder cancer are limited to chemotherapy and immunotherapy, both of which benefit only some patients. Many other types of cancer can be treated with drugs that are specific to genetic mutations found in those cancer cells, often making the treatments more efficient with fewer side effects.</p><p>Between 5–8% of people with bladder cancer have a mutation in the gene that produces a protein called RXRA. This protein partners with itself or with other proteins to control gene activity. However, it was not clear what mutant RXRA proteins do in bladder cancer cells.</p><p>Halstead et al. studied the RXRA mutation in human bladder cancer cells and “mini-bladders” grown in the laboratory from mouse bladder cells. Biochemical experiments showed that the mutant RXRA protein causes abnormally high activity in one group of its partner proteins, called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). The PPARs, in turn, switch on genes that help cancer cells to grow and multiply. Computational simulations of the mutant RXRA binding to PPARs revealed, at a molecular level, how this activation occurs. Lastly, Halstead et al. used chemicals that block the activity of PPARs to stop the growth of cells in the mouse mini-bladders that contained the RXRA mutation.</p><p>These findings suggest that bladder cancer patients with the RXRA mutation may benefit from therapies that inhibit PPARs. Such therapies could also benefit the approximately 15–20% of people with bladder cancer who do not have the RXRA mutation but who do have over-active PPARs. Although there are chemicals that block the activity of PPARs, more research is needed to refine them before they can be used to treat cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bladder cancer</kwd><kwd>RXRA</kwd><kwd>PPARG</kwd><kwd>PPARD</kwd><kwd>KDM6A</kwd><kwd>TP53</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Clinical Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arora</surname><given-names>Vivek K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002002</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arora</surname><given-names>Vivek K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 CA113275</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Halstead</surname><given-names>Angela M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1TR000448</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arora</surname><given-names>Vivek K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA91842</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schriefer</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54DK104279</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kapadia</surname><given-names>Chiraag D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bladder-cancer-associated RXRA mutations were found to stimulate urothelial proliferation through a mechanism susceptible to small molecule inhibitors of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors, credentialing a new class of targetable drivers of bladder cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the US and is predicted to cause ~17,000 deaths in 2017 [The website of the National Cancer Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancer.gov">https://www.cancer.gov</ext-link>)]. In contrast to other common malignancies, bladder cancer management has not yet benefited from molecularly targeted therapies. Early phase clinical data with agents targeting FGFR3 or ERBB family members have shown encouraging activity in the minority of patients with oncogenic versions of these kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nogova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choudhury et al., 2016</xref>), but identification of new targetable genomic drivers is needed to expand the armamentarium. Nuclear receptors are amongst the most successful therapeutic targets in oncology, with small molecule inhibitors of estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) improving survival in breast and prostate cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisher et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beer et al., 2014</xref>). The established ability to modulate nuclear receptors with drugs makes them an attractive class of targets for other cancer types when there is compelling evidence supporting their role as tumor drivers.</p><p>RXRA is a nuclear receptor that regulates transcription as a homodimer or as an obligate heterodimerization partner for 14 other nuclear receptors, including the three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors PPARA, PPARD, and PPARG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evans and Mangelsdorf, 2014</xref>). Exome analysis of bladder cancer samples across three independent cohorts identified mutations at RXRA S427 in 5–8% of cases, always leading to an amino acid substitution with an aromatic amino acid, phenylalanine (~5%) or tyrosine (~1%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Van Allen et al., 2014</xref>). Reported analysis from TCGA found evidence of up-regulated PPAR pathway activity in RXRA hot-spot mutant cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</xref>). Copy number analysis identified PPARG as amplified in 17% of bladder cancer cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</xref>), with PPARG amplified cases being highly enriched for PPARG mRNA expression (q value = 2.6 × 10-9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cerami et al., 2012</xref>). These data raised the possibility that hyperactive PPAR signaling, either due to gene-amplification-driven hyper-expression or RXRA hot-spot mutation may drive 20–25% of bladder cancers. Here, we characterize structural and biological consequences of the RXRA hot-spot mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutant RXRA induces PPAR transcriptional signaling at the canonical DR1 motif</title><p>To establish a causal role of RXRA hot-spot mutations in hyper-activation of PPAR singling, we used retroviral transduction to introduce wild-type or mutant RXRA into two bladder cancer cell lines, JMSU-1 and 575A. Equivalent RXRA expression levels were confirmed by qPCR and western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). RNA-seq was used to compare transcriptomes in the wild-type and S427F RXRA expressing cells. Gene transcripts robustly up-regulated by the mutation (twofold, FDR &lt;0.05) were analyzed using over-representation analysis (ORA) to identify enriched pathways. In both cell lines, the PPAR signaling pathway (KEGG-hsa03320) was the top scoring hit. When the ORA was limited to genes up-regulated by the mutation in both cell lines, again PPAR signaling was the top hit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We also compared transcriptome changes induced by the RXRA mutation to those induced after treating RXRA<sup>wt</sup> expressing cells with the PPARG agonist pioglitazone.

Specific partner-pairs preferentially bind to direct repeats (DR) with defined spacer lengths. RXR homodimers and RXR/PPAR heterodimers both show preference for DRs with a single nucleotide spacer (DR1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evans and Mangelsdorf, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nielsen et al., 2008</xref>). Using ChIP-seq data for RXRA and acetylated H3K27 (H3K27ac), we identified all active enhancer/promoters bound by RXRA<sup>wt</sup> and/or RXRA<sup>S427F</sup> in JMSU-1 (‘<underline>R</underline>XR-bound <underline>A</underline>ctive <underline>E</underline>nhancer/promoters’ or RAEs). Differential mean peak height of the H3K27ac signal was used as an indicator of relative activation status in the wild-type and mutant condition at each RAE. ~12% of RAEs showed significant up-regulation in the mutant condition (FDR &lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). HOMER motif finding was then performed to identify motifs enriched at these hyper-activated RAEs, relative to the background of all RAEs. Consistent with activation of PPAR pathway genes, the canonical RXR/PPAR (DR1) motif was the only known motif found to be enriched with significant q-value. The most statistically robust motif identified by de novo discovery is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. Comparing the de novo identified motif to known motifs found it to be most similar to a PPAR response element (DR1). These data demonstrate that hyper-activation of enhancer/promoters driven by the RXRA hot-spot mutation occurs preferentially at canonical RXR/PPAR response elements. Using transient transfection of a DR1-driven luciferase reporter, we confirmed relative hyper-activation of DR1 in the JMSU-1 cells expressing mutant RXRA compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), with a degree of induction similar to that observed after pioglitazone treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Hot-spot mutation-driven transcriptional activity is dependent on expression of PPARD or PPARG</title><p>Having established that mutant RXRA up-regulates PPAR target gene expression, we next tested if this was dependent on PPARs.

In the non-targeting control, both genes were again found up-regulated by mutant RXRA.

However, expression of neither PPAR target gene was significantly reduced by PPARD knock-down alone. PPARG knock-down partially inhibited <italic>PLIN2</italic> expression in both cell lines, but did not have significant impact on <italic>FABP3</italic>. Combined knock-down of PPARD and PPARG, however, strongly inhibited RXRA<sup>S427F</sup>-driven hyper-expression of both genes, to an extent greater than knockdown of PPARG alone.

Treatment of UM-UC-3 with agonists to either PPARG or PPARD did not have meaningful impact on reporter activity when RXRA was transfected without a PPAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating a lack of relevant endogenous expression in this cell line. Similarly, RXRA<sup>S427F/Y</sup> did not show increased activity relative to RXRA<sup>wt</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Since RXRA can drive transcription as a homodimer with a preference for the DR1 motif, these data indicate that the mutation does not confer gain-of-function in the homodimer context. We then examined reporter activity with co-transfection of PPARG or PPARD. Expression of either PPAR was sufficient to elicit mutant RXRA associated hyperactivity to an extent that approximated agonist induced activation of the PPAR in the wild-type RXRA condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Similar to what was observed in the JMSU-1 stable cells, RXRA<sup>S427F</sup> appeared to have somewhat stronger activity than RXRA<sup>S427Y</sup>, but both were hyperactive relative to RXRA<sup>wt</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Lastly, we tested reporter activity with co-transfection of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA), which belongs to another family of RXRA heterodimerization partners. Both the DR1 reporter and a reporter with the preferred RXR/RAR binding motif, DR5, were induced by the RAR agonist all-trans-retinoic acid, but mutant RXRA did not elicit greater activity than wild-type RXRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The starting structure was the agonist-bound crystal structure of the RXRA/PPARG LBDs(PDB: 1FM6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gampe et al., 2000</xref>); however, the agonist compounds were deleted to reduce subsequent computational complexity and to enable drift toward the inactivated state. We next constructed Markov State Models (MSMs) following the procedure from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hart et al. (2016)</xref> to quantify the thermodynamics and kinetics of each heterodimer. First, conformations adopted by backbone-heavy atoms near the mutated site in RXRA and the PPARG AF2 (RXRA 425–429 and PPARG 445–477) from both wild-type and mutant simulations were clustered in the same state space. An MSM was then constructed for each variant based on how often the corresponding simulations transitioned between every pair of clusters. The wild-type and mutant largely populate different clusters, consistent with our hypothesis that mutant and wild-type RXRA differentially regulate the PPARG AF2 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>)</p><p>We next inspected the three most frequently occupied clusters for wild-type and mutant by superimposing the PPARG residues 445–459 on helix 11 as an anchor, enabling us to visualize relative displacement of the AF2 region located in helix 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In the RXRA mutant condition, PPARG E471 more closely approximated the agonist confirmation, in agreement with our mutational studies showing the importance of this residue. The terminal tyrosine of PPARG (Y477) also appeared in distinct spaces in the two conditions. Comparing the 5% most frequently occupied clusters for wild type and mutant, we observed a significant difference in inter-residue distance between RXRA 427 and PPARG 477 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These data raised the possibility that an aromatic interaction between RXRA S427F/Y and the terminal tyrosine found in all PPARs may underlie activation of PPAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). To test this, the terminal tyrosine was either deleted or mutated to serine in both PPARG (Y477) and PPARD (Y441) and expression of the mutant PPARs was confirmed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Inducibility by RXRA<sup>S427F</sup> or agonist was then determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and G</xref>). In all cases, inducibility by agonist was maintained, but RXRA S427F-mediated hyperactivity was eliminated. We conclude that S427F/Y initiates an allosteric relay via an aromatic interaction with the terminal tyrosine on PPAR, leading to PPAR AF2 activation. No other RXR dimerization partners have an aromatic amino acid at the corresponding position, providing a structural basis for the selective activation of PPARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PPARD activation induces growth-factor-independent growth of urothelial organoids in the context of tumor suppressor loss</title><p>We next sought to determine if PPAR activation drives proliferation of urothelial cells.

These data suggest that loss of tumor suppressors creates a context permissive for PPARD-driven proliferation. Even though responsiveness to GW0742 was consistent across all of the dual knock-out organoids, we reasoned that utilizing a clonal sub-line might minimize variation due to random clonal skewing in later experiments involving retroviral infection and drug selection. Therefore, we established DKO 431.A from a single organoid picked from the DKO 431 line and assessed its responsiveness to PPAR agonists. DKO 431.A showed strong, dose-dependent, enhanced growth when treated with GW0742, but not pioglitazone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To assess transcriptional activation by the same PPAR agonists, DKO 431.A organoids were plated in standard media for 7 days and then treated with two doses of GW0742 or pioglitazone for 48 hr.

While this manuscript was under preparation, Korpal et al. reported biophysical data characterizing the mutant RXRA/PPARG heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korpal et al., 2017</xref>). Those in vitro findings align with our modeling predictions, which we further functionally validated with cell-based mutational studies, both with PPARG and PPARD. This allosteric activation mechanism of the PPAR AF2 by mutant RXRA raises unique challenges with regard to inhibitor design. In our study, we utilized inverse agonists which bind the LBD and stabilize interactions with co-repressors. While they are effective at reversing mutant RXRA-driven activity, we suspect chemical screens using assays in which PPARs are activated through the mutation-based mechanism may identify optimal inverse agonists capable of more complete target inhibition.</p><p>Inverse agonists binding the PPAR LBD remain the most characterized strategy to inhibit PPAR activity, but may not prove to be the most effective approach for blocking ligand independent activity driven by RXRA mutations. A potentially more effective strategy might be through the identification of small molecules that induce PPAR degradation. Supporting the concept, ligands that induce destabilizing conformations in ER have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2005</xref>), and the clinical utility of the ER degrader fluvestrant has been validated in breast cancer clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Howell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Osborne et al., 2002</xref>). Similar to ER, PPARs undergo agonist-induced degradation, suggesting therapeutic ligand-induced degradation of PPARs might also be feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hauser et al., 2000</xref>). Perhaps, a more rational approach to inducing PPAR degradation would be to engineer PPAR ligands linked to a chemical tag (e.g. PROTAC) that targets proteins to the proteasome. Such approaches have been used in preclinical systems to degrade other nuclear receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rodriguez-Gonzalez et al., 2008</xref>), although the clinical utility of the approach is not yet established. Lastly, the identification of biologically active small molecules that disrupt co-regulator binding to the ER AF2 raises yet another possible paradigm for targeting ligand-independent activation through the identification of small molecules that recognize the activated PPAR AF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raj et al., 2017</xref>). Our work here should encourage such approaches with the goal of identifying inhibitors that effectively overcome PPAR tumorigenic activity due to <italic>PPARG</italic> amplification and <italic>RXRA</italic> mutation.</p><p>The organoid system provided us with a unique capability to assay epithelial autonomous effects of PPAR activity in defined genetic contexts, including normal urothelium. In contrast to classical growth factors such as EGF which stimulate proliferation of wild-type organoids, we found that PPARD activation is only sufficient to drive growth with concurrent tumor suppressor loss. One possible explanation is that tumor suppressor loss alters PPARD-driven transcriptional regulation. Studies with AR in prostate cancer suggest that the AR cistrome is broadly reprogrammed during tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pomerantz et al., 2015</xref>), supporting a model in which nuclear receptors take on de novo target regulation in transformed cells. Alternatively, tumor suppressor loss may alter the cellular response to PPARD activation and/or provide complementary pro-tumorigenic signals. These possibilities will be explored in future studies and should help elucidate the cellular mechanisms by which PPAR signaling can drive urothelial proliferation. Regardless of the underlying mechanisms, however, our findings, along with recent work from others demonstrating PPARG orchestrates an immunosuppressive micro-environment to enhance tumor growth in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korpal et al., 2017</xref>), provide an increasingly compelling rationale for the development of a new class of molecularly targeted drugs with potential relevance to at least a quarter of bladder cancer cases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">gene (Homo sapiens)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RXRA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NCBI Gene ID:6256;

Drugs or DMSO were added to medium at time of plating. Medium was changed every 4 days post-plating. Cell viability was measured day 1 (baseline measurement) and at indicated days post-plating using CellTiter-Glo (G7571 Promega). Briefly, tabs were homogenized in 1:1 mixture of 1xPBS:CellTiter-Glo reagent and incubated at room temperature for 10 min with shaking. Homogenate was transferred to a white, 96-well plate and luminescence was measured on the SpectraMax i3 Platform. For organoid counting assay, organoids were digested into a single-cell suspension with trypsin and the counted in duplicate using a Bio-rad TC20.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RNA-seq sample preparation</title><p>Cells were seeded in biological triplicate in 6-well tissue culture plates at 300,000 cells (JMSU-1) or 125,000 (575A) cells per well. 48 hr later, 0.1% DMSO or 1 µM pioglitazone (E6910 Sigma-Aldrich) was added to cells. RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Mini Kit (74106 Qiagen) 16–18 hr after addition of drugs. RNA library prep and sequencing were done by the Genome Technology Access Center in the Department of Genetics at Washington University School of Medicine. Briefly, Ribosomal RNA was removed by poly-A selection using Oligo-dT beads. mRNA was then fragmented and reverse transcribed to yield double stranded cDNA using random hexamers. cDNA was blunt ended, had an A base added to the 3’ ends, and then had Illumina sequencing adapters ligated to the ends. Ligated fragments were then amplified for 12 cycles using primers incorporating unique index tags. Fragments were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq-2500 or HiSeq-3000 using single reads extending 50 bases.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>RNA-seq data acquisition, quality control, and processing</title><p>RNA-seq reads were aligned to the Ensembl release 76 top-level assembly with STAR version 2.0.4b. Gene counts were derived from the number of uniquely aligned unambiguous reads by Subread:featureCount version 1.4.5. Transcript counts were produced by Sailfish version 0.6.3. Sequencing performance was assessed for total number of aligned reads, total number of uniquely aligned reads, genes and transcripts detected, ribosomal fraction known junction saturation and read distribution over known gene models with RSeQC version 2.3. All gene-level and transcript counts were then imported into the R/Bioconductor package EdgeR and TMM normalization size factors were calculated to adjust for samples for differences in library size. Genes or transcripts not expressed in any sample were excluded from further analysis. The TMM size factors and the matrix of counts were then imported into R/Bioconductor package Limma and weighted likelihoods based on the observed mean-variance relationship of every gene/transcript and sample were then calculated for all samples with the voomWithQualityWeights function. Performance of the samples was assessed with a spearman correlation matrix and multidimensional scaling plots. Gene/transcript performance was assessed with plots of residual standard deviation of every gene to their average log-count with a robustly fitted trend line of the residuals. Generalized linear models were then created to test for gene/transcript level differential expression. Differentially expressed genes and transcripts were then filtered for FDR adjusted p-values less than or equal to 0.05. Go-Elite version 1.2 was used to identify over-represented pathways curated by KEGG.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>ChIP-seq sample preparation</title><p>JMSU-1 cells stably expressing RXRA<sup>wt</sup> or RXRA<sup>S427F</sup> were seeded in biological triplicate in 150 mm TC-treated culture dish and collected when 70–90% confluency was reached. Crosslinking and ChIP were performed as described for adherent cells in the ENCODE experiment summary for ENCSR000BJW (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR000BJW/">https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR000BJW/</ext-link>). Chromatin was sonicated using the Diagenode Pico Bioruptor. DNA-protein complexes were precipitated with antibodies against RXRA (PP-K8508-00 R and D Systems) and H3K27Ac (ab4729 Abcam). Ovation Ultralow System V2 (0344–32 NuGen) was used to generate the sequencing library. The library was sequenced by the Genome Technology Access Center in the Department of Genetics at Washington University School of Medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>ChIP-seq data analysis</title><p>Reads were aligned to hg19 using NovoAlign version 3.04.06 with the command novoalign -r None -l 30 -e 100 -i 230 140 –H. For the RXRA and H3K27ac IPs, peaks were called for each phenotype using the IDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2011</xref>) pipeline described here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kundaje, 2012</xref>) with MACS version 2.1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) as the peak caller. RAE regions were defined for each phenotype by running bedtools intersect on the H3K27ac and RXRA IDR peak lists. Differential binding analysis was performed on the H3K27ac signal using DiffBind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ross-Innes et al., 2012</xref>) comparing mutant to wild-type with the IDR peak lists as input and an FDR cutoff of 0.05. Motif analysis of the RAE regions was performed using HOMER version 4.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) with the command findMotifsGenome.pl –h –bg &lt;Background&gt; &lt;Peaklist&gt; hg19. Peaklist was the RAE regions found by DiffBind to have higher H3K27ac binding in mutant. Background was the list of all RAE regions minus the ones found in peaklist.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Preparation of structures for molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>The published structure of complexed RXRA/PPARG LBDs bound to agonist (PDB: 1FM6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gampe et al., 2000</xref>) was used as the starting conformation for simulations. To reduce subsequent computational complexity and enable drift towards an inactive state during simulations, the respective agonist structures binding RXRA and PPARG were removed. The small peads were aligned to hg19 usptide nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (NCOA1) bound to both RXRA and PPARG AF2 domains was also removed with the same purpose. The Chimera molecular visualization tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) was used to mutate RXRA serine 427 to phenylalanine (RXRA S427F), creating wild-type and mutant structures for subsequent simulations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>The protocol described by Hart et. al. was used for molecular dynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hart et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, simulations were performed using the molecular dynamics package GROMACS 5.1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>). The Amber03 force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duan et al., 2003</xref>) was used and hydrogen atoms in each structure were replaced with virtual sites. The protein structure was solvated within a dodecahedron whose border was at least 10 Å away from the protein in all directions. Chlorine counterions were added to neutralize the system’s overall positive charge. To ensure the system contains no steric clashes or inappropriate geometry, energy minimization was used to relax the system below a 1000 kJ/mol/nm threshold. To equilibrate solvent and ions around the structure, the system underwent position-restrained molecular dynamics simulation for one nanosecond using a step size of 4 fs. After relaxation and equilibration, each system was subjected to long-timescale molecular simulations. Simulations took place using the NPT ensemble at 1 bar and 300 K. Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>) and the V-rescale thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bussi et al., 2007</xref>) were used during simulations. The LINCS method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hess, 2008</xref>) constrained hydrogen bonds and allowed the use of virtual sites. The cutoffs for electrostatic and van der Waals interactions was 9 Å. Periodic boundary conditions were applied during simulation and the particle-mesh Ewald summation reconstituted any long-distance electrostatic interactions. Each simulation lasted 100 nanoseconds with conformations stored every 10 picoseconds. Ten simulations were run to produce an aggregate 1 microsecond of simulation for both wild-type and mutant conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Markov state modeling</title><p>MSMBuilder 2.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beauchamp et al., 2011</xref>) was used to analyze conformations adopted during molecular simulation. Wild-type and mutant structures were clustered in overlapping state space using the hybrid k-centers/k-medoids technique. Clustering was based on the RMSD of between backbone-heavy atoms from PPARG 445–477 and RXRA 425–429. The inter-cluster distance cutoff was 1 Å and 50 iterations were performed to refine cluster assignment. A microstate Markov state model (MSM) was constructed using the Transpose method for symmetric counts matrix estimation and without applying an ergodic trim. The 5% most frequently occupied microstates during wild-type and mutant conformations were selected. Distance between alpha carbons of RXRA 427 and PPARG 477 was calculated for comparison between microstate structures from wild-type and mutant simulations. The inter-residue distances were normalized to the respective distance in the agonist-bound crystal structure. The Chimera molecular visualization tool was used to generate representative figures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistical tests are as indicated in figure legends.

We agree that the characterization of the <italic>RXRA</italic> mutation is the main contribution of the paper. We acknowledge there are several papers that have studied PPARG in bladder cancer, but its role as a driver pathway in bladder cancer is not something (in our view) yet firmly established or accepted in the bladder cancer field. Thus, our finding that PPAR pathway activation drives urothelial proliferation is, we believe, an important secondary contribution of the paper. We have made changes in the Abstract and Discussion to better articulate the relative importance of these views.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors found that RXRA mutant can activate PPARG independent of PPAR ligand binding using molecular simulations with the crystal structures.

PLIN2</italic> is up-regulated in the human samples with <italic>RXRA</italic> hot-spot mutations and was utilized in all of our qPCR analysis for this reason. This rationale has now been indicated in the manuscript. In Supplementary Figure S2.6 (RXRA hotspot mutations) from the TCGA’s Nature 2014 paper (Nature 507, 315–322, 2014) a volcano plot shows altered gene expression in <italic>RXRA</italic> hot-spot mutant clinical sample with <italic>PLIN2</italic> located near the top right of the plot. The FABPs did not score individually as up-regulated in mutant cases, but are canonical PPAR target genes. These genes showed particularly strong expression signal changes associated with the mutation in cell lines and organoids, and therefore provided a broad signal range to assess the impact of siRNA knock-down or drug treatments. Notably, there are very few individual genes clearly altered in the mutant cases versus wild-type, and the statistical significance shown in the plot is modest for discovery analysis. We presume this is in part because gene expression values of individual genes are inherently ‘noisy’ in human tissues and the <italic>RXRA</italic> hot-spot mutation is still limited to a small number of patient samples. Gene Pathway analysis we believe helps overcome some of the ‘noise’ associated with gene expression analysis and is a particularly useful tool when assessing changes in transcription factor activity. As we indicated in the manuscript, <italic>RXRA</italic> mutation is associated with PPAR signaling pathway up-regulation in <italic>human tissues</italic>, and a causal role of <italic>RXRA</italic> mutation for this pathway up-regulation was confirmed in two cell lines in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Can the authors distinguish between WT and mutant RXRA binding sites in the same cell (e.g. with 2 different tagged constructs), given cancer cells will have WT and mutant protein?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that such an approach could provide an elegant demonstration of differences in WT and mutant <italic>RXRA</italic> DNA binding and enhancer activation. However, such an approach would also introduce two new potentially confounding variables: 1) different tags which might differentially alter protein function, and 2) the need to use two different antibodies for ChIP with each introducing its own bias with regard to DNA binding site identification and background binding. While with appropriate controls these issues could be surmountable, we feel that adequate validation of the approach would take several months and therefore we cannot include it at this time. We feel that the approach we used, introduction of not tagged wild-type or mutant <italic>RXRA</italic> independently into cell lines and then performing ChIP for <italic>RXRA</italic> and H3K27ac, is adequate to conclude that hyper-activation of enhancer/promoters driven by the <italic>RXRA</italic> hot-spot mutation occurs preferentially at canonical RXR/PPAR response elements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For the organoid culture, and luciferase data, biological replicates should be from experiments performed at different times, with technical replicates deriving from cells grown in different wells. It is essential that this has been done and that this information is clearly stated in the manuscript. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> states that data from organoids is from triplicate wells (assayed in duplicate). This is not clear. The experimental design should be something more like: &quot;data is the mean + SD of three experiments, each of which was assayed in triplicate wells on separate days&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting this lack of clarity and have removed the terms ‘biological’ and ‘technical’ replicate as they are ambiguous. In our previous submission, plotted data for the organoid growth and luciferase data came from one experiment in which cells were plated into three different wells (triplicate) and then two equal volume samples were taken from each well for the endpoint bioluminescence assay (duplicate). Data shown was considered representative of multiple experiments. In response to this comment, we have reformatted many of the data panels such that all the organoid and luciferase experiments include data from three distinct experiments performed on three different days. Since this affects many panels, we are uploading an appendix showing the “old” figure panel next to the “new” figure panel to facilitate review of all affected panels. None of the conclusions of the manuscript are affected and the data look quite similar. The methodology for plotting and analyzing data collected from experiments executed on different days is summarized below. We also point out minor differences resulting from these data analysis.</p><p>1) For panels 1F, 2D, 4C, 4F, 5B, 5C, 5D, and 5E, we have now plotted the mean bioluminescence signal from three identical and independent experiments performed on different days (each performed using 3 replicate cell wells, with 2 independent bioluminescence measurements from each cell well.) For these assays, there is inherently some variation in <italic>absolute</italic> raw bioluminescence signal from day to day, presumably due to a range of factors (e.g. temperature, reagent batches, variations in cell density, etc.). The <italic>relative</italic> bioluminescence signal between conditions is consistent when comparing experiments performed on different days. Since the signal ratios between biological conditions is of greater relevance then the bioluminescence absolute value, we have used a (ratio) paired <italic>t</italic>-test (instead of an unpaired <italic>t-</italic>test) for the statistical comparisons of integrated data from multiple experiments. All data from an experiment performed on the same day are “paired”.</p><p>2) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B and 3G</xref>, as we did in the original submission, the data for each PPAR allele is plotted as a ratio normalized to the <italic>RXRA</italic> WT DMSO condition for that PPAR allele. This approach provides a more intuitive visualization of the effect of PPAR mutations on inducibility by either agonist or <italic>RXRA</italic> S427F. Since with this approach the data for each experimental replicate is already expressed as a normalized ratio to another experimental condition assayed on the same day, comparison is with an unpaired <italic>t</italic> test. The plotted data now represents the mean ratios from three independent experiments performed on different days, each using cell wells plated in triplicate. (Statistical comparisons were not included in the previous submission, but have been added for completeness.)</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref> we have also now plotted the mean bioluminescence signal from three independent experiments performed on different days (each performed using 3 replicate cell wells, with 2 independent bioluminescence measurements from each cell well.) As before, these assays were performed using three independently derived organoids lines for each genotype. The statistical comparisons are between the mean values from the three independently derived organoids after each drug treatment. Thus, the variation in bioluminescence signal of experiments performed on different days does not apply here and an unpaired t-test analysis was used.</p><p>In the previous submission, a significant and consistent impact of GW0742 on growth was limited to organoids deficient in the tumor suppressors Kdm6a and Trp53. As we had pointed out, the data with Trp53 knock-out alone trended toward an effect but it was not statistically significant. By incorporating data from multiple experiments (presumably due to increased statistical power), GW0742 also drives significant growth in organoids with Trp53 deletion alone, although still not with the same apparent consistency across the independently derived lines compared to the dual Kdm6a/Trp53 knock-out organoids. Nonetheless, we have changed language to indicate that Trp53 alone is sufficient for GW0742 to drive growth factor independent growth. We again show that GW0742 fails to drive growth factor independent growth in wild-type organoids. Our conclusion that “PPARD activation induces growth factor independent growth of urothelial organoids in the context of tumor suppressor loss” is not changed.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref> show qPCR data expressed relative to the housekeeping gene actin from one experiment. The entire experiment was performed three times (i.e. on 3 different days.) Because again of inherent noise in the absolute signal value with qPCR data from different experiments, we have kept data from each experiment separate, but have included all data in 2 new supplemental panels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.) Statistical comparison of the aggregated data is by two-way ANOVA (Repeated Measures, GraphPad Prism).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, both PPARD inhibitors (GSK0660 and ST247) are again shown to significantly impair growth and transcriptional activity driven by RXRA S427F. However, with integrated analysis, one inhibitor does not clearly perform better than the other, therefore a suggestion we had made that ST247 may be more efficacious has been removed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
