multiple genes in tight linkage through suppressed recombination. Despite their importance in determining complex phenotypes, our empirical understanding of early supergene evolution is limited. Here we focus on the young ‘social’ supergene of fire ants, a powerful system for disentangling the effects of evolutionary antagonism and suppressed recombination. We hypothesize that gene degeneration and social antagonism shaped the evolution of the fire ant supergene, resulting in distinct patterns of gene expression. We test these ideas by identifying allelic differences between supergene variants, characterizing allelic expression across populations, castes and body parts, and contrasting allelic expression biases with differences in expression between social forms. We find strong signatures of gene degeneration and gene-specific dosage compensation. On this background, a small portion of the genes has the signature of adaptive responses to evolutionary antagonism between social forms.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Red fire ants (<italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic>) are native to South America, but the species has spread to North America, Australia and New Zealand where it can be an invasive pest. A reason for this species’ invasiveness types of colonies : one with a single egg-laying queen and another with several queens. However, it is not possible to simply add more queens to a colony with one queen. Instead, the number of queens in a colony is controlled genetically, by a chromosome known as the ‘social chromosome’.</p><p>Like many other animals, red fire ants are diploid: their cells have two copies of each chromosome, which can carry two different versions of each gene. The social chromosome is no different, and it comes in two variants, SB and Sb. Each ant can therefore have either two SB chromosomes, leading to a colony with a single queen; or one SB chromosome and one Sb chromosome, leading to a colony with multiple queens. Ants with two copies of the Sb variant die when they are young, so the Sb version is inherited in a similar way to how the Y chromosome is passed on in humans. However, the social chromosome in red fire ants appeared less than one million years ago, making it much younger than the human Y chromosome, which is 180 million years old. This makes the social chromosome a good candidate for examining the early evolution of special chromosome variants that are only inherited.</p><p>How differences between the SB and the Sb chromosomes are evolving is an open question, however. Perhaps each version of the social chromosome has been optimised through natural selection to one colony type. Another suggestion is that the Sb chromosome has degenerated over time because its genes cannot be ‘reshuffled’ as they would be on normal chromosomes.</p><p>Martinez-Ruiz et al. compared genetic variants on the SB and Sb chromosomes, along with their expression in different types of ant colonies. The analysis showed that the Sb variant is in fact breaking down because of the lack of gene shuffling. This loss is compensated by intact copies of the same genes found on the SB variant, which explains why ants with the Sb variant can only survive if they also carry the SB version. Only a handful of genes on the social chromosomes appear to have been optimised by natural selection. Therefore Martinez-Ruiz et al. concluded the differences between the two chromosomes that lead to different colony types are collateral effects of Sb’s inability to reshuffle its genes.</p><p>This work reveals how a special chromosome similar to the Y chromosome in humans evolved. It also shows how multiple complex evolutionary forces can shape a species’ genetic makeup and social forms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Solenopsis invicta</kwd><kwd>social evolution</kwd><kwd>supergenes</kwd><kwd>antagonistic selection</kwd><kwd>allele-specific expression</kwd><kwd>ants</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000270</institution-id><institution>NERC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NE/L00626X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wurm</surname><given-names>Yannick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000270</institution-id><institution>NERC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NE/L002485/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinez-Ruiz</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001655</institution-id><institution>DAAD</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>570704 83</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wurm</surname><given-names>Yannick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Commission Marie Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PIEF-GA-2013-623713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wurm</surname><given-names>Yannick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>BBSRC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/K004204/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wurm</surname><given-names>Yannick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analyses of allelic- and socially-biased gene expression reveal that suppressed recombination causes most of the expression differences in the social supergene, with only few differences due to socially antagonistic selection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Evolutionary antagonism can emerge when selection favors multiple phenotypic optima within a population. This process can lead to selection for reduced recombination between co-adapted alleles encoding the different phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Charlesworth, 2016</xref>). In turn, reduced recombination will sometimes favor the formation of supergene regions containing tightly linked alleles of up to hundreds of genes. Such regions enable the maintenance of genetic interactions over evolutionary time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darlington and Mather, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thompson and Jiggins, 2014</xref>). We now know that supergenes controlling ecologically important traits are widespread. Examples include flower heterostyly in <italic>Primula</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2016</xref>), mating type in <italic>Mycrobotryum</italic> fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branco et al., 2018</xref>), Batesian mimicry in butterflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Joron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kunte et al., 2014</xref>), mating behavior in white-throated sparrows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zinzow-Kramer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tuttle et al., 2016</xref>) and male sexual morphs in ruff sandpipers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Küpper et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lamichhaney et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The non-recombining portions of sex chromosomes are extensively studied examples of supergenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergero and Charlesworth, 2009</xref>). Their evolution is thought to have been shaped by antagonism over sexual phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zemp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vicoso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khil et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parsch and Ellegren, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wright et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mank, 2017</xref>). However, studies focusing on young sex chromosome systems suggest otherwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dufresnes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nozawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alekseyenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muyle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Charlesworth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stöck et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, sex chromosome evolution could be driven mostly by processes resulting from suppressed recombination rather than by antagonistic selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Branco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ma et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The social supergene of the red fire ant <italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic> is an excellent model for comparing how evolutionary antagonism and the consequences of suppressed recombination shape early supergene evolution. This species includes single-queen and multiple-queen colonies, which differ in behavior, physiology and ecology. This social polymorphism is controlled by a pair of ‘social chromosomes’, SB and Sb, that carry distinct supergene variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). In single-queen colonies, workers and queens are SB/SB homozygotes. In multiple-queen colonies, egg-laying queens are SB/Sb heterozygotes, but workers can either be homozygous or heterozygous. Sb/Sb queens are rare and their offspring are unviable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gotzek and Ross, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, because of at least three inversions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stolle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2018</xref>), recombination is severely repressed between SB and Sb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pracana et al., 2017a</xref>). Similar to a Y chromosome, Sb thus lacks recombination opportunities. Importantly, the fire ant supergene system could be as young as 175,000 generations. It thus offers a rare glimpse into the evolutionary forces shaping the early stages of supergene evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Suppressed recombination reduces the efficacy of purifying selection through Hill-Robertson interference, which can lead to gene degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Charlesworth, 2016</xref>). Accordingly, Sb has accumulated non-synonymous single nucleotide substitutions and repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stolle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pracana et al., 2017a</xref>). Despite Sb degeneration, gene content in SB and Sb is highly similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pracana et al., 2017a</xref>), likely because of the system’s young age and purifying selection in haploid males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall and Goodisman, 2012</xref>). Modifications in the genomic sequence can lead to gene expression changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Denver et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rifkin et al., 2005</xref>), the accumulation of mutations in Sb alleles of some genes could therefore result in SB/Sb expression bias. Changes in expression due to gene degeneration should result in specific expression patterns. For instance, if such mutations go to fixation because of inefficient purifying selection, they would likely result in consistent allelic bias across all tissues. Alternatively, if such mutations go to fixation because they are adaptive responses to antagonistic selection, their expression levels would be likely to require tissue-specific fine-tuning for particular functions. This process should result in tissue-specific allelic bias, as observed across human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">GTEx Consortium, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The accumulation of deleterious mutations in Sb alleles should lead to lower expression levels due to impacts in regulatory sequences. The opposite effect seems to be less likely and may only involve highly specific mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Loewe and Hill, 2010</xref>). Additionally, selection against the expression of deleterious alleles should result in the downregulation of some Sb alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pucholt et al., 2017</xref>). If lower Sb expression occurs for dosage-sensitive genes, selection should favor upregulation of the corresponding SB alleles. Such dosage compensation can occur through different mechanisms. For instance, in male <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> the entire X chromosome is expressed at roughly twice the level of autosomes to compensate for the lack of expression in the highly degenerated Y chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conrad and Akhtar, 2012</xref>). In species with much younger sex chromosomes such as <italic>Drosophila miranda</italic>, dosage compensation instead occurs only at a gene-by-gene level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alekseyenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nozawa et al., 2018</xref>). Because the fire ant supergene is young, we hypothesize that individual genes for which the Sb allele has begun to degenerate would show evidence of dosage compensation. For such genes, the SB allele would be more highly expressed than the Sb allele, while their combined total expression should be similar between SB/Sb and SB/SB individuals.</p><p>Because the supergene variants determine social forms in the fire ant, their evolution will also have been shaped by antagonistic selection. We thus expect that the supergene region is enriched for genes with alleles that are beneficial for one of the social forms but detrimental for the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zemp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vicoso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khil et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parsch and Ellegren, 2013</xref>). Genes with such alleles are more likely to also show differences in expression between social forms, resulting in an enrichment of socially biased expression in the supergene. However, such enrichment could instead emerge from lowered expression associated with gene degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ma et al., 2020</xref>), or the fixation of mutations with neutral phenotypic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harrison et al., 2012</xref>). Adaptation through lower expression of Sb alleles is indistinguishable from gene degeneration. In contrast, increased expression of Sb alleles is more likely to result from adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harrison et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pál et al., 2001</xref>). This line of reasoning has been used in the analysis of sex chromosomes, in which patterns of high sexually-biased expression for sex-chromosome linked genes is used as a proxy for benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mank, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mank et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhou and Bachtrog, 2012</xref>). Following this logic and given the expected general pattern of Sb downregulation due to degeneration, genes with high expression of the Sb allele are more likely to be adaptive. Furthermore, because Sb should be enriched in alleles beneficial for multiple-queen colonies, we expect that genes with high expression in multiple-queen colonies will tend to show Sb bias.</p><p>We disentangle these evolutionary processes by generating detailed genomic and transcriptomic data: we sequenced genomes of fire ants from their native South American range and combined these with existing genomes from the invasive North American range. This enables us to identify genes with fixed differences between the SB and Sb variants of the social chromosome. To detect differences in expression between SB and Sb alleles, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from SB/Sb individuals from the South American range of the species. We used three body parts of queens (head, thorax and abdomen) and whole bodies of workers. We combined this data with published RNA-seq data from SB/Sb individuals from invasive North American and Taiwanese populations. We then compared these expression patterns with those obtained from comparisons between social forms.</p><p>We find that most genes in the social chromosome show no strong allelic bias and that there is no clear pattern of supergene-wide expression bias towards either variant. Genes with biased expression tend to show patterns consistent with gene degeneration, such as lower Sb expression with increasing numbers of non-synonymous mutations. Additionally, we find that more genes are SB biased than expected given differences in expression between social forms, a pattern consistent with partial dosage compensation. Accordingly, the accumulation of non-synonymous mutations in Sb alleles correlates with an allelic bias towards SB, consistent with ongoing Sb degeneration. Despite these observations, we find an overrepresentation of Sb-biased genes among genes with higher expression in individuals from multiple-queen colonies. This result indicates that antagonistic selection has also shaped the expression patterns in the fire ant supergene. Given the observed impact of gene degeneration, our results highlight the importance of considering the genomic context of gene expression patterns before making inferences about functionality.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hundreds of genes have fixed allelic differences between supergene variants</title><p>To identify differences between supergene variants, we obtained 408-fold genome coverage from 20 haploid SB males and 20 haploid Sb males.

This result was further supported by a linear mixed-effects model of all data: population ancestry has a stronger effect on allelic expression bias than geographic proximity (respective interaction terms with the effect of gene: F = 3.42, p&lt;10<sup>−15</sup> and F = 0.94, p=0.65).</p><p>Together, these results support the idea that the effects of suppressed recombination on genomic architecture explain most of the allelic biases in the supergene region.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Overrepresentation of socially biased genes in the social supergene</title><p>Social-form specific selection should lead to an overrepresentation of socially biased gene expression in the supergene region.

Dosage compensation should lead to a pattern where higher expression of the SB allele does not result in differences in expression between social forms.</p><p>We tested whether such a pattern occurs for 294 genes in the supergene region using North American data. We compared the proportion of SB allele expression (<italic>P<sub>B</sub></italic>) for each gene, with its expression in multiple-queen colonies relative to single-queen colonies (<italic>P<sub>MQ</sub></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). If Sb degeneration had led to its global downregulation or inactivation, we would have found a stark bias towards SB, irrespective of social bias. Instead, we find that the expression levels of SB and Sb are balanced for most genes without differences between social forms (black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, linear regression passes through the point 0.5, 0.5 with a non-significant deviation of 0.0058; p=0.32). At the extremes of the distribution, however, allelic bias is higher when social bias is higher. We therefore considered two models to explain this pattern. The null model assumes that differences in expression patterns between social forms are due solely to differences in baseline allelic expression (purple line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In this model, the <italic>P<sub>B</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>MQ</sub></italic> values change solely as a consequence of the relative expression of the Sb and the SB alleles (see Materials and methods). This model (the purple line) fits the data poorly. The second model (red line), additionally allows for the effect of gene-specific dosage compensation by increasing expression of B-alleles in SB/Sb individuals in multiple queen-colonies. This model fits the data much better and it is significantly different from the null model (analysis of variance p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>). This finding confirms that SB expression in SB/Sb individuals is higher than expected given the observed patterns of expression differences between social forms. Further in line with this, we found no relation between the relative expression levels of the SB and Sb alleles in queens from multiple queen-colonies to the total expression of the genes in the supergene in either social form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>;Wilcoxon sum rank test p&gt;0.05).

The differences in expression between single-queen and multiple-queen individuals remain non-significant (Wilcox test p&gt;0.05) across varying levels of SB-Sb expression differences. Only when Sb expression is much higher than SB expression (Sb/SB expression ratio &gt;1.5) does it seem to be an increase in gene expression for multiple-queen individuals, but the difference between social forms remained non-significant (Wilcox test p=0.08). Without dosage compensation, we would expect that allelic bias would invariably result in changes in expression between social forms: As the allelic expression levels of SB increases, we would observe an increase in expression of single-queen colonies. Instead, expression levels in single-queen and multiple-queen individuals remain similar. These results are therefore consistent with SB expression compensating for low Sb expression.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig3s1sdata1"><label>Figure 3—figure supplement 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Median gene expression levels in single-queen and multiple-queen individuals for different levels of SB and Sb expression levels in multiple-queens.</title><p>The columns in the dataset stand for: expression_group, the samples from which the expression levels were calculated, either whole body queen from multiple-queen colonies (&quot;Poly&quot;), whole body queen from single-queen colonies (&quot;Mono&quot;), SB allelic expression in multiple-queen colonies (&quot;PolySB&quot;) or Sb allelic expresion in multiple-queen colonies (&quot;PolySb&quot;); Sb-SB_expression_category, the different levels in which we divided the Sb to SB allele expression levels ratio; median_expression, median raw expression levels per group per category; confidence_level, estimated median of normalized expression across groups and categories after bootstrapping (5000 bootstrap replicates); lower_median_ci, the lower confidence interval at 95% for the median; upper_median_ci, the upper confidence interval at 95% for the median.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="octet-stream" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-55862-fig3-figsupp1-data1-v3.csv"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55862-fig3-figsupp1-v3.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>To complement these analyses of general trends, we focused on individual genes.

We tested this hypothesis by asking whether genes with higher coding sequence degeneration have a higher SB bias. We used the number of non-synonymous mutations per gene in the Sb allele as a proxy for gene degeneration and compared this measure against allelic bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Indeed, as the number of non-synonymous mutations increases, so does the allelic bias towards SB (coefficient = 0.052, p=0.01). This indicates that coding-sequence degeneration could lead to lower expression, or alternatively that some genes generally degenerate faster than others.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Genes with higher expression of Sb than SB alleles are socially biased towards higher expression in multiple-queen colonies</title><p>Antagonistic selection should lead to an enrichment of genes in the supergene that are highly expressed in multiple-queen colonies and show allelic bias towards Sb. In contrast, without antagonistic selection all expression differences between Sb and SB alleles should be due to gene degeneration, and lead to lower Sb expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ma et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>From the 294 genes analyzed in the previous section, eight (3%) had both allele-biased and socially-biased expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Their expression patterns were strongly directionally biased towards higher expression in Sb and in multiple-queen colonies (5 out 8 Sb biased genes were significantly more highly expressed in multiple-queen colonies <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>; compared to 1 out of 15 for SB biased genes, χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.8, p=0.02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). This enrichment of multiple-queen biased genes in the Sb variant is consistent with antagonistic selection. Although unlikely, Sb-specific upregulation could lead to higher expression in multiple-queen colonies without affecting fitness. However, the broad expression patterns described in the previous section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) show that differences in expression between social forms are not due exclusively to changes in expression levels between Sb and SB alleles. We additionally showed that the fixation of non-synonymous mutations in Sb alleles correlates with lower expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We therefore consider it unlikely that the trend of enrichment in high multiple-queen expression among Sb biased genes would have arisen neutrally. Consistent with the lack of direct correlation between allelic bias and social bias, only 3 of the seven genes with consistent allelic bias in all populations were also differentially expressed between social forms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>): ‘pheromone-binding protein Gp-9’ (LOC105194481), ‘ejaculatory bulb-specific protein 3’ (LOC105199531) and ‘retinol-binding protein pinta-like’ (LOC105199327). This narrow overlap between allelic and social bias makes these genes candidates for playing roles in phenotypic differences between social forms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the fire ant, a supergene system with two variants (SB and Sb) controls whether colonies have one or multiple queens. We compared gene expression patterns between the SB and Sb variants of the social supergene within heterozygote SB/Sb individuals which exist only in multiple-queen colonies. We contrasted these patterns with differences in expression between queens from single-queen and multiple-queen colonies. We find patterns consistent with degeneration of Sb and with dosage compensation in response to this degeneration. We also find that some genes in Sb have patterns consistent with evolutionary antagonism.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The effects of gene degeneration on supergene expression patterns</title><p>We found that a small proportion of the genes in the supergene region showed consistent allele-specific expression differences between the SB and Sb variants. It is tempting to conclude that such gene expression differences arose through selection, as a consequence of evolutionary antagonism between the single-queen and multiple-queen phenotypes. However, this interpretation may be too simplistic, as it ignores the impacts of supergene degeneration. Several studies have shown that Sb is degenerating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stolle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pracana et al., 2017a</xref>). Our observation that roughly half of the fixed differences in coding sequence between SB and Sb impact the protein sequence (where they are likely to have a deleterious effect) is also consistent with degeneration of the Sb variant. Such sequence-level degeneration is a symptom of reduced selection efficacy. By examining gene expression, we revealed three additional symptoms of degeneration and low selection efficacy. First, the absence of tissue-specificity in our study would not be expected if expression differences were adaptive. For some genes, the expression differences between Sb and SB are likely due to mutations that are completely neutral or deleterious. However, for other genes, expression differences could be partially adaptive, but low selection efficacy may have hindered the fine-tuning of their expression during the short timespan since the supergene’s emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). As a result, strong selection for a particular level of allele-specific expression in one body part (<italic>e.g.</italic>, in antennae), could result in consistent allele-specific expression patterns across tissues, even if this has mildly deleterious effects (<italic>e.g.</italic>, in the gut).</p><p>Second, there was a strong correlation in allelic bias between the invasive North American and Taiwanese populations, despite the data from the two populations being from different studies. Both invasive populations have lower genetic diversity overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ascunce et al., 2011</xref>), and in the supergene region in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pracana et al., 2017a</xref>). The strong effect of ancestry on allelic bias indicates that genomic architecture, rather than gene function, defines most expression patterns within the supergene. Finally, gene degeneration can result in lower expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pucholt et al., 2017</xref>). For example, gene expression is reduced in genes with sequence-level signatures of degeneration in the mating-type chromosomes of the anther-smut fungus <italic>Microbotryum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). We similarly find that Sb alleles with more non-synonymous mutations tend to have lower expression than SB alleles. This pattern could result from the relative inefficacy of selection on Sb, leading to selection favoring the downregulation of alleles accumulating detrimental mutations. We find such patterns of degeneration despite the likely effects of antagonistic selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang and Wang, 2014</xref>) and the lack of evolutionary strata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pracana et al., 2017a</xref>), both of which are likely to dampen the degeneration signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ma et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Dosage compensation in the social supergene</title><p>The reduction in expression of the Sb allele in several genes could result in detrimental fitness effects if the genes involved are dosage sensitive, as observed in many sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mank, 2013</xref>). We tested this idea in the fire ant supergene and found that allelic expression bias is relatively balanced, with similar levels of SB and Sb bias across the supergene. However, far more genes have multiple-queen biased expression than single-queen biased expression. This pattern implies that much of the observed SB bias leads to no differences between social forms. Our findings are consistent with dosage compensation, where the higher SB expression effectively counteracts lower Sb expression.</p><p>Some of this dosage compensation likely emerged through selection despite Hill-Robertson effects and a short time of divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pracana et al., 2017a</xref>). However, some dosage compensation could instead occur automatically, whereby transcriptional machinery is less able to bind to degenerate regions of Sb and thus binds to SB instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Teufel et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, we speculate that regulatory elements located outside the supergene region could have co-evolved with Sb degeneration, allowing for variant-specific expression regulation. These elements would not be affected by suppressed recombination, allowing for a quicker emergence of dosage controlling mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lenormand et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of the mechanisms which mediate gene-by-gene dosage compensation in the fire ant, we show that it can emerge over time scales as short as approximately 175,000 generations (1 million years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pracana et al., 2017a</xref>). Furthermore, this is to our knowledge only the second known instance of dosage compensation in a supergene that does not determine sex or mating type. Indeed, a 2–3 million-year-old supergene controlling color morphs of the white-throated sparrow also shows patterns consistent with dosage compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Such findings support the idea that many of the patterns seen in sex chromosomes are representative of supergenes in general. Indeed, rapid evolution of dosage compensation similarly occurred in the 10 million-year-old sex chromosomes of the plant <italic>Silene latifolia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muyle et al., 2012</xref>) and in two <italic>Drosophila</italic> species neo-sex chromosomes that are only a few million years old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nozawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alekseyenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nozawa et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Supergene expression patterns consistent with antagonistic selection</title><p>Most Sb-biased genes are also more highly expressed in multiple-queen colonies, supporting the idea that antagonistic alleles are present in the supergene. In the unlikely case that this pattern had no fitness effects, it could arise neutrally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harrison et al., 2012</xref>). We argue against this possibility because, as discussed above, expression patterns in the supergene do not follow what would be expected if differences between social forms were due exclusively to differences in allelic expression. Additionally, the patterns of expression differences between social forms are similar within the supergene and in the rest of the genome. This observation further suggests that expression differences between social forms are driven by factors unrelated to the genomic architecture of the supergene. Given the patterns of ongoing degeneration in Sb, we conclude that genes with Sb and multiple-queen bias were likely under antagonistic selection.

However, our analysis does single out candidate genes that potentially contribute to the social polymorphism of the fire ant (lists of all sequence and expression differences are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>). In particular, three genes stood out because they were differentially expressed between social forms and had variant-specific allele expression in all populations. For the first gene, ‘Pheromone-binding protein Gp-9’ (LOC105194481), also known as OBP-3, the Sb allele was more highly expressed. For decades, this gene has been a candidate effector for social form differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pracana et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keller and Ross, 1998</xref>), yet its linkage to hundreds of other genes in the supergene led to doubts that its association to social form is any more than coincidental. We found five fixed differences between SB and Sb for this gene, four of which could affect protein efficiency (consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krieger and Ross, 2002</xref>]). For the second gene, ‘Ejaculatory bulb-specific protein 3’ (LOC105199531), which also contains an insect odorant binding protein domain (InterPro IPR005055), the SB allele was more highly expressed. Orthologs of this gene are associated with mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laturney and Billeter, 2014</xref>) in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, sexual behavior in a moth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohbot et al., 1998</xref>), subcaste differences in bumblebees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wolschin et al., 2012</xref>), venom production in social hornets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yoon et al., 2015</xref>) and caste differences in the termite <italic>Reticulitermes flavipes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Steller et al., 2010</xref>).

In sum, all three candidate genes have putative functions related to environmental perception, in line with the complex social phenotype requiring subtle changes in environmental perception or signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Favreau et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found differences in expression between the SB- and Sb-linked alleles of genes in the fire ant supergene across three populations. Such strong patterns can naively be assumed to be indicative of adaptive processes emerging from evolutionary antagonism between social forms. However, we show that the evolutionary forces shaping expression patterns in the supergene are complex and must be interpreted with care. In particular, genes with higher expression of the SB allele than the Sb allele tend to either lack expression differences between social forms or have lower expression in multiple-queen than in single-queen colonies. Both patterns are consistent with the idea that suppressed recombination leads to degeneration in Sb and thus lower Sb allele expression. In some cases, a dosage compensation mechanism through higher expression of the healthy SB allele leads to similar expression levels in both social forms. In cases where no dosage compensation occurs, overall expression is lower in multiple-queen colonies than in single-queen colonies.</p><p>Conversely, we also show that genes with higher expression of the Sb allele than the SB allele are also biased towards higher expression in multiple-queen colonies. This pattern is consistent with evolutionary antagonism favoring the accumulation of beneficial alleles for multiple-queen individuals in Sb, the supergene variant found only in this social form.</p><p>Our study shows that multiple complex evolutionary forces can simultaneously act on a young supergene system. It highlights that allele-specific expression patterns alone are insufficient for inferring whether they are adaptive, deleterious or phenotypically neutral. Instead, putting such expression differences into broader contexts is needed to draw reasonable conclusions. Applying this idea to our data highlights genes which have molecular roles that could affect perception or signaling of the social environment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Solenopsis invicta)</italic></td><td>Fire ants</td><td>Argentina</td><td>NCBI taxonomy 13686</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Tri Reagent</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>MFCD00213058</td><td>DNA/RNA extraction</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay, kit</td><td>NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit</td><td>New England Biolabs</td><td>E7775L</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay, kit</td><td>NEB Library Quant Kit</td><td>New England Biolabs</td><td>E7630</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>RNA sequencing of fire ants</title><p>We used three published and one new RNA-seq gene expression datasets from fire ants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wurm et al., 2011</xref> obtained whole-body RNA-seq data from six pools of 4 egg-laying SB/Sb queens, each from a multiple-queen colony from Georgia, USA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morandin et al., 2016</xref> obtained whole-body RNA-seq data from six samples, each being a pool of 3 queens from a single-queen or a multiple-queen colony (three replicates per social form) from Texas, USA.

Because the patterns of genetic diversity differ between the invasive and South American <italic>S. invicta</italic> populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ross et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2005</xref>), we estimated allele specific expression differences in the social chromosome independently for each population. For this we used haploid male ants because they can provide unambiguous genotypes. For the invasive populations, we identified fixed allelic differences between a group of 7 SB males and a group of 7 Sb males from North America (NCBI SRP017317) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>For the South American population, we sequenced the genomes of 13 SB males and 13 Sb males sampled from across Argentina. For each individual, we extracted 1 µg of genomic DNA using a phenol-chloroform protocol. The extracted material was sheared to 350 bp fragments using a Covaris (M220). We constructed individually barcoded libraries using the Illumina TruSeq PCR-free kit. The libraries were quantified through qPCR (NEB library quant kit). An equimolar pool of the 26 libraries was sequenced on a HiSeq4000 at 150 bp paired reads. This produced an average of 17,790,416 pairs of reads per sample, with a maximum of 38,823,285 and a minimum of 7,910,042 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>, genomic reads of all samples deposited on NCBI SRA (PRJNA542606)). For each dataset, we identified fixed allelic differences between the group of SB males and the group of Sb males. We first aligned the reads of each sample to the <italic>S. invicta</italic> reference genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wurm et al., 2011</xref>; gnG assembly; RefSeq GCF_000188075.1) using Bowtie2 v2.3.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>). We then used Freebayes v1.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garrison and Marth, 2012</xref>) to call variants across all individuals (parameters: ploidy = 1, min-alternate-count=1, min-alternate-fraction=0.2). We used BCFtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2009</xref>) and VariantAnnotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Obenchain et al., 2014</xref>) to only retain variant sites with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with quality value Q greater than or equal to 25, and where all individuals had a minimum coverage of 1. To avoid considering SNPs erroneously called from repetitive regions that are collapsed in the reference genome, we discarded any SNP with mean coverage greater than 16 for the North American samples or 12 for the South American samples or where any individuals had less than 60% reads supporting the called allele. This last filtering step also acts to remove SNPs called from reads with sequencing errors. We then extracted only the SNPs located within the supergene (based on the genomic locations from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pracana et al., 2017a</xref>) and with fixed differences between SB and Sb. This step was performed independently for each population. The two resulting variant call files were inspected using VCFtools v0.1.15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Danecek et al., 2011</xref>) and we manually ensured that all variants had the SB allele as reference and Sb allele as alternative. To test the effect of sample size differences between populations we downsampled the South American dataset to 7 pairs of SB and Sb males, matching the sample size in the North American dataset.</p><p>We extracted SNPs shared between South and North American populations using BCFtools isec v1.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2009</xref>). We then used SNPeff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cingolani et al., 2012</xref>) to characterize the effects of individual SNPs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Estimating read counts from alternate supergene variants in heterozygous individuals</title><p>Because the reference genome for <italic>S. invicta</italic> is based on an SB individual, read mapping could be biased towards the SB variant in heterozygous individuals, resulting in false positive detection of allelic bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castel et al., 2015</xref>). To overcome this potential artifact, we called BCFtools consensus v1.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2009</xref>) once using North American Sb males and once using South American Sb males. We then aligned the RNAseq reads from each sample to the regular reference genome (version gnG; RefSeq GCF_000188075.1) and also, independently, to the most relevant of the modified references. For the reads from the Taiwanese population, we used the Sb reference using North American SNPs. For the alignment we used STAR with the same parameters as described above. We merged the two resulting BAM files from each sample using SAMtools v1.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2009</xref>). We then used the ‘rmdup’ function from the WASP pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soneson et al., 2015</xref>) to generate reference-bias free alignment files. The resulting BAM files can be considered reference bias free alignments. We added a reading group ID to each reference-bias free BAM file using the ‘AddOrReplaceReadGroups’ tool from Picard (v 2.7.0-SNAPSHOT; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>). We then ran all BAM files through GATK’s ‘ASEReadCounter’ v 3.6–0-g89b7209 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wright et al., 2017</xref>) with default options to obtain read counts for each allele. We performed this step once on each population independently.</p><p>We then imported the resulting allele-specific SNP read counts per sample generated by GATK into R v3.4.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">R Development Core Team, 2017</xref>). We used the R packages ‘GenomicRanges’ v1.26.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>) and ‘GenomicFeatures’ v1.26.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>) along with the NCBI protein-coding gene annotation for <italic>S. invicta</italic> to identify which SNPs are in which genes. We estimated the total expression level for a particular allele (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the SB or Sb variant for any given gene) as the median of all SNP-specific read counts per gene and per variant. For instance, consider a gene with three fixed SNPs between SB and Sb for which the SB variants have support from 12, 15 and 18 reads, and the Sb variants from 5, 8 and 6 reads. In this particular case, we would report that the SB variant for this gene has an expression level of 15 reads and the Sb variant, six reads. If instead of this approach, we randomly select one of the possible SNPs for every gene, we find qualitatively similar results to those reported.</p><p>Additionally, to test whether we would be able to detect allele-specific expression changes across body parts and castes in the South American data, we calculated allele-specific expression in the whole genome as a positive control. We used the VCF file containing all SNPs in the 26 males collected from South America. We retained only SNPs with expression data in all samples and a median of at least 1 X RNA coverage in each allele across all samples. After filtering, 1096 SNPs remained for which we were able to test for allele-specific expression. We performed an allele specific expression analysis throughout the whole genome using body part and caste information from South American populations. Unlike the analysis of genes in the supergene region, in the whole genome analysis we cannot ensure that every individual is heterozygous for all SNPs. Indeed, the average frequency in the population for all the alleles analyzed was 0.41 with a standard deviation of ±0.2. This implies that both alleles were not necessarily present in all samples. We therefore had far less power to detect allele-specific expression across body parts using data from the whole genome than using SNPs from the supergene region only. Despite this lack of power, we were able to detect significant (Wald test BH adjusted p&lt;0.05) allele-specific expression changes across body parts of queens and workers in 15 SNPs. These significant SNPs were distributed across nine genomic scaffolds. The significant differences in allele-specific expression were between a queen body part and whole bodies of workers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Identifying expression differences between the SB and Sb variants of the supergene</title><p>We imported the estimated read counts generated by Kallisto into R using Tximport v1.2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soneson et al., 2015</xref>) and DESeq2 v1.14.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Love et al., 2014</xref>). For every sample, read counts for the SB alleles and for the Sb alleles come from the same sequencing library, thus standard normalization methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dillies et al., 2013</xref>) are not applicable. As recommended by the developers of DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Love, 2018</xref>), we thus deactivated normalization by setting SizeFactors = 1. For the North American and Taiwanese datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wurm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fontana et al., 2020</xref>), we only considered genes expressed in all samples for downstream analyses, whereas for the South American populations RNA dataset, we only analyzed genes expressed in all replicates of at least one body part.</p><p>To have the strongest possible analysis of expression between the SB and Sb variants of the supergene region, we performed a joint analysis of RNAseq data from Taiwanese, South and North American populations. The South American dataset includes body part information, which is absent in the North American dataset. We applied a linear mixed effects model on the log2 of the expression ratios between SB and Sb across populations and body parts, using the R packages lme4 v1.1–18.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2014</xref>) and lmerTest v3.1–0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuznetsova et al., 2017</xref>). We fitted the log2 expression ratios using a 0 intercept with gene, population and their interaction as fixed effects, and the interaction between gene and body part as random effects (formula: log2 expression ratio ~0 + gene * population + (1|body part:gene)).</p><p>We also performed an additional linear mixed-effects model to test the effect of geography and ancestry on the allele-specific expression patterns within the supergene. We grouped the populations by geographical proximity (North and South America <italic>vs</italic>. Taiwan) or by phylogenetic proximity (Taiwan and North America <italic>vs</italic>. South America). We then fitted the log2 expression ratios using a 0 intercept, the main effects of gene, ancestry and geographic proximity and the interactions between ancestry and gene and between geographic proximity and gene as fixed effects. As random effects we used again the interaction between gene and body part (formula: log2 expression ratio ~0 + gene * ancestry + gene * geography + (1|body_part:gene)). We then performed an analysis of variance on the model to estimate the size effects of each term.</p><p>For both models, the log2 expression ratios were weighed by a function of the total read counts per gene to reduce the impacts of genes with low expression which have extremely high variance. Here we only report the results of the fixed effects per gene after adjustment of p values for multiple testing following the Benjamini-Hochberg approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). For this joint analysis we only used genes that had fixed differences between SB and Sb in all three populations.</p><p>We additionally analyzed the allele-specific expression patterns between the SB and Sb variants of the supergene in each population independently using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Love et al., 2014</xref> following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castel et al., 2015</xref>. The model formula used for the South American RNA-seq data used ‘body part’ and ‘colony of origin’ as blocking factors, and allele-specific expression, that is ‘variant effect’, as variable of interest. This analysis allowed us to detect differences in expression between variants specific to body part. Preliminary analyses showed that the interaction between ‘variant effect’ and ‘body part’ had no significant effect in any of the genes, and consequently, only the main ‘variant effect’ was considered as the factor of interest for this analysis. The model formula for both the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wurm et al., 2011</xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fontana et al., 2020</xref> RNA-seq datasets included only whole bodies of queens. We thus used ‘sample’ as a blocking factor and ‘variant effect’ as variable of interest.</p><p>In all analyses, we report gene differences between variants as log2 expression ratios between the SB and the Sb counts. That is, genes with expression biased towards SB will produce positive log2 expression ratios whereas those biased towards Sb will produce a negative value. To check whether there was an overall bias towards either variant, we tested the significance of the deviation from 0 for the median log2 expression ratios between SB and Sb via a Wilcoxon sum rank test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Expression differences between single-queen and multiple-queen colonies</title><p>We determined the expression levels for all samples from the North American populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morandin et al., 2016</xref>) by using the count mode in Kallisto v0.44.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bray et al., 2016</xref>) using <italic>S. invicta</italic> coding sequences.

diverse traits, including colour patterns, parasite resistance and, as in the current study, social interaction. We know very little about the early evolution of such supergenes. The study by Martinez-Ruiz et al. addresses this topic, studying the social supergenes of the red fire ant with the help of gene expressing experiments. The authors report a complex history of the evolution of this supergene including signatures of adaptive evolution, gene degeneration and gene-specific dosage compensation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Genomic architecture and evolutionary conflict drive allele-specific expression in red fire ant's social supergene&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The study uses a combination of population genomics and gene expression to characterize the differences among the two functional types of the gene. For this, the authors used a combination of different data sets (some new, some earlier published). Consistent with the relatively young age of this supergene, most variation in the super gene haplotypes is not associated with the phenotype. Also expected, the haplotypes suffer from degeneration, a phenomenon related to the absence of recombination and the increased likelihood of accumulation of deleterious mutations. Finally, a relatively small number of genes carry the signature of functional haplotypes, associated with the phenotypes. Interestingly, these signatures are consistent with the idea that the evolution of the supergene is driven by conflict. All in all, this is a solid study and I think it is of interest for many readers of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The study is well done and technically sound. The combination of different methods and different datasets places particular strength on the analysis. The results are appropriately discussed and placed in the light of other super genes known from a number of very different systems. I have no comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript reports analyses on gene expression in the supergene controlling social structure in the red fire ant to explore whether differences in gene expression between the two haplotypes can be due to antagonistic selection or degeneration of the non-recombining haplotype. The questions are very interesting, the biological model is fascinating and the dataset is important. However, there is some room for improvement, in particular regarding clarity and interpretation, as detailed below.</p><p>– The Abstract is frustrating, it would be good to indicate what kind of evidence are provided in favor of each of the two hypotheses. Actually, the Introduction, and even the Results, are not clear either on the specific hypotheses tested and how they can be tested. It only becomes clear in the conclusion how the hypotheses were tested and how the results allow inferring the two types of selection. I would recomment to be clear in the Abstract and the end of the conclusion about what kinds of tests will be run and what results would support what hypothesis. Also in the Results section, help the reader to interpret the raw results.

This is an interesting approach. This paper presents a large amount of data on gene expression, placed in an interesting context of supergene evolution and possibly allele degeneration. I like the idea that degeneration can be studied by exploring the possibility of dosage compensation.</p><p>I have two main points to raise regarding how the approach is explained and justified.</p><p>The first point is that the authors do not explain well enough why they seem to equate over-expression with adaptive variation in expression. It seems that in many places over-expression of genes in a particular compartment (body part, or cast, or genotype, etc.) is seen and presented as an indication that this gene is advantageous in that context. I can think of many genes whose overexpression is deleterious or lethal, and in many cases of alleles for which repressed expression is advantageous. It is also not clear why under- and over-expression should not be equally likely when it comes to mutations affecting regulatory regions, since transcription factors can also suppress gene expression; therefore, mutations that cannot be purged despite their deleterious effects could equally be mutations with a positive or negative effect on expression. The idea that an unpurged mutation is more likely to have a loss of function effect is also not so obvious, at least in the case of non-coding mutations. This idea that the direction of change in expression due to mutations indicates its adaptive value lingers in the manuscript, and while this may reflect a misinterpretation on my part, I suggest that the authors clearly explain, from the outset, what the expectations are as to what constitutes an expected adaptive response through variation in expression, and test it accordingly.</p><p>The second point is that the authors try to disentangle the effect of the social phenotype and supergene genotype, but the situation is not symmetrical because of the lethality of the Sb/Sb genotypes and the dominance of Sb. It may be expected that genes with an overexpression in an Sb genotype are only overexpressed in multiqueen colonies. Again, this may reflect my lack of knowledge of the system, but I think the authors should explain in more detail how they can eliminate the expected correlation between the Sb genotype and social form.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55862.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a rich paper with a lot of information, including various sources of information to create a complex picture.

We applied them to our system with some caveats. The system studied by Ma et al., 2020 determines mating types; it is thus not thought to be affected by evolutionary antagonism, whereas ours is. In addition, their system is older and contains evolutionary strata, unlike the fire ant supergene. Such differences could reduce potential signals. Furthermore, we lack genomes from sister species to test as many features as Ma et al. did. Despite all this, we were able to test whether there is a gene-level link between sequence degeneration and reduced expression. For this, we now compare allelic bias with the numbers of nonsynonymous mutations for each gene (in Figure 4—figure supplement 2). We additionally perform a linear regression to test whether increased gene degeneration in Sb leads to an overall SB bias. We find that genes with more nonsynonymous mutations are more biased towards SB expression, supporting Sb degeneration. In addition, we now compare changes in expression between social forms across a set of categories of SB/Sb allele bias (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). We find that relative expression between social forms remains constant across different levels of SB bias, adding further evidence for dosage compensation of SB. These results are described in subsection “Genes with no social bias tend to have allele-specific expression biased towards the SB variant”, and discussed in subsection “The effects of gene degeneration on supergene expression patterns”. We describe how these analyses were performed in subsection “Expression differences between variants and social forms”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>This is a very rich paper with a complex analysis of gene expression, in which the authors use caste, social form, supergene genotype and geography to understand how variation in expression of genes forming the so-called social supergene can be used to unravel the evolution of supergene alleles.

There is now indeed some evidence that it can occur at low frequency (Ross and Shoemaker, 2018). Hill-Robertson effects due to suppressed recombination make selection less efficient. Consequently, a broader range of mildly deleterious mutations would remain, but highly deleterious mutations will still be selected against. Bearing this clarification in mind, while we agree that some random mutations can increase expression, we disagree with the idea that over- and under- expression are equally likely. It is thought that most de novo mutations are mildly deleterious and therefore one can expect that mutations rather decrease expression due to impacting regulatory sequences, transcription factor binding sites or other functionally relevant sequences. The opposite effect seems to be less likely and may only involve mutations in specific regulatory (suppressor) sequences or need to involve very specific point mutations with transcription-increasing effects (Loewe and Hill, 2010). Genes with high expression generally show markers of adaptive selection such as slower evolution (e.g. Harrison, Wright and Mank, 2012; Pál, Papp and Hurst, 2001; Fraser, Moses and Schadt, 2010). In addition, previous studies show that genes in degenerating regions have lower expression levels (Xu et al., 2019; Pucholt et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2020).</p><p>Importantly, we would like to clarify that the patterns we refer to are general patterns – for multiple genes. We do not feel that expression patterns alone are sufficient do demonstrate that changes in any individual gene are adaptive or detrimental. What we mean instead is that, overall, we expect that groups of genes affected by gene degeneration will have general patterns of lower expression. Conversely, in general, highly expressed genes would be more likely to be adaptive than detrimental. We now describe these assumptions in more detail in the Introduction. Additionally, we have now added Figure 4—figure supplement 2, which shows with our data that genes with more nonsynonymous mutations in Sb are more likely to be biased towards SB, indicating that gene degeneration tends to result in lower Sb expression levels (as recommended above). Finally, we now discuss (subsection “Dosage compensation in the social supergene”) the potential mechanisms by which the phenotypic effects of gene degeneration could have arisen in such a young system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second point is that the authors try to disentangle the effect of the social phenotype and supergene genotype, but the situation is not symmetrical because of the lethality of the Sb/Sb genotypes and the dominance of Sb. It may be expected that genes with an overexpression in an Sb genotype are only overexpressed in multiqueen colonies. Again, this may reflect my lack of knowledge of the system, but I think the authors should explain in more detail how they can eliminate the expected correlation between the Sb genotype and social form.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, the reviewer raises a very good point. We have now re-written the Introduction and Discussion to focus on addressing the issue raised. The data and tests used for Figure 3 (previously Figure 4) show that the observed pattern of differences in expression between social forms are unlikely to be due solely to differences in expression levels between the SB and Sb alleles. We show that patterns of expression differences between social forms are better explained if we allow for an overall higher expression level of the SB alleles when Sb expression is low. Much of the observed SB bias results in no differences in expression between social forms. In other words, social bias cannot be directly linked to allelic bias in the supergene. In addition, in Figure 2B we show that the patterns of expression differences are similar between social forms within and outside the supergene. This result further supports the idea that patterns of social bias are more or less independent of allelic bias within the supergene.</p><p>Given these results, we conclude that there is not a direct link between allele expression level differences between SB and Sb and social bias in the supergene. We discuss these results in more detail in subsections “Overrepresentation of socially biased genes in the social supergene” and “Genes with no social bias tend to have allele-specific expression biased towards the SB variant” in the Results section and in “Supergene expression patterns consistent with antagonistic selection” in the Discussion section.</p><p><bold>References</bold></p><p>Fraser, Hunter B., Alan M.
