indispensable for development of the dendritic arbor of neurons. We show that, surprisingly, the action of single actin filament-promoting factors was insufficient for powering dendritogenesis. Instead, this required the actin nucleator Cobl and its only evolutionary distant ancestor Cobl-like acting interdependently. This coordination between Cobl-like and Cobl was achieved by physical linkage by syndapins. Syndapin I formed nanodomains at convex plasma membrane areas at the base of protrusive structures and interacted with three motifs in Cobl-like, one of which was Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-regulated. Consistently, syndapin I, Cobl-like’s newly identified N terminal calmodulin-binding site and the single Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-responsive syndapin-binding motif all were critical for Cobl-like’s functions. In dendritic arbor development, local Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-controlled actin dynamics thus relies on regulated and physically coordinated interactions of different F-actin formation-promoting factors and only together they have the power to bring about the sophisticated neuronal morphologies required for neuronal network formation in mammals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>actin nucleators</kwd><kwd>functional cooperation of actin nucleators</kwd><kwd>Ca2+-steered</kwd><kwd>F-actin-supported neuronal morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>F-BAR domain protein syndapin I</kwd><kwd>dendritic branch initiation sites</kwd><kwd>development of the dendritic arbor of neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KE685/4-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kessels</surname><given-names>Michael M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>QU116/6-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qualmann</surname><given-names>Britta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>QU116/9-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qualmann</surname><given-names>Britta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Extended biochemical and functional analyses in primary neurons show that early neuronal morphogenesis critically relies on cooperation of the actin nucleator Cobl and its ancestor Cobl-like and uncover their cooperative mechanisms at dendritic branch initiation sites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The actin cytoskeleton is crucial for a huge variety of key processes in cell biology. Yet, only few factors were found that can promote the de novo formation of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chesarone and Goode, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qualmann and Kessels, 2009</xref>). Thus, the initial idea that each of the discovered actin nucleators may be responsible for the formation of specific, perhaps tissue- or cell-type-specific F-actin structures obviously had to be dismissed as too simple. Theoretically, the required functional diversity in actin filament formation despite a limited set of powerful effectors could be achieved by combinatory mechanisms specific for a given cell biological process. However, experimental evidence for such combinatory actions of actin nucleators is still very sparse. On top of that, which mechanisms may orchestrate these powerful effectors to bring about a certain cellular processes also remains a fundamental question in cell biology.</p><p>Neurons need to extend elaborate cellular protrusions – the single signal-sending axon and multiple signal-receiving, highly branched dendrites – to form neuronal networks. These very demanding and specialized cellular morphogenesis processes are driven by the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kessels et al., 2011</xref>). The formation of the dendritic arbor involves local Ca<sup>2+</sup> and calmodulin (CaM) signals coinciding with transient F-actin formation by the evolutionary young actin nucleator Cobl (Cordon-bleu) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahuja et al., 2007</xref>) at dendritic branch induction sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2015</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM regulates both Cobl’s loading with monomeric actin and its different modes of plasma membrane association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2015</xref>). Cobl is furthermore regulated via arginine methylation by PRMT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hou et al., 2018</xref>). All of these aspects were required for Cobl’s crucial role in dendritic arbor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahuja et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haag et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hou et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, also Cobl’s evolutionary distant ancestor Cobl-like (COBLL1; Coblr1) was recently discovered to be important for Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-controlled neuromorphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izadi et al., 2018</xref>). While Cobl uses three Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein Homology 2 (WH2) domains to nucleate actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahuja et al., 2007</xref>), Cobl-like employs a unique combinatory mechanism of G-actin binding by its single, C terminal WH2 domain and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-promoted association with the actin-binding protein Abp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kessels et al., 2000</xref>) to promote F-actin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izadi et al., 2018</xref>). Cobl-like was also found to interact with cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and to shape prostate cancer cells by not yet fully clear mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takayama et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that Cobl and Cobl-like work at the same nascent dendritic branch sites in a strictly interdependent manner choreographed by physically bridging by the membrane-binding F-BAR protein syndapin I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qualmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Itoh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dharmalingam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schwintzer et al., 2011</xref>), which we identified to interact with Cobl-like and to specifically occur in nanoclusters at the convex membrane surfaces at the base of nascent membrane protrusions of developing neurons. The finding that one of the three syndapin binding sites of Cobl-like was regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM unveiled a further important mechanism of local control and coordination of actin dynamics in neuromorphogenesis.</p><p>Our work thereby provides insights into how two actin filament formation-promoting components – each critical for dendritic arbor formation – power actin-mediated dendritic branch initiation in a strictly coordinated manner and how this process can be directly linked to local membrane shaping to give rise to the complex morphologies required for proper neuronal network formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cobl-like and the actin nucleator Cobl largely phenocopy each other in their critical role in dendritic arborization and seem to work at the same dendritic branching sites</title><p>The actin nucleator Cobl and its evolutionary ancestor protein Cobl-like are molecularly quite distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), however, both critical for dendritic arbor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahuja et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izadi et al., 2018</xref>). Side-by-side loss-of-function analysis of both factors in developing primary hippocampal neurons using IMARIS software-based evaluations for detailed analyses of the elaborate morphology of such cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izadi et al., 2018</xref>) revealed surprisingly similar phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Dendritic branch and terminal point numbers as well as total dendritic length all were severely affected by lack of Cobl-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–G</xref>). Corresponding Cobl loss-of-function showed that, while dendritic growth processes seemed largely unaffected by Cobl deficiency, also Cobl deficiency led to a significant reduction of terminal points and in particular to severe loss of dendritic branch points. With −35%, these defects were about as strong as those caused by Cobl-like RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–G</xref>). Cobl RNAi mostly affected dendritic arborization in proximal areas, as demonstrated by evaluations of morphological intersections with concentric circles of increasing size (Sholl analysis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sholl, 1953</xref>). Cobl-like RNAi led to reduced Sholl intersections throughout the dendritic arbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>).</p><p>The phenotypical comparison of Cobl and Cobl-like unveiled that both cytoskeletal effectors have somewhat similar functions in dendritic arborization. Colocalization studies showed that Flag-mCherry-Cobl and GFP-Cobl-like did not show any obvious spatial segregation (neither in proximal nor in peripheral dendritic arbor of developing neurons) but largely colocalized. Dendritic accumulations of Cobl usually showed corresponding albeit less pronounced accumulations of Cobl-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; arrows).

Functional redundancy and/or parallel action seemed unlikely, because both individual loss-of-function DIV4-to-DIV6 phenotypes were so severe that about a third of the entire arborization normally reached at DIV6 was lacking (Cobl, −33%; Cobl-like, −39%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Thus, we focused on the remaining hypotheses.</p><p>Interestingly, Cobl-like-driven dendritic arborization was completely impaired by the lack of Cobl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–I</xref>). Dendritic branch point numbers, terminal point numbers, and the total dendritic arbor length of neurons cotransfected with GFP-Cobl-like and Cobl RNAi all were significantly below the values of neurons cotransfected with Cobl-like and scrambled RNAi. The suppression of the Cobl-like gain-of-function effects by Cobl RNAi was so strong that under the chosen condition (only 34 hr expression; GFP coexpression), all three parameters were indistinguishable from control levels. As under the chosen conditions neurons subjected to only Cobl RNAi (+GFP expression) for comparison showed a dendritic arbor development with all three parameters evaluated at about control levels, these experiments permitted the clear conclusion that the effects of Cobl RNAi in Cobl-like-overexpressing neurons did not reflect putative independent and thus merely additive effects on dendritic arborization but clearly represented a full suppression of Cobl-like’s functions in dendritic branching in the absence of Cobl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>).</p><p>To our surprise, likewise, Cobl-promoted dendritic arbor formation turned out to be massively affected by absence of Cobl-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–M</xref>). The dendritic parameters of developing neurons expressing Cobl and Cobl-like RNAi did not show any Cobl gain-of-function phenotype but were statistically not significantly different from those of control or Cobl-like RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N–P</xref>). The fact that the suppressive effects of Cobl-like RNAi on Cobl gain-of-function clearly exceeded the effects of Cobl-like RNAi alone (GFP+Cobl-like RNAi) allowed us to firmly conclude that Cobl functions in dendritic arbor formation depended on Cobl-like. This conclusion was further underscored by the fact that GFP-Cobl+Cobl-like RNAi and GFP+Cobl-like RNAi were statistically not different from each other in any of the three parameters. The lack of any Cobl effects upon coexpression of Cobl-like RNAi thus represented a full and direct suppression of all Cobl functions in the absence of Cobl-like.</p><p>Taken together, Cobl and Cobl-like both are cellular factors promoting actin filament formation and significantly differ in their properties, yet, in dendritic branch formation, they do not work independently but surprisingly strongly depend on each other.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cobl-like associates with syndapins</title><p>The surprising functional interdependence of Cobl and Cobl-like in dendritic arbor formation raised the question how this may be organized mechanistically with two proteins that seem to employ quite different molecular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahuja et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izadi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Using a variety of different methods, we failed to observe any obvious interactions of Cobl and Cobl-like (also see below).

Here, we show that this fundamental process is powered by the coordinated, strictly interdependent action of two components, which both promote the formation of actin filaments at the cell cortex, the actin nucleator Cobl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahuja et al., 2007</xref>) and its only distant relative Cobl-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izadi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Cobl-like is already present in bilateria and considered as an evolutionary ancestor of the actin nucleator Cobl. Yet, we did not observe any redundant or additive functions in dendritic arborization of developing neurons. Instead, Cobl and Cobl-like both enriched at the same nascent dendritic branching sites and their functions were cooperative and each crucial for dendritic branch induction. Our findings that Cobl-like interacts with the F-BAR domain protein syndapin I providing links to Cobl and that the syndapin I-binding N terminal part of Cobl-like is regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM signaling in a positive manner unveil the mechanisms of the striking functional interdependence of Cobl and Cobl-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>The identified syndapin/Cobl-like interactions were mediated by three ‘KRAP’ motif-containing regions in Cobl-like and the SH3 domain of syndapin I.

They furthermore show similarity to those of Cobl (consensus, KrRAPpPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schwintzer et al., 2011</xref>), as well as to other mapped syndapin I binding sites, such as RRQAPPPP in dynamin I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anggono and Robinson, 2007</xref>), RKKAPPPPKR in ProSAP1/Shank2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>), and KKPPPAKPVIP in the glycine receptor beta subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">del Pino et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Coprecipitation of endogenous syndapin I with Cobl-like from brain extracts, coimmunoprecipitations of endogenous Cobl-like and syndapin I from mouse brain lysates, as well as visual proof of complex formation in intact cells underscore the in vivo relevance of the Cobl-like/syndapin I interactions we identified.</p><p>Syndapin I/Cobl-like interactions clearly were of functional importance, as syndapin I deficiency completely suppressed Cobl-like-mediated dendritic arbor formation. In line, syndapin I accumulated together with Cobl-like at nascent dendritic branch sites and membrane-bound syndapin I clusters were found at convex membrane curvatures at the base of protrusions in developing neurons. With their topology changes in different directions, these membrane areas fit the structure of the membrane-binding F-BAR domain of syndapin I, which seems unique among the BAR protein superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qualmann et al., 2011</xref>) and shows overall curvature but also a strongly kinked tilde shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We furthermore demonstrated biochemically and in intact cells that Cobl-like and Cobl can physically be interconnected by syndapin I acting as a bridge. Physical interconnection of Cobl and Cobl-like by syndapin I provides a plausible molecular mechanism for the striking functional interdependence of Cobl and Cobl-like and is in line with syndapin I/Cobl interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schwintzer et al., 2011</xref>) as well as with syndapin I’s F-BAR domain-mediated self-association ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kessels and Qualmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shimada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This would leave the SH3 domain of each syndapin I free for recruiting effector proteins, for spatially organizing them at specific, curved membrane areas at nascent dendritic branch sites and for thereby coordinating their functions in dendritic branch induction. Consistently, all three components of complexes composed of Cobl-like, syndapin I, and Cobl showed spatial coordination at branch induction sites. These data were in line with previous reports of accumulations of Cobl-like and of Cobl at dendritic branch induction sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izadi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2015</xref>). Our quantitative determinations of the time points of maximal accumulation prior to dendritic branch induction also demonstrated that, besides being spatially coordinated, both cytoskeletal components and syndapin I interlinking them also are temporally coordinated during dendritic arborization and accumulate together −40 to −25 s prior to dendritic branch induction.</p><p>Importantly, we found that the interlinkage of Cobl-like and Cobl was not static. The Cobl-like/syndapin I interaction was regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. This is well in line with the involvement of transient, local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in dendritic arborization of developing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rajan and Cline, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fink et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaudillière et al., 2004</xref>), with the spatial and temporal coordination of CaM with all of these players at nascent dendritic branch points and with membrane targeting and cytoskeletal functions of Cobl also being controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2015</xref>). The additional Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM regulation of the Cobl-like/syndapin I interface would now provide another key regulatory mechanism right at the interlinking bridge between Cobl and Cobl-like.</p><p>The regulatory mechanism is based on an N terminal stretch of amino acids of Cobl-like proteins in front of the so-called Cobl Homology domain, which is absent in Cobl proteins. With ‘KRAP1’, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling allowed for the modulation of specifically one out of three syndapin I binding sites of Cobl-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This particular, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-regulated syndapin I binding interface played an important role in the recruitment of Cobl-like to the cell cortex of developing neurons. The decline of the cortical Cobl-like localization we observed upon ‘KRAP’ motif 1 deletion suggested that, at least in the cell body, Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are usually high enough to ensure that first ‘KRAP motif’ binds to some syndapin I and that the ‘KRAP’ motif 1 is important for interactions with the plasma membrane-binding and shaping protein syndapin I in developing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G–I</xref>). Importantly, Cobl-like mutants, which either solely lacked the N terminal CaM-binding site or the single Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-regulated syndapin binding ‘KRAP1’, both completely failed to rescue Cobl-like loss-of-function phenotypes in dendritic branching. Thus, explicitly the N terminal CaM association regulating the ‘KRAP1’/syndapin I interaction and consistently also the ‘KRAP1’ were absolutely critical for Cobl-like’s functions in dendritogenesis.</p><p>Our data clearly show that dendritic arborization of developing neurons requires the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM- and syndapin I-coordinated, joined action of Cobl and Cobl-like. In other cells and/or cellular processes, Cobl and Cobl-like also seem to have their independent, individual functions, such as the critical role of Cobl in F-actin formation right beneath the sensory apparatus of outer hair cells in the inner ear, the loss of which correlated with defects in pericentriolar material organization, in postnatal planar cell polarity refinement and in hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haag et al., 2018</xref>). Further studies of <italic>Cobl</italic> knock-out (KO) mice unveiled an importance of Cobl for a specialized set of filaments interconnecting structural elements in the F-actin-rich terminal web of microvilli-decorated epithelial cells in the small intestine. However, there were no indications of an additional Cobl-like involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beer et al., 2020</xref>). Also in proteomic analyses of myoblasts, which upon IGFN1 deficiency show altered G-to-F-actin ratios, only Cobl was identified but not Cobl-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cracknell et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Likewise, apart from dendritic branching of neurons studied here, there are no hints on any Cobl roles in functions that the <italic>Cobl-like</italic> (Cobll-1) gene has been linked to, such as diabetes and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mancina et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>).

It is therefore well conceivable that a joined action of both Cobl and Cobl-like is required to promote actin filament formation at locally restricted sites to drive further branching. It currently seems plausible that Cobl and Cobl-like’s different actin filament formation mechanisms – spatial rearrangement of three actin monomers by the three WH2 domains of Cobl generating actin nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahuja et al., 2007</xref>) <italic>versus</italic> use of the single WH2 domain of Cobl-like and the actin-binding cofactor Abp1 in a structurally not fully understood trans-mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izadi et al., 2018</xref>) – and their different modes of regulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izadi et al., 2018</xref>) represent the distinct functions of Cobl and Cobl-like that have to be combined to power dendritic arborization.

Our mechanistic and functional studies clearly demonstrate that with Cobl and Cobl-like shaping neurons into their complex morphologies involves regulated and physically coordinated interactions of different actin filament formation-promoting factors at the base of nascent dendritic protrusion sites.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA constructs</title><p>Plasmids encoding for GFP-Cobl-like and parts thereof were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izadi et al., 2018</xref>) and generated by PCR using the EST clone UniProtID Q3UMF0 as template, respectively.

In brief, neurons prepared from hippocampi of E18 rats were seeded at densities of about 60,000/well (24-well plate) and 200,000/well (12-well plate), respectively. Cells were cultured in Neurobasal medium containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 1× B27, and 1 µM/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The neurons were maintained at 37°C with 90% humidity and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Transfections were done in antibiotic-free medium using 2 µl Lipofectamine 2000 and 1 µg DNA per well in 24-well plates. After 4 hr, the transfection medium was replaced by conditioned medium and neurons were cultured further. All analyses were done with several independent neuronal preparations.</p><p>Fixation was done in 4% (w/v) PFA in PBS pH 7.4 at RT for 5 min. Permeabilization and blocking were done with 10% (v/v) horse serum, 5% (w/v) BSA in PBS with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 (blocking solution). Antibody incubations were done in the same buffer without Triton X-100 according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kessels et al., 2001</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pinyol et al., 2007</xref>. In brief, neurons were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 hr at RT and washed three times with blocking solution. Afterward, they were incubated with secondary antibodies (1 hr, RT). Finally, the coverslips were washed with blocking solution, PBS and water and mounted onto coverslips using Moviol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Quantitative analyses of dendrites of primary hippocampal neurons</title><p>Comparative Cobl and Cobl-like loss-of-function analyses were done 46 hr subsequent to transfection at DIV4 to allow for clear development of loss-of-function phenotypes. For Cobl-like loss-of-function analyses and corresponding rescue experiments, 37 hr post-transfection (transfection at DIV4) was sufficient for loss-of-function phenotypes to clearly develop.</p><p>For suppressions of Cobl-like overexpression phenotypes, DIV4 hippocampal neurons were transfected with RNAi against Cobl, RNAi against syndapin I and control vectors, respectively, and fixed and immunostained about 34 hr later (DIV5.5). Suppression of Cobl overexpression phenotypes by Cobl-like RNAi was analyzed similarly. Due to the shorter time frame and/or due to the lower expression caused by cotransfection of two plasmids, the suppression effects exceed the effects of the RNAi effects alone evaluated in comparison. This experimental design helps to exclude putative merely additive, unrelated effects of the two manipulations working in opposite directions and simplifies the evaluation of whether a given knock-down can indeed suppress the function of GFP-Cobl and Cobl-like, respectively.</p><p>Two to six independent coverslips per condition per assay and neurons of at least two independent neuronal preparations were analyzed based on the anti-MAP2 immunostaining of transfected neurons.</p><p>Transfected neurons were sampled systematically on each coverslip. Morphometric measurements were based on anti-MAP2 immunolabeling of transfected neurons to identify dendrites.</p><p>Using IMARIS 7.6 software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007370">SCR_007370</ext-link>), the number of dendritic branching points, dendritic terminal points, and dendritic filament length was determined and Sholl analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sholl, 1953</xref>) were conducted according to procedures established previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izadi et al., 2018</xref>). For each neuron, a ‘filament’ (morphological trace) was drawn by IMARIS 7.6 software using the following settings: largest diameter, cell body diameter; thinnest diameter, 0.2 µm; start seed point, 1.5× of cell body diameter; disconnected points, 2 µm; minimum segment size, 10 µm. Immunopositive areas that were erroneously spliced by IMARIS or protrusions belonging to different cells as well as filament branch points that the software erroneously placed inside of the cell body were manually removed from the filament. Parameters determined were saved as Excel files and subjected to statistical significance calculations using GraphPad Prism5 and Prism6 software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Quantitative, visual assessments of subcellular distributions</title><p>Quantitative determinations of the subcellular distribution of Cobl-like and the ∆KRAP1 mutant thereof were done using line scans across Apotome sections of the cell bodies of developing hippocampal neurons similar to methods described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schwintzer et al., 2011</xref>). The neurons were transfected at DIV4, immunostained for MAP2, and imaged 37 hr later. Cobl-like and the ∆KRAP1 mutant thereof were analyzed in a Cobl-like-deficient background by expressing Cobl-like RNAi vectors that coexpressed RNAi-resistant WT GFP-Cobl-like* and GFP-Cobl-like*<sup>∆KRAP1</sup>, respectively. As described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schwintzer et al., 2011</xref>), the fluorescence intensities reached in cortical areas were extracted from the line scans and expressed in relation to the average intensity of an ROI covering a large part of the cytoplasmic area of the neuron.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Freeze-fracturing and immunogold labeling</title><p>Hippocampal neurons were grown for 7 days on poly-D-lysine-coated sapphire disks (diameter 4 mm; Rudolf Brügger, Swiss Micro Technology) in 24-well plates, washed with PBS and subjected to ultrarapid freezing (4000 K/s) as well as to freeze-fracturing as described for mature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Freeze-fracturing of developing neurons led to low yields of rather fragile replica of inner and outer membrane leaflets, which, however, were preserved during subsequent washing, blocking, and incubation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wolf et al., 2019</xref>). Replica were incubated with guinea pig anti-syndapin I antibodies (1:50; overnight, 4°C) and 10 nm gold-conjugated secondary antibodies as described for mature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Controls addressing the specificity of anti-syndapin I labeling of freeze-fracture replica included evaluations of labeling at the E-face (almost no labeling) and quantitative analyses of syndapin I labeling densities at control surfaces not representing cellular membranes (low, unspecific immunogold labels at a density of only 0.4/µm<sup>2</sup>). Further controls including secondary antibody controls and labeling of syndapin I KO material were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Replica were collected and analyzed using transmission electron microscopy and systematic grid explorations as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seemann et al., 2017</xref>).

Anti-syndapin I immunogold labeling densities were determined using the complete area of the respective membrane topology on each image (measured using ImageJ [RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link>]).</p><p>Anti-syndapin I cluster analyses were conducted using circular ROIs of 70 nm diameter. Density of clusters at cylindrical and protrusive membranes were calculated considering ≥3 anti-syndapin I labels per ROI as one cluster.

Morphometric analyses were then conducted using IMARIS software.</p><p>All data were obtained from two to five independent neuronal preparations seeded onto several independent coverslips for each condition for transfection and immunostaining. For each condition, n numbers of individual neurons ranging from about 30 to 40 were aimed for to fully cover the biological variances of the cells.

Lower n numbers were only accepted for the established Cobl overexpression phenotype (n=24) and the Cobl-like-mediated suppression of it (also n=24), as results were clear and sacrificing further rats for further primary neuron preparations could thus be avoided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N–P</xref>).</p><p>Outliers or strongly scattering data reflect biological variance and were thus not excluded from the analyses.</p><p>All n numbers are reported directly in the figures of the manuscript and all are numbers of independent biological samples (i.e. neurons) or biochemical assays, as additional replicates to minimize measurement errors were not required because the technical errors were small in relation to the biological/biochemical variances. In live imaging analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), the n numbers given are dendritic branch induction events (18-21 from 4 to 12 neurons).

Your live-cell imaging data represent an important first effort to determine the temporal sequence of events occurring at the membrane.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Functional interdependence of the actin nucleator Cobl and Cobl-like in dendritic arbor development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has now been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Alphee Michelot as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. This decision letter is long and detailed, but main comments 1 to 4 should be easy to address and only main comments 5 and 6 would require additional experiments.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. Some results appear inconsistent between different Figures. For example, in Figure 1D, Cobl RNAi shifts numbers of dendritic branch points from 10 to 6, while in Figure 2E, Cobl RNAi leaves numbers of dendritic branch points pretty much unchanged (around 7 or 8). Could you make sure that all data are consistent between Figures or explain apparent inconsistencies?</p><p>2. We find experiments of Figure 2 insufficient to conclude that Cobl and Cobl-like factors depend strictly on each other. One could imagine scenarios where effects of Cobl or Cobl-like are highly concentration dependent, and lead to detectable effects in cells only below or above certain thresholds (especially for multi-domain binding proteins such as Cobl and Cobl-like, which are likely to undergo complex phase transition behaviors when clustering at the membrane).</p><p>Therefore, we would recommend here simply to be very careful with wording in the conclusions of these experiments.</p><p>Other mentions such as (line 328) &quot;their functions were cooperative&quot;, should also be avoided unless you provide further explanations; Mentions such as (line 101) &quot;Functional redundancy seemed unlikely, because both individual loss-of-function phenotypes were severe.&quot; should be explained so that readers can assess whether functional redundancy is indeed unlikely or not (for example by referencing a paper describing mild versus severe phenotypes).</p><p>3. Some findings presented in the current manuscript were already published. While it is perfectly logical to base a study on previous findings and results, in the current manuscript the fraction of findings already published in previous manuscripts is non-negligible, which in some ways hides the originality of the data presented in the study.</p><p>For instance, the findings that Cobl-like is involved in the formation of dendritic branches and its localization at branch points (Figure 1, current manuscript) were already showed in a previous article from your group (Izadi et al., JCB 2018; Figure 3, Figure 4). The coordination of Cobl-like and ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in this process was already demonstrated in the same article (Figure 9, CaM inhibitor CGS9343B), even though in the previous article you focused more on the Cter ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding site. Likewise, the coordinated role of Cobl and syndapin in the formation of dendritic branches and their localization at branch points was already demonstrated in previous studies (Schwintzer et al., EMBO J 2011; Hou et al., PlosBiol 2015). In these two articles you also demonstrated the crucial role of ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in that process.</p><p>As the current manuscript is very long (11 Figures), could you please present only new data and refer to previous papers when needed? We believe that this would give you an opportunity to limit the number of Figures and that the manuscript would overall gain in clarity.</p><p>4. The reviewers agree that a discussion on the role of various actin nucleation factors in neuronal development could benefit uninitiated readers. Could you also please discuss in more details other potential mechanisms of coordination between actin regulators based on your extensive previous studies and the existing literature?</p><p>5. In the present manuscript, you show, using fluorescence time-lapses, the co-localization of Cobl-like/Cobl, Cobl-like/Syndapin at branch points. In previous articles, your group demonstrated the localization at branching points of ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (using GCaMP), actin (using LifeAct), CaM, Cobl (Hou et al., Blos Biol 2015); co-localization of Cobl/Syndapin (Schwintzer et al., EMBO J 2011); co-localization of Cobl-like/Actin (LifeAct), Cobl-like/CaM (Izadi et al., JCB 2018).</p><p>However, in these previous studies and in the present manuscript, no quantifications were made concerning the spatio-temporal recruitments of these molecules. In this manuscript, it seems on top of that Cobl-like appears before syndapin, which would not be quite coherent with a recruitement of Cobl-like through syndapin.</p><p>Therefore, it would be important to quantify here more precisely the spatiotemporal relationship between Cobl, Cobl-like, syndapin and CaM (and ideally ca<sup>2+</sup>) during the formation of dendritic branches. This would require to record data at shorter time intervals, but you should have all the biological material necessary to do these experiments. You could use if possible the initiation of the protrusions as a time reference to then quantify the assembly and disassembly of the different molecular actors. This type of analysis has been performed previously for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (e.g. Taylor et al., Plos Biol 2011). For instance, you could measure evolutions of the fluorescence signals (e.g. fluorescence enrichment fluo foci/fluo outside) as a function of time before and after branch formation. It would also be very interesting to quantify the fraction of aborted or effective formation of branches according to the spatiotemporal evolution of the different molecular actors.</p><p>6. Another missing experiment in this story is whether this strong effect of ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in promoting Cobl-like's interaction with syndapin I through the first of the three &quot;KRAP&quot; motifs is indeed critical for Cobl-like recruitement at the membrane in cells. Could you provide experimental evidence that KRAP1 is directly involved in the ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-mediated recruitment of Cobl-like at the plasma membrane?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This work investigates at the molecular and cellular levels the functional dependence of two actin filament nucleation factors, Cobl and Cobl-like proteins, in the formation of protrusive dendritic structures. Depletion of Cobl or Cobl-like lead to roughly similar phenotypes; overexpression of Cobl or Cobl-like induces excessive dendrite formation when the other protein is expressed at normal levels, but not when this other protein is depleted. Altogether, these observations lead the authors to conclude that these proteins work strictly interdependently. The authors then investigate how Cobl and Cobl-like are recruited, and identify syndapin as an essential component to bring Cobl and Cobl-like together at the membrane. This interaction is beautifully documented through a large number of pulldown experiments in vitro, and critical domains for these interactions are identified. These interactions are also confirmed in physiological conditions through ectopic localization experiments of those components to mitochondria. Syndapin I is identified as clusters at dendritic initiation sites by electron microscopy and all three components colocalize at the same nascent dendritic branch sites. In the last part of the manuscript, the authors further document the interaction between Cobl-like and syndapin, and find that calcium-dependent calmodulin binding to Cobl-like increases syndapin I's association through the first of the three KRAP's domains.</p><p>Comments to be addressed in a revised manuscript:</p><p>1. Some results appear inconsistent between different Figures. For example, in Figure 1D, Cobl RNAi shifts numbers of dendritic branch points from 10 to 6, while in Figure 2E, Cobl RNAi leaves numbers of dendritic branch points pretty much unchanged (around 7 or 8). Could the authors make sure that all data are consistent between Figures or explain apparent inconsistencies?</p><p>2. I find experiments of Figure 1 and 2 insufficient to conclude that Cobl and Cobl-like factors depend strictly on each other. One could imagine many scenarios where effects of Cobl or Cobl-like are highly concentration dependent, and lead to detectable effects in cells below or under certain thresholds (especially for multi-domain binding proteins such as Cobl and Cobl-like, which are likely to undergo complex phase transition behaviors when clustering at the membrane). Therefore, I would recommend the authors to be very careful with wording and conclusions of their experiments, and stick to what can strictly be concluded.</p><p>Other mentions such as (line 328) &quot;their functions were cooperative&quot;, should also be avoided without any further explanations; Mentions such as (line 101) &quot;Functional redundancy seemed unlikely, because both individual loss-of-function phenotypes were severe.&quot; should be explained so that readers can assess whether functional redundancy is indeed unlikely or not (for example by referencing a paper describing mild versus severe phenotypes).</p><p>3. One missing experiment in this story is whether this important effect of ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM signaling promoting syndapin I's association with the first of the three &quot;KRAP&quot; motifs is key to account for Cobl-like's clustering at the plasma membrane. Could the authors measure the effect of calcium for Cobl-like (KRAP1 deleted) clustering at the plasma membrane (as compared to wild-type Cobl-like)?</p><p>4. I regret sometimes the lack of quantification for some experiments. For example, protein colocalization in cells should be quantified (for example by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficients of red and green signals at mitochondrial sites) because colocalization (or absence of) is not always obvious for non-expert eyes.</p><p>5. Figure 6 is beautiful, but I am wondering if these data could be exploited better. Is it possible to record data at shorter time intervals? It seems that Cobl-like appears before syndapin. Is that correct and if so, how is this coherent with a recruitement of Cobl-like through syndapin?</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1. Graph bar representation is not recommended nowadays. Please show individual data points with box and whisker plots to represent the variability of the data (and asymmetry of distributions). Also it would be useful to provide significance levels (α factors) in addition to p-values, and indicate exact α/p values in legends in addition of the stars in the Figures. On the contrary, statements such as &quot;highly statistically significantly&quot; (line 106) should be avoided. How p-values were calculated should also be mentioned.</p><p>2. Please make sure that all abbreviations are explained when mentioned first.</p><p>3. Mentions to unpublished efforts is not recommended anymore. Please show results from these efforts in a Supplementary Figure or do not mention them.</p><p>4. Please correct the following inaccuracy:</p><p>&quot;Two powerful molecular machines for actin filament formation&quot;: These proteins are not machines, because they do not consume energy to form new filaments.</p><p>5. Figure 5A: Is it possible to present both gels with the same molecular weight scale so that corresponding bands are aligned?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Izadi et al., &quot;Functional interdependence of the actin nucleator Cobl and Cobl-like in dendritic arbor development&quot; deals with the fundamental question of how actin regulators are orchestrated to control the formation of membranes protrusions during cells morphogenesis. In particular, the authors explored how actin nucleators are coordinated to trigger the formation of branches in neuronal dendritic arbor.</p><p>In that context, Cobl have a crucial role in dendritic arbor formation in neuronal cells. Cobl contains a repeat of three WH2 domains interacting with actin and enabling nucleation of new actin filaments (F-actin). The initial idea was that tandem repeat of WH2 domains could be sufficient to trigger F-actin nucleation. However, other studies have shown that the WH2 repeat of Cobl has no nucleation activity of its own. Importantly, Cobl activity was shown to work in coordination with other actin regulators including the F-actin-binding protein Abp1 (Haag, J Neuro 2012) and the BAR domain protein syndapin (Schwintzer, EMBO J 2011).</p><p>The manuscript of Izadi et al. builds on previous articles from the same group, in particular a study demonstrating that Cobl-like, an evolutionary ancestor of Cobl, is also crucial for dendritic branching (Izadi et al., 2018 JCB). This previous article showed that like Cobl (Haag, J Neuro 2012), Cobl-like protein works in coordination with the F-actin-binding protein Abp1 and ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM to promote dendritic branching through regulation of F-actin nucleation or/and assembly. In the current manuscript the authors showed that the two actin nucleators Cobl and Cobl-like proteins are interdependent to trigger dendritic branching.</p><p>The authors used functional assays by quantifying the formation of dendritic branches in primary hippocampal neurons. Using fluorescence microscopy and siRNA-based knockdowns, the authors showed that Cobl and Cobl-like are functionally interdependent during dendritic branch formation in dissociated hippocampal neurons. They showed that siRNA decreasing Cobl or Cobl-like expression reduced the number of dendritic branch points to the same extent. Fluorescence time-lapses indicated that Cobl and Cobl-like proteins co-localized at abortive and effective branching points. Furthermore, they showed that the increase in branching induced by Cobl-like overexpression is reversed by using a siRNA that decreases Cobl expression, they also performed the reciprocal experiments. Using a variety of biochemistry assays (co-immunoprecipitation, in vitro reconstitutions with purified components…) the authors demonstrated that Cobl and Cobl-like do not interact directly, but that Cobl-like associates with syndapins, as previously shown for Cobl (Schwintzer et al., 2011; Hou et al., 2015). Thus, syndapin is the molecular and functional link between Cobl and Cobl-like proteins. The authors performed a very thorough characterisation of the biochemical interactions between the Cobl-like protein and syndapins. Syndapins and Cobl-like interactions were direct and based on SH3 domain/Prolin rich motif interactions respectively on syndapins and Cobl-like. The Prolin rich motifs were located in 3 KRAP domains at the Nter of Cobl-like proteins. The authors also showed that the interaction of the Nter proximal KRAP domain with syndapin is ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM dependent, and that this ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM dependent interaction is crucial for the function of the Cobl-like protein in the regulation of dendritic arbor formation. The authors confirmed most of their biochemical results by visualizing the formation of protein complexes on the surface of mitochondria in intact COS-7 cells. They also used time-lapse fluorescent microscopy to demonstrate that Syndapin and Cobl-like are co-localized at sites of dendritic branch induction. Importantly, the authors used Immunogold labeling of freeze-fractured plasma membranes combined with electron microscopy. Using this strategy, they showed that membrane-bound syndapin nanoclusters are preferentially located at the base of protrusive membrane topologies in developing neurons. Throughout the manuscript, the authors confronted their biochemistry experiments with functional assays quantifying the formation of dendritic branches.</p><p>The overall conclusion of the manuscript is that a molecular complex involving Cobl, Cobl-like and syndapin and regulated by ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, promotes the formation of actin networks leading to dendritic protrusions to initiate dendritic branches. Importantly, this manuscript demonstrated that multiple actin nucleators can be coordinated in neurons to trigger the formation of subcellular structures.</p><p>The conclusions of the manuscript are, in most cases, convincingly supported by the results. In particular, the authors have performed a very comprehensive characterization of the biochemical interactions between Cobl, Cobl-like and syndapin, which are well supported by the functional results. However, the results found concerning the spatiotemporal relationship between Cobl, Cobl-like and syndapin during dendritic branch formation are more preliminary and do not take into account the roles of ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. In addition, some of the findings were already published by the same group in previous articles. Thus, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed by the authors. These critical points are the following: (1) Need for quantifications concerning the spatiotemporal relationship between Cobl, Cobl-like and syndapin during the formation of dendritic branches. (2) Some of the findings presented in this manuscript have already been published by the same group, which diminishes the inherent originality of this manuscript. Apart from the main points raised above, the manuscript is experimentally solid and contains interesting results that are likely to stimulate further experiments in the fields of actin cytoskeleton but also in the fields of cellular neurobiology and neurodevelopment.</p><p>1) Need for quantifications concerning the spatiotemporal relationship between Cobl, Cobl-like, syndapin, ca<sup>2+</sup>, CaM during the formation of dendritic branches.</p><p>In the present manuscript, the authors have shown, using fluorescence time-lapses, the co-localization of Cobl-like/Cobl, Cobl-like/Syndapin at branch points. In previous articles, the same group demonstrated the localization at branching points of ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (using GCaMP), actin (using LifeAct), CaM, Cobl (Hou et al., Blos Biol 2015); co-localization of Cobl/Syndapin (Schwintzer et al., EMBO J 2011); co-localization of Cobl-like/Actin (LifeAct), Cobl-like/CaM (Izadi et al., JCB 2018). However, in these previous studies and in the present manuscript, no quantifications were made concerning the spatio-temporal recruitments of these biomolecules.</p><p>The authors have emphasized the complex and subtle regulations of these biochemical interactions leading to the functional coordination of these actin regulators. This is actually one of the key points of the manuscript, the demonstration that Cobl, Cobl-like, Syndapin and ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM are orchestrated at the molecular level to control dendritic branching.</p><p>It would be very interesting to quantify the spatiotemporal relationship between the formation of the branch point and the specific recruitment of all these molecular actors. The authors should use the initiation of the protrusion as a time reference to then quantify the assembly and disassembly of the different molecular actors. This type of analysis has been performed previously for clatherin-mediated endocytosis (e.g. Taylor et al., Plos Biol 2011). For instance, the authors could measure evolutions of the fluorescence signals (e.g. fluorescence enrichment fluo foci/fluo outside) as a function of time before and after branch formation. For this specific manuscript, the authors should quantify this for at least Cobl, Cobl-like, Syndapin, and CaM. It would also be very interesting to quantify the fraction of aborted or effective formation of branches according to the spatiotemporal evolution of the different molecular actors.</p><p>2) Some findings presented in the current manuscript were already published by the same group:</p><p>While it is perfectly logical to base a study on previous findings and results, in the current manuscript the fraction of findings already published in previous manuscripts is non-negligible, which in some ways limits the originality of the data presented in the study.</p><p>For instance, the findings that Cobl-like is involved in the formation of dendritic branches and its localization at branch points (Figure 1, current manuscript) were already showed in a previous article from the same group (Izadi et al., JCB 2018; Figure 3, Figure 4). The coordination of Cobl-like and ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in this process was already demonstrated in the same article (Figure 9, CaM inhibitor CGS9343B), even though in the previous article the focused more on the Cter ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding site. Likewise, the coordinated role of Cobl and syndapin in the formation of dendritic branches and their localization at branch points were already demonstrated in previous studies form the same group (Schwintzer et al., EMBO J 2011; Hou et al., PlosBiol 2015). In these two articles they also demonstrated the crucial role of ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in that process.</p><p>The manuscript would gain in strength and originality if the authors could deepen their molecular understanding of the branching process. One way could be to quantify the spatiotemporal coordination of these different molecular players (Cobl, Cobl-like, Syndapin, CaM, ca<sup>2+</sup>, actin, N-WASP, Arp2/3…) in that process, as suggested in the point #1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:This manuscript by Izadi et al., explores the contribution of two actin nucleating proteins, Cobl and Cobl-like, to dendritic arborization. This work links CaCaM signaling with different post-translation modes of Cobl at the plasma membrane via a physical linkage between Cobl and Cobl-like proteins mediated by the F-BAR protein Syndapin I and coordination with the actin disassembly factor Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Srv2/CAP) to ultimately dictate actin-based neuromorphogenesis. The strength of this study includes a robust set of imaging and molecular biology analyses to show the localization and interaction of Cobl, Cobl-like, and Syndapin I. A potential weak point in this work is a lacking comparison between this actin nucleation mode and other neuronal actin nucleation proteins (i.e., Spire, Arp2/3 complex, or formin). This could allow readers to assess and/or compare the effectiveness of the Cobl and Cobl-like to previously discovered single actin-nucleation protein activities on neurogenesis.</p><p>– The authors claim this work is the first demonstration of actin nucleation factors working in concert to promote neuronal morphology. Synergistic promotion of actin assembly by netrin/WASP/Arp2/3 and combinations of Spire / formins and other ligands are essential for several cell processes including vesicle trafficking, DNA repair and neuronal morphology in purkingee neurons (Wagner et al., 2011, Pfender et al., 2011; Schuh, 2011; Montaville et al., 2014; Belin et al., 2015; Sundararajan 2019), although perhaps not shown as clearly as these authors in this work. They show many careful details of the interaction of cobl and cobl-like in neuronal morphology but do not compare how these nucleation effects compare to more other nucleation factors.</p><p>– All figures and images throughout this manuscript should be recolored to avoid red/green for comparison to allow to allow for interpretation by color blind individuals.</p><p>– In several instances throughout the manuscript the authors refer to &quot;highly significant&quot; results based on statistical analyses. For accuracy and clarity, the authors should refer to results as &quot;significant&quot; or &quot;not significant&quot; as the statical tests used do not indicate more than this.</p><p>– For the ease of the reader the N values for each analysis should be listed in each figure legend rather than the methods section.</p><p>– More discussion on the role of various actin nucleation factors in neuronal development could benefit uninitiated readers. What are the contributions of Arp2/3, formins, spire? For example, a preprint (Bradley et al. 2019) suggests the formin Capu and spire cooperate to stimulate actin nucleation from both (barbed and pointed) ends of actin filaments.</p><p>– The images of hippocampal neurons shown in each of the figures are gorgeous!</p><p>– Additional quantitative analysis of co localization could strengthen the localization argument presented in Figure 1H.</p><p>– The interdependence of Cobl and Cobl-like could be more convincing at more timepoints than the single- 34 h one. Is the interdependence consistent on different days of neuronal development?</p><p>– A direct binding event doesn't mediate the interdependent morphological phenotype. Thus, the authors explore whether Syndapin proteins are responsible for linking Cobl and Cobl-like from previous observations demonstrating a direct relationship between Syndapin I and Cobl at the plasma membrane. Could other proteins particularly spire or formin proteins also mediate connections between Cobl and Cobl-like?</p><p>– Lines 106-107: I think the authors mean to say &quot;all were statistically significant compared to neurons cotransfected…&quot;</p><p>– Line 150 &quot;artifacts&quot; is misspelled.</p><p>– Line 226 there is no &quot;highly significant&quot; result in statistics, it is either significant or not based on the p-value cut off used.

Some results appear inconsistent between different Figures. For example, in Figure 1D, Cobl RNAi shifts numbers of dendritic branch points from 10 to 6, while in Figure 2E, Cobl RNAi leaves numbers of dendritic branch points pretty much unchanged (around 7 or 8). Could you make sure that all data are consistent between Figures or explain apparent inconsistencies?</p></disp-quote><p>It is correct that the both the absolute numbers of dendritic branches, terminal points and dendritic length and also the relative effects of Cobl and Cobl-like RNAi differ in particular between former Figure 1 and 2. Roughly, one can say that the RNAi effects in former Figure 1,9 and 10 are about twice as strong as in the former Figure 2. There are two simple reasons for this, which we unfortunately failed to communicate properly in our original manuscript:</p><p>i) time frame of phenotype development and suppression, respectively and</p><p>ii) expression of only one versus two plasmids in the different types of experiments</p><p>Concerning i): The former Figure 2 and actually also the former Figure 4 (suppression by syndapin I RNAi) both are suppressions of gain-of-function phenotypes, whereas the former Figures 1, 9 and 10 are loss-of-function experiments. Because the gain-of-function effects represent strong and fast inductions of dendritic arborization it suffices to do a short transfection (max. 34 h) and then evaluate. Loss-of-function effects in conditions using the RNAi tools alone are not very strong at such short times when compared to control (all three analyzed parameters are -15-25% for the stronger Cobl-like RNAi and 0 to -10% for the weaker Cobl RNAi at this short time; former Figure 1, please see Figure 1—figure supplement 2 of the revised manuscript).</p><p>The loss-of-function experiments (former Figure 1, 9, 10) are different. The times need to be longer, as the phenotype is the normal growth of the dendritic arbor in controls vs. the putative suppression of this developmental process upon RNAi. Thus, transfections in these experiments usually need to be substantially longer (37-46 h) to show loss-of-function phenotypes compared to control – which then also may be more obvious (Cobl-like RNAi, -30 to -40 %; Cobl RNAi, -33% (***), -20% (**) and -10% (n.s.); former Figure 1D-F – now Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Concerning ii): Suppression of gain-of-function experiments require the coexpression of two plasmids (one for the induction of the gain-of-function phenotype and the second for the RNAi (including reporter expression)), whereas we are able to drive loss-of-function/rescue experiments from only one plasmid driving both RNAi and the expression of a reporter or rescue mutant. Such transfections with two plasmids usually leads to gain-of-function but also suppression effects that are weaker than the effects of either overexpressing or knocking down proteins alone.</p><p>The revised manuscript now provides information on the different time frames of transfection (see improved and expanded Figure legends and Material and Method section) and also briefly touches on the coexpression issue leading to different numbers in the different types of experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. We find experiments of Figure 2 insufficient to conclude that Cobl and Cobl-like factors depend strictly on each other. One could imagine scenarios where effects of Cobl or Cobl-like are highly concentration dependent, and lead to detectable effects in cells only below or above certain thresholds (especially for multi-domain binding proteins such as Cobl and Cobl-like, which are likely to undergo complex phase transition behaviors when clustering at the membrane).</p><p>Therefore we would recommend here simply to be very careful with wording in the conclusions of these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We share the reviewer’s concerns that suppression experiments are sometimes difficult to interpret, if the experiments are not designed in a careful manner and/or show a complex outcome. This is not the case in our experiments, however (see details below).</p><p>Of strong concern would be the following outcome: A presence of significant RNAi effect(s) alone compared to control and the results of the suppression attempt and the RNAi run for comparison are not equal but the effects of conducting RNAi alone are stronger. In this case of experimental outcome, one should rather abstain from any interpretation and try to adapt the experimental design to reach a clear conclusion. The reason is that, in this particular case, two processes (one positive, the other one negative) could simply operate in parallel, may not necessarily have anything to do with each other directly and may potentially be affected by unspecifiable dose effects as well – thus the experiment is not informative.</p><p>In our experiments, the situation is different and the revised manuscript now contains an elucidation of the considerations required for a correct interpretation for the two vice versa suppression experiments we conducted and reported in the former Figure 2 (Figure 1C-P in the revised manuscript).</p><p>In general, the reviewers will acknowledge that when component A is able to elicit a certain cell biological effect and this does not happen when component B is not present, then component A’s functions depend on B. This is a very classical experimental design and conclusion. The same can also be done with inhibitors – then A’s functions depend on B’s activity. However, it is absolutely crucial that the individual effects of the manipulations as well as the baseline control values are considered in the interpretation, too. If the suppression of the overexpression effect is larger than any putative RNAi effects compared to control or there is no such RNAi effect, the experiment and interpretation actually is very straight forward.</p><p>In our study, this is the case for Cobl RNAi in the suppression of Cobl-like functions (Figure 1C-I in the revised manuscript): We observed complete suppression of Cobl-like’s effects with Cobl-like RNAi. Yet, the effects of GFP+Cobl RNAi expression are not distinguishable from control and the result thus is straight forward to interpret. We actually designed the experiment in a way that the individual RNAi conditions remained neglectable to reach this straight forward interpretation scenario.</p><p>The same applies to the suppression of Cobl-like effects by syndapin I RNAi (Figure 3 in the revised manuscript). Under the conditions shown, syndapin I RNAi would not cause any phenotypes, yet, it completely suppressed the strong Cobl-like-mediated effects on all four parameters of dendritic arborization determined (former Figure 4; now Figure 3 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>For the suppression of the Cobl gain-of-function phenotypes by Cobl-like RNAi (Figure 1J-P in the revised manuscript) the situation is a bit less obvious and we understand the concern of the reviewer that this may need a more detailed look. Here, in all three parameters shown, GFP+Cobl-like RNAi causes a relatively mild but significant phenotype when compared to GFP+Scrambled control. However, the reviewer will acknowledge that the RNAi effects deviating negatively from the GFP+Scrambled control are much smaller than the suppression of the Cobl-mediated effects on dendritic arborization, which are twice as high (branch points; total dendritic length) and three times as high (terminal branches), respectively. Thus, also here, we clearly observe a suppression of specifically Cobl functions and can exclude additive actions in opposite directions. Importantly, this conclusion is formally further underscored by the fact that in all three phenotypical analyses GFP-Cobl+Cobl-like RNAi and GFP+Cobl-like RNAi are not statistically different from one another but equal (Figure 1J-P in the revised manuscript). This makes the interpretation of the results of also this suppression experiment straight forward again.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other mentions such as (line 328) &quot;their functions were cooperative&quot;, should also be avoided unless you provide further explanations.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our statement above. If A needs B to work and B relies on A, that simply means A and B work together and not in parallel – and working in together is nothing else than cooperation. The revised manuscript now contains an elucidation of the considerations required for a correct interpretation for the two vice versa suppression experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Mentions such as (line 101) &quot;Functional redundancy seemed unlikely, because both individual loss-of-function phenotypes were severe.&quot; should be explained so that readers can assess whether functional redundancy is indeed unlikely or not (for example by referencing a paper describing mild versus severe phenotypes).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the too much shortened argumentation in the original manuscript. A parallel action of Cobl and Cobl-like appeared unlikely because the DIV4-to-DIV6 developmental phenotypes of both components were so severe that a third of the entire arborization normally reached at DIV6 was lacking when only one of the two components was knocked down.</p><p>This paragraph has been changed in the revised manuscript and now explains better why parallel action of Cobl and Cobl-like appeared unlikely and why we thus addressed the alternative hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Some findings presented in the current manuscript were already published. While it is perfectly logical to base a study on previous findings and results, in the current manuscript the fraction of findings already published in previous manuscripts is non-negligible, which in some ways hides the originality of the data presented in the study.</p><p>For instance, the findings that Cobl-like is involved in the formation of dendritic branches and its localization at branch points (Figure 1, current manuscript) were already showed in a previous article from your group (Izadi et al., JCB 2018; Figure 3, Figure 4). The coordination of Cobl-like and ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in this process was already demonstrated in the same article (Figure 9, CaM inhibitor CGS9343B), even though in the previous article you focused more on the Cter ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding site. Likewise, the coordinated role of Cobl and syndapin in the formation of dendritic branches and their localization at branch points was already demonstrated in previous studies (Schwintzer et al., EMBO J 2011; Hou et al., PlosBiol 2015). In these two articles you also demonstrated the crucial role of ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in that process.</p><p>As the current manuscript is very long (11 Figures), could you please present only new data and refer to previous papers when needed? We believe that this would give you an opportunity to limit the number of Figures and that the manuscript would overall gain in clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have to admit that we are a bit irritated to be confronted with the claim that our manuscript to a “non-negligible” part contains data already published before. We usually carefully avoid publishing redundant data.</p><p>i) Concerning Figure 1: We acknowledge that the initial side-by-side comparison of Cobl and Cobl-like loss-of-function phenotypes can be considered as partially redundant with the literature, as the Cobl-like phenotype has been reported as an IMARIS-based evaluation before (Izadi et al., 2018 <italic>J Cell Biol.</italic>). However, the Cobl loss-of-function phenotype has not been evaluated in detail before, as all previous publications unfortunately only included a very limited manual analyses of branch points and of the number of primary dendrites (Ahuja et al., 2007 <italic>Cell;</italic> Schwintzer et al., 2011 <italic>EMBO J;</italic> Haag et al., <italic>2012 J. Neurosci.;</italic> Hou et al., 2015 <italic>PLoS; Hou</italic> et al., 2018 <italic>Dev Cell</italic>) – it thus was impossible to compare the phenotypes of Cobl to Cobl-like loss-of-function because neither terminal points, the total dendritic length nor Sholl analyses of the entire dendritic arbor have ever been analyzed before. Besides this obvious novelty, we have described which hypothesis led to the necessity of a full evaluation of Cobl loss-of-function effects in early neuronal development and of a side-by-side comparison with full consistency on the cell, method and experimenter sides. Since this work is the logical starting point of our study we cannot omit this data entirely but moved this block of data into the Supplemental Material (please see new Figure 1-Supplement2) and fused the remaining panels of the former Figure 1 with Figure 2 (now Figure 1 in revised manuscript) to additionally reduce the numbers of main figures from formerly 11 to now 10, as demanded.</p><p>ii) Concerning Figure 9: It is correct that we have demonstrated before by the use of the CaM inhibitor CGS9343B that Cobl-like functions require ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM signaling (Izadi et al., 2018 J. Cell Biol.). However, these data are NOT recapitulated here. In the current study we instead identify a binding site of CaM in the N terminal part of Cobl-like and address the functions of specifically this site by in vitro, in vivo and functional analyses using a mutant that specifically lacks this site. None of this has been published before. The allegation of redundant publishing of data thus is completely unfounded.</p><p>In case the reviewer meant to question the novelty that Cobl-like functions in principle have something to do with ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM signaling, we herewith stress that nowhere in the manuscript such general novelty was claimed but that we exclusive focused at the newly identified ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding site and its molecular and cell biological functions.</p><p>Furthermore, we would like to remind the reviewer that it is valuable for a cell biological understanding of a given protein to evaluate a second site of binding to some interaction partner or a second or third site of modification mechanistically and functionally – please e.g. just have a look at all the individual phosphorylation sites of the many tyrosine kinase receptors and their (in part) different functions, which have been published in a plethora of independent publications over decades.</p><p>iii) Likewise, it is correct that it is known that syndapin interacts with Cobl (Schwintzer et al., 2011 EMBO J.). Here, however, we for the first time show an interaction of Cobl-like with syndapin I. Furthermore, we unveil that syndapin I can physically link and thereby coordinate Cobl with syndapin I’s new binding partner Cobl-like. And finally we demonstrate how this novel Cobl-like interaction with syndapin I is regulated.</p><p>All three points are novel and we thus fail to understand the background of the reviewer’s allegation of redundant publishing of data.</p><p>iv) Concerning reducing the figure number and citing more literature: The manuscript does refer to data previously reported wherever possible (the originally submitted manuscript already had more than 60 literature citations).</p><p>In order to comply with the suggestion to reduce the figure number, the revised manuscript now presents the former Figure 1 in the Supplemental Material (new Figure 1-Supplement). Despite the fact that the reviewers also asked for additional examinations to be included (see below), the revised manuscript therefore now contains 10 instead of 11 figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The reviewers agree that a discussion on the role of various actin nucleation factors in neuronal development could benefit uninitiated readers. Could you also please discuss in more details other potential mechanisms of coordination between actin regulators based on your extensive previous studies and the existing literature?</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript now covers ten papers suggesting some crosstalk between actin nucleators in the discussion.</p><p>Most of these studies are not studying any processes in hippocampal neurons, still, though, they serve as great examples for valuable hints towards the fact that there may be much more complexity and coordination of different players leading to the formation of actin filaments than we currently think.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In the present manuscript, you show, using fluorescence time-lapses, the co-localization of Cobl-like/Cobl, Cobl-like/Syndapin at branch points. In previous articles, your group demonstrated the localization at branching points of ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (using GCaMP), actin (using LifeAct), CaM, Cobl (Hou et al., Blos Biol 2015); co-localization of Cobl/Syndapin (Schwintzer et al., EMBO J 2011); co-localization of Cobl-like/Actin (LifeAct), Cobl-like/CaM (Izadi et al., JCB 2018).</p><p>However, in these previous studies and in the present manuscript, no quantifications were made concerning the spatio-temporal recruitments of these molecules. In this manuscript, it seems on top of that Cobl-like appears before syndapin, which would not be quite coherent with a recruitement of Cobl-like through syndapin.</p><p>Therefore, it would be important to quantify here more precisely the spatiotemporal relationship between Cobl, Cobl-like, syndapin and CaM (and ideally ca<sup>2+</sup>) during the formation of dendritic branches. This would require to record data at shorter time intervals, but you should have all the biological material necessary to do these experiments. You could use if possible the initiation of the protrusions as a time reference to then quantify the assembly and disassembly of the different molecular actors. This type of analysis has been performed previously for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (e.g. Taylor et al., Plos Biol 2011). For instance, you could measure evolutions of the fluorescence signals (e.g. fluorescence enrichment fluo foci/fluo outside) as a function of time before and after branch formation. It would also be very interesting to quantify the fraction of aborted or effective formation of branches according to the spatiotemporal evolution of the different molecular actors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these further suggestion. It is indeed obvious that spatiotemporal analyses of different factors in dendritic branch induction is an attractive area of research offering a chance of a deeper understanding of the process. It seems to be a complex process involving quite a variety of molecular players. At the moment, one has to admit that we are mostly still at the stage of identifying critical and involved players and of investigating their individual properties and interactions, respectively. With the current study, we for the first time put three of these players and their CaM-coordinated action into the spot light. The revised manuscript now also contains some quantitative spatiotemporal data showing and comparing the degree of accumulation of these players and their average peak time prior to branch induction (please see newly added data panels Figure 5C and D).</p><p>We used the first morphological protrusion as reference point for the analysis of the critical time period prior to this, as suggested by the reviewers. As the reviewers will see from the new data added our data nicely confirms that not only Cobl (Hou et al., 2015) and Cobl-like (Izadi et al., 2018) show elevated values of accumulation prior to branch induction but that also syndapin I and even also CaM do so (see newly added Figure 5C).</p><p>Although the technical challenges were significant (primary neurons are hard to transfect, the developmental processes of dendritic branching occurs with rather moderate frequency somewhere in the extended dendritic arbor of a given neurons, and the analysis nevertheless requires a time resolution in the range of seconds and quite some 3D spatial resolution), we nevertheless were able to obtain n numbers of protrusions high enough to evaluate for each of these four proteins. The newly added data clearly makes the point that syndapin I, Cobl-like, Cobl and CaM in average show spatiotemporal overlap in a time window ranging from about -30 to -10 seconds prior to branch initiation (see newly added Figure 5D).</p><p>Interestingly, it furthermore seemed that Cobl-like together with syndapin I appeared earlier than Cobl, while CaM seemed to peak inbetween. The latter may be related to complex formations of CaM with both Cobl and Cobl-like and with the coordination of all three components by CaM signaling we revealed in our study.</p><p>Beyond these additional efforts made in our revision work for all four components studied here (Cobl-like, syndapin I, Cobl and CaM), we agree with the reviewer that comprehensive and detailed spatiotemporal analyses of all – in part yet to be identified – molecular players in dendritic branch induction will in the future certainly represent a powerful research avenue towards a better understanding of the temporal order of the actions of these players, of how they may be coordinated to bring about a new dendritic branch during development but may be also during repair processes of neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Another missing experiment in this story is whether this strong effect of ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in promoting Cobl-like's interaction with syndapin I through the first of the three &quot;KRAP&quot; motifs is indeed critical for Cobl-like recruitement at the membrane in cells. Could you provide experimental evidence that KRAP1 is directly involved in the ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-mediated recruitment of Cobl-like at the plasma membrane?</p></disp-quote><p>In order to address a putative impact of the first, ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-regulated KRAP motif on the membrane recruitment of Cobl-like, we knocked-down endogenous Cobl-like and then quantified the membrane-association of reexpressed, RNAi-insensitive Cobl-like lacking KRAP1 at the plasma membrane of neurons in comparison to wild-type Cobl-like. Although KRAP1 is only one out of three identified syndapin I binding sites, we observed that deletion of merely this one site had a profound, statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001; ****) impact on Cobl-like’s membrane localization in developing hippocampal neurons. This data obtained in our revision work is reported as Figure 9G-I in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This work investigates at the molecular and cellular levels the functional dependence of two actin filament nucleation factors, Cobl and Cobl-like proteins, in the formation of protrusive dendritic structures. Depletion of Cobl or Cobl-like lead to roughly similar phenotypes; overexpression of Cobl or Cobl-like induces excessive dendrite formation when the other protein is expressed at normal levels, but not when this other protein is depleted. Altogether, these observations lead the authors to conclude that these proteins work strictly interdependently. The authors then investigate how Cobl and Cobl-like are recruited, and identify syndapin as an essential component to bring Cobl and Cobl-like together at the membrane. This interaction is beautifully documented through a large number of pulldown experiments in vitro, and critical domains for these interactions are identified. These interactions are also confirmed in physiological conditions through ectopic localization experiments of those components to mitochondria. Syndapin I is identified as clusters at dendritic initiation sites by electron microscopy and all three components colocalize at the same nascent dendritic branch sites. In the last part of the manuscript, the authors further document the interaction between Cobl-like and syndapin, and find that calcium-dependent calmodulin binding to Cobl-like increases syndapin I's association through the first of the three KRAP's domains.</p><p>Comments to be addressed in a revised manuscript:</p><p>1. Some results appear inconsistent between different Figures. For example, in Figure 1D, Cobl RNAi shifts numbers of dendritic branch points from 10 to 6, while in Figure 2E, Cobl RNAi leaves numbers of dendritic branch points pretty much unchanged (around 7 or 8). Could the authors make sure that all data are consistent between Figures or explain apparent inconsistencies?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her careful evaluation of our data. The discrepancy noticed, however, is only an apparent inconsistency, as the experimental set-ups and purposes were different. Please see our above detailed answer to Essential revision list point 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I find experiments of Figure 1 and 2 insufficient to conclude that Cobl and Cobl-like factors depend strictly on each other. One could imagine many scenarios where effects of Cobl or Cobl-like are highly concentration dependent, and lead to detectable effects in cells below or under certain thresholds (especially for multi-domain binding proteins such as Cobl and Cobl-like, which are likely to undergo complex phase transition behaviors when clustering at the membrane). Therefore, I would recommend the authors to be very careful with wording and conclusions of their experiments, and stick to what can strictly be concluded.</p></disp-quote><p>We share the reviewer’s concerns that suppression experiments are sometimes difficult to interpret.

Please see our above response to the Essential revision list point 6.</p><p>In brief, this type of experimentation was done as part of our revision efforts during the last weeks.

I regret sometimes the lack of quantification for some experiments. For example, protein colocalization in cells should be quantified (for example by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficients of red and green signals at mitochondrial sites) because colocalization (or absence of) is not always obvious for non-expert eyes.</p></disp-quote><p>It may have been overlooked that calculating Pearson's correlation coefficients is not useful in our case, as we are not addressing a correlation of the occurrence of individual signals of one type with another type but are addressing coaccumulations of components under a given condition versus a more diffuse localization under other condition.</p><p>The original manuscript highlighted such coaccumulations by false-color heat map representations and marking sites of interest in two of our main figures.</p><p>In order to also comply with the reviewer’s request concerning the other figures (the in vivo protein complex reconstitutions at mitochondrial membrane surfaces), we added high-magnification insets to all of these figures in the main manuscript and in the Supplementary information visualizing in a more easily accessible manner than in the small full-size images whether the respective mitochondrial patterns are occurring or only a diffuse localization pattern prevails. We furthermore conducted line scans to quantitative visualize coincidences of elevated or diminished signal intensities. We hope that the reviewer is content with these additional figure panels added to many of our revised figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 6 is beautiful, but I am wondering if these data could be exploited better. Is it possible to record data at shorter time intervals? It seems that Cobl-like appears before syndapin. Is that correct and if so, how is this coherent with a recruitement of Cobl-like through syndapin?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to the Essential Revision list point 5 above. We acknowledge that analysis of the spatiotemporal relationship of molecular players involved in dendritic branch induction only is in its infancy, as at the current stage of research not even all important players of this process are known and this type of analysis is technically challenging to do in a quantitative manner in neurons.</p><p>The revised manuscript does now clearly demonstrate by quantitative evaluations of peak signal intensities that all four components studied (Cobl, Cobl-like, syndapin I and CaM) indeed show accumulation at branch induction sites prior to branch initiation. These data are quite well in line with the relative accumulation data collected for two of the components at the 30 s time point prior to protrusion initiation for Cobl (Hou et al., 2015 PLoS Biol.) and for Cobl-like (Izadi et al., 2018 J. Cell Biol.).</p><p>Furthermore the revised manuscript now contains a preliminary assessment of the average peak times of all for components highlighting that they indeed do not only show spatial but also temporal overlap at branch initiation sites, as it can be expected from our finding that Cobl-like and Cobl can be interconnected by Cobl-like’s novel interaction partner syndapin I in a CaM-regulated mechanism converging on one particular of the three syndapin I binding motifs we identified in Cobl-like. The Cobl-like and the syndapin I data hereby showed significant variances and a surprisingly early appearance of both components together. The data obtained thus far do not suggest that Cobl-like is recruited before syndapin but in average showed the same peak time (please see revised Figure 5C,D; former Figure 6). Thus, while we honestly do not claim that we have detailed enough data on the different aspects of the spatiotemporal behaviors of all players in dendritic branch initiation and this will definitively require further studies focusing on these aspects specifically, there at least is no discrepancy with any of the molecular mechanisms involving Cobl-like and syndapin I, which we demonstrate in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1.

In particular, the authors explored how actin nucleators are coordinated to trigger the formation of branches in neuronal dendritic arbor.</p><p>In that context, Cobl have a crucial role in dendritic arbor formation in neuronal cells. Cobl contains a repeat of three WH2 domains interacting with actin and enabling nucleation of new actin filaments (F-actin). The initial idea was that tandem repeat of WH2 domains could be sufficient to trigger F-actin nucleation. However, other studies have shown that the WH2 repeat of Cobl has no nucleation activity of its own. Importantly, Cobl activity was shown to work in coordination with other actin regulators including the F-actin-binding protein Abp1 (Haag, J Neuro 2012) and the BAR domain protein syndapin (Schwintzer, EMBO J 2011).</p><p>The manuscript of Izadi et al. builds on previous articles from the same group, in particular a study demonstrating that Cobl-like, an evolutionary ancestor of Cobl, is also crucial for dendritic branching (Izadi et al., 2018 JCB). This previous article showed that like Cobl (Haag, J Neuro 2012), Cobl-like protein works in coordination with the F-actin-binding protein Abp1 and ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM to promote dendritic branching through regulation of F-actin nucleation or/and assembly. In the current manuscript the authors showed that the two actin nucleators Cobl and Cobl-like proteins are interdependent to trigger dendritic branching.</p><p>The authors used functional assays by quantifying the formation of dendritic branches in primary hippocampal neurons. Using fluorescence microscopy and siRNA-based knockdowns, the authors showed that Cobl and Cobl-like are functionally interdependent during dendritic branch formation in dissociated hippocampal neurons. They showed that siRNA decreasing Cobl or Cobl-like expression reduced the number of dendritic branch points to the same extent. Fluorescence time-lapses indicated that Cobl and Cobl-like proteins co-localized at abortive and effective branching points. Furthermore, they showed that the increase in branching induced by Cobl-like overexpression is reversed by using a siRNA that decreases Cobl expression, they also performed the reciprocal experiments. Using a variety of biochemistry assays (co-immunoprecipitation, in vitro reconstitutions with purified components…) the authors demonstrated that Cobl and Cobl-like do not interact directly, but that Cobl-like associates with syndapins, as previously shown for Cobl (Schwintzer et al., 2011; Hou et al., 2015). Thus, syndapin is the molecular and functional link between Cobl and Cobl-like proteins. The authors performed a very thorough characterisation of the biochemical interactions between the Cobl-like protein and syndapins. Syndapins and Cobl-like interactions were direct and based on SH3 domain/Prolin rich motif interactions respectively on syndapins and Cobl-like. The Prolin rich motifs were located in 3 KRAP domains at the Nter of Cobl-like proteins. The authors also showed that the interaction of the Nter proximal KRAP domain with syndapin is ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM dependent, and that this ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM dependent interaction is crucial for the function of the Cobl-like protein in the regulation of dendritic arbor formation. The authors confirmed most of their biochemical results by visualizing the formation of protein complexes on the surface of mitochondria in intact COS-7 cells. They also used time-lapse fluorescent microscopy to demonstrate that Syndapin and Cobl-like are co-localized at sites of dendritic branch induction. Importantly, the authors used Immunogold labeling of freeze-fractured plasma membranes combined with electron microscopy. Using this strategy, they showed that membrane-bound syndapin nanoclusters are preferentially located at the base of protrusive membrane topologies in developing neurons. Throughout the manuscript, the authors confronted their biochemistry experiments with functional assays quantifying the formation of dendritic branches.</p><p>The overall conclusion of the manuscript is that a molecular complex involving Cobl, Cobl-like and syndapin and regulated by ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, promotes the formation of actin networks leading to dendritic protrusions to initiate dendritic branches. Importantly, this manuscript demonstrated that multiple actin nucleators can be coordinated in neurons to trigger the formation of subcellular structures.</p><p>The conclusions of the manuscript are, in most cases, convincingly supported by the results. In particular, the authors have performed a very comprehensive characterization of the biochemical interactions between Cobl, Cobl-like and syndapin, which are well supported by the functional results. However, the results found concerning the spatiotemporal relationship between Cobl, Cobl-like and syndapin during dendritic branch formation are more preliminary and do not take into account the roles of ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. In addition, some of the findings were already published by the same group in previous articles. Thus, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed by the authors. These critical points are the following: (1) Need for quantifications concerning the spatiotemporal relationship between Cobl, Cobl-like and syndapin during the formation of dendritic branches. (2) Some of the findings presented in this manuscript have already been published by the same group, which diminishes the inherent originality of this manuscript. Apart from the main points raised above, the manuscript is experimentally solid and contains interesting results that are likely to stimulate further experiments in the fields of actin cytoskeleton but also in the fields of cellular neurobiology and neurodevelopment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment of the quality and impact of our work.</p><p>As far as the first point of the reviewer is concerned, the spatiotemporal relationship between Cobl, Cobl-like and syndapin I, please see our response to the Essential Revision list point 5 above.</p><p>We acknowledge that analysis of the spatiotemporal relationship of molecular players involved in dendritic branch induction only is in its infancy, as at the current stage of research not even all important players of this process are known and this type of analysis is technically challenging to do in a quantitative manner in neurons.</p><p>The revised manuscript does now clearly demonstrate by quantitative evaluations of peak signal intensities that all four components studied (Cobl, Cobl-like, syndapin I and CaM) indeed show accumulation at branch induction sites prior to branch initiation.

The Cobl-like and the syndapin I data hereby showed significant variances and a surprisingly early appearance of both components together.

Although technically challenging to do at high enough resolution, with large enough time frames to capture the only relatively rare events of dendritic branch induction, at sufficient frame rates to not miss key events and with high enough numbers of transfected primary neurons of suitable developmental stages to reach sound quantitative data, this will require further comprehensive studies focusing on these aspects specifically.</p><p>As far as the second point of the reviewer is concerned, the criticism that some of the findings presented in this manuscript have already been published, please see our response to the Essential Revision list point 3 above.</p><p>As all other points presented are novel, this probably refers to the side-by-side, software-based, detailed evaluation of Cobl and Cobl-like loss-of-function phenotypes during early dendritic arborization originally presented in Figure 1. This data has been moved to the Supplemental Material (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) in the revised manuscript, as one half of the data set of course indeed merely is a reproduction of the Cobl-like phenotype identified by the same method before (Izadi et al., 2018).</p><p>However, the reviewers will acknowledge and readers will immediately understand that, without this comparison revealing the high degree of phenotypical copy, we would not have followed up and discovered the coordinated action of the two components powering actin filament formation during dendritic branch initiation we report here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Need for quantifications concerning the spatiotemporal relationship between Cobl, Cobl-like, syndapin, ca<sup>2+</sup>, CaM during the formation of dendritic branches.</p><p>In the present manuscript, the authors have shown, using fluorescence time-lapses, the co-localization of Cobl-like/Cobl, Cobl-like/Syndapin at branch points. In previous articles, the same group demonstrated the localization at branching points of ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (using GCaMP), actin (using LifeAct), CaM, Cobl (Hou et al., Blos Biol 2015); co-localization of Cobl/Syndapin (Schwintzer et al., EMBO J 2011); co-localization of Cobl-like/Actin (LifeAct), Cobl-like/CaM (Izadi et al., JCB 2018). However, in these previous studies and in the present manuscript, no quantifications were made concerning the spatio-temporal recruitments of these biomolecules.</p><p>The authors have emphasized the complex and subtle regulations of these biochemical interactions leading to the functional coordination of these actin regulators. This is actually one of the key points of the manuscript, the demonstration that Cobl, Cobl-like, Syndapin and ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM are orchestrated at the molecular level to control dendritic branching.</p><p>It would be very interesting to quantify the spatiotemporal relationship between the formation of the branch point and the specific recruitment of all these molecular actors. The authors should use the initiation of the protrusion as a time reference to then quantify the assembly and disassembly of the different molecular actors. This type of analysis has been performed previously for clatherin-mediated endocytosis (e.g. Taylor et al., Plos Biol 2011). For instance, the authors could measure evolutions of the fluorescence signals (e.g. fluorescence enrichment fluo foci/fluo outside) as a function of time before and after branch formation. For this specific manuscript, the authors should quantify this for at least Cobl, Cobl-like, Syndapin, and CaM. It would also be very interesting to quantify the fraction of aborted or effective formation of branches according to the spatiotemporal evolution of the different molecular actors.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to the Essential Revision list point 5 above. Please also see our response to this point in the review provided by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Some findings presented in the current manuscript were already published by the same group:</p><p>While it is perfectly logical to base a study on previous findings and results, in the current manuscript the fraction of findings already published in previous manuscripts is non-negligible, which in some ways limits the originality of the data presented in the study.</p><p>For instance, the findings that Cobl-like is involved in the formation of dendritic branches and its localization at branch points (Figure 1, current manuscript) were already showed in a previous article from the same group (Izadi et al., JCB 2018; Figure 3, Figure 4). The coordination of Cobl-like and ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in this process was already demonstrated in the same article (Figure 9, CaM inhibitor CGS9343B), even though in the previous article the focused more on the Cter ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding site. Likewise, the coordinated role of Cobl and syndapin in the formation of dendritic branches and their localization at branch points were already demonstrated in previous studies form the same group (Schwintzer et al., EMBO J 2011; Hou et al., PlosBiol 2015). In these two articles they also demonstrated the crucial role of ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in that process.</p><p>The manuscript would gain in strength and originality if the authors could deepen their molecular understanding of the branching process. One way could be to quantify the spatiotemporal coordination of these different molecular players (Cobl, Cobl-like, Syndapin, CaM, ca<sup>2+</sup>, actin, N-WASP, Arp2/3…) in that process, as suggested in the point #1.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript by Izadi et al., explores the contribution of two actin nucleating proteins, Cobl and Cobl-like, to dendritic arborization. This work links CaCaM signaling with different post-translation modes of Cobl at the plasma membrane via a physical linkage between Cobl and Cobl-like proteins mediated by the F-BAR protein Syndapin I and coordination with the actin disassembly factor Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Srv2/CAP) to ultimately dictate actin-based neuromorphogenesis. The strength of this study includes a robust set of imaging and molecular biology analyses to show the localization and interaction of Cobl, Cobl-like, and Syndapin I. A potential weak point in this work is a lacking comparison between this actin nucleation mode and other neuronal actin nucleation proteins (i.e., Spire, Arp2/3 complex, or formin). This could allow readers to assess and/or compare the effectiveness of the Cobl and Cobl-like to previously discovered single actin-nucleation protein activities on neurogenesis.</p><p>– The authors claim this work is the first demonstration of actin nucleation factors working in concert to promote neuronal morphology. Synergistic promotion of actin assembly by netrin/WASP/Arp2/3 and combinations of Spire / formins and other ligands are essential for several cell processes including vesicle trafficking, DNA repair and neuronal morphology in purkingee neurons (Wagner et al., 2011, Pfender et al., 2011; Schuh, 2011; Montaville et al., 2014; Belin et al., 2015; Sundararajan 2019), although perhaps not shown as clearly as these authors in this work. They show many careful details of the interaction of cobl and cobl-like in neuronal morphology but do not compare how these nucleation effects compare to more other nucleation factors.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Essential revision list point 4: The revised manuscript covers nine papers suggesting some crosstalk between actin nucleators in the discussion.

In the other figures we have added additional line scans of fluorescence signal intensity to provide quantitative access to correlating or not correlating peaks of signal intensities.
