nucleosomes, implying an antagonism that is largely unexplored in vivo. Here, we describe two independent genetic screens for <italic>rsc</italic> suppressors that yielded mutations in the promoter-focused ISW1a complex or mutations in the ‘basic patch’ of histone H4 (an epitope that regulates ISWI activity), strongly supporting RSC-ISW1a antagonism in vivo. RSC and ISW1a largely co-localize, and genomic nucleosome studies using <italic>rsc isw1</italic> mutant combinations revealed opposing functions: promoters classified with a nucleosome-deficient region (NDR) gain nucleosome occupancy in <italic>rsc</italic> mutants, but this gain is attenuated in <italic>rsc isw1</italic> double mutants. Furthermore, promoters lacking NDRs have the highest occupancy of both remodelers, consistent with regulation by nucleosome occupancy, and decreased transcription in <italic>rsc</italic> mutants. Taken together, we provide the first genetic and genomic evidence for RSC-ISW1a antagonism and reveal different mechanisms at two different promoter architectures.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06073.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06073.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06073.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genome of an organism can contain hundreds to thousands of genes. However, these genes are not all active at the same time. Instead, mechanisms exist that control when genes are switched off or on. One such mechanism alters how tightly DNA is packaged into a structure called chromatin. To form chromatin, DNA is wrapped around histone proteins at different points along its length; these structures are known as nucleosomes. Once formed, chromatin can either adopt a tightly packed form that represses gene activity or a less compact form associated with gene activation.</p><p>The proteins that control how chromatin is packed are called ‘chromatin remodelers’. These proteins work in complexes that either disassemble chromatin—for example, by repositioning nucleosomes or removing histones—or organize chromatin by replacing nucleosomes and making it more compact.</p><p>Studies in many organisms have identified two key families of chromatin remodelers. In yeast, the ISWI family of complexes assembles chromatin and a protein complex called RSC disassembles chromatin. Parnell, Schlichter et al. used a range of genetic techniques to investigate whether these two chromatin-remodeling complexes work against each other in a species of yeast called <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. The results suggest that this is indeed the case.</p><p>Both the ISWI complex and the RSC complex bind to regions of DNA called promoters, which are found at the start of a gene and help to regulate its activity. Parnell, Schlichter et al. found that the RSC complex helps to activate genes by establishing or maintaining regions of nucleosome-poor chromatin at a promoter. The chromatin is relaxed in these regions, which allows the proteins that activate genes to access the DNA. This effect is partially counteracted by the ISWI complex, which repositions nucleosomes across the promoters to fill the gaps created by the RSC complex.</p><p>In comparison, Parnell, Schlichter et al. found that promoters that do not have regions of nucleosome-poor chromatin contain a larger number of both of the remodeling complexes and have a high turnover of histone proteins. This suggests that at these sites, the RSC proteins are needed to overcome the assembly of nucleosomes by the ISWI complex in order to activate the gene. Thus, these two chromatin remodelers, ISWI and RSC, compete at promoters to determine whether they contain or lack nucleosomes, which helps determine whether the gene is silent or active, respectively. Future work will look further at how the ‘winner’ is determined: how transcription factors or signaling systems within the cell bias the recruitment or activity of RSC or ISWI at particular promoters, to determine gene activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06073.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06073.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>remodeler</kwd><kwd>nucleosome</kwd><kwd>RSC</kwd><kwd>ISWI</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM60415</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cairns</surname><given-names>Bradley R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM60415</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cairns</surname><given-names>Bradley R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of genetics, expression, genomic localization, and genomic nucleosome profiling demonstrates antagonism between two chromatin remodelers that reveal different mechanisms at different promoter architectures.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genomic DNA is packaged into chromatin, a dynamic material that exhibits numerous changes in post-translational modifications, composition, and protein interactions. One aspect of chromatin modulation involves the assembly or disassembly of chromatin through active remodeling, which can confer either occlusion or access to the DNA—a process that is associated with virtually all DNA-mediated transactions, including transcription, replication, and repair. Each remodeling action, either assembly or disassembly, is mediated (in part) by specialized ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vignali et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Narlikar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartholomew, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Certain chromatin remodelers align with these two general categories: those that restrict DNA access by chromatin assembly and organization and those that promote DNA access by chromatin disassembly and disorganization. This broad separation in function can be partially illustrated by studies of individual chromatin remodelers and their effects on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angus-Hill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fazzio et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vary et al., 2003</xref>); in general, remodelers associated with chromatin disassembly promote DNA access and gene expression, while remodelers associated with chromatin organization more often repress gene expression, though there are exceptions to this simplified view (e.g., increased accessibility can promote repressor access to chromatin).</p><p>The SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodelers provides a well-studied example of remodelers associated with nucleosome disorganization and/or disassembly. In yeast, the RSC chromatin-remodeling complex is an essential and abundant paralog of the canonical SWI/SNF remodeler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cairns et al., 1996</xref>). The central subunit of RSC, Sth1, is a DNA-dependent ATPase that translocates DNA, pumping DNA around the surface of a nucleosome, and effectively mobilizing the nucleosome with respect to the underlying sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saha et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2005</xref>). This property enables RSC to shift nucleosome positions, as well as completely eject nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lorch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boeger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dechassa et al., 2010</xref>). In vivo, RSC facilitates transcription by all three RNA polymerases, primarily by enabling promoter access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parnell et al., 2008</xref>). RSC maintains proper promoter chromatin structure, as RSC mutants exhibit alterations in nucleosome occupancy and spacing at promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartley and Madhani, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ganguli et al., 2014</xref>). RSC activity appears regulated, in part, by the presence of histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kasten et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferreira et al., 2007</xref>). RSC contains seven bromodomains on four subunits, implying a key role of acetylation in regulation. Thus, gene activation often involves the recruitment and activation of remodelers such as RSC to act on specific modified nucleosomes and promote promoter accessibility. The converse of gene activation, silencing, is expected to be the reverse process, where nucleosomes are re-positioned and organized to occlude transcription factor access.</p><p>This reconfiguration of chromatin to a less active or repressive state is a function of other chromatin remodelers, including members of the ISWI family. In yeast, these include two highly conserved ATPase paralogs, <italic>ISW1</italic> and <italic>ISW2</italic>, related to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ‘<italic>Imitation SWitch’</italic> (ISWI) protein, which is the catalytic component of multiple chromatin-remodeling complexes with roles in nucleosome assembly and gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsukiyama et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vary et al., 2003</xref>). Similar to the family of SWI/SNF remodelers, the ISWI family of remodelers uses DNA translocation to mobilize nucleosomes, though ISWI remodelers are typically restricted to movement/sliding only and not ejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Whitehouse et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>). Importantly, ISWI generates regularly spaced nucleosome arrays by ‘measuring’ the length of DNA linker between nucleosomes, and this property is thought to enable gene repression by ordering nucleosomes into closely spaced regular arrays that can restrict access to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grune et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Whitehouse and Tsukiyama, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gangaraju and Bartholomew, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tirosh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartholomew, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Studies of remodeler antagonism have been limited. ISW2 function was shown in one study to restrict the binding of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler at a target gene in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomar et al., 2009</xref>). Another study showed antagonistic roles by two alternative assemblies of mammalian SWI/SNF complex (BRG and BRM), where BRM appeared to repress BRG activation functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flowers et al., 2009</xref>). A third noted attenuation of BRG activation by the CHD family remodeler Mi-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramirez-Carrozzi et al., 2006</xref>) at a set of target genes. Although notable, none of the prior studies provide a conceptual view of how two remodelers might antagonize one another at a large number of loci and how antagonism relates to nucleosome occupancy and positioning at co-occupied loci.</p><p>Here, we examine remodeler antagonism explicitly, providing the first evidence for an antagonistic relationship between ISWI and RSC. We demonstrate the suppression of growth rate phenotypes and the impact of these remodelers on both transcription and chromatin architecture at a genome scale. These studies uniquely reveal important activities of these two chromatin remodelers at particular promoter architectures—‘open’ and ‘closed’—and the requirement for remodeler antagonism for proper regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genome-wide screen for null suppressors of <italic>rsc7</italic>Δ</title><p>Rsc7 is a non-essential subunit of the RSC complex that is required for growth at elevated temperatures and for full growth under particular conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilson et al., 2006</xref>).

We again used the SGA array to screen for genes whose null mutation would allow for growth of <italic>rsc7</italic>Δ at an otherwise non-permissive temperature.</p><p>To accomplish this, a strain containing <italic>rsc7</italic>Δ was crossed to a haploid deletion library comprised 4700 strains, each bearing a deletion in a single nonessential gene (SGA array).

The first three genes are associated with various ribonucleoprotein complexes, including ribosomes and snRNPs, which may represent interesting pathways that involve RSC function.

The Rsc1 and Rsc2 proteins are two homologous mutually exclusive subunits of RSC that define two distinct RSC sub-complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cairns et al., 1999</xref>). Loss of either separately confers distinct phenotypes, while loss of both is lethal, suggesting both unique nonessential and redundant essential functions within the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cairns et al., 1999</xref>). Rsc1 and Rsc2 share the same domain structure, which consists of one nonessential and one essential bromodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cairns et al., 1999</xref>), a BAH domain that binds histone H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsankov et al., 2011</xref>), and an AT hook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cairns et al., 1999</xref>).

We then introduced <italic>TRP1</italic>-marked plasmids containing hydroxylamine mutagenized <italic>HHT2-HHF2</italic> genes and screened for suppression of the temperature sensitivity phenotype upon loss of the wild-type histone plasmid (using 5-FOA negative selection). From 20,000 transformants screened, we isolated seventeen suppressors that were verified by isolating and retransforming the plasmid containing the histone mutation. Of these, most contained single mutations: eight had either H3 A7V or H3 A7T mutations, seven had an H3 T6I mutation, and one bore an H3 G33V mutation. However, one mutant bore an H4 RH17,18CY double mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). All of these histone mutations were also tested for suppression of other temperature-sensitive RSC alleles, including <italic>rsc2-D461G</italic>, <italic>rsc2-Y337H</italic>, and <italic>rsc4-2</italic>, and each was suppressed (data not shown), suggesting that these mutations generally suppress RSC defects and not a specific defect of <italic>rsc2-V457M</italic>. We focused on the H4 RH17,18CY mutant for subsequent studies as it caused the most robust suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The H4 RH17,18CY mutations are adjacent to H4 K16, a residue whose acetylation serves as a mark for active chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Millar et al., 2004</xref>). As RSC contains several bromodomains and may be regulated by histone acetylation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Josling et al., 2012</xref>), we considered whether loss of H4 K16 acetylation may underlie the suppression. However, no H4 K16 acetylation was detected by Western blot in the H4 RH17,18CY mutant, but this could either be the result of loss of acetylation or failure of the antibody to recognize the mutated epitope. We therefore combined <italic>rsc2-V457M</italic> with H4 K16Q, H4 K16R, and H4 K16G mutants to determine if loss of K16 acetylation was responsible for the suppression. However, combining these mutants resulted in a slight synthetic sickness instead of suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), ruling out this simple model.</p><p>Notably, the H4 RH17,18CY mutations define the center of a region of the H4 tail referred to as the ‘basic patch’, an epitope of known importance for the binding and activity of several chromatin-modifying factors including Isw1, Sir3, and Dot1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clapier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fazzio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fingerman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altaf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).

We identified 137 or 230 Pol II promoters at an FDR of 1% or 5%, respectively. Strikingly, 224 of these latter promoters also pass the 1% threshold for RSC enrichment. Visual comparison of the enrichment pattern (log2 fold ChIP/Input) across all Pol II promoters reveals a high degree of overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), while a pairwise plot between the RSC and ISWI mean fold enrichment values at the TSS shows a positive correlation (r = 0.6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This enrichment also extends beyond Pol II promoters, as we observed high ISW1a occupancy at both ncRNA and tRNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We did not observe significant enrichment of ISW1a at centromeres, although we note that ISW2 is enriched at centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zentner and Henikoff, 2013</xref>), which may provide any requisite ISWI function at these loci. These results support the notion that RSC and ISW1a share a spatial (though perhaps not temporal) occupancy at particular genes.</p><p>To extend these results, we repeated Rsc8, Ioc3, and Sth1 (the ATPase subunit of RSC) ChIP using micrococcal nuclease-digested chromatin analyzed by paired-end sequencing.

This transcription attenuation, as well as any suppression by ISWI, should be evident by expression analysis. To determine whether this suppression is global in nature or restricted to a subset of genes, we performed a HybMap analysis on a sampling of genes in the genome. The HybMap technique measures both sense and anti-sense RNA levels across a genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dutrow et al., 2008</xref>), providing results that are comparable to RNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ni et al., 2010</xref>). The advantage of this technique is the direct use of total RNA (enabling the detection of transcripts lacking polyA) without RNA labeling and/or amplification protocols to obtain absolute expression levels. Although the format restricted our array to 649 genes, it included a large fraction of genes occupied by RSC (84%), both RSC and ISW1 (9%), or unoccupied (16%), using an FDR threshold of 1%. We performed this analysis on <italic>rsc2-V457M</italic>, <italic>isw1</italic>Δ, <italic>ioc3</italic>Δ, <italic>rsc2-V457M isw1</italic>Δ, and <italic>rsc2-V457M ioc3</italic>Δ strains and compared them to wild type.</p><p>Consistent with the general requirement of RSC function for transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parnell et al., 2008</xref>), the mean expression of both coding and non-coding genes (but not tRNAs) was reduced almost twofold following the loss of RSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Interestingly, individual <italic>ioc3</italic> or <italic>isw1</italic> mutants also lowered mean expression but with less magnitude. However, neither the <italic>rsc2 ioc3</italic> nor the <italic>rsc2 isw1</italic> double mutants generally suppressed the <italic>rsc2</italic> effect by restoring global gene expression. Furthermore, we saw little change among tRNA genes from any genotype and no measureable change in anti-sense transcription levels (data not shown). We also did not observe general aberrant transcription from promoters as reported previously in an <italic>rsc3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Bakel et al., 2013</xref>). These results suggest that the suppression of RSC phenotypes is not due to a global effect on gene expression but rather due to an effect at a subset of genes. To see if such genes could be identified from our sampling, we selected genes whose expression was at least partially restored by combining <italic>rsc2</italic> with <italic>isw1</italic> or <italic>ioc3</italic> mutations. This analysis revealed 20 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), which included genes for ribosome function, snoRNA genes, and several essential genes. It is likely that the combined modest change in expression at these and other genes are responsible for the suppression relationship observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>ISW1 mutations suppress nucleosomal shifts in RSC mutants</title><p>Since RSC and ISW1 are both chromatin remodelers, the most important test for antagonism involves examining whether mutations in <italic>ISW1</italic> could suppress the effects of nucleosomal changes due to the loss of RSC function. Loss of RSC results in a gain of nucleosome occupancy at the nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) commonly found near the TSS of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parnell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartley and Madhani, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ganguli et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore constructed strains that included the <italic>sth1</italic><sup><italic>td</italic></sup> degron allele in combination with an <italic>isw1Δ</italic> allele. Implementation of the <italic>sth1</italic><sup><italic>td</italic></sup> allele allows for precise inducible destruction of the catalytic subunit of RSC, thus abrogating all RSC catalytic function—which we subsequently term ‘rscΔ’ in figures and text. We chose to use both the RSC and <italic>isw1</italic> null alleles to maximize the nucleosomal effects due to the loss of catalytic activity in a manner that mutations in regulatory subunits may not. Mono-nucleosomal DNA was isolated from these yeast strains after inducing the degron allele for 2 hr and analyzed by both high-resolution microarray (rscΔ and <italic>isw1</italic>Δ) and paired-end sequencing (rscΔ only). As a reference, we also analyzed mono-nucleosomal DNA from control strains that cannot degrade Sth1 protein. To analyze the chromatin structure around the TSS, we generated nucleosome profiles around the TSS for every promoter by scoring the nucleosomal occupancy for rscΔ and RSC strains. Promoters were organized into clusters based on their rscΔ/RSC ratio profile using a k-means algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The loss of RSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) resulted in two major categories: (1) clusters 1–4 all share strong changes in nucleosome positioning following the loss of RSC and (2) clusters 5 and 6 show a weak response to the loss of RSC. Closer examination revealed further differences in each category. For example, the cluster 1 rsc<italic>Δ</italic> profile shows a dramatic gain in nucleosome occupancy over the NDR at the expense of the +1 nucleosome relative to the control RSC profile, consistent with prior work (see ‘Discussion’). There is also a clear ‘leftward’ shift in nucleosome positions over the body of the gene, towards the NDR. This nucleosome shift is particularly prominent in clusters 3 and 4, while the NDR is filled into a lesser extent and the +1 nucleosome peak is not as depleted (compared to cluster 1). To confirm that these effects were not due to limitations in the sensitivity and resolution of microarray analyses, the nucleosome profiles from the microarray data were directly compared to those from the sequencing analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nucleosome profiles of the same clusters show remarkable similarity between those derived from array and sequence, validating our approaches and conclusions. Taken together, the filling of the NDR and a strong ‘leftward’ shift of the +1 nucleosome toward the NDR are consistent features that follow loss of RSC function.</p><p>We next examined the impact due to the loss of <italic>ISW1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Loss of <italic>ISW1</italic> results in modest nucleosomal changes, most notably within the promoter-proximal 5′ coding region, either as changes in density or phasing, and minimal impact at the NDR. While loss of <italic>ISW1</italic> alone has been shown to result in nucleosomal shifts towards the TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tirosh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Bakel et al., 2013</xref>), these shifts, discernable in cluster 3, are much smaller and more restricted than those generated by the loss of RSC (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>). Importantly, in the double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), the nucleosomal profiles are more similar to wild type than rscΔ alone. Notably, the NDRs are not as filled and the shifts towards the TSS are not as severe. Taken together, these results provide considerable support for an antagonistic relationship between RSC and ISW1, especially regarding the positioning and phasing of nucleosomes over the promoter-proximal coding region of the gene.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>RSC loss impacts nucleosome structure at structured/open promoters more than unstructured/closed promoters</title><p>Above, we showed that nucleosome architecture at clusters 1–4 shows a strong response to RSC loss, whereas clusters 5 and 6 show apparently limited changes. Clusters 1–4 display a prototypical promoter nucleosomal architecture (−1, NDR, and +1 nucleosome). In contrast, clusters 5 and 6 lack this stereotypical organization; here, RSC and/or ISW1a may indeed impact nucleosome occupancy and/or positioning, but the effect may be obscured due to architectural heterogeneity. Notably, these two types of architectures have previously been designated as open (or structured) vs closed (or unstructured) and have been largely correlated with either constitutive or highly regulated gene types, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tirosh and Barkai, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cairns, 2009</xref>). We verified these classifications by plotting the mean nucleosome prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Segal et al., 2006</xref>) for each of these clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). While the predictive power for individual nucleosome positions was weak, the algorithm predicted the depth and breadth of NDRs fairly accurately. The strongly responsive clusters 1–4 had a well-defined NDR prediction, matching the observed profile, while the weakly responsive clusters 5 and 6 showed a broad shallow NDR. Since nucleosome phasing is, in part, determined by how well the −1 and +1 nucleosomes are positioned flanking the NDR, this result matches well with the general lack of consistent phasing across clusters 5 and 6 gene bodies. Interestingly, cluster 3 does not show as strong a predictive NDR as clusters 1, 2, and 4, which may partly explain why this cluster shows nucleosomal shifts in both <italic>isw1</italic>Δ and rscΔ and weak suppression in the double mutant. Taken together, structured/open promoters show the strongest response to RSC loss, whereas unstructured/closed promoters lack a strong response—though we note that the lack of a uniform structure may obscure the response (see ‘Discussion’).</p><p>Given the strong impact on chromatin structure at open/structured promoters vs the closed/unstructured promoters, we next examined how the loss of RSC might impact the transcription of these classes. Using our HybMap RNA expression data as a proxy for transcriptional impact, we scored genes from each category for expression. We note, however, that the differences between the HybMap and nucleosome experiments in several parameters, for example, RSC mutation vs depletion, time points, and representation among clusters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), place limitations on these comparisons. Nevertheless, while all promoter classes showed reduced gene expression in <italic>rsc2</italic> mutants (consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), cluster 2 and especially clusters 5 and 6 (the two ‘closed’ promoter clusters) were most severely negatively impacted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The inclusion of cluster 2 with clusters 5 and 6 is intriguing; however, it is also the only structured cluster to exhibit significant nucleosome occupancy gain over the body of the gene in rscΔ, which is likely related to the reduction in transcription. These impacts are not simply correlated with the level of gene expression, as the distribution of wild-type expression values between clusters is highly consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to what we observed previously, the <italic>isw1Δ</italic> mutants showed little impact on the bulk expression of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We also examined the chromatin structure of the 17 Pol II-transcribed genes where ISW1a loss provided significant suppression of <italic>rsc2</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, the moderate resolution provided by the microarray format limited the fine mapping of nucleosomes, preventing our ability to identify nucleosomes that might be directly responsible for suppression (data not shown). These 17 genes partitioned slightly more to closed (nine genes) than the more common open promoter structures (eight genes). Together, these results suggest that while the clearest effects on nucleosome positioning (restoration in <italic>isw1Δ</italic>) are seen with ‘open’ promoters, the largest effects on transcription are more closely associated with ‘closed’ promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06073.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Gene clusters identified by their response to RSC loss reveal different promoter classes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The relative expression in <italic>rsc2</italic> (left) or <italic>isw1</italic>Δ (right) mutants relative to wild type as measured by the HybMap assay are plotted as box and whisker distribution plots for each of the six gene clusters identified by their response to RSC loss.

One might expect that genes with a strong response in regard to nucleosome positioning would have high RSC occupancy. Somewhat surprisingly, we found the opposite result. Clusters 5 and especially 6 had the highest mean occupancy of both RSC and ISW1a. We also examined other chromatin remodeler occupancies, including SWI/SNF (this study), Isw2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zentner and Henikoff, 2013</xref>), and Chd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zentner and Henikoff, 2013</xref>).

Interestingly, histone H2AZ demonstrated an inverse relationship, as clusters 5 and 6 bore the least H2AZ. Considering that these two gene clusters have the highest occupancy of chromatin remodelers, we next asked whether these genes also exhibited high histone turnover. We plotted the mean profile of measured histone turnover rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rufiange et al., 2007</xref>) over the six gene clusters and found that the degree of histone turnover correlated well with remodeler occupancy, with cluster 6 having the highest turnover, particularly around and upstream of the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, unstructured/closed promoters have the highest remodeler occupancies and the highest turnover.</p><p>Together, these observations coalesce around the idea that these gene clusters identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, based solely on the impact of RSC remodeler loss, also broadly segregate genes into two distinct types of promoter architectures: open (structured) promoters and closed (unstructured). The gene clusters with the greatest measurable impact on chromatin organization due to RSC loss, groups 1–4, represent the open promoters, whereas groups 5 and 6 represent closed promoters, which collectively lack a distinctive organization and therefore a measurable impact. These promoter architectures matched well with the predictions of remodeler occupancy and histone turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tirosh and Barkai, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cairns, 2009</xref>). These architectures are also predicted to correlate with specific DNA sequence characteristics and nucleosome composition. For example, open promoters typically contain nucleosome exclusion sequences clustered with binding sites for factors that may help exclude or reposition nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Segal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartley and Madhani, 2009</xref>). To verify these, we scored promoters for the presence of TATA, Reb1, and Rsc3 binding sites, as well as the number of AAAAA sequences, which antagonize nucleosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaplan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Segal and Widom, 2009</xref>). We then calculated the statistical enrichment of these sequence attributes for both structured (clusters 1–4) and unstructured (clusters 5–6) genes over background by random permutation analysis. We found that clusters 1–4 showed statistically significant enrichments for Reb1 and Rsc3 binding sites and AAAAA sequences, while closed promoters showed an enrichment of TATA binding sites, matching the predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Importantly, it is unstructured/closed and TATA-rich promoters that have been shown previously to mostly rely on chromatin modifiers and remodelers for their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raser and O'Shea, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Musladin et al., 2014</xref>). As developed in the ‘Discussion’, we believe our results, combined with others, argue for two different modes of impact of RSC and other remodelers at the two promoter types: open and closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06073.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of action by RSC and ISWI remodelers at open and closed promoters.</title><p>An open or structured promoter is depicted on the left with regularly spaced nucleosomes (yellow ovals) and a predominate NDR that frequently contains sequence elements (colored lines), including Rsc3 and Reb1 binding sites as well AT-rich sequence tracts unfavorable to nucleosome formation.

In the absence of RSC, nucleosome ejection is reduced, leading to higher nucleosome density (opaque nucleosomes) and a reduction in transcription. Additional loss of ISW1a may reduce the assembly/organization of nucleosomes in the promoter, partially restoring transcription.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06073.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06073.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06073-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Chromatin remodelers represent a set of complexes with different functional roles; some remodelers are primarily involved in transcriptional activation, while others are more dedicated to chromatin assembly and/or transcriptional repression. Here, we describe an antagonistic relationship between two such chromatin remodelers, RSC and ISW1, through a combination of genetics, gene expression, and genome-wide nucleosome positioning studies. At genes, RSC is primarily utilized for gene activation, providing this function, at least in part, by establishing or maintaining the NDR structure at promoters. We find that this function is partly counteracted by Isw1 activity, which re-positions nucleosomes to ‘fill in’ the NDR and positions nucleosomes over <italic>cis</italic> regulatory sequences. While there are other remodelers that also act at promoters, we consider the interactions described herein as the strongest evidence to date exemplifying chromatin remodeler antagonism.</p><p>Evidence for RSC-Isw1 antagonism was revealed through two entirely independent unbiased genetic screens for suppression of RSC mutants. The first screen utilized an SGA method to identify suppressors of <italic>rsc7Δ</italic> and revealed <italic>isw1Δ</italic> as the strongest of four identified gene suppressors and the only gene with a chromatin-related function. Indeed, combinations of <italic>rsc</italic> mutants with mutations in chromatin factors are almost invariably lethal (<italic>rsc4</italic>-HDAC combinations are a rare exception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kasten et al., 2004</xref>]). The second screen—involving <italic>rsc2</italic> suppression by histone mutations—yielded a small set of mild suppressors in histone H3 and one suppressor of moderate strength, H4 RH17,18CY. This region of the H4 tail is known as the ‘basic patch’—an epitope of known importance for the binding and activity of several chromatin-modifying factors including ISWI, Sir3, and Dot1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clapier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clapier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altaf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fingerman et al., 2007</xref>). Further genetic work focused the impact of this mutation on ISWI function, then on Isw1 function, and finally on Isw1a function (as opposed to the compositionally distinct Isw1b complex). Notably, combinations of <italic>isw1Δ</italic> with Swi/Snf mutations did not confer suppression, indicating specificity for suppressing RSC function. Taken together, two independent genetic screens, combined with multiple additional genetic approaches, identify a specific suppression relationship between the RSC complex and the Isw1a complex.</p><p>This RSC-ISW1a suppression is also consistent with a recent report that loss of Isw1a complex can suppress the phenotypes of <italic>gcn5</italic>Δ mutations combined with loss of another H3 acetyltransferase, Sas3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lafon et al., 2012</xref>). It is possible that the <italic>isw1</italic>Δ and <italic>ioc3</italic>Δ suppression of <italic>gcn5</italic>Δ <italic>sas3</italic>Δ may be partially due to reducing the phenotypic effects of reduced acetylation by reducing RSC activity, since RSC function is partially dependent on acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">VanDemark et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We then explored whether this suppression relationship resulted from opposing roles of the two remodelers for regulating chromatin structure. A role for RSC at maintaining proper chromatin structure was previously demonstrated through the use of the strong <italic>Sth1</italic> degron allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parnell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartley and Madhani, 2009</xref>) and other RSC alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ganguli et al., 2014</xref>). Loss of RSC function results in a gain of nucleosome density across Pol III genes and at the NDR of many Pol II genes. A clear observation here is the ‘leftward’ shift of the +1 and subsequent nucleosomes towards the NDR. This is consistent with (and extends) published models that RSC maintains the NDR by moving and/or ejecting nucleosomes from the TSS. Our work suggests that this movement and ‘fill in’ is, at least in part, performed by the ISWI family of remodelers, as we have demonstrated a reduction of the ‘fill in’ in the <italic>rsc isw1</italic> double mutant. Cells lacking <italic>ISW1</italic> alone exhibit modest changes in the coding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tirosh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yen et al., 2012</xref>), which may, in part, be due to the loss of the ISW1b complex, which is thought to act primarily in the coding region, as opposed to the ISW1a complex that acts at promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morillon et al., 2003</xref>). Our work here provides the first molecular examination of <italic>rsc isw1</italic> double mutants (prompted by our genetic suppression relationships) demonstrating antagonism between these remodelers regarding the depth of the NDR, the occupancy and positioning of the +1 nucleosome, and the phasing of proximal nucleosomes in the coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The clustering of gene promoters into different classes based on their chromatin response to the loss of RSC function also revealed an interesting insight regarding the organization of promoter chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). More responsive genes have an open/structured promoter, with a classic −1, NDR, and +1 nucleosome at uniform positions with respect to the TSS. These patterns are evolutionarily conserved and partially imposed by sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ioshikhes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsankov et al., 2011</xref>), where the open promoters demonstrate a higher enrichment of nucleosome exclusion sequences, such as tracts of AAAAA, and illustrated by the strong NDR in the prediction model. While sequence alone cannot entirely dictate chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), chromatin remodelers like RSC are able to reinforce the NDR by moving nucleosomes out of the NDR. The increased likelihood of Rsc3 or Reb1 binding sites occurring within the NDR may help recruit RSC or other factors to promoters that require nucleosome sliding or ejection activity to maintain this open architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartley and Madhani, 2009</xref>). However, we note that the transcriptional output from these open promoters appears less affected following RSC loss than at closed/structured promoters (see below).</p><p>In contrast, the genes that lack a uniform chromatin response to RSC loss tend to have a closed or covered promoter, where nucleosomes are not uniformly positioned with respect to the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This is not to say that these promoters have no chromatin structure at all; rather, each promoter has a unique chromatin structure that is not uniformly identical in phasing. In composite measurements, such as those presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, these promoters appear to have little chromatin structure, when, in reality, they simply lack consensus structure. These promoters have an increased likelihood to have a TATA box and other transcription factor binding sites, whose access may be regulated by the partial occlusion by nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ioshikhes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tirosh and Barkai, 2008</xref>). Here, Isw1a may function to help assemble/mature and properly space nucleosomes at these promoters to repress transcription, which then increases their reliance upon remodelers such as RSC and/or SWI/SNF to expose these binding sites for proper activation. Hence, these promoters would have an increased presence of both activating and repressing chromatin remodelers, as well as histone turnover, both of which we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This continual state of flux, as well as lack of uniformity, may help explain why we observe little collective change in the chromatin structure in the absence of RSC function, while also observing a greater reliance on RSC function to maintain an active transcriptional status.</p><p>Taken together, our study provides the first evidence for an antagonistic relationship between RSC and ISWI, showing the genetic suppression of growth phenotypes and the lessening of chromatin impact due to the loss of RSC function. These effects are revealed on a genome-wide scale and further reveals that particular promoter chromatin architectures can influence the degree of impact. These results reveal the different strategies chromatin used by genes for maintaining and regulating genic transcription through the use of promoter architecture, DNA accessibility, and the antagonism between complexes that act on promoter chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Media, genetic methods, and strains</title><p>Rich media (YPD), synthetic complete (SC), minimal synthetic defined (SD), and sporulation media were prepared by standard methods.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Aviv Regev (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper addresses the functional antagonism between the RSC and ISW1a remodeling complexes, a subject that is of emerging interest in the chromatin field. By using a synthetic genetic array (SGA) approach to screen for suppressors of <italic>rsc</italic> mutants, the authors discovered that another remodeling protein, Isw1, specifically ameliorates the <italic>rsc</italic> mutant phenotypes. Nucleosome mapping studies revealed global effects of RSC and ISW1a complexes acting against each other in shaping the promoter chromatin architecture. This work appears to be a promising candidate for <italic>eLife</italic>. There are, however, a number of specific questions and concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) It was somewhat surprising that the general changes in nucleosome arrangement were accompanied by very few changes in RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>). For the few genes (e.g., MTH1, GOS1, SNF6, HIS4) that do show clear gene expression changes upon suppression by <italic>ioc3Δ</italic> or <italic>isw1Δ,</italic> the authors should also reveal the corresponding nucleosome maps so that readers can assess the relationship between nucleosome occupancy/position and transcription, and whether there is any correlation between the chromatin and transcription in this respect. Whatever the correlation, the issue should be articulated in the text, and possible explanations provided. Likewise it would be useful to know where the functionally affected genes fall in the categories of open and closed promoters. Do any rules emerge, or is it just random?</p><p>2) There appears to be a contradiction between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figures 4A and 6B</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, it appears that clusters 5 and 6 have the lowest RSC occupancy, whereas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, it appears that clusters 5 and 6 have the highest RSC occupancy. This point needs to be clarified.</p><p>3) The summary diagram <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> “Open” can be easily interpreted, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> “Closed” is confusing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06073.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It was somewhat surprising that the general changes in nucleosome arrangement were accompanied by very few changes in RNA levels (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4D</italic></xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2"><italic>Figure 4–figure supplement 2</italic></xref><italic>).

Whatever the correlation, the issue should be articulated in the text, and possible explanations provided. Likewise it would be useful to know where the functionally affected genes fall in the categories of open and closed promoters. Do any rules emerge, or is it just random</italic>?</p><p>As requested, we examined the genic nucleosome profile analysis for the 20 genes identified as suppressed by either <italic>isw1</italic> or <italic>ioc3</italic>. Ideally, one could link changes in nucleosome positioning to expression by using high-resolution data to show that a nucleosome has moved with respect to an important cis-controlling element, and then infer that the movement might underlie the expression change. However, our profiles are derived from a microarray platform, and although these arrays proved to be very reproducible and provide great ‘class average’ maps of gene/promoter cohorts, their resolution does not allow us to state with confidence that a single nucleosome underlies the expression change. This is indeed a limitation worth discussing, so we have added text in the Results section to reflect this limitation, and we have also included how these genes partition into the open and closed categories. This is one reason why we did not focus our paper on these single genes, but instead focused the work on our clear genetic and genomic (cohort average) evidence for antagonism between these two Remodeler families and how this interplay affects promoter/gene architecture at cohorts of genes. Future work by us and others will indeed address their interplay at particular genes.</p><p><italic>2) There appears to be a contradiction between</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6"><italic>Figures 4A and 6B</italic></xref><italic>. In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4A</italic></xref><italic>, it appears that clusters 5 and 6 have the lowest RSC occupancy, whereas in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref><italic>, it appears that clusters 5 and 6 have the highest RSC occupancy. This point needs to be clarified</italic>.</p><p>In retrospect, we see how this was a major source of confusion, but it is easily explained and corrected. The six clusters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> actually involve different datasets, clustered separately, that just happened to both have six clusters. We thank the reviewers for noticing this, as we now see how a reader could have easily thought that these were the same datasets. In actuality, these two figure panels represent independent k-means cluster organizations of different data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> represents the k-means cluster organization of the RSC and ISW1a occupancy based on the microarray data, and was provided entirely for illustrative purposes to simply show the similarity of RSC and ISW1a occupancy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> displays instead the k-means clustering of the rsc null/RSC nucleosome ratio generated (and shown) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, and thus bear no relationship to those derived in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. To reduce confusion, the cluster labels have been removed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; these labels and groups are never mentioned in the manuscript. Furthermore, we make this distinction clear in the text. Additionally, some references to cluster groups in the text now explicitly reference to those clusters derived in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, to help guide the reader.</p><p><italic>3) The summary diagram</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>“Open” can be easily interpreted, but</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>“Closed” is confusing</italic>.</p><p>We agree, and have revised the right side of the diagram figure fairly extensively. We have removed some of the action arrows with the same color as the remodeler, as we believe this was confusing as to what function these arrows portray. Instead, all action arrows are the same color as the nucleosomes to indicate what direction nucleosomes are moving.</p></body></sub-article></article>
