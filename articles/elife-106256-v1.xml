This study investigates whether the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, is capable of detecting cholesterol through their gustatory system. We found that flies are indifferent to low levels of cholesterol and avoid higher levels. The avoidance is mediated by gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), demonstrating that flies can taste cholesterol. The cholesterol-responsive GRNs comprise a subset that also responds to bitter substances. Cholesterol detection depends on five ionotropic receptor (IR) family members, and disrupting any of these genes impairs the flies' ability to avoid cholesterol. Ectopic expressions of these IRs in GRNs reveals two classes of cholesterol receptors, each with three shared IRs and one unique subunit. Additionally, expressing cholesterol receptors in sugar-responsive GRNs confers attraction to cholesterol. This study reveals that flies can taste cholesterol, and that the detection depends on IRs in GRNs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cholesterol</kwd><kwd>taste</kwd><kwd>gustatory receptor neurons</kwd><kwd>IR7g</kwd><kwd>IR51b</kwd><kwd>IR56d</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RS-2021-NR058319</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Youngseok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC007864</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montell</surname><given-names>Craig</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC016278</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montell</surname><given-names>Craig</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fruit flies detect cholesterol through ionotropic receptors in taste, leading to active avoidance despite dietary necessity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many types of tastants are beneficial at low concentrations, and harmful at high levels. Examples include minerals such as Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2018</xref>), and fatty acids such as hexanoic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pradhan et al., 2023</xref>). Organic molecules such as cholesterol play essential roles in cellular membrane integrity, signaling functions, and steroid hormone synthesis. Cholesterol is a vital molecule, which supports numerous biological processes in animals, including reproduction, nutrient transport, and cellular activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Igarashi et al., 2018</xref>). However, excessive cholesterol consumption can lead to a host of poor health consequences, including cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Soliman, 2018</xref>). Due to the bivalent impact of cholesterol on human health, it stands to reason that there may be mechanisms that exist to promote or repress the taste of cholesterol. However, it is not clear whether cholesterol is sensed by the mammalian taste system. Mice and humans express several dozen taste receptors, most of which function in bitter taste (referred to as either T2Rs or TAS2Rs). The activities of two of these bitter receptors, T2R4 and T2R14 have been shown to be modulated by cholesterol. However, it is unclear if they contribute to the taste of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pydi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shaik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>It is plausible that insects such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> might display a gustatory attraction to low levels of cholesterol since unlike vertebrates, which can synthesize cholesterol internally, fruit flies must obtain sterols through their diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark and Block, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Niwa and Niwa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shaheen, 2020</xref>). Insects acquire cholesterol primarily from plant-derived phytosterols or pre-existing cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jing and Behmer, 2020</xref>). For instance, <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> and <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> convert plant sterols to cholesterol through dealkylation in their gut, which is essential for producing hormones such as ecdysone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Igarashi et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> acquires cholesterol directly from dietary sources such as phytosterols (e.g. sitosterol, stigmasterol) and fungal sterols (e.g. ergosterol) found in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Niwa and Niwa, 2011</xref>). Given that consumption of high cholesterol is harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Soliman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schade et al., 2020</xref>), fruit flies might display a gustatory aversion to high levels, while finding low levels attractive. Such a bivalent response would be similar to the flies’ taste attraction to low concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup> and their repulsion to high Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaeger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taruno and Gordon, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sang et al., 2024</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> is also required at low levels and is deleterious at high concentrations. We have previously shown that fruit flies are indifferent to modest levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and avoid high Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, if flies are endowed with the capacity to taste cholesterol, it is open question as to whether they would have a bivalent gustatory response depending on concentration, similar to Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaeger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taruno and Gordon, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sang et al., 2024</xref>), or be indifferent to low cholesterol and reject high cholesterol, similar to the flies’ differential reaction to Ca<sup>2+</sup> depending on concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, gustatory organs are distributed on multiple body parts, including the labellum at the end of the proboscis, which represents the largest taste organ. The end of the proboscis is endowed with two labella, each of which is decorated with 31 external bristles. These sensilla house either two or four GRNs, which respond to external chemical stimulation and modulate behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dahanukar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Larsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cameron et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rimal and Lee, 2018</xref>). This is accomplished through expression of a diverse repertoire of receptor classes, including gustatory receptors (GRs), IRs, pickpocket (PPK) ion channels, and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels.</p><p>In this work, we reveal that flies taste cholesterol. Reminiscent of their reaction to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2018</xref>), they are indifferent to low cholesterol and reject high cholesterol. Using a combination of behavioral and electrophysiological assays, we demonstrate that a subset of the same class of GRNs that responds to bitter chemicals is also required in adults to avoid the taste of higher cholesterol levels. In addition, we found that multiple members of the IR family are involved in cholesterol taste perception, and that there are two overlapping sets of IRs that are sufficient to confer cholesterol sensitivity to GRNs that normally do not respond to cholesterol. This work establishes that flies can taste cholesterol, and defines the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in rejection of high cholesterol.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Flies taste cholesterol through a subset of bitter GRNs</title><p>To address whether fruit flies can taste cholesterol, we investigated whether cholesterol triggers action potentials in GRNs associated with taste bristles in the labella.

While low levels are crucial, animals must avoid consuming excessive cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beynen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Soliman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). This differential effect of cholesterol is reminiscent of the impact of Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> on health, depending on their concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Flies have a bivalent reaction to Na<sup>+</sup> depending on concentration but only avoid high Ca<sup>2+</sup> and are indifferent to low Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Therefore, it was an open question as to whether flies have the capacity to taste cholesterol, and if so, whether they are endowed with the capacity to respond differentially to low and high concentrations or only avoid high cholesterol.</p><p>Several biochemical and biophysical studies focusing on the mammalian taste receptors T2R4 and T2R14 demonstrate that these receptors can bind to and be activated or modulated by cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pydi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shaik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2024</xref>). While T2R4 and T2R14 are expressed in the taste system, they are expressed at high levels extraorally, such as in airway epithelial cells, pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, and breast epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hariri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaggupilli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Singh et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, it has been thought that these receptors may function in interoception, enabling the body to sense and respond to internal levels of cholesterol. Currently, evidence that these or other receptors function in cholesterol taste is lacking in mammals or any other animal.</p><p>Our research highlights the discovery that flies reject higher levels of cholesterol, but do not show attraction to low cholesterol even though flies cannot synthesize cholesterol and, therefore, must meet their needs for cholesterol from their diet. Nevertheless, the repulsion to a required substance is reminiscent of the fly’s response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is aversive even though Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required for life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, we discovered that the repulsion to high cholesterol is mediated through the taste system since cholesterol stimulates action potentials in a subset of GRNs. The class of GRN that is activated by cholesterol is the B class, which also responds to bitter chemicals and other aversive tastants. However, cholesterol stimulates only a subset of bitter-responsive GRNs.</p><p>An unexpected observation is that inhibition of B GRNs with Kir2.1 not only eliminates cholesterol repulsion but causes cholesterol to become highly attractive. This unmasking of an attractive mechanism for cholesterol when B GRNs are inhibited raises questions about the underlying neural circuitry and molecular mechanisms. Notably, this effect is unlikely to be due to cholesterol-induced activation of GRNs that promote feeding, since cholesterol does not activate any GRN in L-type sensilla, which are devoid of B GRNs, but include three types of attractive GRNs: A GRNs, C GRNs, and other class of GRNs (E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Montell, 2021</xref>). Thus, we suggest that the attraction to cholesterol, which is unmasked by inhibition of B GRNs, occurs through a mechanism postsynaptic to the GRNs. Understanding the attractive mechanisms could provide valuable insights into how <italic>Drosophila</italic> regulates cholesterol intake based on internal nutritional states. This is particularly relevant given that <italic>Drosophila</italic>, like other insects, are cholesterol auxotrophs and must obtain sterols from their diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>) Furthermore, elucidating the neural and molecular basis of cholesterol attraction and its potential modulation by internal metabolic states in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has the potential to reveal evolutionarily conserved mechanisms.</p><p>A key issue concerns the molecular identity of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cholesterol taste receptor. We addressed this question using both electrophysiological and behavioral approaches to assess the impact of mutating genes encoding receptors belonging to the major families of fly taste receptors. We found that five IRs are required for cholesterol taste. These include two broadly required co-receptors (IR25a and IR76b) and three other receptors (IR7g, IR51b, and IR56d). The contribution of five IRs to cholesterol taste was unanticipated since IRs are thought to be tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wicher and Miazzi, 2021</xref>). Therefore, we conducted a series of ectopic expression experiments to determine whether all five IRs were necessary to confer cholesterol sensitivity to GRNs that do not normally respond to cholesterol. We found that either of two combinations of four IRs was sufficient to endow cholesterol responsiveness to GRNs. Three of the IRs were common to both receptors (IR25a, IR56d, IR76b). However, addition of either IR7g or IR51b as the fourth IR was necessary to generate a cholesterol receptor. It remains to be determined as to why there are two cholesterol receptors, and why both are required for cholesterol taste.</p><p>The findings reported here raise the question as to whether mammals such as mice and humans perceive cholesterol through the sense of taste. It is notable that in flies cholesterol taste depends on B GRNs, which also sense bitter compounds, and that in mammals T2Rs are activated by cholesterol, since this family of receptors also respond to bitter compounds. Therefore, it is intriguing to speculate that cholesterol taste may be aversive in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent<break/>(<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Ir7a<sup>1</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rimal et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Provided by Dr. Y.

To initiate each experiment, a group of 50–70 flies (aged 3–6 d, consisting of both males and females) were subjected to an 18 hr period of fasting in a controlled humidity chamber. The subsequent procedures included the preparation of two distinct food sources, both incorporating 1% agarose as the base. The first food source was enriched with 2 mM sucrose, and the second source contained different concentrations of cholesterol in addition to 2 mM sucrose. To distinguish between these two food sources, we introduced blue food coloring dye (0.125 mg/mL brilliant blue FCF) to one and red food coloring dye (0.1 mg/mL sulforhodamine B) to the other. We evenly distributed these prepared solutions into the wells of a 72-well microtiter dish (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. 438733), alternating between the two options. Approximately 50–70 starved flies were introduced to the plate within approximately 30 min of food preparation. The flies were allowed to feed at room temperature (25 °C) for 90 min, which occurred in a dark, humid environment to maintain consistent conditions. Afterward, the tested flies were carefully frozen at −20 °C for further analysis. With the aid of a stereomicroscope, we observed and categorized the colors of their abdomens as either blue (N<sub>B</sub>), red (N<sub>R</sub>), or purple (N<sub>P</sub>). For each fly, we calculated the PI, a value derived from the combinations of dye and tastant, as follows: (N<sub>B</sub> - N<sub>R</sub>)/(N<sub>R</sub> +N<sub>B</sub>+ <sub>NP</sub>) or (N<sub>R</sub> - N<sub>B</sub>)/(N<sub>R</sub> +N<sub>B</sub>+ <sub>NP</sub>). A PI of either 1.0 or −1.0 indicated a complete preference for one of the food alternatives, and a PI of 0.0 signified no bias among the flies toward either option.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Tip recording assay</title><p>The tip recording assay was conducted according to previously established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shrestha et al., 2022</xref>). Flies of both sexes, aged between 4 and 7 d, were gently anesthetized on a bed of ice . A reference glass electrode containing Ringer’s solution was inserted into the thoracic region of the flies. Subsequently, the electrode was incrementally advanced toward the proboscis of each fly. This precise process was repeated over multiple days to ensure the reliability and consistency of the results. To stimulate the sensilla, a recording pipette with a tip diameter ranging from 10 to 20 μm was connected to a preamplifier. The pipette was filled with a blend of chemical stimulants dissolved in a 30 mM TCC solution, which served as the electrolyte solution. Signal amplification was achieved through a Syntech signal connection interface box and a band-pass filter spanning a range of 100–3000 Hz. These amplified signals were recorded at a sampling rate of 12 kHz and subsequently analyzed using AutoSpike 3.1 software (Syntech). To ensure the integrity of the recorded signals, all recordings were carried out at regular 1 min intervals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed following established procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). The labellum or brain of the flies were dissected and fixed using a 4% paraformaldehyde solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences, catalog no. 15710) in PBS-T (1 X phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100) for 25 min at 4 °C. The fixed tissues were thoroughly rinsed three times with PBS-T for 15 min each, precisely bisected using a razor blade, and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a blocking buffer composed of 0.5% goat serum in 1 X PBS-T. Primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution; mouse anti-GFP [Molecular Probes, catalog no. A11120] and rabbit anti-DsRed [TaKaRa Bio, catalog no. 632496]) were added to freshly prepared blocking buffer and incubated with the samples overnight at 4 °C. After overnight incubation, the samples underwent an additional round of thorough washing with PBS-T at 4 °C before being exposed to secondary antibodies (1:200 dilution in blocking buffer; goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 [Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. A11029] and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 [Thermo Fisher Scientific/Invitrogen, catalog no. A11011]) for 4 hr at 4 °C. After another three rounds of washing with PBS-T, the tissues were immersed in 1.25 X PDA mounting buffer (37.5% glycerol, 187.5 mM NaCl, and 62.5 mM Tris, pH 8.8) and examined using an inverted Leica LASX confocal microscope for visualization and analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantification and statistical analyses</title><p>We processed and conducted data analysis using GraphPad Prism version 8.0 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR%20002798">SCR 002798</ext-link>).

They found that flies are indifferent to low cholesterol and avoid high cholesterol.

The reported Ir56d expression pattern contradicts multiple previous studies (Brown et al., 2021 eLife, Figure 6a-c; Sanchez-Alcaniz et al., 2017 Nature Communications, Figure 4e-h; Koh et al., 2014 Neuron, Figure 3b). These studies, using three different driver lines, consistently showed Ir56d expression in sweet-sensing neurons and taste peg neurons. Importantly, Sanchez-Alcaniz et al. demonstrated that Ir56d is not expressed in Gr66a-expressing (bitter) neurons. This discrepancy is critical since Ir56d is identified as the key subunit for cholesterol detection in bitter neurons, and misexpression of Ir7g and Ir51b together is insufficient to confer cholesterol sensitivity (Fig.4b,d). Which Ir56d-GAL4 (and Gr66a-I-GFP) line was used in this study? Is there additional evidence (scRNA sequencing, in-situ hybridization, or immunostaining) supporting Ir56d expression in bitter neurons?</p><p>(2) Ir51b has previously been implicated in detecting nitrogenous waste (Dhakal 2021), lactic acid (Pradhan 2024), and amino acids (Aryal 2022), all by the same lab. Additionally, both Ir7g and Ir51b have been implicated in detecting cantharidin, an insect-secreted compound that flies may or may not encounter in the wild, by the same lab. Is Ir51b proposed to be a specific receptor for these chemically distinct compounds or a general multimodal receptor for aversive stimuli? Unlike other multimodal bitter receptors, the expression level of Ir51b is rather low and it's unclear which subset of GRNs express this receptor. The chemical diversity among nitrogenous waste, amino acids, lactic acid, cantharidin, and cholesterol raises questions about the specificity of these receptors and warrants further investigation and at a minimum discussion in this paper. Given the wide and seemingly unrelated sensitivity of Ir51b and Ir7g to these compounds I'm leaning towards the hypothesis that at least some of these is non-specific and ecologically irrelevant without further supporting evidence from the authors.</p><p>(3) The Benton lab Ir7g-GAL4 reporter shows no expression in adults. Additionally, two independent labellar RNA sequencing studies (Dweck, 2021 eLife; Bontonou et al., 2024 Nature Communications) failed to detect Ir7g expression in the labellum. This contradicts the authors' previous RT-PCR results (Pradhan 2024 Fig. S4, Journal of Hazardous Materials) showing Ir7g expression in the labellum. Additionally the Benton and Carlson lab Ir51b-GAL4 reporters show no expression in adults as well. Please address these inconsistencies.</p><p>(4) The premise that high cholesterol intake is harmful to flies, which makes sensory mechanisms for cholesterol avoidance necessary, is interesting but underdeveloped. Animal sensory systems typically evolve to detect ecologically relevant stimuli with dynamic ranges matching environmental conditions. Given that <italic>Drosophila</italic> primarily consume fruits and plant matter (which contain minimal cholesterol) rather than animal-derived foods (which contain higher cholesterol), the ecological relevance of cholesterol detection requires more thorough discussion. Furthermore, at high concentrations, chemicals often activate multiple receptors beyond those specifically evolved for their detection. If the cholesterol concentrations used in this study substantially exceed those encountered in the fly's natural diet, the observed responses may represent an epiphenomenon rather than an ecologically and ethologically relevant sensory mechanism.

The study provides evidence that (1) cholesterol activates a subset of bitter-sensing gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in the fly labellum, but not other types of GRNs, (2) flies show aversion to high concentrations of cholesterol, and this is mediated by bitter GRNs, and (3) cholesterol avoidance depends on a specific set of ionotropic receptor (IR) subunits acting in bitter GRNs. The claims of the study are supported by electrophysiological recordings, genetic manipulations, and behavioral readouts.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Cholesterol taste has not been well studied, and the paper provides new insight into this question. The authors took a comprehensive and rigorous approach in several different parts of the paper, including screening the responses of all 31 labellar sensilla, screening a large panel of receptor mutants, and performing misexpression experiments with nearly every combination of the 5 IRs identified. The effects of the genetic manipulations are very clear and the results of electrophysiological and behavioral studies match nicely, for the most part. The appropriate controls are performed for all genetic manipulations.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The weaknesses of the study, described below, are relatively minor and do not detract from the main conclusions of the paper.</p><p>(1) The paper does not state what concentrations of cholesterol are present in <italic>Drosophila</italic>'s natural food sources.

Bitter-specific expression of at least some of these receptors would be necessary to explain why bitter GRNs but not sugar GRNs (or other GRN types) normally show cholesterol responses.</p><p>(3) The authors only investigated the responses of GRNs in the labellum, but GRN responses in the leg may also contribute to the avoidance of cholesterol feeding. Alternatively, leg GRNs might contribute to cholesterol attraction that is unmasked when bitter GRNs are silenced. In support of this possibility, Ahn et al. (2017) showed that Ir56d functions in sugar GRNs of the leg to promote appetitive responses to fatty acids.</p><p>(4) The authors might consider using proboscis extension as an additional readout of taste attraction or aversion, which would help them more directly link the labellar GRN responses to a behavioral readout. Using food ingestion as a readout can conflate the contribution of taste with post-ingestive effects, and the regulation of food ingestion also may involve contributions from GRNs on multiple organs, whereas organ-specific contributions can be dissociated using proboscis extension. For example, does presenting cholesterol on the proboscis lead to aversive responses in the proboscis extension assay (e.g., suppression of responses to sugar)? Does this aversion switch to attraction when bitter GRNs are silenced, as with the feeding assay?</p><p>(5) The authors claim that the cholesterol receptor is composed of IR25a, IR76b, IR56d, and either IR7g or IR51b. While the authors have shown that IR25a and IR76b are each required for cholesterol sensing, they did not show that both are required components of the same receptor complex. If the authors are relying on previous studies to make this assumption, they should state this more clearly. Otherwise, I think further misexpression experiments may be needed where only IR25a or IR76b, but not both, are expressed in GRNs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.106256.2.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nhuchhen Pradhan</surname><given-names>Roshani</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kookmin University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seoul</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Montell</surname><given-names>Craig</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Santa Barbara</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Santa Barbara</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Youngseok</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kookmin University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seoul</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Pradhan et al investigated the potential gustatory mechanisms that allow flies to detect cholesterol.

Thus, while <italic>Ir7g</italic>/<italic>Ir51b</italic> are not exclusive to B GRNs, their functional role in cholesterol detection is B-GRN-specific.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors only investigated the responses of GRNs in the labellum, but GRN responses in the leg may also contribute to the avoidance of cholesterol feeding. Alternatively, leg GRNs might contribute to cholesterol attraction that is unmasked when bitter GRNs are silenced. In support of this possibility, Ahn et al. (2017) showed that Ir56d functions in sugar GRNs of the leg to promote appetitive responses to fatty acids.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting idea. Indeed, when bitter GRNs are hyperpolarized, the flies exhibit a strong attraction to cholesterol. Nevertheless, the cellular basis for cholesterol attraction and whether it is mediated by GRNs in the legs will require a future investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors might consider using proboscis extension as an additional readout of taste attraction or aversion, which would help them more directly link the labellar GRN responses to a behavioral readout. Using food ingestion as a readout can conflate the contribution of taste with post-ingestive effects, and the regulation of food ingestion also may involve contributions from GRNs on multiple organs, whereas organ-specific contributions can be dissociated using proboscis extension. For example, does presenting cholesterol on the proboscis lead to aversive responses in the proboscis extension assay (e.g., suppression of responses to sugar)? Does this aversion switch to attraction when bitter GRNs are silenced, as with the feeding assay?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion regarding the use of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay to strengthen the link between labellar GRN activity and behavioral responses to cholesterol.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-106256-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Our PER assay results shown above indicate that cholesterol presentation on the labellum or forelegs leads to an aversive response, as evidenced by a significant reduction in proboscis extension when compared to control stimuli (Author response image 1A. 2% sucrose or 2% sucrose with 10<sup>-1</sup>% cholesterol was applied to labellum or forelegs and the percent PER was recorded. n=6. Data were compared using single-factor ANOVA coupled with Scheffe’s post-hoc test. Statistical significance was compared with the control. Means ± SEMs. **p&lt;0.01). This finding supports the idea that cholesterol is detected by labellar and leg GRNs and elicits behavioral avoidance. In contrast, sucrose stimulation robustly induces proboscis extension, as expected for an appetitive stimulus. We confirmed the defects of due to each <italic>Ir</italic> mutant by presenting the stimuli to the labellum (Author response image 1B). Together, these PER results provide a more direct behavioral correlate of labellar and leg GRN activation and reinforce our conclusion that cholesterol is sensed as an aversive tastant through the labellar bitter GRNs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors claim that the cholesterol receptor is composed of IR25a, IR76b, IR56d, and either IR7g or IR51b. While the authors have shown that IR25a and IR76b are each required for cholesterol sensing, they did not show that both are required components of the same receptor complex. If the authors are relying on previous studies to make this assumption, they should state this more clearly. Otherwise, I think further misexpression experiments may be needed where only IR25a or IR76b, but not both, are expressed in GRNs.</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, we relied on prior work demonstrating that <italic>Ir25a</italic> and <italic>Ir76b</italic> function as broadly required co-receptors in most IR-dependent chemosensory pathways (Ganguly et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2018). These studies showed that <italic>Ir25a</italic> and <italic>Ir76b</italic> are co-expressed in many GRNs across multiple taste modalities. Functional IR complexes often fail to form or signal properly in the absence of these co-receptors. Thus, it is widely accepted in the field that <italic>Ir25a</italic> and <italic>Ir76b</italic> function together as a core heteromeric scaffold for diverse IR complexes, akin to co-receptors in other ionotropic glutamate receptor families. We state that while <italic>Ir25a</italic> and <italic>Ir76b</italic> are presumed co-receptors in the cholesterol receptor complex based on their conserved roles, their direct physical interaction with <italic>Ir7g</italic>, <italic>Ir51b</italic>, and <italic>Ir56d</italic> remains to be demonstrated.</p><p>In support of this model, we note that in our ectopic expression experiments using I9 sensilla, which endogenously express <italic>Ir25a</italic> and <italic>Ir76b</italic>, introduction of either <italic>Ir7g + Ir56d</italic> or <italic>Ir51b + Ir56d</italic> was sufficient to confer cholesterol sensitivity (Figure 4B). We obtained a similar result in L6 sensilla (Figure 4D), which also endogenously express <italic>Ir25a</italic> and <italic>Ir76b</italic>. These findings imply that both co-receptors are already present in these sensilla and are likely part of the functional complex. However, we agree that we have not directly tested the requirement for both co-receptors in a minimal reconstitution context, such as expressing only <italic>Ir25a</italic> or <italic>Ir76b</italic> alongside tuning IRs in an otherwise null background. Such an experiment would indeed provide more direct evidence of their joint requirement in the receptor complex. Future studies, including heterologous expression experiments, will be necessary to define the cholesterol-receptor complexes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
