a variety of human diseases. Due to challenges posed by the clonal nature of MAE, very little is known about its regulation; in particular, no molecular features have been specifically linked to MAE. In this study, we report an approach that distinguishes MAE genes in human cells with great accuracy: a chromatin signature consisting of chromatin marks associated with active transcription (H3K36me3) and silencing (H3K27me3) simultaneously occurring in the gene body. The MAE signature is present in ∼20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes across cell types. Notably, it is enriched among key developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. Our results open a new approach to the study of MAE that is independent of polymorphisms, and suggest that MAE is linked to cell differentiation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01256.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01256.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01256.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Understanding how genes are activated and silenced is one of the central challenges in modern biology. These processes underpin the development of a fertilized egg into a complex organism, and they can also lead to life-threatening diseases when they go wrong. There are two copies of each gene in a human cell, a maternal copy and a paternal copy, and it is thought that both copies are usually regulated together. However, there are exceptions to this rule: for certain genes only the maternal copy is expressed as a protein in some cells, whereas the paternal copy is expressed in other cells.</p><p>This form of gene regulation, which is called monoallelic expression, can result in neighboring cells heading down very different paths. In extreme cases, depending on the differences between the two copies of the gene, cells that express one copy may function normally, while cells where the other copy is activated will start forming tumors. However, despite these potentially grave consequences, and early results which suggested that monoallelic expression affected a large number of human and mouse genes, it has proved to be a major technical challenge to identify these genes in most cell types.</p><p>Now, Nag, Savova et al. have discovered a molecular signature that can be used to detect monoallelic expression. The signature was found in chromatin, the densely packed structure formed by DNA and proteins inside the cell nucleus. Nag, Savova et al. discovered that the genes that are subject to monoallelic expression are bound with proteins that are modified in two contrasting ways. One modification, which is usually a sign of gene silencing, is prevalent on the inactive copy of the gene, and the other, which often marks active genes, is chiefly present on the active copy.</p><p>Nag, Savova et al. report that these modifications are found in different sets of genes in different cell types, indicating distinct genome-wide patterns of monoallelic expression. The chromatin signature approach lets them estimate the fraction of human genes that are subject to monoallelic expression. This number is surprisingly high: about 20% of commonly expressed genes and more than one-third of tissue-specific genes. In a particularly intriguing finding, almost all bivalent genes—a subset of genes that are involved in determining the fate of cell during development—are estimated to become monoallelic when they are activated.</p><p>In addition to these unexpected findings, the chromatin signature approach opens the door to exploring monoallelic expression as a form of gene regulation in all types of cells and, ultimately, to understanding how it is involved in both normal development and in disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01256.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01256.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>monoallelic expression</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>epigenome</kwd><kwd>bivalent</kwd><kwd>AST-Seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Claudia Adams Barr Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gimelbrant</surname><given-names>Alexander A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Susan F Smith Center for Women’s Cancers</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gimelbrant</surname><given-names>Alexander A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM097253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Kun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Pew Scholars Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gimelbrant</surname><given-names>Alexander A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Active and repressive chromatin marks, asymmetrically distributed between alleles, distinguish gene bodies subject to epigenetically controlled monoallelic expression on autosomes in human cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A variety of genetic and epigenetic factors affect the relative expression levels of the two copies of each given gene in diploid cells. In addition to cis- and trans-regulatory variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilad et al., 2008</xref>), there are at least three major kinds of non-Mendelian phenomena that control allele-specific expression in mammals. One is the X chromosome inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lyon, 1961</xref>): in female embryos, around the time of implantation, about half of the cells choose to inactivate the maternal X, and the rest inactivate the paternal X, affecting most of the X-linked genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrel and Willard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berletch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). Another is imprinting: genes such as <italic>IGF2</italic> and <italic>H19</italic> are expressed either from one allele, either paternal or maternal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glaser et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Finally, a significant fraction of mammalian autosomal genes are subject to monoallelic expression (MAE), which reflects a mitotically stable allele-specific expression with different allelic states in clonal lineages. MAE is observed in olfactory receptor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chess et al., 1994</xref>), as well as genes coding for immunoglobulins and some cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pernis et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bix and Locksley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holländer et al., 1998</xref>). Using genome-wide analyses of allele-specific expression, we and others have added a surprisingly large number of the autosomal genes in human and mouse to the MAE class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gimelbrant et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeffries et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zwemer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2012b</xref>), including genes implicated in a number of human diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (<italic>APP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertram and Tanzi, 2012</xref>) and cancer (<italic>DAPK1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raval et al., 2007</xref>). MAE affects about 10% of ∼4000 tested genes in human lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) and about 15% of more than 1300 assessed genes in analogous mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gimelbrant et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zwemer et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our growing appreciation of the prevalence of MAE only underscores how little we know about its biology. The only existing, large-scale sets of data are collected in clonal lymphocyte cell lines in vitro. The limited number of analyzed clones is insufficient to generate a complete catalog of MAE genes in that cell type, and little is known about the prevalence of MAE in other cell types. Virtually nothing is understood about the establishment of MAE during development and differentiation. Mechanistically, allelic choice has been linked to changes in chromatin states in some special cases: imprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wen et al., 2008</xref>), olfactory receptor gene choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Magklara et al., 2011</xref>), and immunoglobulin-kappa gene rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farago et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, for hundreds of other autosomal MAE genes, no molecular features have been associated with establishment and maintenance of allelic choice. Similarly, there is no general understanding of MAE’s function.</p><p>A major technical bottleneck in addressing these questions is the clonal nature of MAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Like X inactivation, MAE is masked in polyclonal samples, and obtaining monoclonal cell populations is challenging for most tissue types, particularly so in vivo. Moreover, genome-wide methods are limited by the availability of polymorphisms. In this study, we report a fundamentally new approach to the detection of monoallelic expression. In contrast to other methods, it does not require any allele-specific information, instead relying on a specific chromatin pattern as a proxy for MAE. We use this approach to address questions about MAE’s prevalence, development, and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MAE genes have a characteristic chromatin signature</title><p>Histone modifications, in their diversity, present rich combinatorial possibilities for controlling gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ernst and Kellis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Filion et al., 2010</xref>). They therefore offer a constrained yet rich set of data for systematic analysis. To identify histone modifications that might be specific to the MAE genes, we compared chromatin marks associated with known MAE genes against those for known biallelically expressed (BAE) genes.</p><p>Previous observations in human and mouse cells suggested that a gene could show MAE in one cell type but not another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gimelbrant et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gimelbrant and Chess, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gimelbrant et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that if there were a correspondence between MAE state and chromatin modifications, it would be more pronounced when comparing data from the same cell type, while not necessarily from exactly the same cells. Since the largest available sets of known human MAE and BAE genes were identified in human lymphoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gimelbrant et al., 2007</xref>) (see also Dataset S1 in Dryad, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nag et al., 2013</xref>), we used these sets to compare with histone modification data for GM12878 lymphoblastoid cells deposited by the ENCODE project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunham et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We focused on the eight marks that were investigated in a broad variety of cell types: H3K27me3 (histone H3 Lys-27 trimethylation), H3K36me3, H3K4me2, H4K20me3, H3K27ac (histone H3 Lys-27 acetylation), H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To enable our analysis, we reduced complex patterns of histone modifications to two simple features capturing signal intensity in two distinct spatial domains: the proximal promoter signal (for any given modification: ChIP-Seq signal intensity integrated over the 2.5 kb region upstream of transcription start) and the signal integrated over the whole gene body (green and red areas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We then set out to analyze in a systematic way whether some combination of these measured signals can reliably distinguish known MAE genes and known biallelic genes.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01256.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genes with monoallelic expression have specific chromatin signature within the gene body.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Assessment of histone modifications.

The best-performing classifier, Decision Tree (DT), identified at the more relaxed ‘Neutral’ stringency setting almost 80% of the known MAE genes with 20% false positive rate. At a more stringent, precision-optimized setting, the DT classifier identified only 10% false positives, maintaining ∼60% of true positives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, performance of the DT classifier with just two gene-body features, H3K27me3 (associated with gene silencing) and H3K36me3 (associated with gene transcription), was as good as the performance of any full-featured model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Other feature combinations also had some discriminatory power, but not as significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This suggests that H3K27me3 and H3K36me3, taken together, account for most of the distinction between MAE and BAE genes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> also illustrates the partition of the phase space defined by these two signals by the most optimal classifier (two-feature Decision Tree; DT2F; see ‘Materials and methods’) at both high and medium stringency settings (Precision and Neutral). Performance of the DT2F classifier was at least as good as the performance of any classifier, including any other tested feature combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We concluded that known autosomal MAE and BAE genes in this study show consistent, characteristic differences with respect to the gene body ChIP-seq signal for H3K27me3 and H3K36me3. Co-occurrence of these two signals in the same gene body is thus a specific chromatin signature of known MAE genes. Importantly, MAE identified in clones is reflected by the chromatin signature in a polyclonal sample.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Chromatin signature is a reliable predictor of MAE</title><p>To broadly test this chromatin signature as a predictor of the MAE state, we identified novel genes with the MAE chromatin pattern, and assessed their allelic bias in monoclonal cell lines. Specifically, we calculated gene-body signal for H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 for all autosomal RefSeq genes based on the ENCODE ChIP-seq data for GM12878 lymphoblastoid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In these cells, the classifier predicted as monoallelic 1315 (13%) of 10,322 autosomal genes with moderate or higher expression (RPKM &gt; 1), and 15 genes (3%) of 450 highly expressed genes (with RPKM &gt; 100) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; detailed in Dataset S1 in Dryad, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nag et al., 2013</xref>). As a group, the predicted MAE genes were spread throughout all autosomes. They were interspersed with biallelic genes and showed a variety of expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This is consistent with MAE genes identified earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gimelbrant et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zwemer et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To test for transcriptional allelic bias in predicted MAE genes, we used two complementary approaches. For a broad, genome-wide analysis, we used mRNA-seq in two independent (with different direction of X-inactivation) monoclonal cell lines, DF1 and DF2. We derived these lines from GM12878 line (see ‘Materials and methods’), because both its own genome and its parental genomes were fully sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Consortium, 2010</xref>). We generated the RNA-seq data from the DF1 and DF2 clones and analyzed them using a custom analysis pipeline (see ‘Materials and methods’). Of the 48 X-linked genes with SNPs covered by 10 or more reads, 43 (∼90%) showed positive evidence of clone-specific allelic bias; the rest were inconclusive; positive evidence for equivalence was not detected in any X-linked genes (Dataset S2 in Dryad, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nag et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, of the 3270 autosomal genes with comparable coverage, 1167 (35%) showed positive evidence of equivalent expression of both alleles and no evidence of bias in either clone; 269 (8%) had allelic bias, while the rest were inconclusive.</p><p>Altogether, there were 5001 autosomal genes with at least one SNP covered at any level (Dataset S2 in Dryad, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nag et al., 2013</xref>). Of these, 1021 genes were predicted to be MAE by the DT2F classifier at the Neutral setting and 236 genes at the Precision-optimized setting. For a quantitative bias comparison, we used all expressed genes. For additional control, we also used equally sized sets of genes with matched levels of expression, randomly chosen from these remaining genes. Both control groups showed quite small mean allelic bias, about 60:40. By contrast, genes predicted MAE by the Neutral DT2F classifier showed about 75:25 bias, and the genes predicted by the classifier at Precision setting had mean bias of 90:10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To estimate probability of error, we sampled 10 sets of 40 predicted genes and 10 equally-sized control sets, matched by expression; the comparison of the mean bias in the 10 sampled sets showed highly significant difference (p&lt;9e−05; non-paired <italic>t</italic> test). Thus the predicted MAE genes had significantly higher bias than the control genes. In subsequent analysis, we used the neutral classifier setting in order to maximize the number of candidate MAE genes and scrutinize predictive properties of this less stringent setting.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01256.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Prediction testing with RNA-Seq.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative examples of allelic counts in data from two clones (DF1 and DF2) derived from GM12878 cells.

Biased expression was identified based on FDR-corrected binomial testing and allelic skewing of at least 2:1 (see ‘Materials and methods’). Importantly, rejection of the bias hypothesis by this test does not automatically mean the gene could be called unbiased. Therefore, we used equivalence testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Limentani et al., 2005</xref>), with equivalence boundaries corresponding to the two-fold imbalance; genes that failed both tests were called indeterminate. Genes predicted by the DT2F neutral classifier were enriched for genes with positively identified allelic bias; the precision classifier setting, as expected, yielded still better enrichment but fewer positively identified genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>).</p><p>This RNA-Seq approach confirms MAE predictions on a whole-transcriptome level, but it has significant limitations. Insufficient coverage depth leaves an overwhelming majority of genes as ‘indeterminate’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This results in underestimation of both the true positive and the true negative rates. Furthermore, a large majority of known MAE genes (about 85%) show biallelic expression in some clonal lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gimelbrant et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zwemer et al., 2012</xref>). This is highly important when considering any validation experiments, since even exhaustive analysis of just two independent clones would miss monoallelic expression in many such genes that would happen to show biallelic expression in the two assessed clones. To validate MAE predictions more conclusively, we measured allelic bias in a greater number of independent clones. To simultaneously increase both coverage depth and the number of biological samples, we designed a targeted extra-deep RNA-Seq assay (allele-specific targeted sequencing; AST-Seq) that allowed us to precisely quantify allele-specific expression of a subset of genes in an increased number of clones (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01256.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Prediction testing with allele-specific targeted sequencing (AST-Seq).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the deep barcoding approach. As an illustration, analysis of three clones with no multiplexing is shown, each with a different allelic bias at a SNP of interest. Random-primed cDNA or genomic DNA are used as templates for PCR1, using gene-specific primers with universal tails. The next step associated universal amplicon tails in each sample with two barcodes (PCR2); this allows for barcoding a large number of samples with limited number of secondary primers. For a given sample, all amplicons share the same two barcodes. Barcoded amplicons from all samples are pooled, and sequencing adaptors attached. After sequencing and deconvolving by barcode, allelic hits are counted. (<bold>B</bold>) Representative allelic counts using the AST-seq. Allelic bias was assessed in two clonal lines, DF1 and DF2, derived from GM12878 and four clones, H2, H7, H14, and H16, from GM13130 (‘H0’) cells. Target SNPs were chosen to be informative in both cell lines. Genomic DNA (gray) was used as a control for allelic bias introduced in amplification; only unbiased assays were pursued. Shown are representative assays for X-linked genes (as control), and examples of genes predicted MAE or biallelic based on the chromatin signature in GM12878.

Previously, we had derived and characterized several independent clones from GM13130 lymphoblastoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gimelbrant et al., 2007</xref>). Starting with four of these clones and the two clones from GM12878, we selected SNPs heterozygous in both genotypes. To control for possible genotyping errors and amplification bias, we used genomic DNA from the same cells. After removing SNPs that did not pass the equivalence test in the gDNA (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), we had SNPs in 17 predicted MAE genes and 28 predicted biallelic genes. As templates, we used DNA and DNase-treated nuclear RNA from original cell lines and the clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gimelbrant et al., 2007</xref>); as a positive control for expression bias, we included X-linked genes Dataset S3 in Dryad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nag et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We performed two sequencing experiments, with overlapping samples, obtaining 1.6 M reads on average per sample per run. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows a representative subset of all classes of assessed genes and associated allelic counts (complete data in Dataset S3 in Dryad, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nag et al., 2013</xref>). While alleles were equally represented in genomic DNA, the X-linked genes (e.g., <italic>PIR</italic> and <italic>XIAP</italic>) showed strong clone-specific bias; genes predicted as biallelic (e.g., <italic>CEP110</italic> and <italic>HDLBP</italic>) showed no significant bias. Most autosomal genes predicted as monoallelic (e.g., <italic>FRMD6</italic> and <italic>IGF1R</italic>) showed the characteristic pattern of clone-specific monoallelic expression: strong bias in some clones, and biallelic expression or opposite bias in others.</p><p>The complete results of this experiment (see Dataset S3 in Dryad, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nag et al., 2013</xref>) are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. Of the 17 predicted autosomal MAE genes, 13 exhibited strong allelic bias in at least some of the assessed clones, with 12 of those showing different direction of bias between individual clones (false positive rate of about 24%). Note that the false positive rate should be treated as an overestimate, since two of the unconfirmed genes failed in the GM13030-derived clones, while two others failed altogether. In addition, the number of clones we assayed, while higher than in the first experiment, is not sufficient to establish at high level of certainty that these are truly biallelic genes. Conversely, of the 28 predicted biallelic genes, none showed significant allelic bias in expression in any of the clones. We can thus conclude that the MAE chromatin signature is a specific and sensitive predictor of clone-specific MAE status.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Asymmetric distribution of chromatin marks between the active and inactive alleles</title><p>We asked how the allelic distribution of the active and repressive chromatin marks in clonal cell lines relates to the transcriptional allelic bias. A multiplexed padlock probe approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) enabled us to assess allelic bias in heterozygous exonic SNPs in two clones with GM12878 genotype, and four clones from GM13130 cells. After removing assays that failed equivalence test in gDNA in all samples, we had 482 SNPs (see Dataset S4 in Dryad, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nag et al., 2013</xref>).

SNPs in cDNA were assigned to one of three bins: reference allele bias; no bias; and alternative allele bias. For these groups, allelic bias in H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure4B</xref>) and H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) was determined. In unbiased loci, both H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 were equally represented.

We used the trained DT2F classifier to analyze available ChIP-seq data from PBMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2010</xref>). In this and the following analyses we applied the classifier to all genes with evidence of transcription (excluding only genes that were not expressed; with RPKM&lt;0.1), to achieve the most comprehensive possible coverage (‘Method note 1’). The overall distribution of genes in the DT2F phase space was very similar in cells in vitro and in vivo, with two principal clusters at high H3K36me3 and high H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Predicted genes in PBMC largely overlapped with our predictions for LCLs: out of 2057 genes showing the MAE chromatin signature in PBMC, and called in GM12878 cells, 83% (1712) were also predicted MAE there. This is particularly striking since the experimental data for these two related cell types were collected in two different laboratories.

This, along with the similarity in the general structure of the feature space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Fig 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggests that the biological properties of the cell type are captured by the model to a greater extent than other potential sources of variation and provides indirect support for the use of our method in other cell types. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> illustrates the prevalence of tissue-specific differences by comparing the predicted MAE genes in three cell lines. Genes predicted as MAE in only one of the three cell types are typically not expressed in all the three cell types. Strikingly, in each cell type between 1/3 and half of the predicted MAE genes showed cell type-specific expression. (In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, compare 1184 predicted MAE genes expressed in HMEC but silent in one or both other cell lines, with 495 genes that are MAE only in HMEC but expressed also in HSMM and HUVEC cells, or with 395 genes that are expressed and predicted MAE in all three cell types.)</p><p>We interpret these observations to mean that the H3K36me3–H3K27me3 gene body signature is a general feature of monoallelic expression in multiple types of human cells, while a particular set of affected genes can be cell type-specific. It should be noted that the correspondence of the chromatin signature to monoallelic expression has only been systematically validated in clonal LCL lines (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Analysis in nonclonal cell populations (such as the ENCODE cell lines or isolated ex vivo cells) has been mostly restricted to single-cell techniques such as the fluorescent in situ hybridization approach which we have used in PBMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gimelbrant et al., 2007</xref>). Until a more general study is completed, it remains formally possible that the chromatin signature does not reflect MAE in some or many cell types. The analysis in the rest of this section should be understood as being performed on genes that have a particular chromatin signature, which at least in one cell type strongly correlates with monoallelic expression.</p><p>The greater the biological similarity between cell types, the greater the overlap in MAE genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Overall, cell lines fell into two groups: GM12878, K562 and H1ESC had a larger percentage of transcribed genes with MAE chromatin signature (about 25%), while the rest had a lower percentage (about 15%). A large number of predicted MAE genes in ES cells suggest that the allelic choice may occur fairly early in development.</p><p>When assessing overlap between predicted MAE genes in different cell types, several patterns became evident. Only 61 genes were predicted as MAE in all of the seven analyzed cell types. Among commonly expressed genes (∼10,000 genes with at least some evidence of expression in all analyzed cell lines), many are predicted as MAE only in some lines, implying tissue-specific MAE. Among ubiquitously expressed genes within this group, addition of more cell lines rapidly led to a plateau in the cumulative number of MAE genes, making up about 20% of the genes in this set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In contrast, when all genes are considered (including cell type-specific ones), the number of genes expressed in at least one cell line and the cumulative number of predicted MAE genes keep rising, since a large fraction of the cell type-specific genes are predicted as MAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). With seven cell lines, the total number of genes with evidence of expression in at least one cell line (RPKM&gt;0.1) was 18,248, among which the total number of genes with the chromatin signature of MAE in at least one cell line was 8716 (48%). Extrapolation of this trend indicates that, with a large number of cell types, about half of all genes would be predicted to have MAE in one or more cell type. Qualitatively similar results remain if a higher expression threshold is applied, such as RPKM&gt;1 (39% at seven cell lines).</p><p>Taken together, these analyses lead to two unexpected conclusions: (a) among widely expressed genes, about 20% have a chromatin pattern characteristic for MAE in at least one tissue; (b) taking genes with tissue-specific expression as a group, we estimate that between 39% and 48% have the MAE pattern.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>General properties of human MAE genes</title><p>The genes with MAE chromatin signature share some pronounced features as a group. Among predicted MAE genes, genes coding for cell surface proteins and those involved in multicellular developmental processes were heavily over-represented. Conversely, housekeeping genes and genes specific to intracellular organelles were highly under-represented. When the same gene ontology categories were assessed in other analyzed cells lines, they were similarly over- or under-represented at high significance levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Since the overlap in actual genes is relatively modest, this suggests that in different cell types MAE affects different genes involved in the same type of activity.</p><p>A particularly important group consists of bivalent genes, which are also associated with overlapping active and inactive histone modifications. In embryonic stem cells, bivalent genes are transcriptionally silent, and their promoters carry overlapping peaks of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</xref>). These genes play a crucial role in determining cell fate during differentiation: upon reaching a point of lineage commitment, this ‘poised’ chromatin allows these genes to rapidly resolve into either an active or inactive state. To our surprise, we found that a remarkably large fraction of the known bivalent genes (&gt;80%) acquire the MAE chromatin signature in at least one of the differentiated cell types, much higher even when compared to other genes that are also silent in ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Our observations indicate that upon activation, these master regulator genes preferentially resolve into a state with the characteristic MAE chromatin signature.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01256.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>MAE chromatin signature in bivalent genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overrepresentation of bivalent genes among predicted MAE genes.

The initial choice is stochastic, but it is stable in the clonal progeny.

Interestingly, the promoter signal carried very little additional information relative to the gene-body features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This could be due to some combination of biological reasons with much lower noise associated with gene body features due to their much greater length. It should also be noted that we focused on promoters and gene bodies because they are unequivocally associated with particular genes. It might be informative to study the involvement of other regulatory elements, such as enhancers. Upon applying this approach to a variety of cell types, we estimate that up to 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and more than one-third of tissue-specific genes showed the chromatin signature of MAE. Since detection of the MAE signature does not rely on SNPs or on sample clonality, we expect that this approach will make feasible the analysis of MAE in primary samples, including systematic comparisons of normal and diseased tissue.</p><p>Our findings fill three major gaps in our understanding of MAE. First, we have positively identified a molecular correlate of MAE with strong predictive power. We mapped MAE signature genome-wide in multiple cell types. Finally, we uncovered an unexpected relationship between MAE and known drivers of differentiation, bivalent genes, implying a functional role of MAE in this process.</p><p>The overlap of MAE and bivalent genes poses a potential mechanistic puzzle. In the promoters of bivalent genes, both active and inactive modifications are simultaneously present on both alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, direct evidence showed individual nucleosomes carrying H3K4me3 or H3K36me3 along with H3K27me3, albeit on the opposite histone H3 tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Voigt et al., 2012</xref>). At the same time, asymmetric distribution of H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 within the gene body of MAE genes is consistent with a very simple asymmetric model: H3K27me3 is known to be associated with transcriptionally silenced chromatin, and H3K36me3 is associated with gene bodies of the actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Black et al., 2012</xref>). This leads us to speculate that transition of the bivalent genes from transcriptionally silent state with ‘poised’ chromatin into an active state often happens independently for the two alleles. In that scenario, either allele can become stably inactive, with gene body chromatin enriched with H3K27me3, while the other becomes active and enriched with H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Once the poised state has resolved into active or inactive state, it locks in that state; with some probability, both alleles become active, and the biallelic state is locked. While the molecular details of this process remain unclear, this model makes testable prediction that for bivalent genes, MAE is established during lineage commitment events, such as ES cell differentiation.</p><p>Our finding of a specific combination of molecular markers associated with autosomal MAE creates opportunities for a deeper understanding of mechanisms underlying this epigenetic phenomenon. The presence of H3K27me3 immediately implies that histone methyltransferase <italic>EZH2</italic>, and possibly other components of the PRC2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>), could be involved in MAE maintenance. Our experimental observations suggest that H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 marks are asymmetrically distributed between the alleles of genes with MAE. Our observations are consistent with the idea that a uniform molecular mechanism might be involved in MAE maintenance genome-wide.</p><p>Our study strongly implies that very similar sets of genes are subject to MAE in different individuals: the presence of the H3K36me3/H3K27me3 chromatin pattern in one individual corresponds to MAE in the same cell type in another individual. A parsimonious hypothesis is that the capacity for MAE is genetically controlled by regulatory DNA sequences, presumably in <italic>cis</italic> to the affected MAE genes. Consistent with this notion, significant inter-species conservation exists among genes subject to MAE in human and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zwemer et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Epigenetic regulation of monoallelic expression can profoundly affect the relationship between genotype and molecular phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pereira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zuo et al., 2007</xref>). One intriguing possibility is raised by a recent observation that genomically identical clones can be dramatically different in terms of tumorigenic properties and drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kreso et al., 2012</xref>). The knowledge of the chromatin signature of MAE will help in exploring the relationship between MAE and functional cellular states in normal development and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Automated classification of MAE</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Data</title><p>The chromatin mark data for the ENCODE cell lines was obtained in wig format from the UCSC genome browser The chromatin mark data for HMEC and HCC1954 were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus Series GSE29127 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22a">Hon et al., 2012</xref>), and for PBMC were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus Series GSE16368 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2010</xref>).

We then looked at dataset generated by the Wold and Gerstein labs on the GM12878 individual to create a subset of genes that were expressed in this cell type. We had very few genes in the predicted MAE table that had heterozygous SNPs in the primary transcript in both the cell lines and were expressed at sufficient level. Many MAE genes chosen also had multiple SNPs per transcript. The BAE genes to be tested were then chosen randomly from the resulting table. These were the genes that were NOT predicted to be MAE.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank A Bortvin, M Kuroda, R Medzhitov, F Winston, and members of the Gimelbrant lab for critical comments on the manuscript, A Alekseenko, B Bernstein, and A Regev for helpful technical suggestions, and SA Gimelbrant, A Landry, JB Lazaro and R Issner for technical help.</p></ack><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>AN, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>VS, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>H-LF, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>AM, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>G-CY, Critical reading of the article, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>KZ, Acquisition of data, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>AAG, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec sec-type="datasets"><title>Major dataset</title><p>The following datasets were generated:</p><p><related-object content-type="generated-dataset" document-id="Dataset ID and/or url" document-id-type="dataset" document-type="data" id="dataro1"><name><surname>Nag</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Savova</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fung</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Miron</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gimelbrant</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name>, <year>2013</year><x>, </x><source>Data from: Chromatin signature of monoallelic expression</source><x>, </x><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1775k">10.5061/dryad.1775k</ext-link><x>, </x><comment>Publicly available at Dryad (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://datadryad.org/">http://datadryad.org/</ext-link>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following list of areas of clarification and editorial comments that should be addressed.</p><p>1) The authors mentioned that they have explored different features except H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 to classified MAE and BAE genes, but do not describe them. However, it is important to see how other features affect the performance of classification.</p><p>2) The rationale of selecting several thresholds used in the analyses is not discussed nor is the variability of the results described if other higher or lower thresholds are used. This question can be applied to the 2:1 ratio used for RNAseq data to distinguish MAE from BAE genes and the thresholds corresponding to the log H3K36me3/input vs log H3K27me3/input inside of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>.</p><p>3) The predictability of the signature studied should be addressed by either providing information concerning results obtained from other cell types or make more explicit that since this approach was carried out with only a very limited biological context the general applicability is currently uncertain.</p><p>4) The authors describe the chromatin signature of gene bodies. It is not clear why they focused on gene bodies with no mention of promoter versus gene body status, or of other possible regulatory elements.</p><p>5) Why did the authors not choose similar numbers of BAE genes (1068) as MAE (270) to train the model?</p><p>6) Why are only 27% of X-linked genes showed positive evidence of clone-specific allelic bias?

However, it is important to see how other features affect the performance of classification</italic>.</p><p>We have now added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure1–figure supplement 3</xref> with multiple panels showing performance of other gene body features, as well as promoter features, with the training set genes. The main text has been adjusted accordingly with three new paragraphs starting:</p><p>“We focused on the eight marks that were investigated in a broad variety of cell types: H3K27me3 (histone H3 Lys-27 trimethylation), H3K36me3, H3K4me2, H4K20me3, H3K27ac (histone H3 Lys-27 acetylation), H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>)…”</p><p>This also addresses one part of point 4.</p><p><italic>2) The rationale of selecting several thresholds used in the analyses is not discussed nor is the variability of the results described if other higher or lower thresholds are used. This question can be applied to the 2:1 ratio used for RNAseq data to distinguish MAE from BAE genes and the thresholds corresponding to the log H3K36me3/input vs log H3K27me3/input inside of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B and 1C</italic></xref>.</p><p>We would like to clarify that the minimum 2:1 ratio of allele-specific counts in RNA-Seq data was used as one necessary but not sufficient criterion of allelic bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> summarizes additional statistical tests we required). Moreover, presence of allelic expression bias, no matter how strong, was in and of itself insufficient to call a gene MAE. In order to distinguish MAE-based bias from <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory or imprinting-based bias, we also required positive identification of equal or preferential expression of the other allele in other clonal cell populations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> for examples).</p><p>We have edited the text in the Materials and methods and Results sections to reflect this.</p><p><italic>3) The predictability of the signature studied should be addressed by either providing information concerning results obtained from other cell types or make more explicit that since this approach was carried out with only a very limited biological context the general applicability is currently uncertain</italic>.</p><p>We clarified the text as follows:</p><p>“It should be noted that the correspondence of the chromatin signature to monoallelic expression has only been systematically validated in clonal LCL lines (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Analysis in nonclonal cell populations (such as the ENCODE cell lines or isolated <italic>ex vivo</italic> cells) has been mostly restricted to single-cell techniques such as the fluorescent in situ hybridization approach which we have used in PBMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gimelbrant et al., 2007</xref>). Until a more general study is completed, it remains formally possible that the chromatin signature does not reflect MAE in some or many cell types. Thus the analysis in the rest of this section should be understood as being performed on genes that have a particular chromatin signature, which at least in one cell type strongly correlates with monoallelic expression.”</p><p><italic>4) The authors describe the chromatin signature of gene bodies. It is not clear why they focused on gene bodies with no mention of promoter versus gene body status, or of other possible regulatory elements</italic>.</p><p>We discuss analysis of promoter features in response to point 1. We also added the following to the Discussion:</p><p>“Interestingly, the promoter signal carried very little additional information relative to the gene-body features (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>). This could be due to some combination of biological reasons and higher signal/noise ratio associated with gene body features due to their much greater length. It should also be noted that we assessed promoters and gene bodies because they are unequivocally associated with particular genes. In the future, it might be informative to study the role of other regulatory elements, such as enhancers.”</p><p><italic>5) Why did the authors not choose similar numbers of BAE genes (1068) as MAE (270) to train the model</italic>?</p><p>To clarify this point, we added the following into the “Classifier training, evaluation and prediction” subsection of the Materials and methods:</p><p>“We used all genes for which the MAE or biallelic status was ascertained with high confidence to gain maximum information from all available knowledge, including negative examples.”</p><p><italic>6) Why are only 27% of X-linked genes showed positive evidence of clone-specific allelic bias? Surely this should be higher if this number is of the total expressed genes? How many of the X-linked genes looked at are known escapees</italic>?</p><p>We showed that fraction with respect to all X-linked genes with any coverage, rather than those that had sufficient coverage on the SNPs. That was confusing and we changed the description to include only genes that were sufficiently covered. We adjusted the description accordingly.</p><p><italic>7) For</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>what percentage of the previously identified monoallelically expressed genes have both chromatin signatures and the number of the genes assayed needs to be included in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref>.</p><p>We added the following text to the caption of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>: “Of 270 high-confidence MAE genes, 268 had data for both H3K27me3 and H3K36me3.
