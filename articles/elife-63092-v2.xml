of excitatory neurons, it is still unclear whether interneurons also localize a large population of mRNAs. In addition, the variability in the localized mRNA population within and between cell types is unknown. Here we describe the unbiased transcriptomic characterization of the subcellular compartments of hundreds of single neurons. We separately profiled the dendritic and somatic transcriptomes of individual rat hippocampal neurons and investigated mRNA abundances in the soma and dendrites of single glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. We found that, like their excitatory counterparts, interneurons contain a rich repertoire of ~4000 mRNAs. We observed more cell type-specific features among somatic transcriptomes than their associated dendritic transcriptomes. Finally, using celltype-specific metabolic labeling of isolated neurites, we demonstrated that the processes of glutamatergic and, notably, GABAergic neurons were capable of local translation, suggesting mRNA localization and local translation are general properties of neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>local translation</kwd><kwd>GABAergic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Erin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012818</institution-id><institution>Comunidad de Madrid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Atraccion de Talento-2019T1/BMD-14057</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alvarez-Castelao</surname><given-names>Beatriz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ramón y Cajal- RYC2018-024435-I</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alvarez-Castelao</surname><given-names>Beatriz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grant 743216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Erin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG CRC 1080</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Erin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG CRC 902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Erin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single somata and dendrites of individual rat neurons were laser-captured and sequenced to discover and compare the subcellular transcriptomes, identifying over 4000 mRNAs in GABAergic dendrites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The synaptic connections between the dendritic and axonal processes of individual neurons provide the substrate for the flow, modification, and storage of information in the brain. Because they usually extend hundreds of micrometers from their cell bodies, axons and dendrites must operate with some biochemical and electrical autonomy to accommodate changes at the speed of synaptic transmission. This is accomplished by post-translational modifications and regulation of the local proteome, including the local synthesis of proteins. By localizing specific mRNAs to these compartments, a neuron can control where and when different proteins are made and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holt et al., 2019</xref>). Working with tissue-derived RNA samples, multiple groups have identified transcripts present in dendrites and axons, revealing which proteins are likely generated by local translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cajigas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glock et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gumy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hafner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhong et al., 2006</xref>). However, by design, these tissue-based approaches forgo fundamental features of local transcriptomes that can only be dissected at the level of individual neurons. First, how universal is the localization and translation of mRNAs in different neuronal cell types? Second, how variable are the dendritic/axonal transcriptomes from one neuron type to another? Third, how much influence does the somatic abundance of a given mRNA have on its localization in neuronal processes?</p><p>It is unclear if subcellular mRNA localization and translation occurs in all types of neurons, and whether it varies according to cell type or cell state. The current state-of-the-art includes two kinds of sequencing studies. On one hand, bulk RNA studies of microdissected tissue (containing multiple cell types) have profiled mRNAs in the neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poon et al., 2006</xref>) or brain slice neuropils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cajigas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glock et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhong et al., 2006</xref>) providing a comprehensive view of mRNAs localized to the axonal/dendritic population. However, quantitative expression values obtained from these bulk sequencing approaches do not reflect the actual mRNA values present in an individual neuron, but rather the population average, potentially hiding intercellular heterogeneity in the local transcriptome. On the other hand, unbiased single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) studies circumvent the averaging effect of bulk approaches and have revealed extensive diversity in cellular composition of the brain. However, these methods require the generation of cell suspensions, resulting in the shearing off of neuronal processes and the profiling of exclusively somatic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prakadan et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, most bulk-sequencing studies have attributed the identified mRNAs to excitatory neurons; it is still unknown whether local translation occurs in different classes of inhibitory interneurons. Indeed a better understanding of the subcellular transcriptome of these neurons may help explain their diverse size, transmitter phenotype, axonal and dendritic architecture, and electrophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang and Paul, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, our growing appreciation of the brain’s cell type complexity and the fact that many of the variable genes act at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>) suggest that the specialization of dendritic and axonal compartments is a critical consequence of cell differentiation. Determining which mRNAs are locally translated could thus highlight unique functions and dynamics of cell type-specific compartments.</p><p>Single cell approaches that include dendrites or axons could, in principle, elucidate how different classes of neurons (glutamatergic, GABAergic, peptidergic, etc.) establish and maintain diverse transcriptomes across different compartments. Since it houses the source of transcription (the nucleus), the neuronal soma is the source of mRNA from which local transcriptomes are generated. It is unclear, however, how much a transcript’s somatic level influences its localization in processes, and whether transcripts can be enriched or excluded from the neurites regardless of their somatic abundances. In fact, mRNA localization is often defined based on either the absolute abundance of a transcript in neurites or the relative enrichment in comparison to somata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kügelgen and Chekulaeva, 2020</xref>). These absolute versus relative values can generate significantly different abundance rankings of the mRNAs that comprise local transcriptomes. For example, a highly expressed somatic transcript that is also abundant in dendrites would be considered highly dendritic in absolute terms, but less so in relative terms. The opposite could be true for a lowly expressed transcript frequently found in dendrites albeit at low copy numbers. These distinctions could be biologically meaningful: absolute values may indicate the number of molecules needed in a compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kosik, 2016</xref>), while relative values may reflect regulation of mRNA concentrations between compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Estimates of these values based on bulk expression may be distorted since diversity among individual neurons in both the somatic and local transcriptomes is averaged out. Ideally, the transcriptome of each subcellular compartment would be measured and compared within each neuron. Such analyses could also elucidate the functions and thus the biochemical environments that distinguish each neuronal compartment.</p><p>Here we developed a method to profile, in an unbiased manner, the transcriptome of subcellular compartments of an individual neuron, which can be scaled to hundreds of single cells. We used this method to identify the dendritic and somatic transcriptomes of cultured hippocampal neurons and observed mRNAs in the dendrites of all types of neurons including three GABAergic types. We found that dendritic transcriptomes were different from somatic transcriptomes and detected distinct patterns of dendritic mRNA variability according to cell type. Additionally, we describe the relation between somatic abundance and dendritic localization; we found that whether an mRNA is dendritically enriched or de-enriched strongly correlates with its cellular function. Finally, we show that proteins are locally synthesized in the dendrites of both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, suggesting mRNA localization and local translation are general neuronal properties.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of a subcellular scRNA-seq method</title><p>To profile individually the somatic and dendritic transcriptome of a single neuron we used laser capture microdissection (LCM), previously used to profile the transcriptome of individual cells from tissue sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nichterwitz et al., 2016</xref>), since it allows for the dissection of biological material with µm resolution. To target subcellular structures with LCM, we first optimized the dissection of individual dendritic processes of rat primary cultured hippocampal neurons (see Materials and methods). To maximize sensitivity and throughput, we adapted a scRNA-seq protocol for droplet microfluidics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>) which tags mRNAs with both an index and unique molecular identifier (UMI). The index allows sample pooling and processing followed by the identification and quantification of mRNAs from individual neuronal somata and dendritic arbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Using 92 synthetic RNA standards of different concentrations, we determined the method accurately measures RNA expression levels and reliably detects RNA species present in as low as four copies per sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Subcellular single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), compartment-specific transcriptomic signatures, and identification of cell types based on the somatic transcriptome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental workflow: After fixation, the soma and dendritic arbor of individual cultured hippocampal neurons were acquired separately by laser capture microdissection.

Every neuron was first imaged, followed by capture of the soma, followed by collection of all accessible dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Neurites of smaller diameters were avoided since they could be axons. We also collected additional somata from other neurons to expand the depth of cell types explored. As a negative control, we laser-captured comparable areas within the dish with no visible cellular structure (‘empty cuts’). All samples were then processed as described above (also see Materials and methods). Data processing steps and analyses of the sequencing data are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>. In total, we collected 795 samples: 276 dendritic samples and their respective somata, 227 somata without a dendritic arbor, and 16 empty cuts.</p><p>Somatic and dendritic samples contained significantly more RNA molecules and unique genes than empty cuts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, mean RNA counts = somata 64,265, dendrites 6,802, empty cuts 41), highlighting the accuracy of our laser-capture microdissection. On average we detected 3404 unique gene features in somata, 553 features in dendrites, and 19 features in empty cuts. Some cellular samples exhibited very low counts (somata and dendritic samples with less than 700 and 55 genes detected, respectively) and were thus not retained for downstream analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We analyzed the depth of our subcellular transcriptomes and estimated that we identified the majority of genes expressed in the soma, whereas for dendrites, the most abundant dendritic genes were identified, but some less abundant genes were probably below our detection limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To identify potential glia or low-quality cells we performed uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) for all samples, and identified two clusters expressing either glial or apoptotic markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>); these were removed from further analyses. After the above filtering steps, 345 somatic and 112 dendritic samples remained.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Somatic and dendritic samples exhibit distinct transcriptomic signatures</title><p>We first investigated the similarities between somatic and dendritic samples. If dendrites simply reflect somatic expression we would expect them to group together with their respective soma in a transcriptome-based clustering analysis. As seen by UMAP visualization, however, cellular samples clearly separated according to subcellular compartments: somata and dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Somata were further differentiated between GABAergic and glutamatergic types, while dendrites remained as one cluster. To determine whether differences in transcriptome depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) were responsible for the observed clustering, we randomly downsampled somata to different molecular totals, comparable to those observed in dendrites. Although the differences between compartments and cell types became less explicit, dendrites still formed a separate cluster while somata continued to split according to cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We also compared our data set with a recent publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Middleton et al., 2019</xref>), which used a different method to profile the dendrites and soma of 16 single neurons; we found that the dendrites and somata of the Middleton et al. data set integrated with the dendrites and somata of our data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Together these observations suggest that intercellular diversity is less pronounced in dendrites than in somata, but do not rule out cell type-specific effects in the dendritic transcriptome. Additionally, they imply that significant differences exist between the dendritic and somatic transcriptomes of the same neuron.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Identification of cell types based on the somatic transcriptome</title><p>To investigate the effect of cell type on the dendritic transcriptome, we first characterized the cell types present in our data set using our somatic samples. Dimensionality reduction of the somata revealed five neuron types: two glutamatergic and three GABAergic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref> shows the most differentially expressed genes between identified cell types (adjusted p&lt;0.05, logistic regression model). The major differences in expression occurred between glutamatergic and GABAergic somata; however, significant differences between subtypes were also observed. Although glutamatergic types 1 and 2 largely co-expressed a majority of transcripts, a handful of mRNAs like <italic>Nptx2</italic> and <italic>Grm5</italic> allowed their distinction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). GABAergic 1 neurons, the most abundant cell type in our data set, were distinguished by their expression of <italic>Sst</italic> and other neuropeptides. Despite their clear inhibitory identity, GABAergic 3 neurons exhibited a very different transcriptomic profile from GABAergic 1, mainly distinguished by the expression of <italic>Cck</italic> and <italic>Cnr1</italic>. Finally, GABAergic 2 neurons showed similarities in their expression patterns to both GABAergic 1 and 3; their identity was best described by the co-expression of some GABAergic 3 markers, like <italic>Id2</italic>, but not others, like <italic>Cck</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

Our own clustering analysis of this data set identified 12 or 19 cell types, respectively (data not shown), consistent with the authors’ observations. To find transcriptomic similarities that were robust to different species (rat vs. mouse), different growth conditions (primary culture vs. tissue), and different developmental stages (cells cultured from P0 brains vs. juvenile/adult brains), we used the Seurat.v3 algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mayer et al., 2018</xref>). Integration of the two tissue data sets and our somata samples organized cells into multiple glutamatergic, GABAergic, and non-neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Our glutamatergic 1 somata mainly distributed between hippocampal glutamatergic 1 and 2 neurons, while glutamatergic 2 somata overwhelmingly integrated within the hippocampal glutamatergic 5 cluster. Among the shared marker genes between tissue and cultured cells were <italic>Schip1</italic> and <italic>Nrgn</italic> for glutamatergic 1 somata, and <italic>Camk2a</italic> and <italic>Grm5</italic> for glutamatergic 2 somata. GABAergic 1, 2, and 3 somata showed clear differences in their integration patterns. GABAergic 1 somata were mainly split according to the expression of <italic>Pvalb</italic> among other genes. <italic>Pvalb</italic>+ GABA1 somata integrated among Basket-bistratified interneurons, while <italic>Pvalb</italic>- GABA1 somata integrated among hippocampo-septal and oriens-bistratified neurons. On the other hand, GABAergic 3 somata integrated exclusively in <italic>Cck</italic>+ neighborhoods, particularly onto radiatum-lacunosum moleculare border interneurons (RLMbs). Finally, GABAergic 2 somata were split between different types of neurogliaform and HS neurons.</p><p>Cell type classification based on the somatic transcriptome also correlated with differences in cell morphology. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> shows representative examples of each cell type. GABAergic neurons possessed darker cell bodies than glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>) consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benson et al., 1994</xref>). Among GABAergic cells, we noted that GABAergic 1 and GABAergic 3 neurons tended to have the largest and smallest somata, respectively, and exhibited differences in the length and thickness of their dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D,E</xref>). These morphological features were consistent with the transcriptomic relations established in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>. The transcriptome of GABAergic 1 most resemble basket-bistratified and hippocampo-septal interneurons: large cells that have their somata in the stratum pyramidale of the hippocampus, and exhibit complex dendritic arborizations that extend to other layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, the transcriptome of GABAergic 3 is closest to RLMb interneurons: smaller cells, whose somata are located at the border between the stratum radiatum and the stratum lacunosum moleculare, and exhibit short dendrites that usually remain in the same layer. Together these results reveal some clear cell type identities within hippocampal cultures that recapitulate the transcriptome signatures and resemble the morphological patterns observed in tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cell type-specific effects: the dendritic transcriptome of GABAergic interneurons</title><p>Profiles of the neuronal local transcriptome have been derived from populations containing diverse cell types or from populations enriched with glutamatergic neurons. Instead, our single cell approach allowed us to determine the local mRNA pool of cells classified according to their (somatic) transcriptome, including GABAergic types. We detected ~4000 mRNA species in the dendrites of the two glutamatergic and three GABAergic neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). This number is consistent with the number of translated mRNAs recently observed in the hippocampal neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glock et al., 2020</xref>) and represents 30% of the transcripts detected in somata of each cell type, suggesting similar patterns of mRNA localization in glutamatergic and different GABAergic types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The dendritic transcriptome of GABAergic neurons exhibited both similarities and differences to the glutamatergic dendritic transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For instance, <italic>Calm1</italic> and <italic>Map1a</italic> were among the most abundant dendritic RNA across all cell types. We also observed similarly low abundances in the dendrites of all cell types for genes like <italic>Meg3</italic> and <italic>Psmb2</italic>, which are robustly expressed in the somata of all cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Conversely, we observed mRNAs whose dendritic abundances changed according to cell type including <italic>Lgi2</italic> and <italic>Serf2</italic>, which were most abundant in GABAergic 1 dendrites, and <italic>Cnr1</italic> and <italic>Cplx2</italic> which were most abundant in GABAergic 3 dendrites. GABAergic 2 neurons exhibited comparable levels of dendritic mRNA species to the other cell types, but did not appear to preferentially localize any mRNA species. To validate the presence of mRNAs in GABAergic dendrites with an independent method, we performed two-color single molecule FISH (smFISH) for selected candidates in cells expressing <italic>Gad1/2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Quantification of puncta in <italic>Gad</italic>+ and <italic>Gad−</italic> distal dendrites for the above transcripts and <italic>Camk2a</italic> (known to localized to glutamatergic dendrites) confirmed these observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). <italic>Camk2a</italic> was abundant in the distal dendrites of <italic>Gad−</italic> but not <italic>Gad</italic>+ neurons indicating <italic>Gad−</italic> neurons were mostly glutamatergic.

However, as predicted, <italic>Atp5f1b</italic> was more abundant in the soma than <italic>Fth1</italic> and <italic>Cox8a</italic>. For <italic>Nsg1</italic>, a gene that was neither significantly enriched nor significantly de-enriched in dendritic samples, the great majority of the signal was in the soma, with some signal detected in the proximal dendrites. Finally, as seen in our scRNA-seq data, signal for <italic>Psmb2</italic> was almost exclusively present in the soma. To characterize the cell-to-cell variability of such patterns we used smFISH to quantify dendritic localization of two dendritically enriched genes, <italic>Eef1a1</italic> and <italic>Cox8a</italic>, and two dendritically de-enriched genes, <italic>Psmb2</italic> and <italic>Psmd6</italic>, across hundreds of neurons (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Equivalent lengths of dendrites were measured for each gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Both <italic>Eef1a1</italic> and <italic>Cox8a</italic> were highly abundant, often reaching far into the dendrites of most neurons. In contrast, <italic>Psmb2</italic> and <italic>Psmd6</italic> displayed a rapid decay of signal density within the first 20 µm of the dendrite. We also observed some cell-to-cell variability in the absolute number of dendritic mRNAs of a given transcript, as also seen in our scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For instance, a handful of dendrites exhibited low expression for <italic>Cox8a</italic>, while for <italic>Psmb2</italic> and <italic>Psmd6</italic> a few neurons showed sparse mRNA puncta along the dendrites. Thus, as observed by scRNA-seq data, the smFISH experiments showed that different genes substantially differ in their dendritic localization and abundance, with some cell-to-cell variability not accounted for by cell type.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Functional associations of dendritically enriched and de-enriched genes</title><p>To investigate whether mRNA distribution between soma and dendrites is related to function, we performed a rank-based gene set enrichment analysis.

To test this directly, we took advantage of a conditional mouse line that enables the expression of a mutant Methionyl tRNA synthetase (MetRS*) in specific cell types, when crossed to different Cre driver lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez-Castelao et al., 2017</xref>).

This technique allows for the clean dissection of the dendrites and respective soma from a cell of choice, while preserving information about its original morphology. Compared to previous attempts at profiling the local transcriptome of single neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Middleton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tóth et al., 2018</xref>), our technique dramatically expands the number of cells profiled and mRNAs identified. We discovered that the dendrites of GABAergic neurons contain ~4000 mRNA species, similar to the number of mRNAs observed in glutamatergic dendrites. We found that the dendritic transcriptome varied according to cell type, but to a lesser extent than the somatic transcriptome. Additionally, we described the relation between the somatic and dendritic transcriptomes of single neurons and how both the absolute dendritic abundance and enrichment relative to the soma vary according to gene and function. Finally, we demonstrated that, like glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic neurons translate mRNAs in their dendritic compartments.</p><p>The subcellular scRNA-seq method presented here combines LCM to isolate cellular compartments from a single neuron with scRNA-seq to profile the RNAs within it. To decrease the labor-intensive nature of LCM protocols, reduce technical variability, increase sensitivity for low-input samples, and enable the use of UMI, we adopted and modified a library preparation method initially developed for droplet microfluidics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>). This allowed us to combine single subcellular compartments into fewer samples and use RNA-sequencing to reconstruct the relation between molecules and subcellular compartments. This technique has several limitations. First, our profiles likely represented only a portion of the mRNAs actually present in dendrites. We estimate that our method detects mRNA species present in as low as four copies in the material collected by LCM, but additional losses likely occur before collection due to RNA degradation and the failure to gather all cut pieces. Accordingly, our dendritic profiles were relatively shallow and may have failed to detect genes present in moderate-to-low copy numbers. This method would thus be inadequate to profile mRNAs within individual dendritic branches. Instead, emerging methods in spatial transcriptomics relying on in-situ hybridization are better equipped for such questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xia et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast to FISH-based transcriptomic techniques, however, our method is unbiased (does not rely on a pre-determined set of transcripts), bypasses secondary structure that may limit accessibility for certain mRNAs in situ, and does not suffer from signal saturation of highly abundant transcripts. Therefore, it may be a good option for transcript discovery where a priori information about the sequence or expression levels of transcripts is lacking (e.g. exploring the usage of alternative 3’UTRs or when working in less annotated cell types or species).</p><p>While studies of neuronal mRNA localization have generated several lists of localized mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holt et al., 2019</xref>) much less attention has been paid to potential cell-to-cell diversity. To investigate the role cell identity has on the dendritic transcriptome, we determined the cell types present in hippocampal cultures based on the somatic transcriptome. This revealed two types of glutamatergic and three types of GABAergic neurons, although more subtypes likely exist within these categories. We detected some dendritic transcripts that varied according to cell identity. These included some of the genes expressed in a cell type-specific manner, and, surprisingly, genes expressed at similar levels across different cell types (based on somata transcripts). This latter group suggests differences in the machinery regulating dendritic localization according to cell type. Transport of mRNAs to dendrites is known to rely on interactions between RNA elements, particularly in 3’UTRs, and RNA binding proteins, thus enabling their movement along microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darnell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glock et al., 2017</xref>). Cell type-driven variations in mRNA localization could be explained by the cell type-specific expression of proteins capable of modifying RNA elements, like RNA-editing enzymes or epitranscriptome regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behm and Öhman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merkurjev et al., 2018</xref>), or of RNA binding proteins that may activate dendritic transport of mRNAs containing its targeted elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin and Ephrussi, 2009</xref>). Significantly more cell type-specific differences were observed between somata than between dendritic arbors, based on both unsupervised clustering and differential expression analyses. This is to be expected since the soma harbors the dendritic transcriptome in addition to transcripts that maintain cell identity (e.g. transcription factors) and axonal specialization (e.g. neurotransmitter(s) machinery). While it is likely that our method lacks sensitivity, it is also conceivable that less transcriptomic heterogeneity occurs between the dendrites of different neurons for biological reasons. Dendrites, as the recipients and integrators of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, may be more generalized than other cellular compartments. Some cell type-specific dendritic proteins may be synthesized in somata. Additionally, given the complex signal integration and plasticity that occurs within dendrites, it is plausible that cell states have bigger influences than cell types in the local mRNA repertoire.</p><p>We also investigated the patterns of mRNA distribution between the somatic and dendritic compartments of single neurons. We observed that expression levels established in the soma positively influence the dendritic presence and abundance of some, but not all, mRNAs and that the magnitude of this effect varies significantly according to the transcript. By comparing the expression between the dendrites and soma of the same neuron we identified hundreds of genes relatively enriched and de-enriched in dendrites, which occurred at a wide range of absolute abundances in dendrites. Our results are consistent with a model in which mRNAs compete for access to the transport machinery creating an advantage for the more abundant mRNA species, like <italic>Calm1</italic> or <italic>Atp5f1b</italic>. To compensate, less abundant mRNA species like <italic>Ccni</italic> and some ribosomal proteins might increase their affinity for the transport machinery based on the type or number of elements in their sequence. Interestingly, we also observed some mRNAs like <italic>Gria2</italic> and <italic>Psmb2</italic> that were significantly de-enriched in dendrites despite their moderate-to-high somatic abundances. Although it is possible that these mRNAs simply lack the elements that allow dendritic localization, it is also possible that mechanisms exist to prevent dendritic entry or to ensure somatic confinement.</p><p>Using GO analyses, we identified multiple cellular functions highly represented in the somatic and dendritic transcriptomes. Mitochondrial functions were the most represented among highly abundant somatic and dendritic genes, consistent with the high energetic demands of neuronal compartments. Indeed, local production of mitochondrial proteins was recently implicated in the function of local mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuzniewska et al., 2020</xref>), which supply energy to spatially stable compartments containing multiple synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rangaraju et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, we also observed contrasting patterns between the protein synthesis and the protein degradation machinery. Ribosomal protein (RP) mRNAs were detected across a wide range of abundances in both somatic and dendritic compartments, as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cajigas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gumy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poon et al., 2006</xref>). Despite this high variance in absolute expression most RP mRNAs exhibited dendritic enrichments relative to somatic expression of similar magnitudes. In contrast, most proteasome genes were uniformly de-enriched in dendrites despite having diverse somatic expression values. A similar opposing trend in mRNA localization between ribosomal and proteasome genes was observed in the growth cone of cortical projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poulopoulos et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the dendritic mRNAs and the intracellular localization dynamics described above were observed in both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, suggesting both can locally synthesize proteins. Indeed, we observed that GABAergic neurons localize thousands of mRNAs to their dendrites and showed directly that they also perform local translation, suggesting this is a general property of neuronal dendrites. Consistently, a recent study described the local synthesis of protein in an inhibitory axon terminal during plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Younts et al., 2016</xref>). Moving forward, it will be important to investigate how plasticity and changes in cell state regulate the dendritic transcriptome of individual neurons, ideally in the context of neuronal circuits. For instance, glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons within a circuit establish an excitatory–inhibitory balance that is crucial for proper brain functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nelson and Valakh, 2015</xref>). Single cell resolution of the local transcriptome will bring a better understanding of the intracellular mechanisms regulating its properties, as well as better comprehension of the dendritic and axonal compartments participating in diverse neuronal circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>Primary neurons</td><td>Other</td><td/><td>Animals obtained from our animal house</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td>Primary neurons</td><td>Other</td><td/><td>Animals obtained from our animal house</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Sst-IRES-Cre</td><td>Jackson</td><td>JAX013044</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Gad2-IRES-Cre</td><td>Jackson</td><td>JAX010802</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Nex-Cre</td><td>Obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Klaus-Armin Nave</td><td/><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goebbels et al., 2006</xref> <break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17146780">17146780</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>STOPflox R26-GFP-2A-MetRS*(L274G)</td><td>Developed in house</td><td>JAX028071</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-biotin</td><td>SIGMA</td><td>31852</td><td>(1:1000) IB</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Guinea pig polyclonal anti-MAP2</td><td>Synaptic Systems</td><td>188004</td><td>(1:1000) IF</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat polyclonal anti-rabbit IRDye680</td><td>Licor</td><td>Goat anti-rabbit IRDye680</td><td>(1:5000) IB</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat polyclonal anti-guinea pig Dylight405</td><td>Jackson ImmunoResearch</td><td>Goat anti-guinea pig Dylight405</td><td>(1:500-1:1000) IF</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat polyclonal anti-guinea pig-Alexa488</td><td>Thermo-fisher</td><td>Goat anti-guinea pig-Alexa488</td><td>(1:1000) IF</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Nextera XT DNA Library prep kit</td><td>Illumina</td><td>FC-131–1096</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit v2.5 (75 Cycles)</td><td>Illumina</td><td>20024906</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>ViewRNA ISH Cell Assay Kit</td><td>Thermo-fisher</td><td>QVC0001</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Cufflinks 2.2.1</td><td>Cufflinks 2.2.1</td><td/><td>Annotation of Rat 3’UTRs</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Drop-seq tools (v2.3.0)</td><td>Drop-seq tools (v2.3.0)</td><td/><td>Sequencing data processing</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Fastp</td><td>Fastp (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/tree/v0.20.1">v0.20.1</ext-link>)</td><td/><td>Read quality control</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>STAR 2.5.4b</td><td>STAR 2.5.4b</td><td/><td>Genome alignments</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Seurat 3.1.5</td><td>Seurat 3.1.5</td><td/><td>Data analyses</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GSEA_4.0.3</td><td>GSEA_4.0.3</td><td/><td>Pathway enrichment analyses</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Fiji ImageJ Version 2.0.0-rc-68/1.52 n</td><td>Fiji ImageJ Version 2.0.0-rc-68/1.52 n</td><td/><td>FISH data analyses</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animals were housed under conditions approved by the local governmental authorities in standard cages under a 12 hr:12 hr light–dark cycle with standard lab chow and water ad libitum.

Reverse transcription (RT) and template switch buffer containing 10 U/µL of SuperScript IV and its buffer at 1× (Thermo-fisher), 40 U/µL RNAse Inhibitor (Takara Bio), 1 µM Template Switch Oligo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>), 6 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Thermo-fisher), 5 mM DTT (Bio-rad), and 1M betaine (Sigma) was then added to the digestion reaction for a final volume of 6.4 µL and incubated at 55°C for 10 min of RT, followed by a 10 min incubation to inactivate the RT enzyme. Next, samples underwent a pre-amplification PCR reaction containing 1× KAPA Hifi Hot-Star Mix (Roche) and 0.1 µM ISPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>) for a final volume of 14 µL. Then, samples with different indexes but of the same source (somata, dendrites, or empty cuts) were pooled together in groups of eight and purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Libraries were further indexed, prepared, and pooled a final time using the Nextera XT DNA library prep kit (Illumina), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Library amplification PCR was performed with a custom P5 primer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Finally, paired-end sequencing was conducted on the NextSeq 550 (Illumina) according to the following specifications: Read 1 = 18 bp (Index and UMI), Read 2 = 58 bp (gene), and Read 1 Index = 8 bp (i7 index). Read 1 was generated using a custom primer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Samples were sequence in four separate runs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Transcript annotations</title><p>The rat transcriptome is not as well annotated as the mouse or human transcriptome especially in its untranslated regions. This is particularly limiting when using 3’end sequencing (like the subcellular scRNA-seq method used here) to analyze mRNAs localized to neurites since they tend to have longer 3’UTRs that are often unannotated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tushev et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, to improve our detection of mRNAs we used a recent full-length reconstruction of the hippocampal rat transcriptome using long read sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). We then created a Merged Transcriptome, by combining this full-length annotation with non-overlapping Ref-seq and Ensemble annotations. Finally, we performed bulk RNA-sequencing on the same plates used for subcellular scRNA-seq and used Cufflinks 2.2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trapnell et al., 2012</xref>) to identify additional alternative 3’UTRs. Cufflinks assembly was conducted using the Merged Transcriptome as a reference guide and included only additions to genes present in the reference, that is, novel genes were discarded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sequence quality filters, read mapping, and generation of digital expression data</title><p>Sequencing data was processed according to the Drop-seq core computation protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, using Drop-seq tools (v2.3.0) and Fastp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) reads were removed if they contained low quality indexes or UMI, or low quality, low complexity, or too short (&lt;30 bp) gene sequences. Additionally, the ends of the reads were trimmed when containing adapter sequences or stretches of &gt;6 nt of the same base (e.g. Poly A). Reads were aligned to the Rat genome using STAR 2.5.4b. Reads with multiple alignments or excessively soft-clipped (&gt;28 bp) were removed. Reads were then assigned to genes, based on their overlapped with the transcript annotations described above. Finally, UMIs of the same gene and same sample (same index) within edit distance of 1 were merged, and counted to determine the expression of each genes within each sample. Mitochondrial encoded mRNAs were excluded from all expression analyses as they are locally synthesized and thus beyond the scope of this study. Tables containing mRNA counts per sample were imported into R and analyzed using Seurat 3.1.5.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Normalization of UMI counts</title><p>All analyses, unless otherwise specified, were performed on ‘Normalized Expression’ which was calculated using Seurat’s SCTransform function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>). Briefly, SCTransform uses the residuals of a regularized negative binomial regression to correct for technical variation on UMI counts. In UMAP and Heatmap plots the natural logarithm of normalized expression is shown.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Dimensionality reduction and cluster identification</title><p>Dimensionality reduction consisted of determining the principal components (PC) of the data using Seurat’s RunPCA function and then using the top 40 PCs for UMAP embedding using Seurat’s RunUMAP function. To identify clusters, we used the top 23 PCs to construct a k-nearest neighbor graph of each cell, which was then used to construct a shared nearest neighbor graph by calculating the overlap between k-nearest neighbors, using Seurat’s FindNeighbors function. Modularity was optimized using the Louvain method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blondel et al., 2008</xref>) in Seurat’s FindClusters function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Differential expression</title><p>To determine gene markers of cell types identified in the somatic data set we used the Seurat FindAllMarkers function to conduct a logistic regression test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ntranos et al., 2019</xref>) on genes expressed in at least 25% of samples and with a log fold-change above 0.25. A cutoff of adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 was used to determine the significance. Differential expression analyses between somata or dendrites of different cell types were conducted by the above-mentioned logistic regression test using genes detected in at least 10% of the samples and with a log fold-change above 0.5, using Seurat’s FindMarkers function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A cutoff of adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 was used to determine significance in somata samples. In dendrites, however, this same cutoff reported almost no significant genes in all of the comparisons. To determine whether adjusted p-value of 0.05 was overly conservative when working with a shallower transcriptome and fewer samples (as is the case for dendrites) we performed three iterations of differential expression testing on a number of somatic samples equal to dendritic samples, and which were downsampled to equivalent molecular counts (data not shown). In these conditions, an adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05 missed most somatic differential expression between cell types. To calculate a more accurate significance cutoff we used a bootstrapping mock test approach. Briefly, dendrites belonging to each of the two groups being compared were randomly shuffled to create two mock groups while preserving the same number of samples that were present in the real groups. Differentially expressed genes in the mock groups were then identified using the same test and parameters used in the real comparison. For each cell type comparison, we tested 1000 mock permutations and create an average distribution of p-values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This distribution was then used to identify the p-value in which a 5% false discovery rate was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This p-value was then used as the cutoff in the real data set. Paired-differential expression analyses between soma and dendrites of the same neuron were conducted with Seurat’s FindMarkers function for genes expressed in at least 25% of samples using a Poisson generalized linear model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) with cell of origin as a latent variable. A cutoff of adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 was used to determine significance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Integration with hippocampal tissue scRNA-seq</title><p>Tables containing gene counts per cell were obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Middleton et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harris et al., 2018</xref> supplementary information, and run through data normalization. The Zeisel et al. and Harris et al. data sets also underwent dimensionality reduction, cluster identification, and differential expression as previously discussed. This allowed us to match the clusters identified in our analysis with those reported by the respective authors.

In brief, rat hippocampal or mouse cortical/hippocampal neuron cultures grown on MatTek glass bottom dishes were fixed for 20 min with PBS containing 4% sucrose and 4% PFA, pH 7.4, washed and permeabilized for 5 min with the provided detergent solution. Gene-specific type 1 and type 6 probe sets were applied in 1:100 dilution for 3 hr at 40°C. Signal amplification steps with PreAmp/Amp and Label Probe reagents coupled with 550dye (and 650dye or 488dye in dual color FISH) were all performed for 1 hr at 40°C with branched DNA reagents diluted in the provided solutions 1:100. Staining for markers was performed after the FISH protocol as described in the immunocytochemistry section starting after the permeabilization step. For experiments in combination with FUNCAT the FISH protocol was performed after the metabolic labeling step and the click reaction applied after finishing the FISH protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Metabolic labeling and FUNCAT</title><p>Mouse neurons expressing the MetRS*(L274G) mutant under control of GAD2-IRES-Cre, Sst-IRES-Cre, or Nex-Cre, respectively, were maintained on MatTek glass bottom dishes at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in glia- and neuron-conditioned Neurobasal-A with B27 and GlutaMax supplements. For metabolic labeling with ANL the cells were washed for 5 min with Neurobasal A with the above supplements but lacking methionine, incubated for 60 min with 4 mM ANL in Neurobasal A<sup>-Met</sup> with supplements, and finally washed with their own original methionine-containing medium for 5 min at 37°C 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and humidified atmosphere and fixed after another brief washing step as described in the RNA-FISH section. After performing the FISH protocol, the cells were blocked for 30 min with 4% goat serum in PBS pH 7.4, equilibrated to PBS pH 7.8, and subjected for 2 hr to a copper mediated click reaction in PBS pH 7.8 at RT (with the following reagents: 200 µM Triazole, 500 µM TCEP, 2 µM Alexa647 alkyne, 200 µM CuSO4) before proceeding with immunocytochemistry for marker proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Metabolic labeling of neurites and BONCAT</title><p>Mouse neurons on transwell inserts were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in glia- and cortex-conditioned Neurobasal-A supplemented with B27 and GlutaMax until 10 days in vitro. For the experiment the inserts were carefully rinsed two times in Neurobasal A lacking methionine (Neurobasal A<sup>-Met</sup>, Life Technologies) and incubated with 8 mM ANL in Neurobasal A<sup>-Met</sup> with B27 and Glutamax supplements for 15 min at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified atmosphere with or without prior removal of the soma layer by scraping (above the membrane). Negative control samples were treated in the same way but without ANL added to the media. Soma and neurite layers were harvested separately by two times scraping in PBS, transferred to a microtube followed by a 30 s centrifugation in a benchtop minifuge (neoLab, Heidelberg, Germany). When 6-well transwell membranes were used, material from three wells was combined for one replicate sample. After spindown, the supernatant was removed, the pellet immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80°C until lysis. The samples were lysed in a minimal volume of PBS with 1% (w/v) TritonX-100, 0.4% (w/v) SDS, protease inhibitors w/o EDTA (Calbiochem, 1:750), and benzonase (Sigma, 1:1000), heated to 75°C for 5 min and centrifuged. Supernatants were analyzed and adjusted for equal protein content within the soma samples and within the neurite samples of the experiment. BONCAT was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dieterich et al., 2007</xref>).

The authors do an excellent job of describing their experimental details, interpretations of the data, associated caveats, and carry out reasonable confirmations of genomic data using smFISH as well as data supporting local protein synthesis in the dendrites of GABAergic neurons. I was excited to see comparisons of dendritic vs. somatic transcripts within individual cells as well as comparisons of dendritic transcriptomes between cell types. The relative lack of differentiation of the dendritic transcriptome between cell types was somewhat surprising and even though careful downsampling and other means were carried out to account for lower depth in these transcriptomes and the authors discuss potential reasons why this may be, I do wonder if future studies with greater depth will confirm these results and/or if such results might be the case in other brain regions. It might be worthwhile for the authors to compare their data to a study published last year that carried out somatic vs. dendritic profiling in hippocampal neurons: Middleton, Eberwine and Kim, 2019.</p><p>Although that study did not differentiate between neuronal cell types, presumably one could examine this using the raw data. It should probably be cited in this manuscript as well.</p><p>While I am enthusiastic about the manuscript and the data it will provide to the field, there are some issues that could be addressed to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) In the very first figures the authors should describe how many dendrites are from which category of neurons or maybe highlight them with a different color in the UMAP plot (Figure 1C).</p><p>2) A potential deep comparison of the dendritic transcriptome of different cell types seemed exciting to me but was only superficially examined. The authors do mention the DEG list between the different groups, but only name a few genes and then validate them. It would be great to discuss the functional consequence of these differences in how the local dendritic transcriptome difference determines the functioning of these cells during signal transmission. Also, when comparing and integrating the data with published tissue scRNA-seq, why not include the dendritic data too? Such comparisons could be important for others in the field to &quot;deconvolute&quot; their scRNA-seq data to look for dendritic-enriched transcripts.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper is excellent with a wealth of data. Some points to consider:</p><p>1) In the first Results section they look at hippocampal cultures. The control is empty cuts. Could they perform an axon cut as a control?</p><p>2) They give the number of transcripts in the dendritic and somatic compartments. Although discussed in the Introduction and later in the manuscript, did they mention the total RNA extracted in each compartment and look for a selective loss of low abundance dendritic mRNAs normalized to total RNA in the beginning of the paper when making the simple comparisons to transcript numbers in the two compartments?</p><p>a) It seems one way they addressed the above issue was by down sampling which is certainly reasonable. But could they determine whether dendritic mRNAs are selectively reduced in the mRNAs from the low abundance tail of somatic mRNAs? This analysis performed at some threshold would offer a simple and quick high level look.</p><p>3) The work superbly addresses quantitative comparisons-for example in the Poisson generalized linear model, but some greater to attention to functional differences would enhance the paper. This topic is not ignored-they have a section on &quot;function associations&quot; but that section is very descriptive and not completely as satisfying as one would expect for such profound differences and such an interesting problem. In this vein, their data would be very suitable for a bipartite community detection algorithm. It seems some of the points they want to make concerning dendritic and somatic mRNAs might become more revealing by identifying bipartite modules.</p><p>4) They should address parvalbumin cells in some detail.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper by Perez and colleagues uses laser capture microdissection of dendrites and somata of cultured rat hippocampal neurons followed by single cell RNA-seq to assess the localization of mRNA transcripts in the somatic and dendritic compartments. This study addresses an important gap in our understanding of the cell type-specific regulation of dendritic RNA localization. Capturing mRNA from dendrites of single cells is challenging, and the dataset and analysis they present convincingly demonstrate that both glutamatergic and GABAergic cell types localize specific mRNA species to the dendrites in support of dendritic protein synthesis.</p><p>Overall I found the paper to be well organized and clearly presented. Although the number of cells/dendrites and the number of transcripts per cell/dendrite are modest compared with scRNA-seq studies, due to the challenge of manual LCM, the data quality appears to be sufficient to clearly separate at least ~2 glutamatergic and 3 GABAergic cell types.</p><p>1) The authors compare rat cultured neurons, derived from P0 animals, with large-scale scRNA-seq datasets from adult mouse primary hippocampus samples. What are the caveats from the species difference and also the difference between cultured and primary neurons? This should be at least mentioned.</p><p>2) – Data about gene expression are presented without any units (e.g. Figure 2A, B – y-axis; Figure 3A, B, Figure 4A-C). Are these values TPM, FPKM, CPM, or something else? In the axes with log units, is it showing log2 or log10?</p><p>3) – In the differential expression analysis, the authors explain that they used an adjusted p-value (i.e. FDR control) for somatic cell type differences, but they chose an uncorrected p-value cutoff (p&lt;.02) for the dendrites. The reasoning they provide is that the FDR-control is &quot;overly punitive&quot; (meaning conservative) and would cause a high rate of false negatives, which they demonstrate by downsampling the somatic datasets. This is not a statistically sound justification for omitting any correction for multiple comparisons, as it essentially allows an arbitrarily high rate of false positives.</p><p>One way the authors could validate the potential rate of false positives would be to shuffle the dendrite labels (i.e. randomly re-assign dendrites to each of the cell types) and re-run the analysis with the same statistical thresholds (i.e. p&lt;0.02). Any genes that pass the significance threshold are by definition false positives, and the number of such genes can be compared with the number that are detected in the original (non-shuffled) analysis. This issue is critical because it affects the central claim of the paper that there are differentially expressed dendritic RNAs between cell types. As shown in Figure 3A, only ~2-30 such genes were detected even with the uncorrected p&lt;.02 threshold, and it is thus conceivable that this number is strongly affected by false positives.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63092.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] It might be worthwhile for the authors to compare their data to a study published last year that carried out somatic vs. dendritic profiling in hippocampal neurons: Middleton, Eberwine and Kim, 2019.</p><p>Although that study did not differentiate between neuronal cell types, presumably one could examine this using the raw data.

We were initially hesitant to compare our datasets because (1) since only 16 neurons were profiled in their study there was insufficient power to perform the cell type identification and differential expression analyses that we used and (2) their study quantifies genes by number of reads instead of UMI counts (and most of the analyses we used have been designed for UMI counts). Nevertheless, we reasoned that an integration analysis as the one used in Figure 1F could circumvent the limitations of sample number and technical differences. As seen in Figure 1—figure supplement 2C, most of the dendritic and somatic samples from Middleton et al. 2019 integrated with our dendritic and somatic samples, respectively. This is consistent with our observation that dendrites and somata exhibit distinct transcriptomic signatures, and more diversity according to cell type is observed in somata. To fully reproduce our results, however, we believe the subcellular compartments of a similar or larger number of single neurons as the one used in this study, will be necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While I am enthusiastic about the manuscript and the data it will provide to the field, there are some issues that could be addressed to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) In the very first figures the authors should describe how many dendrites are from which category of neurons or maybe highlight them with a different color in the UMAP plot (Figure 1C).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, which shows the number of dendrites and somata used in the clustering analysis of Figure 1C, as well as their subsequent cell type classification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A potential deep comparison of the dendritic transcriptome of different cell types seemed exciting to me but was only superficially examined.

Unfortunately, the above analyses likely underestimate the functional associations in the cell-type specific dendritic transcriptome due to several limitations. To avoid very noisy genes, we exclude genes expressed in less than 10% of samples and with fold change below 0.5 from the differential expression test. As such, we are only able to test 783 genes between Glutamatergic and GABAergic dendrites, 556 between GABAergic 1 and GABAergic 2/3 dendrites, and 753 between GABAergic 2 and GABAergic 3 dendrites. Then, in the GSEA analysis we only considered gene ontology terms with at least 10 members present in the differential expression results. This meant that of the 2302 possible gene sets we could only test enrichment of 237 gene sets in Glutamatergic vs. GABAergic results, 187 gene sets in GABAergic 1 vs. GABAergic 2/3 results, and 224 gene sets in GABAergic 2 vs. GABAergic 3. Future datasets with higher number of dendrites (as in Figure 5A, where 95 dendrites were considered), higher detection sensitivity and differential expression tests optimized for such datasets, will likely reveal a more complete picture of functional associations in the cell-type specific dendritic transcriptomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, when comparing and integrating the data with published tissue scRNA-seq, why not include the dendritic data too?

Could they perform an axon cut as a control?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this would be interesting but unfortunately the axons are just too thin to reliably obtain enough material for this kind of experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) They give the number of transcripts in the dendritic and somatic compartments. Although discussed in the Introduction and later in the manuscript, did they mention the total RNA extracted in each compartment and look for a selective loss of low abundance dendritic mRNAs normalized to total RNA in the beginning of the paper when making the simple comparisons to transcript numbers in the two compartments?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this observation. We use the total number of counted RNA molecules (UMI counts) as a proxy for total RNA extracted (this includes both mRNAs and some non-coding RNAs) as shown in Figure 1B. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>, we show the relation between expression and likelihood of detection (fraction of somatic or dendritic samples in which a gene is detected) in both compartments. There is a close relation between expression and detection in both somatic and dendritic samples. Thus, indeed, RNA species below a certain expression level are unlikely to be detected by our method.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63092-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) It seems one way they addressed the above issue was by down sampling which is certainly reasonable. But could they determine whether dendritic mRNAs are selectively reduced in the mRNAs from the low abundance tail of somatic mRNAs? This analysis performed at some threshold would offer a simple and quick high level look.</p></disp-quote><p>This is also true. The lower a gene is expressed in the soma the less likely it is to be detected in dendrites as can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63092-resp-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The work superbly addresses quantitative comparisons-for example in the Poisson generalized linear model, but some greater to attention to functional differences would enhance the paper. This topic is not ignored-they have a section on &quot;function associations&quot; but that section is very descriptive and not completely as satisfying as one would expect for such profound differences and such an interesting problem. In this vein, their data would be very suitable for a bipartite community detection algorithm. It seems some of the points they want to make concerning dendritic and somatic mRNAs might become more revealing by identifying bipartite modules.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting suggestion. We looked into this and see that the bipartite community detection algorithm has not been used much (yet) in these biological contexts. Unfortunately, we were not able to investigate this further during the revision period because of the substantial time investment required. We hope, however, to look into this in the future and of course the data are available for anyone who is interested to also analyze with this and any other algorithm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) They should address parvalbumin cells in some detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We do detect a subset of GABAergic 1 neurons that express <italic>Pvalb</italic>. This can be seen in Figure 1—figure supplement 3A (last line, second to last panel). These <italic>Pvalb</italic>+ subset of GABAergic 1 cells maps to the <italic>Pvalb</italic>+ Basket/Bistratified cells of the CA1 in Figure 1F. Thus, these cells would likely be separated into a separate cluster from the rest of GABAergic 1 neurons if more cells were to be added to our analysis. We now mention <italic>Pvalb</italic>+ neurons in the text describing Figure 1D and Figure 1F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Overall I found the paper to be well organized and clearly presented. Although the number of cells/dendrites and the number of transcripts per cell/dendrite are modest compared with scRNA-seq studies, due to the challenge of manual LCM, the data quality appears to be sufficient to clearly separate at least ~2 glutamatergic and 3 GABAergic cell types.</p><p>1) The authors compare rat cultured neurons, derived from P0 animals, with large-scale scRNA-seq datasets from adult mouse primary hippocampus samples. What are the caveats from the species difference and also the difference between cultured and primary neurons? This should be at least mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the integration performed here entails the comparison of datasets differing in multiple influential variables, namely sample source (culture vs. tissue), developmental stage (cells plated at P0 and cultured for 2 weeks vs. juvenile/adult brains) and species (rat vs. mouse). These variables could affect the integration in two not mutually exclusive ways: (1) differences in the transcriptomes of equivalent cell types, (2) differences in the repertoire of cell types. Integrating across different species has the additional caveat of differently named orthologs or missing orthology between species. The integration algorithm we used, Seurat v3, was shown to successfully integrate scRNA-seq datasets from different species, and from culture and tissue sources in (Butler et al., 2018), and from different developmental stages in (Mayer et al., 2018), and is now routinely used for the integration of this and many other kinds of single cell datasets (Stuart and Satija, 2019). To avoid errors due to differently named orthologs between rat and mouse, we converted rat gene names to the name of their mouse ortholog, when possible. These procedures do not exclude the possibility that the aforementioned variables contribute inaccuracies to the integration analysis. However, since our somata samples integrate to the other datasets in an organized manner consistent with the expression of established neuronal markers, we believe this integration is mainly driven by real biological similarities.</p><p>We now clearly mention these differences among datasets in the text describing Figure 1F and in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Data about gene expression are presented without any units (e.g. Figure 2A, B – y-axis; Figure 3A, B, Figure 4A-C). Are these values TPM, FPKM, CPM, or something else? In the axes with log units, is it showing log2 or log10?</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies. We quantify gene expression in the form of UMI counts, which are then processed to correct for differences in coverage and technical variation to obtained “Normalized UMI Counts”. We have now added this information to the graphs and to the Materials and methods. Unless otherwise specified we use natural logarithms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the differential expression analysis, the authors explain that they used an adjusted p-value (i.e. FDR control) for somatic cell type differences, but they chose an uncorrected p-value cutoff (p&lt;.02) for the dendrites. The reasoning they provide is that the FDR-control is &quot;overly punitive&quot; (meaning conservative) and would cause a high rate of false negatives, which they demonstrate by downsampling the somatic datasets. This is not a statistically sound justification for omitting any correction for multiple comparisons, as it essentially allows an arbitrarily high rate of false positives.</p><p>One way the authors could validate the potential rate of false positives would be to shuffle the dendrite labels (i.e. randomly re-assign dendrites to each of the cell types) and re-run the analysis with the same statistical thresholds (i.e. p&lt;0.02). Any genes that pass the significance threshold are by definition false positives, and the number of such genes can be compared with the number that are detected in the original (non-shuffled) analysis. This issue is critical because it affects the central claim of the paper that there are differentially expressed dendritic RNAs between cell types. As shown in Figure 3A, only ~2-30 such genes were detected even with the uncorrected p&lt;.02 threshold, and it is thus conceivable that this number is strongly affected by false positives.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion. To address this concern, we used the suggested bootstrapping mock test approach. For each comparison we generated 1000 permutations where we randomly shuffled the identities of the dendrites between the two groups being compared and performed the same differential expression test in each. The reviewer was indeed right that a p-value of 0.02 contained a substantial number of false positives as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63092-resp-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>To correct for this, we reasoned that this approach could also be used to calculate an accurate and empirically-determined significance cutoff. We reasoned that the cumulative distribution of the permutation average in % can be interpreted as a false discovery rate. Thus, the p-value in which we obtain a 5% false discovery rate can be determined by the point in which we observe 5% of values in a cumulative distribution of the permutation average. Given the more rigorous approach we also felt we could increase the number of genes tested for differential expression by relaxing the required minimum fraction of samples expressing a gene from 0.19 to 0.1, and the required minimum log fold change between groups for a gene from 0.95 to 0.5.These analyses and the determination of p-values is now shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D, and described in the Materials and methods. Figure 3 has been updated accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
