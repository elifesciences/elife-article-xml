social experience, aggression, and reproductive success. In male <italic>Drosophila</italic>, aggression is often characterized by lunging, a frequent and comparatively low-intensity combat behavior. Here, we provide a behavioral paradigm for studying a less frequent but more vigorous fighting form known as tussling. While social enrichment decreases lunging, aligning with past observations, it heightens the more forceful tussling behavior. These two forms of aggression rely on different olfactory receptor neurons, specifically Or67d for lunging and Or47b for tussling. We further identify three pairs of central pC1 neurons that specifically promote tussling. Moreover, shifting from lunging to tussling in socially enriched males is accompanied by better territory control and mating success. Our findings identify distinct sensory and central neurons for two fighting forms and suggest that social experience may shape fighting strategies to optimize reproductive success.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fighting strategies</kwd><kwd>social experience</kwd><kwd>aggression</kwd><kwd>Or47b ORNs</kwd><kwd>pC1 neurons</kwd><kwd>reproductive competition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01h0zpd94</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32371067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Yufeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key R&amp;D Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFA1101300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Yufeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00jsay989</institution-id><institution>Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>B2402005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Yufeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Natural Science Foundation from Jiangsu Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BK20231418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Qionglin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2242023R40054</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Qionglin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Social enrichment increases the less-frequent high-intensity aggressive tussling and decreases the low-intensity aggressive lunging via distinct sensory and central neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Competition for resources such as territory, food, and mates is crucial for animal survival and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoffmann and Cacoyianni, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stockley and Campbell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zwarts et al., 2012</xref>). Among diverse competitive strategies, physical combat is a prevalent form of fighting to repel rivals and regulated by both genetic factors and social environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Sokolowski, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zwarts et al., 2012</xref>). Understanding how social experience influences combat behaviors in animals to maximize their survival and reproduction remains a fundamentally important yet inadequately understood question.</p><p>In the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, inter-male aggression includes relative low-intensity fights such as lunging, in which one fly rears up on its hind legs and snaps down onto its opponent, as well as relative high-intensity fights like tussling, where two males tumble over each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Certel and Kravitz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoopfer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Palavicino-Maggio and Sengupta, 2022</xref>). A recent work showed that lunges are insufficient to establish dominance but mainly serve to maintain social status, while tussling frequency is correlated with dominance establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simon and Heberlein, 2020</xref>). It is noteworthy that the majority of studies focus on the low-intensity lunging behavior, owing to its higher frequency and ease of observation. Substantial studies have identified regulatory genes and the neural circuit underlying the lunging-based aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoopfer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kravitz and de la Fernandez, 2015</xref>). In particular, the male-specific volatile pheromone 11-<italic>cis</italic>-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) acutely promotes lunging behavior via its olfactory receptor Or67d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang and Anderson, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, chronic cVA exposure in socially enriched males reduces the level of lunging via another olfactory receptor Or65a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Consistently, it has been found that social isolation increases lunging frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Palavicino-Maggio and Sengupta, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yadav et al., 2024</xref>) by altering the expression of genes such as <italic>Cyp6a20</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>Drosulfakinin</italic> (<italic>Dsk</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 2020</xref>), and <italic>Tachykinin</italic> (<italic>Tk</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>). Social isolation also increases male aggression in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsumoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zelikowsky et al., 2018</xref>) and even in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferguson et al., 2005</xref>). In mice, the TK homologue Tachykinin 2 (Tac2) responds to social isolation and promotes inter-male aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zelikowsky et al., 2018</xref>). These findings contribute to the consensus that social isolation escalates aggression, whereas social enrichment mitigates it in animal models.</p><p>Meanwhile, social enrichment increases male mating success by enhancing the sensitivity of <italic>Or47b</italic>-expressing olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) to fly pheromones common to both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>). Artificially activating <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs also improves mating advantage in a competitive assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dweck et al., 2015</xref>). Group housing and age-dependent juvenile hormone (JH) jointly increase the expression of the male-specific proteins from <italic>fruitless</italic> (<italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic>), which is a master gene for male courtship behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sato et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</xref>), in the <italic>Or47b</italic>-expressing ORNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hueston et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, courtship levels in single-housed (SH) wild-type males are equal to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dankert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pan and Baker, 2014</xref>, in some cases, even stronger than those in group-housed (GH) males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dankert et al., 2009</xref>). In fact, group housing decreases excitability of the courtship-promoting P1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>), which express both terminal genes in the sex determination hierarchy, <italic>fru</italic> and <italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>). These findings raise a question on how social enrichment, which suppresses lunging-based aggression and does not increase courtship intensity, would facilitate mating competition.</p><p>Here, we provide a behavioral paradigm for studying inter-male tussling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and discover that this infrequent yet intense form of combat is enhanced by social enrichment, while the low-intensity lunging is suppressed by social enrichment. This social enhancement of tussling requires olfactory receptor Or47b, but not Or67d or Or65a. We further identify three pairs of central <italic>dsx</italic>-expressing pC1 neurons that specifically promote tussling. Moreover, we demonstrate that socially enriched males can overcome mating disadvantages associated with aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A paradigm for high-intensity aggression in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>While studying the lunging-based aggression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using a high-throughput aggression assay based on previously aggression paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Certel and Kravitz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>), we occasionally observed the high-intensity boxing and tussling behavior in male flies as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nilsen et al., 2004</xref>), which are difficult to distinguish and hereafter simply referred to as tussling. We reasoned that the intensity, instead of the frequency, could be decisive for a combat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simon and Heberlein, 2020</xref>). Thus, although tussling is a less frequent behavior, it could serve a vital function.</p><p>To induce a higher level of tussling for further manipulation, we first introduced a fixed live virgin female in the same behavioral chamber for assaying lunging. The female fly was immobilized in the middle of the food, with its head embedded in the food and its body exposed to enhance male competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that males who were group-housed for 7 days showed a significantly higher frequency of tussling behavior and reduced latency to tussle in the presence of an embedded virgin female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We next compared tussling in male flies of different ages. We observed a significantly higher proportion of 14-day-old males raised in groups that showed tussling behavior during the 2 hr observation period, compared to the 7-day-old males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, 2-day-old males never displayed tussling behavior. In contrast, 14-day-old males showed a lower level of lunging behavior than 7-day-old males did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Previous studies have shown that, in addition to mating resources, food quality is another crucial factor affecting aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lim et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we next assayed tussling behavior in 14-day-old males in the presence of an embedded virgin female with different concentrations of sucrose or yeast in the food during the behavioral test. We found that these males displayed similar levels of tussling behavior with different concentrations of sucrose in the food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). On the contrary, male tussling intensity increased significantly with higher yeast concentrations such that more than 70% of males displayed this high-intensity fighting behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, see <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). Taken together, these results provide an efficient behavioral paradigm for the high-intensity tussling behavior and indicate that older males display more tussling but less lunging than younger ones.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A paradigm for tussling behavior in male <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagrams of two fighting paradigms for <italic>Drosophila</italic> tussling behavior.

Therefore, we wondered whether social enrichment might also inhibit the high-intensity tussling behavior in males. To answer this question, we compared both fighting behaviors in SH and GH 14-day-old males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Lunging and tussling events from each group of representative samples were exhibited in raster plots for comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We scored lunging behavior mainly in the first 10 min of the test, due to its relatively higher occurrence, and tussling behavior during the whole 2 hr observational period since males take much longer time to initiate tussling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, we found that while SH males performed more frequent lunging behavior in 10 min than GH males did, which is consistent with previous findings, they rarely showed tussling behavior. In contrast, GH males displayed a large number of tussling events within 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Statistical analysis of tussling and lunging behaviors showed that GH males exhibited reduced tussling latency and enhanced tussling frequency, in addition to increased lunging latency and decreased lunging frequency, compared to SH males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>). We also quantified the duration of each tussling and lunging event and found that the average duration of individual lunging events was less than 0.2 s, while a tussling event lasted from seconds to minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

Two males and one virgin female were loaded into the behavioral chamber at the same time and recorded for courtship behaviors. A winner was defined as the male that first copulated with the female. We used the copulation advance index, which was calculated as the proportional difference between marked males and unmarked males in winning copulation (see Materials and methods). We found that G7 males had no significant advantage over S7 males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>); however, G14 males displayed a significantly increased mating advantage over S14 males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, see <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the tussling-favored GH males are more competitive in territory control and mating compared to the lunging-favored SH males, supporting a correlation between tussling and reproductive competition.</p><p>The above results showed that GH males were more competitive compared to SH males, especially in older males, suggesting that social experience may play a potential role in altering age-related mating competition. To test this hypothesis, we first tested mating competition between males of different ages under the same rearing conditions. The results showed that younger males, whether reared in group or isolation, had a greater mating advantage compared to older males (G7 &gt;G14, S7 &gt;S14, G14 &gt;G21, S14 &gt;S21; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These results indicate that there is generally a disadvantage in mating competition associated with aging. We next investigated whether the mating advantage induced by social experience could compensate for the mating disadvantage caused by aging. We tested pairs of males with different ages and rearing conditions (G7 vs. S14, S7 vs. G14, G14 vs. S21, S14 vs. G21) for mating competition. We found that while 14-day-old males were less competitive than 7-day-old males regardless of the rearing condition, indicative of the aging-related disadvantage, 21-day-old GH males were significantly more competitive than 14-day-old SH males (G21 &gt;S14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate whether the territorial control and mating competition advantage in GH males are related to their high tussling behavior, we paired males with low tussling behavior (<italic>Or47b-GAL4/UAS-Kir2.1</italic> and <italic>pC1<sup>SS2</sup>/UAS-Kir2.1</italic>) with control males for territorial control and mating competition tests.

Here, we found that social experience shapes the fighting strategies of male flies, in which GH males tend to reduce the low-intensity lunging and increase the high-intensity tussling. We further showed that the two forms of fighting are mediated by distinct sensory and central neurons. The complex implications of these findings are discussed below.</p><p>Previous studies have found that social isolation generally enhances aggression but decreases mating competition in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Palavicino-Maggio and Sengupta, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yadav et al., 2024</xref>), presenting a paradox between social experience, aggression, and reproductive success. Our results provide an explanation for this paradox by dissecting aggressive behaviors into the well-studied, frequently observed lunging behavior and the less frequent but high-intensity tussling behavior. We improved the behavioral paradigm for studying tussling behavior and revealed that social experience oppositely regulates lunging and tussling. It is important to note that the frequency of lunging decreases while the frequency of tussling increases from 7-day-old to 14-day-old males, suggesting a shift in fighting strategy with age. Our results further suggest that social experience may enhance male mating competition by shifting their fighting strategy to the low-frequency, high-intensity tussling, which may be more effective in combat, although direct evidence is still lacking. These results are consistent with a previous study showing a correlation between the establishment of male dominance and tussling behavior, but not lunging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simon and Heberlein, 2020</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the mating advantage gained through social enrichment can even offset the mating disadvantage associated with aging. Note that a previous study found a mating advantage in 7-day-old males compared to 2-day-old males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2016</xref>), which may be due to different levels of sexual maturity, but not necessarily reflect the aging effect.</p><p>Our results revealed distinct neural circuits underlying the two forms of fighting, spanning from primary sensory neurons to central regulatory neurons. Specifically, silencing the cVA-sensing Or67d neurons reduced male lunging but not tussling, whereas inactivating Or47b neurons impaired male tussling but not lunging. Notably, Or47b neurons respond to pheromones common to both sexes, and the sensitivity of these sensory neurons is enhanced by social enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>). Unlike the Or67d-dependent lunging, which is primarily male-induced and socially inhibited, the Or47b-dependent tussling is promoted by social enrichment with either male or female flies. Recently, it has been found that female flies increase aggression towards mating pairs or mated females, depending on Or47b and Or67d, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaspar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wan et al., 2023</xref>). These results suggest a common function of Or47b and Or67d neurons in both sexes for regulating aggression. However, whether these neurons mediate different fighting patterns in females and how they respond to social experience in females remain unknown. According to the FlyWire connectome database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorkenwald et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schlegel et al., 2024</xref>), connecting Or47b and Or67d ORNs to pC1 neurons in females requires at least two intermediate neurons, suggesting a high degree of parallel processing from ORNs to pC1s.</p><p>Regarding central regulatory neurons, we identified a novel class of pC1 neurons, pC1<sup>SS2</sup>, that specifically promote male tussling. In male flies, there are ~60 pairs of <italic>dsx</italic>-expressing pC1 neurons, including the well-characterized P1<sup>a</sup> neurons that also express <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asahina, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang and Pan, 2022</xref>); however, there are only three pairs of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons that specifically express <italic>dsx</italic> but not <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic> and are crucial for the high-intensity tussling in males. The three pairs of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons may have distinct functions from P1<sup>a</sup> neurons in several ways. (1) P1<sup>a</sup> neurons promote both male courtship and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao et al., 2024</xref>), whereas pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons specifically promote aggression but not courtship. A recent study also identified pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons as aggression-promoting, but their roles in different fighting modes are not depicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hindmarsh Sten et al., 2025</xref>). That tussling-promoting pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons specifically express <italic>dsx</italic> but not <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic> is also consistent with a previous finding that <italic>dsx</italic>-positive pC1 neurons, rather than <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic>-positive pC1 neurons, are crucial for male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koganezawa et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the anatomical features of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons are highly similar to the male-specific aggression-promoting (MAP) neurons identified previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiu et al., 2021</xref>). (2) P1<sup>a</sup> neurons promote both lunging and tussling, although their function on tussling requires additional visual stimulation. In contrast, pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons specifically promote tussling, and the presence of light enhances but is not absolutely necessary for tussling. These results align with previous findings that visual stimuli amplify P1 activation and related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hindmarsh Sten et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kohatsu and Yamamoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pan et al., 2012</xref>), and visual stimulation is important for male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duistermars et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>). (3) Male lunging is induced after P1<sup>a</sup> activation, whereas male tussling is induced during pC1<sup>SS2</sup> activation. These results suggest that P1<sup>a</sup> neurons may not directly regulate aggression but instead induce a persistent state that promotes aggression in general, while pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons may play a more direct role in mediating tussling. Future studies are needed to further dissect the seemingly parallel sensory and central neuronal pathways involved in lunging and tussling and to explore how these pathways interact during social experience and aging to optimize reproductive success.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>We manually analyzed aggressive behaviors and strived to ensure objectivity in behavioral analysis; however, precisely tracking and quantifying specific occurrences of lunging and tussling events for each fly over extended time periods remained methodologically challenging. Furthermore, tussling events often exhibit prolonged durations, which may also include other forms of aggression such as holding. While our results indicate an association between tussling behavior and reproductive competition, a direct link between them is lacking. Future investigations are needed to establish a causal relationship between fighting strategies and reproductive success.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

There was no female in the traditional paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>), while a 3- to 5-day-old virgin female was gently fixed in the center of the food with its abdomen outside in the modified paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right). We used a fixed female to restrict its position in the center of food. Then two male testers were placed into the upper chambers separated from the food (with or without a fixed female) by a film barrier. All testers were loaded by cold anesthesia. After a 30-min adaptation, the film was gently removed to allow the two males to fall into the behavioral chamber, and the aggressive behavior was recorded for 2 hr. The aggression assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> were performed by using the paradigm without female, while other data were acquired using the modified paradigm with a fixed female unless otherwise stated. In some experiments, both single-housed and group-housed (30–40 males per vial) males were assayed for comparison.</p><p>We manually analyzed lunging and tussling behaviors in this study. Lunging is characterized by a male raising its forelegs and quickly striking the opponent, and each lunge typically lasts less than 0.2 s through detailed slow-motion analysis. Tussling is characterized by both males using their forelegs and bodies to tumble over each other, and this behavior may last from seconds to minutes. Tussling is often mixed with boxing, in which both flies rear up and strike the opponent with forelegs. Since boxing is often transient and difficult to distinguish from tussling, we referred to the mixed boxing and tussling behavior simply as tussling. As we manually analyze tussling for 2 hr for each pair of males, it is possible that we may miss some tussling events, especially those quick ones.</p><p>For the quantification of lunge latency and frequency in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>, we manually analyzed the videos and defined the lunge latency as the time point at which the first lunging event occurred between the two male flies after the start of the recording. We then counted the number of lunge events occurring within 10 min after the first lunge. For the quantification of tussle latency and frequency in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B, C, D</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A and B</xref>, we manually analyzed the videos and defined the tussle latency as the time point at which the first tussling event occurred between the two male flies after the start of the recording. We defined the tussle frequency (No. of tussles in 2 hr) as the total number of tussling events that occurred within two hours from the beginning of the video.</p><p>The food recipes for the male aggression assay were listed below.

Before the recording started, the chamber was transferred to the recording platform at a specific temperature (22 °C or 30 °C) for 30 min adaptation. After that, the film was removed, and the behavior was recorded for 1 hr.

The specific light stimulation protocols are shown in the schematic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In brief, two 5–7 days old males were loaded into the circular chamber (d=10 mm) under freeze anesthesia and separated with a transparent film in the dark. Then the chamber was moved on the plane light source (IR channel: 865 nm, red-light channel: 630 nm) for 15 min adaptation. Before video recording, the IR light channel was switched on and adjusted to the appropriate intensity for recording. The film was removed before the recording started, with the red-light channel switched on (constant red light, 0.02 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) during the 2nd and 5th minutes of the experiment. The statistics for the tussling, lunging, and unilateral wing extension (UWE) are as follows. For tussling time and UWE time, we used LifesongY 2.1 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo, 2021</xref>), which is written by Dr. Chao Guo based on LifesongX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 1992</xref>), to calculate the percentage of the total time these behaviors occurred per minute. Specifically, the ‘tussling time (%)’ refers to the percentage of time during the observation period in which tussling behavior occurred, relative to the total observation time. Similarly, ‘UWE time (%)’ represents the percentage of time during the observation period in which UWE occurred. For lunges, we counted the number of lunging occurrences per minute.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Territorial competition experiment</title><p>For the territorial competition experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>, the behavioral setup was produced using a 3D printer (Bambu Lab A1), as illustrated in the schematic, with a transparent cover plate placed on the top. The preparation of food and female was the same as the above aggression paradigm. The female was fixed in the center of the food, and two male testers were placed separately in the two small chambers on both sides. Before initiating the experiment, the two barriers were closed. After a 30-min adaptation, the barriers were opened to allow the males access to the central large chamber and were closed once the males went inside, and the territorial behavior was recorded for 2 hr. The first 10 encounters occurring after 1 hr of recording were used for statistical analysis. The winning event was defined as a male driving the other male out of the food area. To discriminate between tester males, about half of them were marked on one of their wings using a red marker pen 24 hr before the experiment. For experiments using males with different ages and/or housing conditions, we calculated the winning index as (num. of wins by males [upper panel] – num. of wins by males [lower panel])/10 encounters * 100%. For control experiments using males of the same age and housing condition, we calculated the winning index as (num. of wins by unmarked males – num. of wins by marked males)/10 encounters * 100%, which is roughly zero due to the randomness of marking.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Mating competition experiment</title><p>For the mating competition experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>, the wings of males were marked 24 hr prior to the experiment the same as described above. During the experiment, a 3–5 days old virgin female was placed into the chamber under freeze anesthesia and covered with a transparent film. Then the unmarked males were loaded into the chamber in the same manner and also covered with a transparent film. Finally, the marked males were loaded. After 30 min adaptation, two films were removed to allow the three flies to interact, and the behavior was recorded for 1 hr. The chambers without successful copulation during the 1 hr period were excluded from further analysis. For each condition, we used 120 efficient chambers with 10 random chambers collectively as one sample. For experiments using males with different ages and/or housing conditions, the copulation advance index was defined as (number of male winners [upper panel] – number of male winners [lower panel])/10 chambers * 100%. For control experiments using males of the same age and housing condition, the copulation advance index was calculated as (number of winners by unmarked males – number of winners by marked males)/10 chambers * 100%, which is roughly zero due to the randomness of marking. The winner was defined as the male that first copulated with the female.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>Adult fly samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and decapitated by vortex.

Two modes of inter-male aggression in Drosophila are known: lunging, high-frequency but weak mode, and tussling, low-frequency but more vigorous mode. Previous studies have mainly focused on the lunging. In this paper, the authors developed a new behavioral experiment system for observing tussling behavior and found that tussling is enhanced by group rearing, while lunging is suppressed. They then searched for neurons involved in the generation of tussling. Although olfactory receptors named Or67d and Or65a have previously been reported to function in the control of lunging, the authors found that these neurons do not function in the execution of tussling and another olfactory receptor, Or47b, is required for tussling, as shown by the inhibition of neuronal activity and the gene knockdown experiments. Further optogenetic experiments identified a small number of central neurons pC1[SS2] that induce the tussling specifically. These neurons express doublesex (dsx), a sex-determination factor, and knockdown of dsx strongly suppresses the induction of tussling. In order to further explore the ecological significance of the aggression mode change in group-rearing, a new behavioral experiment was performed to examine the territorial control and the mating competition. And finally, the authors found that differences in the social experience (group vs. solitary rearing) are important in these biologically significant competitions. These results add a new perspective to the study of aggression behavior in Drosophila. Furthermore, this study discusses an interesting general model in which the social experience modified behavioral changes play a role in reproductive success.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A behavioral experiment system that allows stable observation of tussling, which could not be easily analyzed due to its low-frequency, would be very useful. The experimental setup itself is relatively simple, just addition of a female to the platform, so it should be applicable to future research. The finding about the relationship between the social experience and the aggression mode change is quite novel. Although the intensity of aggression changes with the social experience was already reported in several papers (Liu et al., 2011 etc), the fact that the behavioral mode itself changes significantly has rarely been addressed, and is extremely interesting. The identification of sensory and central neurons required for the tussling makes appropriate use of the genetic tools and the results are clear. A major strength of this study in the neurobiology is the finding that another group of neurons (Or47b-expressing olfactory neurons and pC1[SS2] neurons), distinct from the group of neurons previously thought to be involved in low-intensity aggression (i.e. lunging), function in the tussling behavior. Furthermore, the results showing that the regulation of aggression by pC1[SS2] neurons is based the function of the dsx gene will bring a new perspective to the field. Further investigation of the detailed circuit analysis is expected to elucidate the neural substrate of the conflicting between the two aggression modes. The experimental systems examining the territory control and the reproductive competition in Fig. 6 are novel and have advantages in exploring their biological significance. It is important to note that, in addition to showing the effects of age and social experience on territorial and mating behaviors, the authors suggested that an altered fighting strategy has effects with respect to these behaviors.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>New experimental paradigm in Fig. 6 is quite useful, but as the authors mentioned, still the future investigations are needed to reveal a direct relationship between aggression strategies and reproductive success.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104212.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Can</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Southeast University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nanjing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Mingze</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Southeast University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nanjing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Nanjing Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nanjing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>Xiaoxiao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Southeast University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nanjing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Qionglin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Southeast University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nanjing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Yufeng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Southeast University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nanjing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This work addresses an important question in the field of Drosophila aggression and mating.

The duration of each lunge was measured by analyzing the videos frame by frame—from the frame before the initiation of the lunge to the frame after its completion—resulting in an average span of 3–5 frames. Given a frame rate of 30 fps, this corresponds to approximately 0.1–0.17 seconds. We acknowledge that there are certain limitations for manually quantifying the two types of aggressive behaviors, which has now been stated in the newly added “Limitations of the Study” section in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Gao et al. investigated the change of aggression strategies by the social experience and its biological significance by using Drosophila.

Moreover, results of behavioral assays led authors to suggest that increased tussling among socially experienced males may increase mating success. They also concluded that tussling is controlled by a class of olfactory sensory neurons and sexually dimorphic central neurons that are distinct from pathways known to control lunges, a common male-type attack behavior.</p><p>A major strength of this work is that it is the first attempt to characterize behavioral function and neural circuit associated with Drosophila tussling. Many animal species use both low-intensity and high-intensity tactics to resolve conflicts. High-intensity tactics are mostly reserved for escalated fights, which are relatively rare. Because of this, tussling in the flies, like high-intensity fights in other animal species, have not been systematically investigated. Previous studies on fly aggressive behavior have often used socially isolated, relatively young flies within a short observation duration. Their discovery that (1) older (14-days old) flies tend to tussle more often than younger (2 to 7-days-old) flies, (2) group-reared flies tend to tussle more often than socially isolated flies, and (3) flies tend to tussle at later stage (mostly ~15 minutes after the onset of fighting), are the result of their creativity to look outside of conventional experimental settings. These new findings are key for quantitatively characterizing this interesting yet under-studied behavior.</p><p>Newly presented data have made several conclusions convincing. Detailed descriptions of methods to quantify behaviors help understand the basis of their claims by improving transparency. However, I remain concerned about authors' persistent attempt to link the high intensity aggression to reproductive success. The authors' effort to &quot;tone down&quot; the link between the two phenomena remains insufficient. There are purely correlational. I reiterate this issue because the overall value of the manuscript would not change with or without this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for acknowledging the novelty and significance of the study. Regarding the relationship you mentioned between high-intensity aggression and reproductive success, we further toned down the statement between them throughout the manuscript in the revised manuscript. We also modified the title to “Social Experience Shapes Fighting Strategies in Drosophila”. In addition, we now added a ‘Limitations of the Study’ section to clearly state the correlation between tussling and reproductive success.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>If possible, mention the EM-connectome data showing the minimal interneuronal path from Or47b ORNs to pC1SS2 neurons (even if derived from the female connectome), which can strengthen the model of parallel sensory-central pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. According to data from the EM connectome, connecting Or47b ORNs to pC1d neurons requires at least two intermediate neurons. An example minimal pathway is: ORN_VA1v (L) → AL-AST1 (L) → PLP245 (L) → pC1d (R). We have added this point in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I'm not convinced that labeling lunges as &quot;gentle&quot; combat behavior works, either in the abstract or elsewhere.

It is possible that the labeling intensity in postsynaptic cells increases from the change in expression levels of the Or47b gene due to GH. However, there is no difference in the expression level of the Or47b gene labeled by GFP between SH and GH. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the expression of the Or47b gene is increased by rearing conditions.</p><p>The original paper on trans-TANGO (Talay et al., 2017) does not discuss the usage-dependency. A review of trans-synaptic labeling techniques (Ni, Front Neural Circuits. 2021) discusses that the increase in trans-TANGO signaling with aging may be related to synaptic strength, but there is no experimental evidence for this. In my opinion, the results in Figure 3-figure supplement 2 only weakly suggest that the increase in trans-TANGO signaling may be explained by an increase in synaptic strength due to group rearing.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment regarding the interpretation of the trans-Tango signal. Indeed, the original trans-Tango study (Talay et al., 2017) does not claim that the method is usage-dependent. The observed increase in trans-Tango labeling with age, as reported in their supplemental figures, may reflect accumulation over time, potentially influenced by synaptic maturation or increased component expression. To avoid overstating our results, we have revised the relevant statement in the manuscript to remove the term &quot;usage-dependent&quot; and now describe the change in trans-Tango signal more cautiously.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Below are the cases where their professed attempts to &quot;tone down the statement&quot; appear ignored:</p><p>Lines 27-29:</p><p>&quot;Our findings... suggest how social experience shapes fighting strategies to optimize reproductive success&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now revised the manuscript to “Our findings… suggest that social experience may shape fighting strategies to optimize reproductive success.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 85-86:</p><p>&quot;... discover that this infrequent yet intense form of combat is... crucial for territory dominance and mating competition&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now revised the manuscript to “…discover that this infrequent yet intense form of combat is enhanced by social enrichment, while the low-intensity lunging is suppressed by social enrichment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 335-339:</p><p>&quot;Here, we found that...

In addition to the lines listed above, we carefully checked all statements regarding the correlation between fighting strategies and reproductive success throughout the full text.

Even if the socially isolated males do not engage in tussling, it is not a leap to assume that a different fighting tactic of socially experienced males can give them an advantage in defending a territory. To me, this is a sufficient ethological link with the observed behavioral change.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this insightful comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The following are relatively minor, although important, concerns.</p><p>I beg to differ over the authors' definition of &quot;tussling&quot;. Supplemental movies S1 and S2 appear to include &quot;tussling&quot; bouts in which 2 flies lunging at each other in rapid succession, and supplemental movie S3 appears to include bouts of &quot;holding&quot;, in which one fly holds the opponent's wings and shakes vigorously. These cases suggest that the definition of &quot;tussling&quot; as opposed to &quot;lunging&quot; has a subjective element. However, I would not delve on this matter further because it is impossible to be completely objective over behavioral classification, even by using a computational method. An important point is that the definition is applied consistently within the publication. I have no reason to doubt that this was not the case.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. Since the analysis of tussling behavior was conducted manually, it is challenging to achieve complete objectivity. However, we made every effort to apply consistent criteria throughout the analysis. We have added a “Limitations of the Study” section in the revised manuscript to clearly state this caveat. We appreciate your understanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors now state that &quot;all tester flies were loaded by cold anesthesia&quot; (lines 432-433). I would like to draw attention to the well-known fact that anesthesia, whether by ice or by CO2, are long known to affect fly's subsequent behaviors (for aggression, see Trannoy S. et al., Learn. Mem. 2015. 22: 64-68). It will be prudent to acknowledge the possibility that this handling method could have contributed to unusually high levels of spontaneous tussling, which has not been reported elsewhere before.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. The increased tussling behavior observed in our study is unlikely due to cold anesthesia, as noted by Trannoy S. et al. (2015), cold anesthesia profoundly reduces locomotion and general aggressiveness in flies. We acknowledge that the use of cold anesthesia in behavioral experiments may have potential effects on aggression. To minimize this influence, we allowed the flies to recover and adapt for at least 30 minutes before behavioral recording. Moreover, both control and experimental groups were treated in exactly the same manner to ensure consistency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is intriguing that pC1SS2 neurons are dsx+ but fru-. Authors convincingly demonstrated that these neurons are clearly distinct from the P1a neurons, a well-characterized hub for male social behaviors. It is possible that pC1SS2 neurons overlap with previously characterized dsx+ neurons that are important for male aggressions (measured by lunges), such as in Koganezawa et al., Curr. Biol. 2016 and Chiu et al., Cell 2020, a point authors could have explicitly raised.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We have added this point into the Discussion section of the revised manuscript, as follows: “That tussling-promoting… aggression (Koganezawa et al., 2016). Moreover, the anatomical features of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons are highly similar to the male-specific aggression-promoting (MAP) neurons identified by another previous study (Chiu et al., 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I acknowledge the authors' courage to initiate an investigation to a less characterized, high intensity fighting behavior. Tussling requires the simultaneous engagement of two flies. Even if there are confusion over the distinction between lunges and tussling, authors' conclusion that socially experienced flies and socially isolated flies employ distinct fighting strategy is convincing. The concern I raised above is about the interpretation of the data, not about the quality of data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your constructive comments to make this manuscript better.</p></body></sub-article></article>
