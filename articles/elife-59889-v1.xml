order structures is essential for chromosome segregation, the repair of DNA-damage, and the regulation of gene expression. Using Micro-C XL to detect chromosomal interactions, we observed the pervasive presence of cohesin-dependent loops with defined positions throughout the genome of budding yeast, as seen in mammalian cells. In early S phase, cohesin stably binds to cohesin associated regions (CARs) genome-wide. Subsequently, positioned loops accumulate with CARs at the bases of the loops. Cohesin regulators Wpl1 and Pds5 alter the levels and distribution of cohesin at CARs, changing the pattern of positioned loops. From these observations, we propose that cohesin with loop extrusion activity is stopped by preexisting CAR-bound cohesins, generating positioned loops. The patterns of loops observed in a population of wild-type and mutant cells can be explained by this mechanism, coupled with a heterogeneous residency of cohesin at CARs in individual cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Chromatin loops</kwd><kwd>cohesin</kwd><kwd>Wpl1</kwd><kwd>Pds5</kwd><kwd>Micro-C</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35 GM-118189-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koshland</surname><given-names>Douglas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-resolution mapping of cohesin-dependent chromatin loops in the genome of budding yeast reveals evolutionarily conserved features for loop formation and cohesin residency as a determinant of loop positioning.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The genome is organized into three-dimensional structures that are essential for the correct segregation of chromosomes, the efficient repair of DNA damage, and the regulation of gene transcription. The initial existence of higher order chromosome structures was discovered in the early 1900s by the dramatic cytological appearance of pairs of condensed sister chromatids in mitosis. Moreover, electron microscopy studies showed that mitotic and meiotic chromatin is organized in loops with a protein scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gall and Callan, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marsden and Laemmli, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Paulson and Laemmli, 1977</xref>).</p><p>A high-resolution view of chromosome folding became possible with the development of new methods based on chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dekker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denker and de Laat, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kempfer and Pombo, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>). Essentially, 3Cs methods stabilize the interactions between different regions of the chromatin that are in close spatial proximity, detect these interactions, and visualize them on a contact map. These methods showed in mammalian cells the existence of chromatin loops at specific loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Palstra et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tolhuis et al., 2002</xref>). Later papers revealed defined loops at defined positions genome-wide that persisted from interphase to the onset of preprophase but not later in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, 3Cs methods showed that mammalian chromosomes are organized into self-associating domains, which contain sequences that are more likely to interact with each other than with the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nora et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>). The existence of these loops has inspired several outstanding questions, including what are the molecular mechanisms that drive the formation of loops, their genome distribution, their frequency in a population of cells, and their biological function(s).</p><p>A major advance came with the discovery that loops formation depended upon the evolutionarily conserved SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gassler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schwarzer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>). SMC complexes can tether together two regions of DNA, either within a single DNA molecule or between DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hassler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Onn et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, they can translocate along DNA to extrude DNA loops (loop extrusion) in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ganji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Loop formation by one SMC complex, called cohesin, has been extensively studied in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hadjur et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Parelho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wendt et al., 2008</xref>). The CTCF DNA-binding factor defines the position of most of the cohesin-dependent loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Handoko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Splinter et al., 2006</xref>). In fact, cohesin-dependent loops occur preferentially between the two CTCF-binding sites that are in a convergent orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Wit et al., 2015</xref>). Cohesin-dependent loops occurred between more distal CTCF-binding sites when the cohesin regulator WAPL was depleted, showing that WAPL restricts loop size. WAPL dissociates cohesin from chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haarhuis et al., 2017</xref>), and by preventing WAPL binding to cohesin, CTCF is thought to stabilize cohesin and prevent loop disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2020</xref>). The formation of specific loops by cohesin, CTCF, and WAPL has been proposed to contribute to the regulation of gene expression by facilitating the interactions of enhancers with distal promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schoenfelder and Fraser, 2019</xref>).</p><p>However, five observations paint a more complicated picture of the regulation and function of cohesin-dependent looping. First, robust loops still form when the orientation preference of CTCF sites was eliminated through depletion of a cohesin regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>). Clearly, CTCF orientation is not the only determinant of loop position in mammals. Indeed, looping is observed in organisms that do not have the CTCF factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Heger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rowley et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the fundamental mechanism(s) of positioning loops in most organisms including mammals remains to be determined. Second, a cohesin auxiliary factor, PDS5, facilitates WAPL's ability to remove cohesin from chromosomes, yet the impact of WAPL and PDS5 on looping appear to be different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>). This observation suggests that cohesin regulators control looping by additional yet to be discovered mechanisms. Third, the current understanding of cohesin, CTCF, WAPL, and PDS5 does not fully explain why the intensity of each loop can vary dramatically in a cell population, and how the loop pattern changes upon the inactivation of cohesin regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haarhuis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>). Fourth, while there are studies that analyzed cohesin residency and the turnover on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fudenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wutz et al., 2020</xref>), it is still unclear how they exactly contribute to loop formation. Fifth, the postulated function of looping in gene expression does not explain why most regions of the mammalian genome have cohesin-dependent loops, yet the proper expression of most genes is cohesin/CTCF independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schwarzer et al., 2017</xref>). These observations show that key aspects of the molecular mechanisms and the biological functions of looping remain to be elucidated.</p><p>A deep understanding of complex cellular processes often resulted from their study in diverse organisms. Indeed loop formation in yeast was analyzed with a high-throughput 3C-method called Hi-C. Interestingly, a seminal study showed that cohesin mediates a change in chromosomal interactions during mitosis that, through polymer simulations, is compatible with the presence of chromatin loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>). Another study showed that loop size was restricted by Wpl1p (yeast ortholog of WAPL) as observed in mammalian cells, and by Pds5 (yeast ortholog of PDS5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dauban et al., 2020</xref>). However, the signal for loops with a defined position appeared sporadically in the genome and was poorly defined when compared to mammalian interphase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dauban et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Paldi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>). The weak signal for positioned loops in yeast might have been a reflection of a biological difference between yeast and mammalian cells, hinted by the absence of a CTCF protein in yeast, or methodological limitations of these studies. A recent study revealed a robust signal for cohesin-dependent positioned loops during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schalbetter et al., 2019</xref>), revealing that yeast has indeed the capability to efficiently form positioned loops.</p><p>We reasoned that the formation of positioned loops in yeast could be cell cycle-regulated. Moreover, given the small size of the yeast genome relative to mammals, positioned loops in yeast could be smaller and their detection might require a high-resolution methodology. Micro-C and its evolution Micro-C XL can detect chromatin interactions from the scale of nucleosomes to the whole genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hsieh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hsieh et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, this method successfully detected positioned loops in quiescent cells and in S phase of mitotically dividing yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ohno et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Swygert et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we use Micro-C XL on synchronized populations of yeast cells to improve the detection of chromatin loops and observe a robust signal for positioned loops genome-wide. The analysis of this loop signal led us to a model that explains the genomic distribution and frequency of loops and their relationship to cohesin binding to DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Micro-C XL reveals prevalent chromatin loops with a defined position in mitotic chromosomes</title><p>To maximize the detection of loops, we arrested cells in mitosis, using the inhibitor of microtubule polymerization nocodazole (Nz), where chromosomes are highly structured and analyzed them by high-resolution Micro-C XL analysis with improved short-range interactions detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hsieh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hsieh et al., 2016</xref>). In brief, we treated cells with crosslinkers to preserve existing contacts between nucleosomes and then digested the crosslinked chromatin into mono-nucleosomes using the micrococcal nuclease (MNase). The free nucleosomal DNA ends were labeled, ligated, isolated, and subjected to paired-end sequencing. The paired reads from the chimeric sequences gave the coordinates of nucleosomes that were contacting in vivo. We plotted these coordinates producing a contact map of all the interacting nucleosomes in a cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), generating a matrix of ~66,000 × 66,000 nucleosomes/pixels for the yeast genome.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Micro-C XL reveals positioned loops in mitotic chromosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Micro-C XL maps chromatin conformation by detecting nucleosomes that interact in vivo.

First, local interactions between neighboring nucleosomes are likely, giving rise to a robust signal along the diagonal on the contact map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, unstructured). Second, in a chromatin domain, nucleosomes within the domain will interact with each other more frequently than ones in the neighboring domains, giving rise to a square signal on the contact map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, interaction domain). Third, a positioned loop is made when the same pair of distal regions (5’ and 3’ loop anchors) are bridged together with enough frequency in a cell population. The interacting nucleosomes from the loop anchors will generate an off-diagonal spot/focal interaction on the contact map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, loop). The positioned loop size is equal to the length of DNA between the loop anchors and is equal to the distance of the spot from the diagonal. Loops that are randomly located in the genome of a cell population are not immediately visualized in the contact map. Previous papers have inferred the presence, size, and genome distribution of randomly located loops through polymer modeling and simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Micro-C XL analysis of mitotically arrested cells revealed many off-diagonal spots on the contact map, indicative of the presence of positioned loops. These positioned loops became easily visible when zooming-in on smaller regions of the chromosome with increasing resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, top row). The pervasive presence of positioned loops shown on chromosome 7 was observed in the entire genome. These positioned loops were less frequent and less defined in contact maps using datasets from previously published Hi-C maps of mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, bottom rows; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and Micro-C XL analysis of asynchronous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The improved detection of positioned loops in Micro-C XL was likely due to its superior resolution in the range from 100 bp to 30 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), as shown in the genome-wide analysis of interaction decaying rate. We used two different loop-calling programs, HiCCUPS and Chromosight, to identify the location of positioned loops genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Durand et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Matthey-Doret et al., 2020</xref>). Both identified 10–20 times more positioned loops in Micro-C XL than Hi-C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The total number of 3’ and 5’ loop anchors for positioned loops was also 10 times greater in Micro-C XL than Hi-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We piled-up the signal from the contact map of a 5 kb region with each positioned loop spot at its center. We compared the center (positioned loop signal) versus the four edges (background) as a ratio and detected a ~4 fold increase in Micro-C XL (4 vs 1), but only a minor increase in Hi-C (1.2 vs 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This strong signal for positioned loops allowed us to locate precisely the chromosomal position of their loop anchors genome-wide. Thus, Micro-C XL is a robust assay to detect chromosome loops, suggesting that positioned loops are a ubiquitous folding feature of yeast mitotic chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cohesin complex mediates loop formation</title><p>We proceeded to identify the protein/s that are responsible to form the positioned loops in yeast mitotic chromosomes.

To assess if cohesin was also needed for the formation of positioned loops in budding yeast, we first identified the genomic positions of cohesin binding by ChIP-seq of the Mcd1p cohesin subunit (also known as Scc1p/Rad21p) in mitotically arrested cells. Cohesin binds to discrete chromosomal loci termed cohesin associated regions (CARs), which are distributed along chromosomal arms preferentially between terminators of two convergently transcribed genes, and at centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blat and Kleckner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glynn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Laloraya et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Megee and Koshland, 1999</xref>). By aligning the Mcd1p ChIP-seq signal with the Micro-C XL contact map, we observed that the position of every positioned loop anchor overlapped with the position of a CAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To evaluate the robustness of this correlation genome-wide, we plotted the Mcd1p ChIP-seq signal of every sequence involved in a positioned loop (the 5’ and 3’ anchors, and the region in between), by aligning their 5’ and 3’ anchors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We observed an enrichment of Mcd1p over &gt;98% of positioned loop anchors. Therefore, cohesin associated regions and the anchors for positioned loops are highly correlated in mitotic chromosomes of budding yeast, suggesting that CARs help define the position of loops.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mitotic positioned loops are cohesin-dependent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cohesin peaks colocalize with the loop anchors of positioned loops.

For this analysis, we piled-up the contact map signal of the five kilobases regions centered at the intersection of the coordinates of each pair of Mcd1p ChIP-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The portion of the contact map with a contact probability greater than 90%, corresponded to a 1 kilobase region that was centered at the summit of the Mcd1p ChIP-seq peak. Coincidentally, the average width of Mcd1p ChIP-seq peaks is also ~1 kilobase. Thus, anchors for positioned loops in budding yeast are centered at the peak of cohesin binding at CARs and both are confined within 1 kilobase region. These results further correlate anchors for positioned loops with cohesin associated regions on mitotic chromosomes.</p><p>This correlation prompted us to examine the causal role of cohesin in positioned loop formation. To test this possibility, we depleted the cohesin subunit Mcd1p using an auxin-induced degron system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eng et al., 2014</xref>) and analyzed loop formation by Micro-C XL. Without cohesin, we detected no distinguishable positioned loops by visual inspection of the contact map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The positioned loops were also gone genome-wide using the loop calling program, dropping from 732 in wild-type cells to just five when cohesin was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Finally, we analyzed the genome-wide average signal coming from the piled-up of 5 kilobases regions centered on each positioned loop spot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The signal for the positioned loop spots was reduced to background upon Mcd1p depletion. We conclude that cohesin is required for positioned loop formation genome-wide.</p><p>Condensin, another member of the SMC family, was known to promote mitotic chromosome structure by condensing chromosomes in vertebrate and yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hirano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hirano and Mitchison, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kimura and Hirano, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Saitoh et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Strunnikov et al., 1995</xref>).

We tested whether the newly detected mitotic positioned loops in our study were also condensin-independent, by depleting Brn1p, a subunit of condensin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The positioned loop signal was largely unaffected on the contact map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), as the number of detected positioned loops modestly decreased from 732 in wild-type to 585 when condensin was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Accordingly, the signal from the averaging analysis of the positioned loop regions was only slightly reduced when condensin was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In conclusion, cohesin is responsible for the formation of the vast majority of positioned loops in budding yeast mitotic chromosomes.</p><p>Contact density decay analysis showed a drop in contacts starting around the 10 kilobases region when cohesin was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This drop was absent when condensin was depleted, corroborating that cohesin, but not condensin was the major driver of loop formation. Furthermore, the number of the inter-chromosomal interactions was similar between wild-type and condensin-depleted cells, unlike cohesin depletion where these interactions doubled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Therefore, cohesin is also responsible for chromosome individualization and decreased inter-chromosome contacts in mitosis, as previously shown by Hi-C studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the effect of cohesin depletion on chromatin loops, we compared the changes in contact probability in Micro-C XL and previous Hi-C datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dauban et al., 2020</xref>).

Previous studies have characterized that the contact enrichment at ~10–20 kb appears to be cohesin dependent. In addition to those contacts, the higher resolution Micro-C XL data revealed a finer and more pronounced separation between the curves of wild-type and cohesin depletion, showing that the cohesin-dependent structures overrepresent at the length of ~3–15 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Our dataset presented a more pronounced decay in contact density upon cohesin inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>), suggesting that, in addition to the technical improvement on chromatin mapping, our degron-allele of Mcd1p might result in a better cohesin inactivation than the temperature-sensitive allele used in the other studies. In conclusion, the comparative analysis between Micro-C XL and Hi-C data highlights finer cohesin-dependent structures that were omitted in the previous studies, whose size-range is compatible with the range of positioned loops.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cohesin and condensin shape the rDNA locus in mitosis</title><p>The ribosomal DNA locus (RDN) has 75 to 100 tandem repeats of the 9.1 kilobases rDNA unit, with two transcribed loci (RDN37 and RDN5) spaced by two non-transcribed regions (NTS1 and NTS2).

In interphase where the RDN is a decondensed puff, we detected widespread contacts all over the RDN that were caused by interactions within a repeat and/or between different repeats (intra- or inter-repeats are indistinguishable in sequencing data). While in mitosis where the RDN is a condensed line, the widespread off-diagonal signal was lost.

These contacts increased when cohesin and/or condensin were depleted from mitotically arrested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Furthermore, both cohesin and condensin depletion similarly changed the contact decay pattern of the RDN from the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

The ability of condensin and cohesin to restrict local contacts has not been reported previously. The restriction of local interactions could alter the accessibility of gene regulatory regions.

This analysis revealed three features of CARs in positioned loop organizations that were present throughout the yeast genome. First, each CAR formed at least two positioned loops, one by pairing with the CAR that precedes it on the chromosome, and one by pairing with the CAR that follows it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, Positioned loops from adjacent CARs). Thus, each CAR always exhibited bidirectional looping with the two adjacent CARs.

We defined the positioned loops between distal CARs as loops expansion.

Eighty-one percent of CARs form loops only with the adjacent CARs, while 19% formed positioned loops with CARs further down the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This analysis underestimated the number of CARs involved in loop expansion since the loop calling program performed poorly in detecting the spots that were far away from the diagonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To better estimate the extent of loop expansion and avoid loop calling bias, we piled-up the contact map for regions ranging from +1 to +10 CARs interval from each loop anchor in the genome. We detected a slow decrease in the loop signal as a function of the distance until the +5 CAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This data showed that the biggest positioned loops reached sizes of tens of kilobases. We conclude that loop expansion is a common feature of mitotic chromosomes and can occur over large distances.</p><p>We noted that the cohesin-rich regions in ChIP-seq presented a wide-range of peak heights. We ordered CARs based on the height of their peaks of cohesin binding from lower to higher, and we defined the top 10% as high-residency CARs. We also noted that the dots on the contact map presented different levels of intensity. We correlated the intensity of the dots/positioned loop in the contact map with the ChIP-seq peak height of the corresponding CAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). We found that the intensity of the dots correlated with the intensity of the Mcd1p ChIP-seq signal on the corresponding CARs. We confirmed this correlation by comparing the genome-wide averaging signal from loops created by high- and low-intensity CARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, first versus second panel). Moreover, we performed genome-wide averaging of the signal coming from the pairing of two CARs spaced by a high-residency CAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, third panel). The signal detected was much weaker when compared to the signal between CARs that did not cross a high-residency CAR, suggesting that high-residency CARs block loop expansion. In conclusion, we described the key features of how cohesins organize the mitotic chromosomes into positioned loops: (1) each CAR always forms two positioned loops with its neighboring CARs in both directions; (2) looping can expand to distal CARs, up to ~5 CARs away in wild-type; (3) CARs with high-residency Mcd1p ChIP-seq signal function as a strong barrier to loop expansion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Chromosome loops form during S-phase</title><p>We showed that chromosomes from mitotically arrested cells were organized into positioned loops, but when these positioned loops formed during the cell cycle and how long they persist remained unanswered. To address these questions, we arrested cells in G1 with alpha-factor. We then released cells from the arrest and monitored loop formation and cohesin binding to chromosomes every 15 min for one entire cell cycle at two different temperatures 23°C and 30°C. We used two different temperatures to assess whether loop formation was affected by the rate of progression through the cell cycle. In budding yeast, the Mcd1p subunit of cohesin is synthesized at the beginning of S phase, allowing the assembly of a functional cohesin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>). We detected the emergence of loop signal during DNA replication, concomitant with the synthesis and deposition of cohesin on chromosomes and its accumulation at CARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ohno et al., 2019</xref>).

The timing of the disappearance of loops corresponded with the degradation of Mcd1p and inactivation of cohesin that normally occurs at the onset of anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>).

These results suggest that the cell cycle control of chromatin loops is achieved by the regulation of a functional cohesin complex and its deposition on chromosomes.

The 75 min sample had the most positioned loops but contained only 50% of the positioned loops observed in mitotically arrested cells. Also, in the 75 min sample, most of the spots were close to the diagonal as a result of the pairing of adjacent CARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). This inability to detect loop expansion (+2, +3, etc.) was also evident for the other time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Pile-up analysis further confirmed the lack of loop expansion during the cell cycle. Only the +1 CAR interval showed substantial enrichment in the contact signal, while the enrichments are diminished in the distal CAR intervals. The contact decay analysis for cells ~60 to 75 min released from G1 had an enrichment in a similar range to the cohesin-dependent structures (or positioned loops) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Interestingly, the contact enrichment in the cycling cells appeared to be slightly shorter than in the mitotically arrested wild-type cells, with the maximal signal peaking at ~8 kb. This decreased detection of positioned loops in the time course might reflect increased noise due to imperfect synchronization, an increase of cohesin binding to chromosome during the mitotic arrest, or the stabilization of loops and loop expansion during the mitotic arrest.</p><p>A key observation from our time course was that most of the cohesin deposition at CARs occurred 15 min before the appearance of the majority of positioned loop signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, compare 45 vs 60 min). A model to explain the uncoupling of loop formation and cohesin binding to CARs is that this initial cohesin is not competent for loop extrusion. Loop extrusion may be mediated by a different pool of cohesin that is activated later in S phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Cohesin regulators affect the size and location of chromosomal loops</title><p>Cohesin has many different activities that are regulated by multiple proteins. Two cohesin regulators, Wpl1p and Pds5p had been previously implicated in regulating chromatin loops in mammals and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dauban et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haarhuis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>).

Counterintuitively, in budding yeast lacking Wpl1p, cohesin binding to CARs is reduced 50%, leading to reduced cohesion and condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guacci and Koshland, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lopez-Serra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>). This paradox can be explained if Wpl1p, by dissociating randomly bound cohesin from chromosomes, allows efficient accumulation of cohesin at CARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloom et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>).

The number of called loops increased from 732 in wild-type to 1588 in cells depleted for Wpl1p, and visual inspection of the contact map showed many more dots linked by distal CARs. Since these positioned loops away from the diagonal were often missed by the loop calling program, the increase in the number of positioned loops was likely higher in Wpl1p-depleted cells.

First, the signal from positioned loops to the close-distanced CARs (+1 and +2) was similar to wild-type, suggesting that Wpl1p-depleted cells retained the same group of positioned loops at these adjacent CARs. Second, Wpl1p-depleted cells presented an increased loop expansion capacity. In fact, while in wild-type cells loops with +5 CARs were weak, in Wpl1p-depleted cells the signal from loop anchors +5 was almost as robust as at +2. Moreover, in wild-type, the signal of loops extended to +5 CARs, while in Wpl1p-depleted cells it extended to +9 CARs.

These regions also exhibited an altered positioned loop distribution. The high-residency CAR at the centromere forms positioned loops with the other CARs along the chromosome, generating a prominent stripe pattern that can extend up to hundreds of kilobase (sometimes across an entire chromosome arm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, second and third panels). Analysis of the contact decay curve showed that Pds5p-depleted cells lose the contact enrichment in the range of cohesin-dependent structures in wild-type, confirming the lack of genome-wide positioned loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Nevertheless, we detected an enrichment of the contacts in a much larger range, ~50–200 kb, and the loops stemming from the centromeres may contribute to the signal. These results suggest that in the absence of Pds5p, yeast cohesin can extrude chromatin from the centromere over long distances, forming loops of comparable size to the loops extruded by mammalian cohesin. Thus, Pds5p by stabilizing cohesin binding to chromosomes, it restricts loop expansion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Chromosome domains in mitosis</title><p>Another structural feature of the contact map was the presence of chromosomal interaction domains. We observed that the high-residency CARs demarcated the chromatin landscape into domains, presumably by blocking loop expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These domains were found all over the chromosomes. Since domain calling is an empirical process in the contact map analysis, we extensively tested multiple methods to identify domains and found that the results from ‘hicexplorer’ match our visual inspection more consistently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wolff et al., 2018</xref>). We applied this domain-calling algorithm at two kilobase resolution to the contact map of wild-type, Mcd1p-depleted, Brn1p-depleted cells arrested in mitosis, and published Micro-C XL on asynchronous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hsieh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hsieh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and domain strength score is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>).

To corroborate that the formation of these domains was dependent upon cohesin, we averaged the signal for each strain on the rescaled wild-type domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We confirmed that the strength of the wild-type domains was dependent on the presence of cohesin, but not condensin. Thus cohesin promotes domain formation as well as loops in budding yeast. To confirm that CARs were at the boundaries of the wild-type domains genome-wide, we plotted the cumulative Mcd1p ChIP-seq signal from wild-type cells at domains boundaries in wild-type, cohesin-depleted, and asynchronous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> top). A marked enrichment of cohesin was present only at the wild-type domain boundaries confirming these domains are defined by CARs. Furthermore, cumulative curves for Mcd1p ChIP-seq signal showed that cohesin was enriched at wild-type domain boundaries when compared to cohesin-depleted, and asynchronous domain boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> bottom). We also observed a relocation of the domain boundaries from promoters (cohesin-depleted and asynchronous domains boundaries) to terminators (wild-type domains boundaries) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>), as expected since the vast majority of CARs are located between the terminators of convergently transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glynn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lengronne et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, the CAR domain boundaries presented a stronger Mcd1p ChIP-seq signal when compared to the other CARs genome-wide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), consistent with our finding that high-residency CARs had the capacity to insulate loop expansion to define domains. Our results suggest that chromosomes are organized into cohesin-dependent and cohesin-independent domains. The boundaries of the cohesin-dependent domains in wild-type mitotic cells are determined by CARs with strong cohesin binding, and we termed these new structures ‘CAR domains’. These results are consistent with data from mammalian cells that show the presence of cohesin-dependent and cohesin-independent domains (referred to as compartmental domains). The compartmental domains are thought to be dependent on histones modifications and become more evident upon cohesin depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gassler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schwarzer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>). All together data suggest that cohesin-independent yeast CID are comparable to mammalian compartmental domains, while cohesin-dependent CAR domains in yeast are equivalent to the mammalian topologically associating domain (TAD).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we use Micro-C XL, a version of chromosome conformation capture with high-resolution to study chromosome architecture in mitotic yeast cells. This approach corroborated several findings from previous Hi-C studies including the presence of cohesin-dependent chromatin loops and the regulation of their size by cohesin regulators Wpl1p and Pds5p. However, our approach generated a robust signal for dots on the contact map, where loops with a defined position are distinct and easily detectable. We exploited this improved signal to reveal important new features about positioned loop distribution (size and genomic position) and insights into the molecular determinants of loop formation.</p><p>One feature of our study is the remarkable correlation between the anchors of positioned loops and cohesin associated regions (CARs). First, the genomic position of positioned loop anchors correlates almost perfectly with the position of CARs throughout the genome. The pairing of two anchors in a positioned loop always occurred between a CAR and the adjacent CAR on either side (bidirectional looping), but many CARs could also partner with more distal CARs (loop expansion). On average the portion between the two anchors for a positioned loop (~8 Kb) mirrors the average distance between adjacent CARs. Much larger loops were also observed (20–40 Kb), reflecting the distance between distal CARs. These data suggest that CARs determine the size and position of chromatin loops in mitotic budding yeast. Similarly, CARs have been suggested to determine the size and position of chromatin loops in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schalbetter et al., 2019</xref>). The patterns of positioned loops in mitosis and meiosis are different, likely reflecting differences in the chromosomal structure and function in these two different yeast cell types.</p><p>The pervasive presence of CARs and their respective positioned loops along the chromosomes suggest that almost all, if not all, regions in the yeast genome can form a positioned loop. A similar omnipresence of positioned loops is also observed in yeast meiosis, and in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schalbetter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hsieh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krietenstein et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). This shared global distribution suggests an important evolutionarily conserved function for looping chromatin, distinct from the previously proposed function in controlling the expression of a subset of genes. For example, the tethering of sister chromatids by cohesin is already known to promote DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sjögren and Nasmyth, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ström et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Unal et al., 2004</xref>). Looping by cohesin may contribute to the alignment of homologous repetitive elements between sister chromatids, thereby avoiding unequal sister chromatid exchange. Importantly, budding yeast provides an excellent system to test this and other potentially conserved physiological functions for cohesin-dependent chromatin loops.</p><p>The data from this and other studies in yeast revealed two differences between loop determinants in yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schalbetter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dauban et al., 2020</xref>). First, in mammals, 86% of loop anchors depend on sites with CTCF and cohesin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). In yeast cells loops formation and positioning depend on cohesin only, since yeast lacks CTCF or any known DNA-binding factor that colocalizes with cohesin. Second, in budding yeast, each CAR forms loops with the adjacent CARs on either side (bidirectional), while in mammals loop formation is often directional correlating with the orientation of convergent CTCF sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haarhuis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Wit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>). The CTCF-independent mechanism in yeast may be a model for loop formation in most other eukaryotes that lack CTCF.</p><p>Indeed, from our study of loop anchors, we observed a positive correlation between the level of cohesin binding to a CAR and its probability of acting as a loop anchor in a positioned loop. A key to understanding this correlation comes from two observations. In yeast and mammals, cohesin binding to chromosomes is split between a stably bound pool and a pool that is more dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>). The ChIP-seq peaks at CARs result from stably bound cohesin (half-life &gt;60 min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eng et al., 2014</xref>). The differences in ChIP-seq signal intensity at different CARs likely reflect the fraction of cells in the population with stably bound cohesin at those sites. Second, in our time-course experiment, the ChIP-seq signal from stably bound cohesin precedes the signal from positioned loops by 15 min.</p><p>Using these observations, we postulated a model to explain the correlation of the level of cohesin binding at CARs with the formation of loops and loop barriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In S-phase, a functional cohesin complex is assembled and deposited on chromosomes and a pool of cohesin stably accumulates at CARs. In a cell population, some CARs are occupied by stably bound cohesin more often than others (High-residency CARs). After the binding at CARs, a pool of cohesin will start extruding the DNA forming a chromatin loop until it encounters two CARs that are stably occupied by cohesin. This encounter will stop the loop extrusion activity and the two CARs will be held together at the base of the loop, generating a positioned loop. Cohesin with loops extrusion activity could start looping bidirectionally in between the two occupied CARs, or cohesin from one occupied CAR can extrude DNA unidirectionally till it reaches the next occupied CAR. High-residency CARs are occupied by cohesin more often in a cell population, stopping incoming cohesin with loop extrusion activity efficiently and blocking its progression to CARs further down (barrier for loop spreading). CARs that are occupied less often in a cell population will stop the incoming looping cohesin in the few cells that have that CAR occupied, while the looping will proceed to CARs further down in the cells that have that CAR cohesin-free, resulting in bigger loops and loop spreading. Therefore, the frequency of a loop between any two CARs is determined in part by how often those CARs are occupied by cohesin, by the number of CARs between them, and by the number of incoming cohesin with loop extrusion activity. A similar model has been suggested for yeast meiotic chromosomes through polymer simulation modeling, and for mammalian mitotic chromosomes through an ingenious approach that allows differentiating contacts within and between sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schalbetter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mitter et al., 2020</xref>). A key point will be to measure the percentage of yeast cells in a mitotic population that present a certain CAR occupied, and have the corresponding loop defined.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Cohesin residency model for loop formation.</title><p>Loop-extrusion with a heterogenous cohesin residency gives rise to a heterogeneous pattern of chromatin looping and domains. The intensity of a cohesin ChIP-seq peak reflects the probability of the CAR being occupied by cohesin in a cell population. ChIP-seq peaks with high signals reflect CARs that are occupied with high probability by cohesin in a cell population. Low-signal peaks are CARs that are occupied by cohesin only in a fraction of cells. Cohesin with loop extrusion activity will start looping and stop when encountering two cohesin-bound CARs, creating a positioned loop. Every loop will result in a spot on the contact map from the stable interaction of the two CARs that function as loop anchors. Furthermore, the sequences inside the loop will have more probability of interacting with each other creating a loop domain visualized as a square in the contact map with spots at its vertices. Each spot and square signal from different positioned loops coming from individual cells will pile-up producing the final contact map signal detected by Micro-C XL with CAR domains with two high-intensity CAR as domain barriers and spots inside.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59889-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>This model can also explain the signal of CAR domains and their boundaries. Our model postulates that positioned loops of different sizes being formed between a certain number of CARs. The sequences within each loop are more likely to interact with each other resulting in a ‘loop domain’ square signal on the contact map with the spot signal for the positioned loops at its vertices. The ‘loop domains’ square signal of different sizes coming from individual cells will be piled-up in the contact map, resulting in the observed CAR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, right side). The high-residency CARs will block the loop extrusion activity functioning as a barrier, resulting in a boundary for the CAR domain. A similar model for loop extrusion and formation of domains was also postulated for mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fudenberg et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>This model can also explain the pattern of positioned loops in Wpl1p- and Pds5p-depleted cells. Pds5p helps cohesin to establish cohesion but also forms a complex with Wpl1p to remove cohesin from chromosomes. It has been proposed that depletion of Wpl1p or Pds5p stabilizes the binding of dynamic cohesin, increasing the processivity of its looping activity and loop size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>). However, this hypothesis alone could not explain additional differences between loop expansion and location in Wpl1p- and Pds5p-depletion revealed in this study.</p><p>In cells depleted for Wpl1p, the number of loops and loop expansion increased genome-wide compared to wild type. We can explain these changes in looping through our cohesin occupancy model and the fact that in budding yeast Wpl1p depletion reduced cohesin binding at CARs about 50% genome-wide (this study, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guacci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rowland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sutani et al., 2009</xref>]) This reduced binding of cohesin is not well understood but might reflect a role for Wpl1p in removing the non-specific binding of cohesin genome-wide to allow its accumulation at CARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloom et al., 2018</xref>). We suggest that the defect in cohesin accumulation at CARs will result in a decrease in the number of CARs that are occupied by cohesin in the cell population, and will provide more dynamic cohesin with loop extrusion activity. As a result, in these cells increased amount of cohesin with loop extrusion activity can pair with occupied CARs that are more distant, allowing the formation of more loops and the expansion of loops size.</p><p>In Pds5-depleted cells, the number of loops decreased and more pronounced loop expansion (100's of kilobases) occurred only from the centromere compared to wild-type or Wpl1p-depleted cells. These differences can also be explained by our occupancy model and the dramatic differences in cohesin binding to different CARs in Pds5p-depleted cells. In ChIP-seq, we observed a prominent cohesin binding at the centromeres, greatly reduced binding in the centromere-proximal regions, and almost no binding at centromere-distal regions. We suggest that the high occupancy of cohesin at the centromere will always stop the looping of the dynamic cohesin. On the other side, the looping will proceed down the arm for long distances before being stopped by the occasional CAR site occupied by stably bound cohesin. This process will result in a series of loops emanating from the centromeres to the arms in a cross pattern, as observed in our contact map. The low occupancy of the other CARs with stable cohesin is so low that dynamic cohesin is stopped rarely between these CARs, and therefore rarely generates loops on chromosome arms. Thus, the two very different looping patterns of Wpl1p- and Pds5p-depletion can be explained by our occupancy model. In summary, the patterns of cohesin binding to chromosomes and position of loops in wild-type and mutants suggest that loop expansion is restrained not only by decreasing the level of dynamic cohesin with looping activity but also by increasing the level of stably bound cohesin to CARs. In mammalian cells looping by dynamic cohesin may also be blocked by cohesin that is stably bound to chromosomes because of Sororin or CTCF.</p><p>The analysis of our results presents a novel interpretation of how yeast cells organize their genomes into loops. A previous study analyzed the chromosome contacts density produced with Hi-C using in silico modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>). They predicted the presence of loops with an average size of 35 kb, randomly occurring on chromosomes, and covering around 35% of the mitotic yeast genome per cell. In contrast, our dataset detected chromosome contacts that start occurring at a size-range of 3–5 kb and peaks at 10–15 kb. Furthermore, we provided evidence that loops in yeast accumulate at defined positions throughout the genome, with a size range that is consistent with the aforementioned contact enrichment. We suggest that loops are much smaller than previously predicted, and they tend to accumulate at precise locations. The organization of the yeast genome into recurrent defined structures could potentially impact chromosome functions, much like the mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and culture conditions</title><p>All strains used in this study are derived from the A364A background and their genotypes are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

Crosslinking reaction was quenched with 400 mM glycine at room temperature for 5 min. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min and washed once with ice-cold PBS. Crosslinked cells can be stored at −80°C for few months or proceed to chromatin fragmentation immediately. We note that using freshly made formaldehyde and DSG solution is critical to generate high-quality Micro-C data.</p><p>Crosslinked cells were permeabilized with MB1 (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 1.43 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% NP-40) on ice for 5 min. Chromatin was fragmented into ~90% mononucleosome and ~10% dinucleosome with Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) (Worthington Biochem #LS004798). We recommend titrating the MNase digesting condition for each sample. Typically, we treat cells with various pre-titrated MNase concentrations and then incubate them at 37°C for 10 min with vigorously mixing. MNase reaction was inactivated by adding 2.5 mM EGTA and incubated at 65°C for 10 min. Chromatin was pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 g at 4°C for 5 min and washed twice with ice-cold MB2 (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2). We note that MNase titration to yield 90% monomer/10% dimers reduces un-digested (un-ligated) dimers contamination in Micro-C data.</p><p>MNase-digested fragments were then subject to the customized three-step end-repair protocol. First, chromatin was resuspended in the end-repair buffer (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 µg/mL BSA, 2 mM ATP, 5 mM DTT) and phosphorylated the 5’-ends with 25 units of T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (NEB #M0201) at 37°C for 15 min. Second, treating chromatin with 25 units of DNA Polymerase I, Large (Klenow) Fragment (NEB #M0210) in the absence of dNTPs at 37°C for 15 min allows the Klenow enzyme using its 3’-to-5’ exonuclease activity to convert the mixed types of nucleosomal ends to the cohesive ends. Tight binding and chemical crosslinking between DNA and nucleosome are supposed to prevent the Klenow enzyme’s 3’-to-5’ exonuclease activity from chewing nucleosomal DNA all the way through. Third, Klenow enzyme’s polymerase activity repairs the nucleosomal DNA ends to the blunt and ligatible ends upon the supplement of dNTPs including 66 µM dTTP, dGTP (NEB #N0446), biotin-dATP (Jena Bioscience #NU-835-BIO14), and biotin-dCTP (Jena Bioscience #NU-809-BIOX) in 1X T4 DNA ligase reaction buffer (NEB #B0202). The reaction was incubated at 25°C for 45 min with interval mixing and then inactivated with 30 mM EDTA at 65°C for 20 min. Chromatin was pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 g at 4°C for 5 min and washed once with ice-cold MB3 (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2).</p><p>Biotinylated-nucleosomes were then subjected to the proximity ligation reaction with 5000 cohesive end units (CEU) of T4 DNA ligase (NEB #M0202) in 1X T4 DNA ligase reaction buffer (NEB #B0202) at room temperature for at least 1.5 hr with slowly shaking. After ligation, biotin-dNTPs at the DNA termini were removed with 500 units of Exonuclease III (NEB #M0206) in 1X NEBuffer 1 (NEB #B7001) at 37°C for 15 min. Samples were then reverse crosslinked with 1X proteinase K solution (500 ug/uL Proteinase K (ThermoFisher #AM2542), 1% SDS, 0.1 µg/µL RNaseA) at 65°C overnight. DNA was extracted by the standard Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl Alcohol (25:24:1) and ethanol precipitation procedure. DNA was then loaded and purified on ZymoClean column. Purified DNA was separated on a 3% NuSieve GTG agarose gel (Lonza #50081). The gel band corresponding to the size of dinucleosomal DNA (~250 to 350 bp) was cut and purified with Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo #D4008). We note that the size-selection for DNA larger than 200 bp greatly reduces the ratio of unligated monomer in Micro-C data.</p><p>Micro-C sequencing library was generated by using NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB #E7645) with some modifications. Purified DNA was end-repaired using End-it from Lucigen. 17.5 µl DNA was added to 2.5 ul 10X end-it buffer, 2.5 ul 10x ATP and 2.5 µl dNTP 10x, and finally 0.5 end-it enzyme was added. The mix was incubated at 25°C for 45 min and at 70°C fro 10 min. Then the Biotinylated-DNA was captured by Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads (ThermoFisher #65001) in 1X BW buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl) at room temperature for 20 min with gentle rotation. DNA-conjugated beads were washed twice with 1X TBW buffer (0.1% Tween20, 5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl) at 55°C for 5 min with vigorously shaking, rinsed once with Tris buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5), and then resuspended in Tris buffer. We then performed ‘on-bead’ end-repair/A tailing and adapter ligation following the NEB protocol. Adapter-ligated DNA was washed once with 1X TBW and rinsed once with Tris buffer before PCR amplification. Micro-C library was generated by using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Roche #KK2601) or Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB #E7645) with commercial recommended conditions. We recommend using a minimal PCR cycle to reduce PCR duplicates, typically ranging from 8 to 12 cycles that can generate high-quality data for yeast samples. Prior to sequencing, purifying the library twice with 0.85X AMPure XP beads (Beckman #A63880) can eliminate primer dimers and adapters. We used Illumina 100 bp paired-end sequencing (PE100) to obtain ~50M reads for each replicate in this study.</p><p>Micro-C data are accessible from the GEO repository accession number GSE151553.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Preprocessing Micro-C data from fastq to contact matrix</title><p>Each fastq mate was mapped to the yeast sacCer3 genome independently using Bowtie 2.3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) with ‘very-sensitive-local’ mode. Aligned reads were paired by the read name. Pairs with multiple hits, low MAPQ, singleton, dangling end, self-circle, and PCR duplicates were discarded. Contacts shorter than 200 bp (unligated monomer) were also removed. Output files containing all valid pairs were used in downstream analyses. Valid Micro-C contact read pairs were obtained from the HiC-Pro analysis pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Servant et al., 2015</xref>), and the detailed description and code can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nservant/HiC-Pro">https://github.com/nservant/HiC-Pro</ext-link>. We recommend checking these quality control statistics before moving forward to the downstream analysis: (1) bowtie mapping rate; (2) reads pairing percentage; (3) ratio of sequencing artifacts; (4) ratio of cis/trans contacts; (5) unligated monomer percentage. If any of the above statistics is not in the optimal range, one might consider checking mapping and filtering parameters or further optimize the Micro-C experiment.</p><p>Valid Micro-C contacts were assigned into the corresponding ‘pseudo’ nucleosome bin. The bin file was pre-generated from the yeast sacCer3 genome by the 100 bp window that virtually resembles the nucleosome resolution. The binned matrix can be stored in HDF5 format as COOL file format by using COOLER package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mirnylab/cooler">https://github.com/mirnylab/cooler</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdennur, 2017</xref>) or HIC file format by using JUICER package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer">https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Durand et al., 2016</xref>). COOL and HIC are the standard 4DN formats that are compatible with many downstream analysis ecosystems (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.4dnucleome.org/">https://www.4dnucleome.org/</ext-link>). Contact matrices were then normalized by using iterative correction (IC) in COOL files (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Imakaev et al., 2012</xref>) or Knight-Ruiz (KR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Knight and Ruiz, 2013</xref>) in HIC files. Regions with low mappability and high noise were blocked before matrix normalization. We expect that matrix balancing normalization corrects systematic biases such as nucleosome occupancy, sequence uniqueness, GC content, or crosslinking effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Imakaev et al., 2012</xref>). We notice that both normalization methods produce qualitatively equal contact maps. To visualize the contact matrices, we generated a compilation of COOL file with multiple resolutions (100 bp to 12,800 bp bins) that can be browsed on the Higlass 3D genome server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://higlass.io">http://higlass.io</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kerpedjiev et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, all snapshots of Micro-C or Hi-C contact maps and the 1D browser tracks (e.g. ChIP-seq) were generated by the Higlass browser unless otherwise mentioned.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Genome-wide contact decaying curve analysis</title><p>We only used intra-chromosomal contact pairs to calculate the contact probability in bins with exponentially increasing widths from 100 bp to 1 Mb. Contacts with a distance shorter than 100 bp were removed from the analysis to minimize noise introduced by self-ligation or undigested DNA products. Decaying curves in this study were normalized to the total number of contact pairs. The orientations of ligated DNA are parsed into ‘IN-IN (+/-),' ‘IN-OUT’ (+/+),' ‘OUT-IN’ (-/-),' and ‘OUT-OUT’ (-/+)' according to the readouts of Illumina sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hsieh et al., 2015</xref>). ‘UNI’ pairs are the combination of ‘IN-OUT’ and ‘OUT-IN’ because both orientations are theoretically interchangeable. We plotted the contact decaying curves with the ‘UNI’ orientation in this study unless otherwise mentioned.</p><p>Slopes of contact decay curves were obtained by measuring slopes in a fixed-width window. After the window searching through the entire range of curves, the slopes obtained from each window were connected and plotted against the genomic distance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Chromatin loop analysis</title><p>Loops (focal contact enrichment) in this study were identified by using the HICCUPS algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rao et al., 2014</xref>) in the JUICER package or Chromosight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Matthey-Doret et al., 2020</xref>). In HICCUPS analysis, loops were called with KR-normalized Micro-C contact matrices at 500 bp resolution, and filtered by a false discovery rate at 0.1 (calling options: -m 4096 k KR -r 500,500 f 0.1,0.1 p 6,8 -i 12,16 -d 2500,2500). In chromosight analysis, loops were detected with balanced contact matrices at 400 bp resolution and filtered by a cut-off in Pearson correlation coefficient 0.3 (calling options: <monospace>--pearson</monospace> 0.3 <monospace>--min</monospace>-dist 5000 <monospace>--max-dist</monospace> 1000000 <monospace>--min-separation</monospace> 1000 <monospace>--perc-undetected</monospace> 10). Hi-C data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schalbetter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Paldi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hsieh et al., 2016</xref> were reanalyzed with the same loop calling option. Apparent false-positive hits (e.g. distance larger than 100 kb) were manually removed. We applied the lists of loop anchor to many downstream analyses by using Bedtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>), including (1) comparison of loop anchors between Micro-C and Hi-C, (2) histogram of loop size, (3) cross-correlation with ChIP-seq data, and (4) the number of loops per anchor, etc. We noted that the current loop calling algorithm does not identify all the visible chromatin loops, mostly skipping a subset of distal and weaker loops.</p><p>Genome-wide loop intensity was assessed by the aggregate peak analysis (APA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). We used JUICER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Durand et al., 2016</xref>) or coolpuppy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flyamer et al., 2020</xref>) packages to perform the analysis. In brief, loops were centered and piled up on a 10 kb x 10 kb matrix with 200 bp resolution data. The pile-up matrix was then normalized by KR, ICE, or distance, as indicated in the figure legend. Loops close to the diagonal were excluded or normalized by a random shift to avoid distance decay effects. The ratio of loop enrichment was calculated by dividing normalized center contacts in a searching window by the normalized corner submatrices.</p><p>We used the same approach to analyze the genome-wide target-centered loop intensity. Instead of aggregating at the intersection of loop anchors, the matrix is centered at the paired MCD1 ChIP-seq peaks. The pairs are selected for the adjacent peaks at distances shorter than 100 kb or the indicated peak intervals. The pile-up matrix was then normalized by KR, ICE, or distance, as indicated in the figure legend.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Chromatin domain analysis</title><p>We used insulation score analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crane et al., 2015</xref>) from the cooltools package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mirnylab/cooltools">https://github.com/mirnylab/cooltools</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Venev et al., 2020</xref>) or the ‘hicfindTADs’ function from hicexplorer packages (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/deeptools/HiCExplorer">https://github.com/deeptools/HiCExplorer</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wolff et al., 2020</xref>) to identify sharp changes in chromatin interactions, which typically represent the domain boundaries. To identify kb-scale cohesin-mediated chromatin domains, we analyzed insulation profiles with Micro-C contact matrices at 2 kb resolution and 15 kb searching window. The sliding window scans across the entire genome and assigns the insulation intensity to its corresponding bin. The insulation scores were obtained and normalized as the log2 ratio of the individual score to the mean of the genome-wide averaged insulation score. Chromatin boundaries can be identified by finding the local minima along with the normalized insulation score. Boundaries overlapping with low mappability regions were removed from the downstream analysis.</p><p>For aggregate domain analysis (ADA), each domain was rescaled to a pseudo-size by N<sub>i,j</sub>=((C<sub>i</sub>-D<sub>start</sub>)/(D<sub>end</sub>-D<sub>start</sub>), (C<sub>j</sub>-D<sub>start</sub>)/(D<sub>end</sub>-D<sub>start</sub>)), where C<sub>i,j</sub> is a pair of contact loci within domain D that is flanked by D<sub>start</sub> and D<sub>end</sub>, and N<sub>i,j</sub> is a pair of the rescaled coordinates. The rescaled domains can be aggregated at the center of the plot with ICE or distance normalization.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional

examines the structure of budding yeast chromosomes in mitosis using the high resolution chromosome capture technique, Micro-C XL. By analysis of specific mutants, high quality datasets are presented to unequivocally show that yeast chromosomes are organised into loops that are defined by cohesin. A model is presented for cohesin-dependent loop formation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cohesin residency determines chromatin loop patterns&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Adèle L Marston as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript describes the generation and analysis of chromosome conformation changes in synchronised populations of budding yeast, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, using a high-resolution method termed micro-C (an evolution of Hi-C) that was recently developed by one of the authors (Hsieh et al., 2015; Hsieh et al., 2016).</p><p>The authors describe a punctate interaction pattern that arises in metaphase-arrested cells, is dependent on the cohesin subunit Mcd1, and is altered upon depletion of the cohesin regulators Wpl1 and Pds5. The authors propose a modification of prior models of loop extrusion with barrier elements to interpret the microC patterns, specifically proposing that the stable binding of cohesin acts as a barrier to loop extrusion by dynamic cohesin.</p><p>The datasets themselves are informative, and will be of great use to the research community. It should be noted that some of the key findings were described in earlier work by Schalbetter et al., (2019) and (Dauban et al., 2020). The paper is technically impressive, the beautiful interaction patterns are compelling and the increased resolution of the micro-C both reinforces and extends conclusions from earlier work. However, there are a number of concerns related to how the analysis was done and how the findings are interpreted. The general perception of this manuscript would also be boosted by a small amount of additional analysis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Though the data quality in the current study is unmatched, others have convincingly shown the presence of loops in budding yeast by Hi-C (Schalbetter et al., 2017, 2019; Dauban et al., 2020) and these studies need to be appropriately acknowledged throughout. Credit should be given to Dauban et al., 2020 for cohesin-dependent domains in G1, demonstrating cohesion-independent chromosome looping.</p><p>2) The authors must substantially rephrase and rewrite the text to avoid confusing the presence/absence of the punctate/grid-like focal interactions detected by Hi-C/micro-C with the presence/absence of &quot;loops&quot;. The importance of this point cannot be overstated.</p><p>Critically, whilst it is correct to interpret focal matrix signals to represent the higher-order polymer interactions that can arise at loop bases, it is incorrect to infer that the lack of such focal interactions in a matrix indicates the lack of loops. Rather, the latter simply means that there are no &quot;well-positioned&quot; loops within the population of cells assayed.</p><p>Fundamentally, looped chromatin can be inferred from the relationship between the decay rate of interactions over distance (P(s)) without any explicit need to observe focal interactions-be this either because the dataset being studied lacks resolution to resolve such interactions (low-resolution HiC/binning, or low depth sequencing), or because loops may not arise at preferred locations (across the population). Indeed, prior mitotically-arrested yeast datasets were able to estimate both average loop length, and average loop number (per cell), despite the lower spatial resolution of the data analysed (Schalbetter et al., 2017).</p><p>3) A brief sentence subsection “Chromosome domains in mitosis” states that the boundaries of CAR domains are enriched at terminators (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C), where CARs are preferentially located. This point may be far from trivial. I indeed wonder whether the anchors of the loops presented in this paper overall correspond with terminators. A recent bioRxiv piece by the Cees Dekker and Uhlmann labs raises serious doubt as to whether yeast cohesin (in contrast to human cohesin) can in fact extrude loops. Yeast cohesin may still act as a topological anchor that when pushed along DNA enables the enlargement of a loop, but cohesin itself might not act as the motor. Of course the current manuscript does not need to fully address this point, but it would be relatively straightforward to assess whether the loop anchors genome-wide appear to correspond with terminators in general and/or with sites of convergent transcription in particular. Such an analysis could for sure add to the impact and the novelty of the current paper.</p><p>4) Do those CARs that act as boundaries then maybe correspond with convergent genes? If cohesin were pushed to these sites by transcription from two sides, this would also explain why these CARs have higher cohesin peaks by ChIP. It would be good to then also place these findings in the context of a recent paper by Paldi et al., on how convergent transcription shapes pericentromeres.</p><p>5) In Figure 2D, depletion of Mcd1 leads to the loss of focal loops. Yet, one can still observe domains. Also, here, it would be good to link these structures to the presence of genes. I would actually recommend that the authors throughout plot the genes above the matrices. A comparison of these domains with the Mcd1-independent domains observed in the previously published Micro-C work from asynchronous cells would also be useful here.</p><p>6) Figure 5—figure supplement 1: The plots in panels B and F suggest that loss of Wapl or Pds5 yields similar results, while e.g. panels A and E suggest that loss of these two factors yields very different results. Please explain.</p><p>7) The authors appear to conclude that it is non-random cohesin binding that defines the non-random location of loops (last sentence of Abstract for example). How do they exclude that it is not the non-random position of loops (generated by SMCs at their bases) that creates the non-random cohesin pattern?</p><p>8) Please specify in the text (for all experiments) for how long cells were arrested, and for the depletion experiments, how long after auxin was added were specific samples harvested? Have the authors confirmed depletion of AID-tagged proteins by western blotting in each experiment?</p><p>9) Critically, it is far from clear what genotypes and conditions are being compared. For example, is the wild type nocodazole sample also treated with auxin (as a control) when compared to the mcd1-AID, pds5-AID, and wpl1-AID mutants? Or are the AID strains processed {plus minus}auxin? Were durations of nocodazole arrest identical in the comparisons presented?</p><p>10) Please provide flow cytometry profiles to help demonstrate the homogeneity (or otherwise) of the samples/timepoints being analysed for each dataset in every figure. This is relevant for all data samples – especially when auxin may have been added for an unspecified time after the initial nocodazole arrest. Moreover, this is especially important for the S-phase timecourse presented in Figure 4. For these experiments, please explain why t = 0 minutes is not included as the starting state.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cohesin residency determines chromatin loop patterns&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Although it is now clearer what had been shown in previous studies and how the current study advances the field, there are still instances where more context is required and there are some points that need revision to improve clarity.</p><p>Subsection “Micro-C XL reveals prevalent chromatin loops with a defined position in mitotic chromosomes”: The sentence should read &quot;The pervasive presence of positions loops shown….&quot;</p><p>Subsection “Micro-C XL reveals prevalent chromatin loops with a defined position in mitotic chromosomes”: &quot;These positioned loops were mostly absent in contact maps using datasets from previously published Hi-C maps of mitotic cells (Figure 1C, bottom rows; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A)&quot;. This is not completely accurate – though there is no doubt that the Micro-C XL offers improved resolution, the positioned loops can be seen in the Schalbetter et al., data and are clearly present in the Paldi, 2020 data, just less distinct. This statement should be revised to &quot;&quot; These positioned loops were less obvious in contact maps using datasets from previously published Hi-C maps of mitotic cells (Figure 1C, bottom rows; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A)&quot;.</p><p>Subsection “Cohesin complex mediates loop formation”. As a general comment about the role of cohesin in loop formation in budding yeast, this should include a reference to Schalbetter, 2019. &quot;To assess if cohesin was also needed for the formation of positioned loops in budding yeast…&quot;. The yeast meiotic observations (referenced in the Introduction) clearly demonstrate cohesin-dependence for loop positioning in yeast. To avoid confusion, it is suggested to write &quot;whilst cohesin-dependent positioned loops have been clearly demonstrated in yeast meiosis, whether or not the same is true in mitotically-dividing yeast cells is unclear.&quot;</p><p>Subsection “Cohesin complex mediates loop formation”. These two paragraphs confirm conclusions already reported by others and this should be made clear. Schalbetter et al., 2017 already demonstrated that looping was mostly cohesin rather than condensin-dependent – this was the main conclusion of that study. Similarly, this point is confirmed in Daubain et al., 2020. Please preface these two paragraphs as confirming the previous findings in these studies, rather than presenting this as a new finding.</p><p>Subsection “Cohesin complex mediates loop formation”. A comparison to the meiotic result would provide better context and make it clear that this general concept has already been clearly demonstrated in the same organism albeit under different growth conditions. e.g. &quot;Thus, we conclude, as in yeast meiosis (Schalbetter, 2019), that cohesin is required for positioned loop formation genome wide.&quot;.</p><p>Figure 2B. What are the units of the scale bar in B? How is this calculated? Is it a ratio? Is it a linear scale? Please specify in the legend.</p><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and subsection “Cohesin complex mediates loop formation”. The main conclusion from this figure is that the increased resolution of the microC-XL allows the authors to draw the conclusion that the short distance interactions are also dependent on cohesin. Otherwise the datasets broadly similar and this point should be explicitly stated.</p><p>Subsection “Cohesin complex mediates loop formation”. It is not clear why this sentence was changed from the original. The revised text is now incorrect. Whilst it is true that cohesin is responsible for chromosome individualisation, cohesin activity leads to a *reduction* in interchromosomal contacts.</p><p>Subsection “Cohesin and condensin shape the rDNA locus in mitosis”: should be a single sentence &quot;……(Guacci et al., 1994), while…&quot; Also, please remove the comma within the text: &quot;…loci (RDN37 and RDN5), spaced by two non-transcribed regions (NTS1 and NTS2).&quot;</p><p>Subsection “Cohesin and condensin shape the rDNA locus in mitosis”: Schalbetter et al., 2017 also looked at the rDNA by Hi-C in the absence of cohesin and condensin with similar conclusions and should be cited here.</p><p>Subsection “Cohesin organizes chromosomal loops genome-wide”. For clarity, it is important to make it clear that the analysis of inter-anchor distances described here is only considering adjacent (+1) distances.</p><p>Subsection “Cohesin organizes chromosomal loops genome-wide” &quot;While we detected…&quot;. As written, this sentence doesn't make sense grammatically. Please clarify what is meant.</p><p>Subsection “Cohesin organizes chromosomal loops genome-wide”. Without a direct test of causality, &quot;confirming&quot; is an overstatement. Please revise to &quot;suggesting&quot;, or &quot;supporting a model where.&quot;.</p><p>Subsection “Chromosome loops form during S-phase”. Please explain int the main text why two different temperatures were performed. The data are nice, but it is entirely unclear what conclusion the reader is expected to draw from the two-temperatures without further guidance.</p><p>Subsection “Chromosome loops form during S-phase”. &quot;wild type cells&quot; is stated, but do the authors mean 'wild-type cells arrested at mitosis with nocodazole'?</p><p>Subsection “Chromosome loops form during S-phase”. An alternative explanation is that there could be an increase in cohesin occupancy on chromosomes in mitotic arrested cells?</p><p>Subsection “Chromosome loops form during S-phase”: To make clear that this is speculation: &quot;Loop extrusion may be mediated by a different pool of cohesin that is activated later in S phase.</p><p>Subsection “Cohesin regulators affect the size and location of chromosomal loops”. To improve readability, please add commas around the central clause as indicated here: &quot;This paradox can be explained if Wpl1p, by dissociating randomly bound cohesin from chromosomes, allows efficient accumulation of cohesin at CARs (Bloom et al., 2018; Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008).&quot;</p><p>Subsection “Cohesin regulators affect the size and location of chromosomal loops”. What is the analysis that lead to the conclusion that the amount of cohesin detected at CARs was reduced 50%. The ChIP-seq data themselves are not calibrated. If analysis has not been done to determine this point, please revise the text accordingly. This also applies to the description for the data in pds5 mutant.</p><p>Subsection “Chromosome domains in mitosis”. To aid the reader, please provide a reference to Figure 7—figure supplement 1A here. However…the presented figure does not allow the reader to reach the conclusion that: &quot;A visual inspection pointed out that most cohesin-depleted domains have a roughly similar boundary distribution to the ones detected in asynchronous cell populations.&quot; The few patterns that can be seen at this scale scale look to be quite different when comparing the mcd1-AID to the asynchronous Hsieh dataset.</p><p>Subsection “Chromosome domains in mitosis”. Where do these numbers come from? Is there a relevant graph that has been omitted?</p><p>Subsection “Chromosome domains in mitosis”. The authors should be wary of their conclusions drawn in this analysis. It is very likely that the domains detected by the algorithms in the wild type are almost entirely driven by the loop signals at the apex (and edge). (e.g. look at the patterns of signal enrichment in Figure 7B for wild type). Thus, obviously, if loops disappear, so will the ability to detect these domains bioinformatically.</p><p>Discussion section. Since this point has already clearly been demonstrated for preferred Rec8 sites in meiosis, Schalbetter, 2019 should be both mentioned and referenced here to avoid overstating the novelty of the findings.</p><p>Discussion section. Similarly, this finding was also demonstrated, clearly, by the meiotic yeast data, and thus should be described and cited.</p><p>Discussion section: As above, the conclusion that cohesin defines the loops is not entirely novel and previous work showing this should be cited here.</p><p>Discussion section. The model that is described is entirely congruent with the finding of the simulations employed by Schalbetter, 2019, which employed a stochastic model of loop expansion driven by extruders that could be blocked by barriers at preferred cohesin-binding sites (Rec8 in this case). As such, it would be entirely relevant to mention the congruence of the author's data (and model) with the findings of the polymer simulations developed by others.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59889.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript describes the generation and analysis of chromosome conformation changes in synchronised populations of budding yeast, <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> using a high-resolution method termed micro-C (an evolution of Hi-C) that was recently developed by one of the authors (Hsieh et al., 2015; Hsieh et al., 2016).</p><p>The authors describe a punctate interaction pattern that arises in metaphase-arrested cells, is dependent on the cohesin subunit Mcd1, and is altered upon depletion of the cohesin regulators Wpl1 and Pds5.

This is similar to the human domains observed in the referenced papers. We have an analysis that shows the preferential location of the 2 different domain families with respect to the genes (CAR domains on terminators and cohesin-independent domains on promoters). We added the suggested comparison with previously published asynchronous cells and show that the majority of cohesin-independent domains overlap with the domains registered on asynchronous cells. In the revised manuscript, we extensively tested multiple methods (e.g., insulation scores, arrowhead, hicexplorer, and chromosight) to identify domains and found that the results from hicexplorer agree with our visual inspection more consistently. We updated the related figures and text with the new analysis. Given the packed distribution of genes and the size of chromosomes shown, a plot for genes is not really informative (it is really hard to pinpoint locations of genes features and orientations).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 5—figure supplement 1: The plots in panels B and F suggest that loss of Wapl or Pds5 yields similar results, while e.g. panels A and E suggest that loss of these two factors yields very different results.

PDS5-AID shows contact enrichment around 40 to 100kb and does not appear to have the enrichment in the same range as in the WT, suggesting the existence of extra wide-ranging loops is likely in the mutant (perhaps extending from centromere all the way to telomere).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors appear to conclude that it is non-random cohesin binding that defines the non-random location of loops (last sentence of Abstract for example).

We had included this information in the original Material and methods section but it was unclearly presented. We added further description of the cultures and the strain used in the Material and methods section to avoid any confusion. Briefly, all the strains were treated with the same exact regimen. The same amount of Auxin was added (both in WT and AID strains) and treated with alpha-factor and nocodazole for the same period of time. In fact, most of the experiments were done on the same day side by side. The depletion was checked on every experiment, and we added the western blot to show that every AID tagged protein is not detected upon auxin. The strains were analyzed extensively in (Eng et al., 2014, Lamothe et al., 2020).

For these experiments, please explain why t = 0 minutes is not included as the starting state.</p></disp-quote><p>All the mitotically arrested cells were treated with the same amount of drug (auxin and nocodazole) for the same length of time, as indicated in the original Materials and methods section. We checked their cell-cycle arrest by flow cytometry and all the strains were arrested in G2/M and are indistinguishable from one another. We agree that flow cytometry profiles are important in the time course and we added the flow cytometry profile below each panel.</p><p>Since cohesin-subunit Mcd1p is not present on alpha-factor arrested cells, but is needed to form loops (defined and undefined), we decided to start the analysis a few minutes after the release from alpha-factor. Furthermore, in our experience alpha-factor arrested cells (t=0) are slightly different from G1 cells. Therefore, we allowed the cells to recover from alpha-factor for a few minutes before beginning our analysis. We start seeing foci on the contact map at a later time point at both temperatures used, showing that we did not lose the initiation nor the range of loop formation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Although it is now clearer what had been shown in previous studies and how the current study advances the field, there are still instances where more context is required and there are some points that need revision to improve clarity.</p><p>Subsection “Micro-C XL reveals prevalent chromatin loops with a defined position in mitotic chromosomes”: The sentence should read &quot;The pervasive presence of positions loops shown….&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We changed to “shown”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Micro-C XL reveals prevalent chromatin loops with a defined position in mitotic chromosomes”: &quot;These positioned loops were mostly absent in contact maps using datasets from previously published Hi-C maps of mitotic cells (Figure 1C, bottom rows; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A)&quot;.

As a general comment about the role of cohesin in loop formation in budding yeast, this should include a reference to Schalbetter, 2019. &quot;To assess if cohesin was also needed for the formation of positioned loops in budding yeast…&quot;. The yeast meiotic observations (referenced in the Introduction) clearly demonstrate cohesin-dependence for loop positioning in yeast.

These two paragraphs confirm conclusions already reported by others and this should be made clear. Schalbetter et al., 2017 already demonstrated that looping was mostly cohesin rather than condensin-dependent – this was the main conclusion of that study. Similarly, this point is confirmed in Daubain et al., 2020. Please preface these two paragraphs as confirming the previous findings in these studies, rather than presenting this as a new finding.</p></disp-quote><p>Subsection “Cohesin complex mediates loop formation” we clearly credited the mentioned papers: ‘In budding yeast, cohesin is needed for loops genome-wide (Dauban et al., 2020; Schalbetter et al., 2017).’</p><p>We added “Previous studies have shown that genome-wide loops are cohesin- not condensin-dependent (Dauban et al., 2020; Schalbetter et al., 2017).

A comparison to the meiotic result would provide better context and make it clear that this general concept has already been clearly demonstrated in the same organism albeit under different growth conditions. e.g. &quot;Thus, we conclude, as in yeast meiosis (Schalbetter, 2019), that cohesin is required for positioned loop formation genome wide.&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The Results section focuses on the mitotic yeast. The idea that chromosome loops in mitosis and meiosis should be similar because they come from the same organism under different growth conditions ignores the dramatic structural (especially in yeast) and functional differences between meiotic and meiosis chromosomes. Therefore, we think it is more appropriate to compare with the meiotic results in the introduction and discussion, as we now extensively do.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2B.

The main conclusion from this figure is that the increased resolution of the microC-XL allows the authors to draw the conclusion that the short distance interactions are also dependent on cohesin.

We stated: “Previous studies have characterized that the contact enrichment at ~10 – 20kb appears to be cohesin dependent. In addition to those contacts, the higher resolution Micro-C XL data revealed a finer and more pronounced separation between the curves of wild-type and cohesin depletion, showing that the cohesin-dependent structures overrepresent at the length of ~3 – 15kb (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C).” This statement acknowledges the similarity in the big range and then focus on the differences between the datasets, as asked by the previous round of reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Cohesin complex mediates loop formation”.

The authors should be wary of their conclusions drawn in this analysis. It is very likely that the domains detected by the algorithms in the wild type are almost entirely driven by the loop signals at the apex (and edge).
