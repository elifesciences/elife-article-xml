A potential site for this interaction is the song premotor nucleus HVC, which receives auditory input and contains neurons (HVC<sub>X</sub> cells) that innervate an anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) important to feedback-dependent vocal plasticity. Although the singing-related output of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells is unaltered by distorted auditory feedback (DAF), deafening gradually weakens synapses on HVC<sub>X</sub> cells, raising the possibility that they integrate feedback only at subthreshold levels during singing. Using intracellular recordings in singing zebra finches, we found that DAF failed to perturb singing-related synaptic activity of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells, although many of these cells responded to auditory stimuli in non-singing states. Moreover, in vivo multiphoton imaging revealed that deafening-induced changes to HVC<sub>X</sub> synapses require intact AFP output. These findings support a model in which the AFP accesses feedback independent of HVC.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01833.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01833.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01833.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Whenever we speak, sing, or play a musical instrument, we use auditory feedback to fine-tune our movements to achieve the sound that we want. This same process is used by songbirds to learn and maintain their songs. As juvenile birds practice singing, they compare their vocalizations with their father’s song, which they will previously have stored in memory, and continually tweak their own song until the two versions match.</p><p>It has been suggested that auditory feedback is integrated with song motor commands—the instructions from the brain to move the muscles required for singing—in a region of the songbird brain called the song premotor nucleus HVC. The structure of certain neurons in this region, known as HVC<sub>X</sub> cells, rapidly changes when a bird is deafened, which suggests that these HVC<sub>X</sub> cells detect auditory feedback.</p><p>Hamaguchi et al. have now tested this idea by using fine electrodes to record the signals in HVC<sub>X</sub> cells in male zebra finches as they sang. The cells changed their activity patterns whenever the birds changed their vocalizations. By contrast, these patterns did not change when the birds heard a distorted version of their own song played back to them as they sang. This suggests that HVC<sub>X</sub> cells are insensitive to auditory feedback, and that they mainly encode song motor commands instead.</p><p>If HVC<sub>X</sub> cells don’t detect feedback, then why does deafening affect them? HVC<sub>X</sub> cells send signals indirectly to a brain region called the LMAN (which is short for the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium). Normally, if a bird becomes deaf, the quality of their song begins to deteriorate, but this deterioration can be prevented by destroying the LMAN. Hamaguchi et al. used high resolution imaging to show that destroying the LMAN also prevents deafening from altering the structure of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells. Again, this suggests that auditory feedback is not relayed from the HVC to the LMAN; instead the flow of information is in the opposite direction.</p><p>This surprising finding—namely, that HVC<sub>X</sub> cells do not integrate auditory feedback and song motor commands—raises the question of which brain region is in fact responsible for this process. Further experiments will be required to identify the underlying circuitry in the brains of songbirds.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01833.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01833.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>zebra finch</kwd><kwd>auditory feedback</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor</kwd><kwd>birdsong</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC02524</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mooney</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 NS079929</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mooney</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM78031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donald</surname><given-names>Bruce R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation Integrative Organismal Systems</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0821914</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mooney</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Intracellular recordings in singing birds and images of synapses in deafened birds provide insights into the neural circuitry that enables songbirds to fine-tune their songs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many elaborate behaviors, ranging from playing a guitar to engaging in a conversation, depend on the brain’s ability to integrate performance-related auditory feedback with the output of motor circuits controlling behavior. The synaptic mechanisms underlying the integration of sensory and motor-related signals remain enigmatic. Songbirds use auditory feedback to learn and maintain their vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Konishi, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Price, 1979</xref>) and possess well-delineated neural circuits for singing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nottebohm et al., 1982</xref>), thus providing an attractive organism in which to identify synaptic mechanisms for auditory–vocal integration. Nevertheless, despite important progress in identifying synaptic mechanisms of auditory-guided song plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mooney, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Olveczky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andalman and Fee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warren et al., 2011</xref>), how auditory feedback is integrated in the brain to affect the neural circuits for singing remains poorly understood.</p><p>One site where feedback could interact with song motor commands is the sensorimotor nucleus HVC, which is necessary for singing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nottebohm et al., 1976</xref>), exhibits neural activity precisely time-locked to song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hahnloser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prather et al., 2008</xref>), and receives input from auditory regions that contain auditory feedback-sensitive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keller and Hahnloser, 2009</xref>). Within HVC, a distinct type of projection neuron (HVC<sub>X</sub>) provides input to an anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) that is necessary for song learning and that is anatomically similar to cortico-basal ganglia pathways in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Farries and Perkel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doupe et al., 2005</xref>). Various studies have shown that the output nucleus of the AFP (the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium, or LMAN) is the source of behavioral variations that can adaptively bias song in response to feedback perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andalman and Fee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Charlesworth et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, LMAN lesions prevent deafening-induced song degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brainard and Doupe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andalman and Fee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warren et al., 2011</xref>), and inactivating LMAN can reverse shifts in syllable pitch induced by distorted auditory feedback (DAF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brainard and Doupe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andalman and Fee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warren et al., 2011</xref>). These findings suggest that the AFP has access to feedback-related information about song performance. One potential source of this information is the HVC<sub>X</sub> cell population, because auditory responses that can be detected in the AFP of anesthetized birds disappear when HVC is pharmacologically inactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roy and Mooney, 2009</xref>). Moreover, individual HVC<sub>X</sub> cells can fire in remarkably similar patterns during singing and in response to song playback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prather et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fujimoto et al., 2011</xref>). However, the singing-related action potential activity of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells does not change when auditory feedback is masked by noise bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prather et al., 2008</xref>). These and other observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hessler and Doupe, 1999</xref>) are consistent with the idea that in singing birds, HVC<sub>X</sub> cells provide the AFP with a motor-related efference copy rather than an auditory feedback signal.</p><p>Although extracellular recordings indicate that HVC<sub>X</sub> cell output in singing birds is insensitive to feedback perturbations over tens of minutes, a recent imaging study found that deafening shrinks and destabilizes dendritic spines on HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons within ∼12–48 hr, and these changes precede and predict the severity of song degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</xref>). Therefore, a remaining possibility is that HVC<sub>X</sub> cells receive subthreshold feedback signals during singing that modify their dendritic spines and more slowly alter HVC<sub>X</sub> action potential output, and thus AFP activity, over a period of hours to days. One prediction of this model is that synaptic inputs onto HVC<sub>X</sub> cells will be acutely sensitive to feedback perturbation. In this study, we tested this idea using sharp intracellular current clamp recordings in freely singing zebra finches exposed to DAF. A second prediction of this model is that the deafening-induced changes in HVC<sub>X</sub> spines will be caused by feedforward changes to HVC’s auditory afferents rather than by AFP-dependent mechanisms that drive deafening-induced vocal plasticity. To test this prediction, we imaged HVC<sub>X</sub> dendritic spines in zebra finches that received LMAN lesions prior to deafening.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Singing-related subthreshold activity of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells is insensitive to DAF</title><p>To determine whether synaptic inputs onto HVC<sub>X</sub> cells convey auditory feedback signals during singing, we made intracellular sharp electrode recordings from HVC neurons in unrestrained, young adult (∼95 days post hatch [dph]) male zebra finches using a modified version of recording techniques developed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Long et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We recorded from a total of 72 HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons in 11 birds as they engaged in spontaneous bouts of singing produced in social isolation (i.e., undirected song) and/or listened to playback of the bird’s own song (BOS). HVC<sub>X</sub> cells were identified either by antidromic stimulation methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), DC current-evoked firing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mooney, 2000</xref>), or characteristic singing-related hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Long et al., 2010</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Long et al., 2010</xref>), all HVC<sub>X</sub> cells we recorded without current injection showed spontaneous, regular action potential activity when the bird was not vocalizing (8.2 ± 5.8 Hz, mean ±SD), entered a hyperpolarized state within several hundred milliseconds before song onset (baseline −58.5 ± 7.1 mV, during singing −62.3 ± 7.3 mV), and all except two exhibited one or more action potential bursts during the utterance of the stereotyped sequence of syllables constituting the song motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

Playback sounds included either a 100-ms noise burst or a recorded version of one of the bird’s own syllables; using either of these stimuli to distort singing-related auditory feedback has been shown to induce gradual changes to adult song, indicating the existence of neural circuitry that detects these acute feedback perturbations and induces vocal plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leonardo and Konishi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tumer and Brainard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andalman and Fee, 2009</xref>). To establish the efficacy of this DAF method, we set the sound amplitude slightly above the level that causes song truncation in some initial trials (∼65 dB at the center of the cage). To ensure that any changes in subthreshold activity we might detect were driven by feedback perturbations rather than by acute changes in motor-related activity, we excluded from analysis any trials in which DAF triggered truncation or changes in song tempo (see below for a description of subthreshold activity in those DAF trials that evoked acute motor effects; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sakata and Brainard, 2008</xref>). In separate behavioral experiments, we also confirmed that applying our perturbation protocol in a pitch-contingent manner over a period of days as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tumer and Brainard, 2007</xref>) was sufficient to shift the pitch of target syllables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; the observed hit rate was 30–70%).</p><p>To measure any rapid effects of DAF on the singing-related synaptic activity of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells, we compared membrane potential records from randomly interleaved trials with (‘hit’) and without (‘catch’) DAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1D and 2A</xref>; target hit rate = 50%; observed rate was 30–70%). In a subset of cells, we used current injection to strongly hyperpolarize the membrane potential to maximize our ability to detect feedback-dependent changes in inhibitory inputs. To quantify the amplitude and timing of singing-related synaptic activity, we computed the average deviation of the baseline subtracted membrane potential between hit and catch trials (ΔV<sub>m</sub>; see ‘Materials and methods’) and estimated the onset times of depolarizing postsynaptic potentials (dPSPs) 20–200 ms after DAF onset, which brackets the auditory-evoked synaptic latencies of HVC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lei and Mooney, 2010</xref>) and the offset of the DAF stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>).

Although prior studies have not described auditory–vocal mirroring in HVC of zebra finches, longer intracellular recordings (&gt;3 hr) that we made in two DAF-insensitive HVC<sub>X</sub> cells revealed clear evidence of auditory–vocal mirroring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>).

One expectation of a motor-related signal is that it should precede sound onset during singing. To test this idea, we examined the relationship between the onsets of dPSPs and syllables during bouts of singing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). Population-averaged cross-correlation analysis revealed that dPSP onsets in HVC<sub>X</sub> cells occur on average ∼25 ms before syllable onsets (n = 53 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), similar to the findings from prior extracellular studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fujimoto et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, dPSP onsets were not correlated with syllable offsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), indicating that singing-related synaptic inputs to HVC<sub>X</sub> cells are correlated to future, rather than ongoing or past, vocal output. Another expectation of a motor-related signal is that, should change in parallel to changes in vocal output. As previously mentioned, DAF can trigger acute effects, such as truncation or slowing of song tempo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sakata and Brainard, 2008</xref>), which are distinct from the slower changes in song that are associated with feedback-dependent error correction mechanisms. In fact, we observed significant changes in membrane potential fluctuations of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells when DAF-triggered song truncation or delays in syllable onsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,H</xref>). Therefore, the intracellular method we used is capable of detecting DAF-related changes in the subthreshold activity of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells, but only when DAF triggers acute vocal motor effects.

One possibility is that feedback perturbations are detected by auditory neurons indirectly presynaptic to HVC<sub>X</sub> cells, and information from these feedback-sensing cells alters synapses on HVC<sub>X</sub> cells more gradually as a prelude to the AFP-mediated error correction processes that result in vocal plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In this ‘feedforward model’, disrupting auditory feedback should be sufficient to induce synaptic changes in HVC<sub>X</sub> cells regardless of any downstream processes in the AFP.

Lesions to LMAN also prevented deafening-induced decreases in HVC<sub>X</sub> cell spine stability, and spine stability measurements from HVC<sub>X</sub> cells in LMAN lesion-deafened birds were significantly higher than those from LMAN intact-deafened HVC<sub>X</sub> cells in all post-song degradation time bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>; 2401 spines from 7 HVC<sub>X</sub> cells in 3 LMAN lesion-deafened birds; 3562 spines from 14 HVC<sub>X</sub> cells in 9 LMAN intact-deafened birds; spine data from LMAN intact-deafened birds were previously reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</xref>; p≤0.02 for difference between groups in last 3 time bins).

First, spine dynamics in HVC<sub>X</sub> cells following LMAN lesions but prior to deafening did not differ from values obtained from similarly aged birds with normal hearing and an intact LMAN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>; HVC<sub>X</sub> cell spine size index: 1.10 ± 0.06 in LMAN lesion group; 1.07 ± 0.03 in LMAN intact group, mean ±SEM, p=0.62; HVC<sub>X</sub> cell spine stability: 94.0 ± 1.1% in LMAN lesion group, 92.0 ± 1.6% in LMAN intact group, p=0.61; LMAN intact data previously reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</xref>). Second, prior to deafening, LMAN lesions did not affect the mean or variability of syllable entropy or entropy variance (EV), two features that are sensitive to small changes in song’s acoustic structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>; Wilcoxon signed-ranks test used to compare pre-lesion to post-lesion values for 25 syllables from 6 birds [includes 3 birds used for imaging]; data shown only for mean entropy and EV; p=0.09 for mean entropy, p=0.92 for coefficient of variation [CV] of entropy, p=0.25 for mean EV, p=0.31 for CV of EV). Third, a post mortem analysis of brain tissue indicated that the lesions we made in LMAN were comparable in volume to those reported in previous studies that have established LMAN’s role in preventing deafening-induced song degradation (40–100% lesion extent, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brainard and Doupe, 2000</xref>).

HVC<sub>X</sub> cells are attractive candidates for providing this information because they provide auditory input to the AFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roy and Mooney, 2009</xref>), receive inputs that are weakened by deafening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</xref>), and may receive inputs from DAF-sensitive neurons, including HVC interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sakata and Brainard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keller and Hahnloser, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, some forms of mammalian cortical plasticity initially involve changes to inhibitory rather than excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Froemke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keck et al., 2011</xref>), raising the possibility that DAF might alter inhibitory input onto HVC<sub>X</sub> cells prior to any changes in excitatory input. Therefore, although the singing-related action potential output of HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons is insensitive to DAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prather et al., 2008</xref>), the possibility remained that these cells integrate input from feedback-sensing cells during singing at subthreshold levels, which could then trigger slower changes to synapses on HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons as a prelude to vocal plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</xref>). By directly measuring synaptic activity in singing birds, we found that singing-related synaptic activity in HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons lacks real-time sensitivity to feedback perturbation. Moreover, many HVC<sub>X</sub> cells that we recorded displayed auditory responses in non-singing states, including a subset of cells that exhibited auditory-motor mirroring, a property which has been theorized to arise through integration of real-time feedback signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanuschkin et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, although HVC<sub>X</sub> cells receive fast synaptic inputs from several sources that may have the potential to convey auditory feedback during singing, these inputs appear to be gated to an ‘off’ position during vocalization in zebra finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shea and Margoliash, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardin and Schmidt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coleman et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>One potential concern is that a synaptic feedback ‘gate’ onto HVC<sub>X</sub> cells may only open after the bird has experienced frequent and prolonged exposure to DAF. Several observations allay this concern. First, the hit rate for applying DAF we used during intracellular recordings (i.e., ∼50%) has been shown here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) and by others to be sufficiently frequent to drive adaptive changes in pitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andalman and Fee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Charlesworth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2013</xref>). Second, all of the analyses of subthreshold DAF sensitivity we performed were conducted after the bird had been exposed to DAF for at least an entire preceding day, the time required for the bird to habituate to the exposure, as determined by the decreased frequency of song truncations we observed in response to DAF. Finally, because we recorded from individual birds for 1 to 2 weeks and exposed them to DAF throughout much of that time window, many of the cells we recorded from were monitored after the animal had experienced many days or even more than a week of DAF. That is, our intracellular recordings and analyses of subthreshold DAF sensitivity were made in conditions where the bird’s exposure to DAF was both frequent and prolonged. And although we did not track any single cell’s activity while DAF exposure induced song plasticity, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al. (2013)</xref> has shown that singing-related HVC multiunit activity remains unchanged even after contingent DAF is used to drive changes in song pitch. Therefore, we support a model in which auditory synapses onto HVC<sub>X</sub> cells are always gated off when the bird is singing, while also recognizing that experiments involving longer-term intracellular recordings in birds that are undergoing DAF-induced song plasticity are required to fully resolve this issue.</p><p>The absence of any detectable synaptic trace of auditory feedback in HVC<sub>X</sub> cells during singing raises the question of how deafening drives changes to synapses on these cells. One possibility is that auditory feedback information is first transmitted to HVC<sub>X</sub> cells and then to downstream error correction circuits in the AFP, but that this information transfer occurs slowly and only when the bird is not singing. Regardless of the plausibility of such an offline feedforward model, it predicts that removal of auditory feedback independent of downstream error correction processes in the AFP should be sufficient to trigger changes to dendritic spines in HVC. In contrast, we found that LMAN lesions prevent the shrinkage and destabilization of HVC<sub>X</sub> dendritic spines that normally follow deafening. Therefore, deafening-induced changes to HVC<sub>X</sub> spines depend on an intact AFP, rather than resulting simply from the removal of auditory drive to HVC, thus raising the possibility that HVC receives error-correction signals from the AFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2013</xref>). Although the current experiments cannot resolve whether deafening-induced changes in HVC are driven solely by changes in LMAN activity or instead by LMAN acting in concert with the removal of auditory inputs to HVC<sub>X</sub> cells, the total insensitivity of HVC<sub>X</sub> cells to acute feedback perturbations suggests to us that deafening-induced synaptic changes in HVC<sub>X</sub> cells are a consequence rather than a cause of error correction processes mediated by the AFP. The indirect, recurrent pathways that can convey activity from LMAN to HVC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamaguchi and Mooney, 2012</xref>) provide a substrate over which the consequences of error correction processes in the AFP could be transmitted back to the early stages of the vocal motor hierarchy. Furthermore, because LMAN can access multiple stages of the motor hierarchy in tens of milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamaguchi and Mooney, 2012</xref>) and song may only change in response to altered feedback over hours or days, the consequences of performance evaluation may be widely distributed in the song motor network even before behavioral changes are first evident.</p><p>A remaining important question is how and in what form auditory feedback information enters the AFP to facilitate error correction. Previous studies have shown that input and output cells of the AFP (HVC<sub>X</sub> and LMAN neurons) are not real-time sensors of auditory feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leonardo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prather et al., 2008</xref>), and the current study shows that even those feedback-dependent changes that can be detected in HVC depend on the AFP rather than fast synaptic signaling onto HVC<sub>X</sub> cells from feedback-sensing auditory neurons. These findings suggest that HVC is downstream of the performance evaluation provided by real-time feedback sensors, and also raises the possibility that these sensors communicate error-related information to the AFP independent of HVC. Notably, the ventral tegmental area provides input to Area X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lewis et al., 1981</xref>) and receives indirect input from several auditory regions, including the HVC shelf, that contain DAF-sensitive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wild et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fortune and Margoliash, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vates et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keller and Hahnloser, 2009</xref>). In this scenario, the consequences of error detection would reach the AFP in the form of neuromodulatory signals from the VTA, an arrangement that would buffer the entire song premotor circuitry from the role of acute feedback processing. In fact, this buffered feedback architecture, along with the gating of auditory inputs to HVC, may be necessary when the frequency of motor control is so fast that a relatively slow feedback signal becomes uninformative for the ongoing motor command.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>All experiments were carried out in accordance with a protocol approved by Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

The microdrive was surgically implanted over HVC using stereotaxic coordinates. All recordings were made from the right hemisphere. HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons were identified by antidromic stimulation of Area X with a bipolar stimulating electrode (a pair of 75 μm diameter silver wires, ∼500 μm apart, A-M systems, WA) implanted into Area X, or by their spontaneous, DC-evoked, and singing-related activity.

Before the experiments, a support-vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used to define the pre-target syllable (SVM algorithm with a Gaussian kernel using soft margins was written by KH in MATLAB). During the experiment, the same SVM algorithm and the same parameter sets (written in Simulink and xPC Target, MATLAB by KH) were used for the online detection of the pre-target syllable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, step 3). Once the pre-target syllable was detected, spectral features including sound amplitude, mean frequency, Wiener entropy, FM, and pitch values were measured for a duration ∼100 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, step 4). Because the occurrence of the target syllable was almost completely predicted by the detection of the pre-target syllable in zebra finch songs, we defined the occurrence of the target syllable simply as the time when sound amplitude crossed a threshold. The occurrence of the target syllable was confirmed in post-hoc analysis. To avoid false positives (triggering DAF by detecting a natural fluctuation of syllable features), the criteria need to be met for more than 3 ms before executing DAF playback; therefore, the minimum latency between the detection of target syllable and the delivery of auditory feedback is 3–4 ms. We set the sound amplitude slightly above the level where birds tend to truncate their song (∼65 dB at the center of the cage) to establish the saliency of DAF. Birds gradually begin to sing motifs of normal duration and tempo even with DAF, and our analysis is limited to the songs without truncation and delayed syllables except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Song truncation was detected by the absence of expected syllables following DAF onset. Delayed syllables were detected by referencing the expected distribution of the syllable onset timings in catch conditions with the probability p(τ | catch), where τ is the syllable onset timings relative to DAF.

Because zebra finch songs are highly stereotyped, the onset timing of each dPSP is highly stereotyped across bouts, and dPSP onsets naturally form clusters in dPSP raster plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To identify each dPSP onset cluster, we used a <italic>k</italic>-means clustering algorithm to identify dPSP onsets. The number of clusters is given by inspecting the dPSP histogram and raster plots. The time range for this analysis is 20–200 ms after DAF onset. We did not include cells with overlapping dPSPs because the identification of the corresponding dPSPs across hit and catch conditions is difficult.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Measurement of auditory responses</title><p>To quantify the auditory responses of the intracellularly recorded neurons, we first measured the subthreshold (median-filtered voltage trace relative to baseline) and suprathreshold (firing rate) activity during and before playback of the bird’s own song (BOS), a stimulus known to evoke robust and selective responses in HVC neurons (stimulus duration was 1–2.4 s, played to birds at random intervals of 15-60 s). We analyzed data from neurons with 7 or more trials and the significance of each neuron’s response was evaluated by either a statistical test for differences in median value (Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test) or variance (Ansari–Bradley test). The Ansari–Bradley test is applicable only when there is no significant difference in median value; therefore, we first tested for a significant difference in the median response using the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test and then applied the Ansari–Bradley test if there was no significant difference in median response. Cells that exhibited a significant difference in either the median or variance were defined as ‘responsive’. The threshold for statistical significance was set to p=0.025 for both tests. Response index of variable <italic>r</italic> (V<sub>m</sub> or firing rate) is defined as follows;<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Response</mml:mtext><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mtext>index</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> are the mean or standard deviation of variable <italic>r</italic> measured during response and baseline periods, respectively.</p><p>The expected playback amplitude was subtracted from the sound amplitude recorded through the microphone to detect and eliminate trials when the bird vocalized during BOS playback. The sound amplitude was set to around 60 dB at the center of the cage during day-time recordings (light on) and ∼45 dB during night-time recordings (light off).</p><p>We classified our dataset based on both recording time and the bird’s behavioral state. For day-time recordings, the bird’s wakefulness was monitored by video, and we excluded data from periods when the bird closed its eyes and perched quietly for &gt;1 min. For night-time recordings, the light was turned off and we excluded the trials when the bird was making noise. The light was turned on at a fixed time each day (9AM) and was turned off around 9 PM (±2 hr; day/night ratio between 14:10 and 10:14 hr).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Deafening and quantification of song degradation</title><p>Male zebra finches (120–150 dph) were anesthetized with isoflurane and deafened by bilateral cochlear removal. Undirected song was recorded continuously starting at least 2 days before until at least 1 week after deafening. Wiener entropy and entropy variance (EV) of each syllable in a bird’s song were quantified using Sound Analysis Pro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43a">Tchernichovski et al., 2000</xref>). 30 examples of each syllable were measured on each day, and values from two pre-deafening days were pooled to obtain a baseline distribution for each syllable. The onset of song degradation for each bird was defined as the day on which the distribution of values for either the entropy or EV of any syllable differed significantly from the baseline distribution and remained significantly different on all subsequent days (one-way ANOVA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Fluorescent labeling of HVC neurons and in vivo two-photon imaging</title><p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</xref>), GFP-lentivirus (∼1 µL; eGFP expressed under the control of the Rous Sarcoma Virus LTR [FRGW]) was injected into HVC and Fast Blue or Alexa-Fluor 594 conjugated dextran amine were injected into Area X and RA (64-160 nL) in isoflurane-anesthetized male finches 4 days to 2 weeks prior to imaging. The birds were placed on a reverse day–night cycle 1 week before the first imaging session to minimize effects of imaging on their daytime behavior and were imaged longitudinally starting 1–2 nights prior to deafening. On the first night of imaging, birds were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. A headpost was affixed to the skull using dental acrylic, and bilateral craniotomies (1–2 mm<sup>2</sup>) were made over HVC. The dura was excised, and a custom-cut coverslip (No. 1 thickness) was placed over the pial surface and sealed in with dental acrylic. The birds were placed on a custom stage under a Zeiss Laser Scanning Two-Photon Microscope 510. Only GFP-labeled neurons within a field of retrogradely labeled neurons were classified as HVC neurons and imaged. Dendritic segments of identified HVC neurons were imaged twice nightly at 2 hr intervals (Zeiss Laser Scanning Two-Photon Microscope 510, 1024 × 1024 pixels, 76 × 76 µm<sup>2</sup> image size, 3.2 µs/pixel, averaging 2 samples per pixel with 1 µm z-steps, using a 40x/0.8NA Zeiss IR-Archoplan immersion objective).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Three-dimensional image stacks were smoothed using a Gaussian filter (ImageJ); brightness and contrast adjustments were not made for data analysis, although images were contrast-enhanced for figure presentation. Dendritic segments to be analyzed were selected and identified in image stacks collected either 2 hr or 24 hr apart. Spine size (measured across nights, 24 hr interval) was measured as the integrated optical density of each spine head, background-subtracted (using the optical density of neuropil next to the dendrite) and normalized to the mean brightness of the adjacent dendritic shaft. Spine size index was calculated as the ratio of spine size values measured during imaging sessions separated by 24 hr (time 24 size/time 0 size). Spine stability was calculated as the percentage of spines maintained each night (2 hr interval). Data from LMAN intact, deafened birds and LMAN intact, hearing birds (previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</xref>) are reported as raw values (i.e., post-deafening measurements of spine size index and spine stability were not normalized to baseline, pre-deafening measurements for data presentation).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>LMAN lesions</title><p>The boundaries of LMAN were mapped out using extracellular recordings, and LMAN was lesioned bilaterally by 7% ibotenic acid injection at least 4 days prior to deafening or imaging. Nissl-stained tissue from 2 LMAN intact control birds was used to estimate the average volume of LMAN, and the volume of LMAN remaining in LMAN lesion birds was divided by this value to estimate lesion extent. Additionally, injections of retrograde tracer were made into RA 4–5 days prior to sacrificing the animals to retrogradely label any remaining RA-projecting neurons in LMAN and to aid in the identification of remaining, non-lesioned portions of LMAN in Nissl-stained tissue sections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Source code</title><p>MATLAB and xPCtarget based data acquisition program for realtime detection of target syllable and playback of sound.

Positioned as they are in the auditory/singing pathway these HCV<sub>X</sub> neuron seem a likely target for feedback during singing that leads to behavioral plasticity, but extracellular recordings have not shown an effect of acoustic feedback on spiking during singing: thus the motivation in this study to look for subthreshold effects of feedback. The results show convincingly that synaptic input to HVC<sub>X</sub> cells can be driven by sound input but not during singing corroborating the previous extracellular results. These experiments are supplemented by an ablation (AFP) experiment that shows that deafening induced plasticity of spines on HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons requires an anterior forebrain pathway. This structural study provides novel conclusions. This elegant analysis in freely singing birds will generate wide interest in the songbird and sensory motor integration communities.</p><p>All the reviewers thought the work was elegant and important but there were some minor concerns that should be addressed. The reviews are highly congruent and complementary, and they are provided in their entirety so that the authors can benefit from them directly. The authors should address reviewer concerns and implement all the minor edits. They should particularly address this minor concern:</p><p>“A remote possibility with DAF is that auditory responses in HVC<sub>X</sub> might only occur after a window of time. One could envisage, for example, that HVC only processes auditory feedback errors if these occur for a critical amount of time. In other words, auditory flow might be gated for small infrequent errors (this might prevent the motor system from changing to any random perturbation of auditory feedback during singing) but might become “un-gated” once the perturbations are sensed as occurring in a consistent manner (this “consistency” could potentially be monitored in the auditory forebrain and need not rely on the AFP or VTA). A prediction of this idea is that HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons would not show any changes in activity if (1) DAF is too infrequent or (2) when DAF is first introduced. It would be helpful for the authors to address this issue. This argument could easily be resolved if the authors are able to show that DAF-induced changes in song also occur in the birds they record from. Ideally, the most convincing argument would be to show a lack of change in HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons during DAF even while the birds undergo changes in song.”</p><p>Because such a demonstration would constitute a new study they should squarely address this issue in Discussion.</p><p>Another point that the authors should address is making the title more descriptive of what the manuscript actually presents.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#1</italic>:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors perform a careful electrophysiological analysis of subthreshold activity in HCV<sub>X</sub> neurons using sharp electrode recordings of the awake unrestrained songbird during singing to assess the role of auditory feedback during singing in these neurons.

The work is carefully done with detailed analysis and the figures appropriately illustrate the data. Nevertheless the figures are very complicated and could benefit from more detailed legends and perhaps better labeling. A better general figure of the system than <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> would help, including some of the detail of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> up front. Essential information from the supplemental figures should be incorporated into the text according to <italic>eLife</italic> policy – I defer to the expert reviewers on what is essential.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#2</italic>:</p><p>The authors convincingly demonstrate their two main points: lack of subthreshold responses to auditory feedback perturbations in HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons and a dependence of deafening-induced changes in spine morphology on an intact AFP. The work represents a very high level of technical proficiency and, except in rare cases, the presentation is very clear.</p><p>My primary concern centers on the impact of the paper’s findings. As the authors correctly point out, a number of prior studies have used extracellular recordings to show that the pattern of action potentials fired by HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons is insensitive to perturbations of auditory feedback. The first main finding of the present manuscript <italic>–</italic> that subthreshold activity is also not affected by feedback perturbations <italic>–</italic> therefore confirms current thinking in the field and appears to have limited interest except to specialists in the system.</p><p>The paper’s second main finding – that post-deafening changes in spine morphology in X-projecting HVC neurons depends on an intact AFP – has somewhat higher impact. Earlier work from the same lab (Tschida and Mooney, Neuron 2012) convincingly demonstrated that deafening-induced changes in spine morphology precede the degradation of song and that the changes in spine size predicted the magnitude of behavioral changes. These earlier results raise the question of whether the morphological changes reflect the sensory perturbation (deafening) or the beginning of AFP-dependent motor changes that are first detectable days later. The present results demonstrating that spine changes depend on an intact AFP show that such changes are not solely a function of altered auditory feedback, ruling out a simple model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) in which changes in spine morphology depend only on the removal of ascending auditory inputs. Although ruling out this model leaves several important questions unanswered (especially the mechanisms by which patterns of AFP activity could regulate spine changes in HVC and how LMAN’s indirect inputs to HVC might interact with ascending auditory signals), it nevertheless represents an advance in knowledge over prior studies.</p><p>In summary, I have no substantial concerns about how the research was performed or the validity of the results. My primary concern is that the first finding described above does not substantially change current thinking about the system. The second finding advances our understanding of sensorimotor plasticity by ruling out a simple model of auditory dependence and therefore will be of greater interest to readers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#3</italic>:</p><p>This is a very carefully executed experimental study investigating, in songbirds, how and where auditory feedback modifies vocal motor circuits. This is a question that lies at the core of how auditory feedback shapes vocal learning. Over the past several decades, a number of increasingly refined experiments have shown that auditory feedback is necessary for vocal learning and that perturbations of auditory feedback will cause, even the normally stereotyped song of adult zebra finches, to degrade. The time course over which this degradation occurs is not immediate. Depending on the experimental paradigm and the precision with which song is analyzed, changes in song acoustic structure can be observed within hours to days. Because lesions of a specialized basal ganglia circuit (known as the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP)) prevents song degradation following feedback perturbation (e.g., deafening by cochlear removal or distorted auditory feedback (DAF)), it has been hypothesized and shown that song degradation is an active process that can be prevented by interrupting this basal ganglia circuit, for example with lesions of its output nucleus, LMAN.</p><p>One of the primary assumptions has always been that auditory feedback information is processed by nucleus HVC. This nucleus receives direct input from the auditory forebrain, is necessary for song production and was thought to provide the only known auditory input to the basal ganglia circuit by way of neurons that project directly to the basal ganglia, known as HVC<sub>X</sub>-projection neurons. It had been assumed that these neurons would relay auditory feedback information to the basal ganglia. It was therefore surprising that these neurons did not shown any changes in firing pattern during DAF even though feedback distortion was sufficient to perturb song.</p><p>In the present study, the authors used intracellular electrodes (technically heroic experiments) to record from HVC<sub>X</sub>-projecting neurons during singing under both normal and DAF conditions. They provide compelling evidence that DAF does not alter (at all!) the highly stereotyped membrane potential fluctuations that are recorded during song production. This despite recent findings, by the same lab, that DAF modifies synaptic inputs onto these cells. While these results do not provide a direct answer as to where auditory feedback is first monitored in the vocal motor system, these experiments are extremely important in ruling out HVC as the site for such monitoring.</p><p>In this study the authors also show that changes in synaptic strength (as measured by spine dynamics) of HVC<sub>X</sub>-projection neurons following auditory feedback perturbation (here they use deafening) are dependent on LMAN. They use this finding to argue that auditory feedback dependent changes in HVC<sub>X</sub>-projecting neurons are dependent on LMAN and that HVC is therefore downstream of where the real-time sensors of auditory feedback. Because the authors have previously show that LMAN receives direct auditory input from the VTA, they suggest that this circuit might be a possible candidate for auditory feedback processing, but they do not show any evidence for this.</p><p>While the authors do not, in the end, show where auditory feedback processing occurs, this study is extremely important because it makes a strong case that it does not occur in HVC.

As the authors correctly point out, a number of prior studies have used extracellular recordings to show that the pattern of action potentials fired by HVC</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub> <italic>neurons is insensitive to perturbations of auditory feedback. The first main finding of the present manuscript – that subthreshold activity is also not affected by feedback perturbations – therefore confirms current thinking in the field and appears to have limited interest except to specialists in the system</italic>.</p><p><italic>The paper’s second main finding – that post-deafening changes in spine morphology in X-projecting HVC neurons depends on an intact AFP – has somewhat higher impact. Earlier work from the same lab (Tschida and Mooney, Neuron 2012) convincingly demonstrated that deafening-induced changes in spine morphology precede the degradation of song and that the changes in spine size predicted the magnitude of behavioral changes. These earlier results raise the question of whether the morphological changes reflect the sensory perturbation (deafening) or the beginning of AFP-dependent motor changes that are first detectable days later. The present results demonstrating that spine changes depend on an intact AFP show that such changes are not solely a function of altered auditory feedback, ruling out a simple model (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7A</italic></xref><italic>) in which changes in spine morphology depend only on the removal of ascending auditory inputs. Although ruling out this model leaves several important questions unanswered (especially the mechanisms by which patterns of AFP activity could regulate spine changes in HVC and how LMAN’s indirect inputs to HVC might interact with ascending auditory signals), it nevertheless represents an advance in knowledge over prior studies</italic>.</p><p><italic>In summary, I have no substantial concerns about how the research was performed or the validity of the results. My primary concern is that the first finding described above does not substantially change current thinking about the system. The second finding advances our understanding of sensorimotor plasticity by ruling out a simple model of auditory dependence and therefore will be of greater interest to readers</italic>.</p><p>We respect the reviewer’s perspective on the novelty and/or potential impact of the intracellular data we collected in singing birds that fails to detect evidence of auditory feedback perturbation. However, we believe that the clear negative results we obtained with these intracellular recordings are critical to distinguishing between two different models of auditory feedback processing in songbirds. Together, the intracellular recordings and imaging datasets we obtained allow us to advance a model where the song premotor elements in HVC are buffered from feedback during singing. This model stands in contrast to that developed by Sakata and Brainard (albeit in a different species) and also clarifies pathways by which deafening affects synapses on song premotor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</xref>). As the third reviewer noted, “…these experiments are extremely important in ruling out HVC as the site for such [feedback] monitoring.”</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>A remote possibility with DAF is that auditory responses in HVC</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub> <italic>might only occur after a window of time. One could envisage, for example, that HVC only processes auditory feedback errors if these occur for a critical amount of time. In other words, auditory flow might be gated for small infrequent errors (this might prevent the motor system from changing to any random perturbation of auditory feedback during singing) but might become “un-gated” once the perturbations are sensed as occurring in a consistent manner (this “consistency” could potentially be monitored in the auditory forebrain and need not rely on the AFP or VTA).

Several observations allay this concern. First, the hit rate for applying DAF we used during intracellular recordings (i.e., ∼50%) has been shown here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>) and by others to be sufficiently frequent to drive adaptive changes in pitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andalman and Fee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Charlesworth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2013</xref>). Second, all of the analyses of subthreshold DAF sensitivity we performed were conducted after the bird had been exposed to DAF for at least an entire preceding day, the time required for the bird to habituate to the exposure, as determined by the decreased frequency of song truncations we observed in response to DAF. Finally, because we recorded from individual birds for one to two weeks and exposed them to DAF throughout much of that time window, many of the cells we recorded from were monitored after the animal had experienced many days or even more than a week of DAF. That is, our intracellular recordings and analyses of subthreshold DAF sensitivity were made in conditions where the bird’s exposure to DAF was both frequent and prolonged. And although we did not track any single cell’s activity while DAF exposure induced song plasticity, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al. (2013)</xref> has shown that singing-related HVC multiunit activity remains unchanged even after contingent DAF is used to drive changes in song pitch. Therefore, we support a model in which auditory synapses onto HVC<sub>X</sub> cells are always gated off when the bird is singing, while also recognizing that experiments involving longer-term intracellular recordings in birds that are undergoing DAF-induced song plasticity are required to fully resolve this issue. These potential concerns and the points made above that address them are now considered in the second paragraph of the Discussion, as directed by the Reviewing editor.</p></body></sub-article></article>
