and nociceptive responses to non-noxious stimuli, affecting approximately 7–10% of the general population. However, current first-line drugs like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and opioids have limitations, including dose-limiting side effects, dependence, and tolerability issues. Therefore, developing new interventions for the management of NP is urgent. In this study, we discovered that the high-frequency terahertz stimulation (HFTS) at approximately 36 THz effectively alleviates NP symptoms in mice with spared nerve injury. Computational simulation suggests that the frequency resonates with the carbonyl group in the filter region of Kv1.2 channels, facilitating the translocation of potassium ions. In vivo and in vitro results demonstrate that HFTS reduces the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex likely through enhancing the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> and also the leak K<sup>+</sup> conductance. This research presents a novel optical intervention strategy with terahertz waves for the treatment of NP and holds promising applications in other nervous system diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Up to 1 in 10 people are estimated to experience neuropathic pain, a particularly challenging form of chronic pain where nerve damage causes extreme sensitivity to everyday stimuli. Current treatments often rely on painkiller drugs that can lead to serious side effects as well as dependency issues. New and effective interventions are therefore necessary.</p><p>One radically different approach is the use of ‘terahertz’ waves, a type of electromagnetic radiation that has the ability to affect the chemical bonds holding molecules together. In fact, previous research has shown that specific frequencies of terahertz waves can modify the activity of certain proteins. With this technique, it may therefore be possible to disrupt voltage-dependent potassium channels, a type of proteins which help to regulate nerve cell activity and is a possible target for pain therapy.</p><p>To explore this approach, Peng, Wang, Tan et al. investigated whether high-frequency terahertz stimulation that targets potassium ion channels could reduce neuropathic pain in mice. The animals, which had undergone surgery recreating nerve damage, were implanted with a device that allowed the delivery of terahertz waves into a brain region vital for regulating pain sensations. Experiments showed that delivering 36 terahertz radiations changed important ion channel properties (such as how easily they would allow ions to pass through), decreasing neuron activity and raising the pain threshold of the mice.</p><p>This finding indicates that, with further development, terahertz frequency stimulation could become a new, non-drug method to manage neuropathic pain. Additional research will be needed to see if terahertz waves could also be applied to other neurological disorders influenced by ion channel activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>NP refers to a debilitating chronic pain condition, which is often a consequence of nerve injury or of the diseases such as cancer, diabetes mellitus, infection, autoimmune disease, and trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baron et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shan et al., 2023</xref>). The symptoms of NP include spontaneous pain, hyperalgesia, and mechanical allodynia. Unfortunately, NP is often resistant to currently available drug treatments, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and even opioids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jensen and Finnerup, 2014</xref>). More evidences reveal that NP is not merely a symptom of a disease but rather an expression of pathological operations of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costigan et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, developing new therapeutic technology aimed at these underlying mechanisms for pain relief represents a considerable challenge.</p><p>Compared with the limitations of chemical-based drug research, physics-based treatment offers a new concept and opportunity for intervening in NP. Optogenetics, as an interdisciplinary approach, has demonstrated therapeutic potential in NP. However, the limitations of viral vector delivery systems in humans are well-known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu and Wang, 2019</xref>). Recently, evidence has emerged suggesting that high-frequency terahertz (THz) photons directly resonate with molecules, thereby regulating corresponding biological functions. For instance, our previous study demonstrated that a 34.88 THz wave resonates with Aβ protein, disrupting the process of fibril formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peng et al., 2023</xref>). Li et al. discover that the band of 42.55 THz resonates with the stretching mode of either the –COO- or the –C=O group significantly enhancing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Zhu et al. conclude that 48.2 THz photons greatly increase the permeability of the sodium channel by a factor of 33.6 through breaking the hydrated hydrogen bonding network between the hydrosphere layer of the ions and the carboxylate groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, the frequency of 53.5 THz has been reported to enhance the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> currents, which modulate the startle response and associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). These studies strongly prompt us to the potential application of THz photons in the treatment of neuropathic pain by targeting the ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Trimmer, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The anterior cingulate cortex plays a crucial role in pain regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bliss et al., 2016</xref>). Our previous research has demonstrated that nociceptive information resulting from nerve injury is transmitted to the ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsuda et al., 2017</xref>). This region exhibits pre- and postsynaptic long-term plasticity (LTP), which contributes to chronic pain and associated negative emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koga et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, descending projection pathways from the ACC enhance the neuronal activity of the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) and regulate nociceptive sensory transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2018b</xref>). Brain imaging and MRI studies also provide evidence of hyperexcitability in the ACC during both acute and chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alles and Smith, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bliss et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, the activity of pyramidal cells in the ACC is directly correlated with the expression of chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Optogenetic excitation of ACC pyramidal cells induces pain, while their inhibition leads to analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, targeting the cortical regions of the ACC and inhibiting the activity of ACC pyramidal neurons may hold promise as a strategy for treating NP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuchs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lançon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Um et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Neuronal excitability is influenced by various types of voltage-gated ion channels and among them, voltage-dependent potassium (Kv) channels, as one of the important physiological regulators of neuronal membrane potentials, has been proposed as potential target candidates for pain therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Takeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Du and Gamper, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sakai et al., 2017</xref>). Zhao et al. have reported that enhancing Kv currents in injured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons alleviates neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, Fan et al. have demonstrated that lumbar (L)<sub>5</sub> spinal nerve ligation (SNL) leads to a time-dependent decrease in Kv1.2-positive neurons in the ipsilateral L<sub>5</sub> DRG. However, rescuing Kv1.2 expression in the injured L5 DRG attenuates the development and persistence of pain hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2014</xref>). These findings highlight the potential of targeting Kv channels as a therapeutic approach for managing pain.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the effects of HFTS on the Kv model. By analyzing the absorbance spectra of Kv1.2 channels, we observed a significant response to photons with a frequency of approximately 36 THz. This frequency modulates the resonance of the carbonyl group in the Kv1.2 structure, affecting the action potential waveform and frequency as demonstrated through simulations. Subsequently, we conducted in vivo multi-channel recordings and in vitro patch recordings to confirm the activation effect of HFTS on K<sup>+</sup> conductance and its inhibition of neuronal activity in the ACC pyramidal cells. Importantly, the application of HFTS resulted in a significant reduction in pain behavior in mice with spared nerve injury (SNI).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HFTS attenuates the generation of action potential through molecular dynamics simulation</title><p>To identify a specific terahertz (THz) frequency capable of modulating a major subset of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, we developed an integrated model comprising both mouse Kv channels (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 3LUT) and Na<sup>+</sup> channels (PDB ID: 3RVY) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and Supplement Fig. S1). We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the spectral absorption characteristics within the THz frequency range. Our results revealed a pronounced absorption peak at approximately 36 THz for the potassium channel, which exhibited a considerable board band compared to the absence of a corresponding peak for the sodium channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This indicates a preferential and resonant absorption of photons at the ~36 THz frequency by the potassium channel. We then tested the possible kinetic changes of Kv1.2, the typical and widely distributed Kv channel in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tsantoulas and McMahon, 2014</xref>), following the absorption of these THz photons. Our findings indicated a significant kinetic change in the -C=O groups of the channel filter structure, as evidenced by an expansion of its van der Waals radius by approximately 0.5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Furthermore, during exposure to THz photons, the conductance of the potassium ion channel exhibited an almost linear increase with the intensity of the THz field, while the conductance of sodium ions remained largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Interestingly, under terahertz photonic influence, the cortical neurons model showed significantly decreased in discharge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We performed a detailed waveform analysis of the action potentials, including parameters such as full width at half maximum (FWHM) and firing frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Our observations revealed that the FWHM of action potentials in the THz-exposed group decreased to 95% of the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, red column), and the firing frequency experienced a reduction of approximately 70% after THz photon stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, green column). These results collectively suggest that THz photons primarily attenuate neuronal firing activity by increasing potassium ion conductance, thereby modulating neuronal excitability.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Specific frequency terahertz (THz) photons resonate the voltage-dependent potassium (Kv) channel and decrease the AP firing rate in cortical neurons through molecular dynamics simulation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Absorbance spectra of voltage-gated potassium/sodium ion channels and the bulk water.

Initially, we examined the Nav current by applying a series of test pulses (from –80 to –10 mV) with a command voltage of –100 mV (20 ms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Upon illumination with ~36 THz photons (0.3±0.05 mW) for durations of 5, 10, and 20 min, we observed that HFTS had no significant effect on the activation and inactivation curve slope, half-activation and half-inactivation voltage and time constants (tau) for half-activation and half-inactivation voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–f</xref>). These findings indicate that HFTS does not affect Nav channel-mediated currents. Subsequently, we investigated the influence of HFTS on Kv currents by applying a series of test pulses (100 ms) ranging from –70 to +130 mV with a command voltage of –100 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>).

Furthermore, to assess the duration of neuronal effects induced by HFTS (15 min), we examined Kv currents at 5 min and 20 min post-HFTS. It was observed that the Kv current were enhanced 20 min post-HFTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2l</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>).

The mechanism underlying this effect is that HFTS increases voltage-gated potassium ion conductance through resonance with the carbonyl group in the potassium channel filter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Unlike optogenetic technology, HFTS can directly regulate the conformation of the ion channel without delivering a transgene that encodes a light-response protein. It exhibits frequency selectivity and dependence on channel structure. This research suggests that HFTS has the potential to serve as a novel optical technology for the treatment of NP pathology.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram shows the mechanism of high-frequency terahertz stimulation (HFTS) in alleviating neuropathic pain.</title><p>The left panel shows the group with blue light stimulation (BLS) and the right panel shows the group with HFTS.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97444-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Neuropathic pain is closely associated with nociceptor excitability in the ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bliss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2008</xref>), with ion channels playing a fundamental role in determining neuronal excitability, particularly in the hyperexcitability of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Trimmer, 2014</xref>). Excitatory Nav channels, responsible for initiating and depolarizing the action potential, can be targeted by inhibitors to effectively decrease or eliminate electrical excitability. These inhibitors are commonly used in neurology as antiepileptic drugs. On the other hand, inhibitory K channels, responsible for repolarization, contribute to the initiation of action potentials in diverse ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">González et al., 2012</xref>). Enhancing K conductivity could have a similar effect to Nav channel blockers. For instance, retigabine, an activator for Kv7, has recently been approved as a first-in-class antiepileptic drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maljevic and Lerche, 2013</xref>). Among the 12 subfamilies of Kv channels (Kv1-12), Kv1.2 is the most prevalent in neuronal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Sabi et al., 2013</xref>) and has been reported to be significantly associated with neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2021b</xref>). Although the response frequency of Kv1.2 at ~53 THz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2021</xref>) or ~34 THz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xiao et al., 2023</xref>) and the corresponding modulation function have been verified due to the broad absorption band, this study highlights the significant resonance of Kv1.2 filter structure with photons at 36 THz. By optically stimulating ACC neurons with the frequency of ~36 THz, we observed a significant reduction in the firing rate of pyramidal neurons' action potentials in SNI mice, accompanied by a notable enhancement of K<sup>+</sup> conductance. This confirms the effect of THz photons on Kv channels, including Kv1.2. However, to consolidate this conclusion, a more specific pharmacological experiment is necessary. For example, applying a blocking peptide to eliminate the Kv1.2 current and then testing whether this blocks the effects of HTFS would be a valuable test to perform in the future. Moreover, the application of HFTS resulted in significant changes in the rheobase and RMP of pyramidal cells, suggesting that HFTS may also affect the two-pore K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tsantoulas and McMahon, 2014</xref>). We thus tested the effect of HTFS on the K<sub>leak</sub> current and confirmed this hypothesis. Additionally, it has been reported that basal excitability is influenced by the opening of low-threshold Kv1.2 channels, which filter out small depolarizations and thus control the number of triggered APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Sabi et al., 2013</xref>). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that THz photons affect other K channel functions, but further research is required to confirm this in the future.</p><p>During our research, we focus on studying of pyramidal neurons in the ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xiao and Zhang, 2018</xref>). It has been reported that the firing rate of glutamatergic pyramidal cells, rather than inhibitory interneurons, increases in the ACC after chronic pain, suggesting an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). In the local circuits of the ACC, inhibitory neurons release GABA and inhibit the activities of pyramidal cells. Different studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang et al., 2015</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cichon et al., 2017</xref> have reported that specific activation of interneurons in the ACC or in the somatosensory cortex reduces pyramidal neuron hyperactivity and alleviates mechanical allodynia. Thus, the application of THz may induce complicated results by affecting the Kv channels distributed on both pyramidal cells and interneurons. However, as shown in our in vivo recording data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>), although THz illumination slightly decreased the activity of interneurons, which could potentially lead to an enhanced activity of local pyramidal cells, the direct and significant decrease in pyramidal cell activity caused by the illumination would overcome this disinhibitory effect, ultimately resulting in a net decrease in pyramidal cell activity. The behavioral analgesic effect caused by THz illumination also confirmed this conclusion.</p><p>There are several limitations in this study that should be acknowledged. Firstly, we did not investigate the thermal effect of HFTS on the Kv channel. Previous research has demonstrated the non-thermal, long-distance stimulation of high-frequency terahertz stimulation on neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, the specific interaction between ~36 THz and Kv channels in terms of thermal effects remains unexplored. Additionally, in this study, we used blue light as a comparison, and found no significant changes in potassium current and the excitability of pyramidal cells. This finding suggests the specificity of the terahertz frequency and supports the existence of non-thermal effects. Another limitation of our research is the use of an optic fiber to deliver the HFTS into the ACC region. This invasive approach may pose challenges for potential noninvasive applications. However, we believe that with the advancement of terahertz enhancement techniques, such as the use of metasurfaces or nanomaterials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2023</xref>), high-frequency terahertz waves show promising potential for broad applications in regulating diverse brain diseases, such as episodic ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cole et al., 2021</xref>), benign familial neonatal convulsions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jentsch, 2000</xref>), Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Taylor et al., 2022</xref>), and others.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male adult (8–10 weeks) C57BL/6 were used for all experiments.

The detailed process has been described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>). In brief, mice were generally anaesthetized by 2% isoflurane. Three terminal branches of the left sciatic nerve were exposed by making a direct incision in the skin and a section of the biceps femoris muscle in the left thigh. The tibial nerve and the common peroneal nerve were ligated using 6–0 silk sutures and then sectioned distal to the ligation. After ligating and cutting the nerves, they were carefully put back into their original positions, and the muscles and skin were sutured in two layers. For the sham mice, animals only received an operation that exposed the branches of the left sciatic nerve but without any nerve injury. Following a week’s accommodation period, pain behaviors were assessed using the <italic>von Frey</italic> filament test and CatWalk gait analysis to confirm the successful establishment of the NP model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Molecular dynamics simulation</title><p>The simulation was conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the interaction between terahertz photons and ion channels. A composite model of mouse eukaryotic voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels (PDB ID: 3LUT) and eukaryotic Na<sup>+</sup> channels (PDB ID: 3RVY) was built using the Charmm-GUI website. The model consisted of intact proteins, phospholipid bilayers, and saline solution (with a concentration of 0.15 M). Kinetic calculations were performed using GROMACS 5.1.2 software. The CHARMM 36 force field and periodic boundary conditions were applied to the proteins. Electrostatic interactions were handled using the connected element algorithm Ewald. During the simulation, the Rattle algorithm was used to constrain key lengths. The motion equation was solved using the Velocity-Verlet algorithm with a time step of 2 fs. Initially, the simulation was carried out at a room temperature of 303.5 K to observe the ion transport process within the channels at the molecular level. Subsequently, conductivity values (gNa, gK) for potassium and sodium ions and their corresponding absorption spectrum were calculated. To investigate the effect of ion transport under the influence of terahertz radiation, time-varying electric fields of THz radiation were added to the system. In the interaction of terahertz radiation with biological systems, electrical components play a crucial role.

Consequently, the model can replicate and explain a wide range of phenomena, including the shape and propagation of action potentials, the sharp threshold, refractory period, anode-break excitation, accommodation, and subthreshold oscillations.

Slices were then transferred to a room temperature-submerged recovery chamber containing oxygenated ACSF and incubated for at least 1 hr before patch clamp recording. The neurons were then visualized under a microscope with infrared differential interference contrast or fluorescent optics video microscopy (BX51W1, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this manuscript, by using simulation, in vitro and in

After testing the leak K+ current with and without HFTS on the SNI model, we observed a notable increase in the leak K+ current with HFTS when the holding potential surpassed -40 mV (please see the revised Figs. 2m and n). This finding prompted us to delve deeper into the shifts in the resting membrane potential (RMP). The data, along with statistical analysis, are detailed in Tables S1-3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The activation curves of the Kv currents in Figure 2h seem to be not well-fitted. I would suggest testing a higher voltage (&gt;100 mV) to collect more data to achieve a better fitting.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advice. We repeated the experiment while maintaining the voltage of patched neurons at a higher level (&gt;100 mV) to collect ample data for better fitting. The outcomes are illustrated in the revised Figs. 2g-j. Clearly, the data reveals a significant increase in K+ conductance in the HFTS group as compared to the SNI group. We have integrated these discoveries into the revised manuscript, replacing the earlier results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In the part of behavior tests, the pain threshold increased after THz application and lasted within 60 mins. I suggest conducting prolonged tests to determine the end of the analgesic effect of terahertz waves.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful comment. We echo your curiosity about the duration of the HFTS effect. In the process of revising our work, we conducted a comparative analysis of the analgesic duration resulting from 10-minute and 15-minute applications of HFTS. The findings are visualized in the revised Fig. 5c. Our observations indicate that after 160 minutes, the PWMT value for the 15-minute HFTS group decreased to a level comparable to that of the SNI group. Meanwhile, the analgesic effects persisted for 140 minutes in the case of the 10-minute HFTS application. These results imply a direct correlation between the duration of HFTS application and the duration of analgesia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Regarding in vivo electrophysiological recordings, the post-HFTS recordings were acquired from a time window of up to 20 min. It seems that the HFTS effect lasted for minutes, but this was not tested in vitro where they looked at potassium currents. This long-lasting effect of HFTS is interesting. Can the authors discuss it and its possible mechanisms, or test it in slice electrophysiological experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Based on the results from in vivo electrophysiological recordings, it was observed that the effect of HFTS can endure for a minimum of 20 minutes, and this duration was even more extended in behavioral assessments. Taking your advice, we employed slice electrophysiological recording for further testing. Following a 15-minute application of HFTS, we evaluated the K+ current at 5 and 20 minutes after incubation. Our observations clearly indicated a substantial and lasting increase in K+ current, with the effect persisting for at least 20 minutes (refer to Fig. 2l). This provides confirmation of the long-lasting influence of HFTS. The relevant data and statistical analysis are documented in Table S1-2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) How did the authors arrange the fiber for HFTS delivery and the electrode for in vivo multi-channel recordings? Providing a schematic illustration in Figure 4 would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. To enhance the reader's understanding of the HFTS delivery device during multi-channel recording, we have included a schematic illustration in Fig. 4a in the revised manuscript. The top portion of Fig. 4a depicts a quantum cascade laser (QCL) with a center frequency located at approximately 36 THz. This laser is then connected to the recording electrode via a PIR fiber. The left section illustrates the detailed structure of the recording electrode.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Some grammatical errors should be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thorough review. We have carefully checked and corrected grammar errors we found throughout the entire text to ensure that readers can better comprehend the content of the article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this manuscript, Peng et al., reported that 36 THz high-frequency terahertz stimulation (HFTS) can suppress the activity of pyramidal neurons by enhancing the conductance of voltage-gated potassium channel.

We have created schematic diagrams illustrating the HFTS delivery (Fig. 4a and Fig. 5a in the revised manuscript). Fig. 4a presents the structure designed for in vivo multi-channel recording. Fig. 5a shows the structure used in behavior test, the recording electrode is replaced by a metal hollow tube, allowing the PIR fiber to pass through the tube and target the ACC region of the mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) It would be very helpful to estimate the volume of tissue that can be influenced by HFTS. It is not clear how 15 mins HFTS was chosen for this functional study. Does a longer time have a stronger effect? A better characterization of the relationship between the stimulus duration of HFTS and its beneficial effects would be very useful.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your feedback. The degree of tissue influence is directly related to the size of the spot emerging from the fiber outlet. In our experiment, we used a PIR fiber with a 630 nm inner core diameter to propagate high-frequency THz waves. This core features a refractive index of 2.15 and has an effective numerical aperture (NA) of 0.35 ± 0.05.</p><p>Our decision to apply HFTS for 15 minutes in the behavioral study was primarily based on observations from in vivo multi-channel recordings. Specifically, we noticed a considerable reduction in the average firing rate of PYR cells after 15 minutes of HFTS exposure. To further investigate the correlation between the duration of HFTS stimulation and its effects, we conducted a comparative study using a 10-minute HFTS session. The results, depicted in revised Fig. 5c, reveal that the PWMT value decreased to the level seen in the SNI group after approximately 160 minutes following 15 minutes of HFTS, and after about 140 minutes with 10 minutes of HFTS. This suggests a direct relationship between the length of HFTS application and its beneficial outcomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) How long does the behavioral effect last after 15 minutes of HFTS? Figure 5b only presents the behavioral effect for one hour, but the pain level is still effectively reduced at this time point. The behavioral measurement should last until pain sensitization drops back to pre-stim level.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your feedback. Similar question is also mentioned by reviewer 1. As depicted in Fig. 5c, it was observed that the analgesic effects lasted for 140-160 min with 10-15 minutes application of HFTS. Based on these findings, we can conclude that in the SNI model, targeting the ACC brain region with HFTS for a duration of 10-15 minutes results in an analgesic effect that lasts for roughly 140-160 minutes. This provides valuable insights into the potential clinical applications and duration of relief that can be achieved through HFTS treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Although the manuscript only tested in ACC, it will also be useful to demonstrate the neural modulation effect on other brain regions. Would 36THz HFTS also robustly modulate activities in other brain regions? Or are different frequencies needed for different brain regions?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We hypothesize that light waves at a frequency of approximately 36 THz effectively modulate neuronal activities in various brain regions, primarily due to their impact on K channels. Additionally, we speculate that the application of THz waves at different frequencies may influence other channels, such as Na and Ca channels, potentially facilitating or inhibiting neuronal activities. We believe this is a fascinating and significant area of research to explore in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Peng et al. presents intriguing data indicating that high-frequency terahertz stimulation (HFTS) of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) can alleviate neuropathic pain behaviors in mice.

Time constants (tau) for the rate of activation and inactivation for Na currents would be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your feedback. We have carefully considered your comments and made several adjustments in the revised Figs. 2b-f to improve clarity and accuracy. Firstly, we have conducted a comparison of the time constants (tau) between the SNI group and the SNI+HFTS group. These time constants represent the latency of Na current activation or inactivation relative to the half-activated/inactivated voltage. Our analysis reveals that there is no statistically significant difference in tau between the two groups for both activation and deactivation curves. Secondly, we have updated the sample traces in Fig. 2b of the revised manuscript. These new traces illustrate that tau does not significantly differ between the SNI and SNI+HFTS groups, providing a visual representation of our findings. We believe that these modifications strengthen the presentation of our study's details and results, making the data more accessible and understandable for readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is unclear why an unpaired t-test was performed for paired data in Figure 2. Also, statistical methods and values for non-significant data should be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. I think you mean the results in Fig. 3. We agree with you that we should use one-way ANOVA to analyze the data since there are more than 2 groups for comparison. We thus re-analyzed the data by using one-way ANOVA in Figs. 3g-k, and have included detailed statistical methods and <italic>P</italic> values in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It would seem logical to perform HFTS on ACC-Pyr neurons in acute slices from sham mice (i.e. Figure 3 scenario). These experiments would be informative given the data presented in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable advice. During the revision process, we performed HFTS on ACC-PYR neurons in acute slices obtained from sham mice. The findings from this experiment have been integrated into the updated Fig. 3, where the sham group is represented by the green line and histogram (the revised Fig. 3 in the manuscript). It is noteworthy that a significant decrease in spike frequency was observed in the sham mice following HFTS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) As the data are presented in Figure 4g, it does not seem as if SNI significantly increased the mean firing rate for ACC-Pyr neurons, which is observed in the slice. The data were analyzed using a paired t-test within each group (sham and SNI), but there is no indication that statistical comparisons across groups were performed. If the argument is that HFTS can restore normal activity of ACC-Pyr neurons following SNI, this is a bit concerning if no significant increase in ACC-Pyr activity is observed in in-vivo recordings from SNI mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting the inaccuracies in the analysis. After reviewing the data, we re-analyzed it using alternative statistical methods. In the revised version, since the data did not follow a normal distribution, we employed Wilcoxon matched-paired signed rank tests within the sham and SNI groups, and Mann-Whitney tests between the sham and SNI groups.</p><p>Upon comparing the statistical outcomes across the groups, we found that the mean firing rate of 130 ACC neurons in SNI mice was significantly higher compared to that of 108 ACC neurons in sham mice (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0447, Mann-Whitney test). Notably, the mean firing rate of ACC-PYR exhibited a more pronounced increase with a <italic>P</italic> value of 0.0274 in SNI pre-HFTS versus sham pre-HFTS, while the mean firing rate of ACC-INT did not display a significant change across the groups. These findings align with the observations we made in the slice, reinforcing the validity of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors indicate that the effects of HFTS are due to changes in Kv1.2. However, they do not directly test this. A blocking peptide or dendrotoxin could be used in voltage clamp recordings to eliminate Kv1.2 current and then test if this eliminates the effects of HFTS. If K current is completely blocked in VC recordings then the authors can claim that currents they are recording are Kv1.1 or 1.2.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your kind suggestion. In our research, we employed the Kv1.2 structure as a model to determine the response frequency of terahertz waves. Through both in vitro and in vivo experiments, we were able to demonstrate that the frequency of approximately 36 THz affects the Kv channel and its corresponding spike frequency. Upon analyzing the action potential waveform, we observed a notable variance in the resting membrane potential (RMP). This RMP is predominantly controlled by leak potassium channels, specifically the Tandem-pore potassium channels. In accordance with the recommendation of reviewer 1, we have addressed this particular aspect of our experimentation in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We agree that we should use blocking peptides or dendrotoxin to eliminate Kv1.2 current. However, we meet problems in purchasing and delivery of the drugs. We thus added some explanation in the Discussion part to emphasize the value for this pharmacological experiment and can further confirm this in the future works.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The ACC is implicated in modulating the aversive aspect of pain. It would be interesting to know whether HFTS could induce conditioned place preference in SNI mice via negative reinforcement (i.e. alleviation of spontaneous pain due to the injury). This would strengthen the clinical relevance of using HFTS in treating pain.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable advice. We share your intrigue regarding this experiment, and we fully recognize the importance and potential of further exploring this area. At present, however, our equipment and platform limitations prevent us from conducting the necessary tests. However, we remain committed to pursuing relevant research opportunities in the future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
