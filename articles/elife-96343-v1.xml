To combat priority pathogens, like <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, the development of novel therapies is of utmost importance. Understanding the molecular alterations induced by medications is critical for the design of multi-targeting treatments capable of eradicating the infection and mitigating its pathogenicity. However, the application of bulk omics approaches for unraveling drug molecular mechanisms of action is limited by their inability to discriminate between target-specific modifications and off-target effects. This study introduces a multi-omics method to overcome the existing limitation. For the first time, the Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration (PISA) assay is utilized in bacteria in the PISA-Express format to link proteome solubility with different and potentially immediate responses to drug treatment, enabling us the resolution to understand target-specific modifications and off-target effects. This study introduces a comprehensive method for understanding drug mechanisms and optimizing the development of multi-targeting antimicrobial therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>target deconvolution</kwd><kwd>multi-omics</kwd><kwd><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic></kwd><kwd>antimicrobial resistance</kwd><kwd>FtsZ</kwd><kwd>CagA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/801586</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maity</surname><given-names>Ritwik</given-names></name><name><surname>Sancho</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013281</institution-id><institution>Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FLAV4AMR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sancho</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOSBRI grant 101004806</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sancho</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2019-107293GB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sancho</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014440</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2022-141068NB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sancho</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010067</institution-id><institution>Gobierno de Aragón</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>E45_23R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sancho</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Like two peas in a pod but not exactly alike, similar molecules targeting the same bacterial protein behave differently, requiring systems biology and target deconvolution to gain better comprehension.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antimicrobial resistance poses a global threat of profound proportions. It is estimated that drug-resistant infections contribute to nearly 5 million deaths every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Murray et al., 2022</xref>). The development of new, ideally narrow-spectrum antibiotics for ‘Priority pathogens’ is one of the key factors in reducing the toll, along with international cooperation, vaccines, and diagnostics. <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> is one of the high-priority pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">World Health Organization, 2017</xref>) in the World Health Organization (WHO) list of bacteria for which new antibiotics are urgently needed. A meta-study published in 2018 has estimated <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection has a prevalence of 44.3% worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zamani et al., 2018</xref>). The eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> is carried out using either triple or quadruple chemotherapy, in which several antibiotics and antimicrobial compounds including bismuth are used in combination with a proton pump inhibitor. A recent meta-analysis from published US studies estimated the individual rate of resistance for clarithromycin, metronidazole (MNZ), and levofloxacin to be higher than 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ho et al., 2022</xref>). This urges the development of new, ideally narrow-spectrum, antibiotics for the treatment of drug-resistant <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Essential metabolic pathways are a vast promising scenario for antimicrobial development. Flavodoxin, urease, menaquinone synthesis enzymes, and respiratory complexes are among the most promising potential disease-specific targets for obtaining narrow-spectrum anti-<italic>H. pylori</italic> agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Salillas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cunha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lettl et al., 2023</xref>). In this study, we have used five compounds developed from a high-throughput screening conducted to identify inhibitors against <italic>H. pylori</italic> flavodoxin (Hp-Fld) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Salillas et al., 2019</xref>). Hp-Fld is an essential protein for <italic>H. pylori</italic>, and it is not present in humans as an independent protein, which makes it a preferred candidate for anti-<italic>H. pylori</italic> drug development. The selected compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) derive from 4-nitrobenzoxadiazole (IV and IVj) or 4-amine benzoxadiazole (IVa and IVk) and differ in terms of solubility and antimicrobial specificity spectrum. IVb is a hydrophobic analog not having a benzoxadiazole moiety.</p><p>The identification of the modes of action of new potential drugs is a major challenge in the chemical systems biology of diseases and there are numerous bioactive compounds (including approved drugs) whose mechanisms of action remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Iwata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Santos et al., 2017</xref>). Whether identifying the mode of action of a new antibiotic is a medical priority can be debated. However, a mechanistic understanding at the molecular level is of immense benefit to its future development as a drug. The mode of action of an antibiotic is generally classified depending on the interaction with its target, which is often a protein essential for maintaining bacterial viability. However, as with any drug, an antibiotic may interact not only with its primary target but also with other unexpected targets in the bacterium or the host (off-targets) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Heppler et al., 2022</xref>). This may cause unforeseen side effects that, although typically undesired, may occasionally enable new therapeutic indications.</p><p>Target-based drug discovery pipelines rely on in vitro screening protocols mostly monitoring drug–target (usually a protein) binding or concomitant changes in protein stability. Despite their scalability and adaptivity, these protocols may or may not accurately represent the drug’s target and off-target interactions in vivo. Recent developments in omics techniques can provide a molecular-level view of drug-induced changes in cellular processes. The robustness of omics techniques in pathway prediction has been demonstrated and a wide range of life science fields increasingly rely on them. Compared to conventional approaches, omics techniques provide a more holistic molecular perspective on biological systems. While large-scale omics data are becoming more accessible, and multi-omics studies are more frequent, multi-omics integration of data remains challenging. Here, we propose a post-analysis data integration method for pathway prediction and validation of the mechanism of action of Hp-Fld inhibitors. It is a long‐standing knowledge that, when heated, proteins denature and generally become insoluble, and interaction with small molecules can induce changes in the thermal stability and solubility of proteins. Thermal shift assay (TSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Molina et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mateus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Peng et al., 2016</xref>) utilizes this knowledge to understand drug–protein interaction by observing the target’s melting temperature shift upon drug treatment. However, when the target is uncertain or the mechanism is to be elucidated, the use of omics techniques must consider different angles to be able to deconvolute changes in the system as a whole upon drug treatment. The deconvolution of unknown targets using TSA-based proteomics approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Molina et al., 2013</xref>) shows some technical biases and a limited throughput to be able to compare multiple drugs in a significant number of biological replicates and to be able to integrate other omics approaches. To address those issues, we adopt here an approach based on the unbiased and high-throughput target deconvolution method known as the Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration (PISA) assay in the PISA-Express format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gaetani and Zubarev, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gaetani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sabatier et al., 2021</xref>). It is based on the fact that protein targets, as well as other early mechanistic proteins, may undergo changes in solubility as a result of drug binding or changes in related molecular interactions and macro complexes within a cell.</p><p>The information obtained on the protein targets of the individual compounds has been utilized to filter the differential expression data from proteomics and transcriptomics, aiming to identify the most influenced pathways. Subsequently, we validated selected pathways at a functional level.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Changes in transcriptomics and proteomics landscape, and associated gene ontology</title><p>Our investigation into understanding the mode of action of nitro-benzoxadiazole compounds commenced with a comparison of the conventional transcriptional and translational changes induced by these compounds, the vehicle control (DMSO) dimethyl sulfoxide, and the commercially used drug MNZ. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and expressional proteomics were employed to identify transcriptional and translational changes, respectively. A total of 771 differentially expressed transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and 113 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) differentially expressed proteins were selected using a linear model fitting analysis followed by a cutoff-based selection. Overall, we have achieved more than 90% of genomic coverage and more than 25% of the transcripts and 10% of the proteins were found to be differentially expressed upon treatment except for Compound IVk, which exhibited 372 differentially expressed proteins in spite of the fact that only 11 transcripts showed differential expression at a p-value of 0.001 and 175 at a p-value of 0.05. Lack of correlation between mRNA and protein expressions has been reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bathke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Haider and Pal, 2013</xref>). It has been related to differences in half-lives, post-transcription machinery, and transcriptional and translational decoupling in bacteria. The differentially expressed <italic>H. pylori</italic> transcripts in the presence of the individual drugs were investigated using gene set enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–G</xref>).</p><p>We compared transcriptomics and proteomics data for the lead Compound IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and found 174 common IDs (gene or protein). These IDs show enrichment in gene ontology (GO) terms ‘Protein containing complex’, ‘Cellular anatomical entity’, ‘Proton-transporting ATP synthase complex’, and ‘Non-membrane-bounded organelle’. Two GO terms, ‘Metabolic process (GO:0008152)’ and ‘Organonitrogen compound biosynthetic process (GO:1901566)’, are present in all compounds except for Compound IVk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Some analogies for pairs of compounds sharing either the nitro, the amine group, or the polar moiety stand out. For example, the ‘Proton-transporting ATP synthase complex (GO:0045259)’ is found in the nitro-containing Compound IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), while its soluble derivative, Compound IVj, is the only compound containing the ‘ATP metabolic process (GO:0046034)’ and ‘ATP synthesis coupled proton transport (GO:0015986)’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting IVj exerts a specific effect on ATP production and utilization. ATP-synthase-related functions are thus relevant in the two closely related nitro compounds tested. On the other hand, both Compound IVa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and its soluble derivative IVk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) share the ontology term related to gene expression (GO:0010467), highlighting their potential alteration of this biological process. The GO term ‘cellular process (GO:0009987)’ is present in the sets of the two relatively more soluble compounds: IVj and IVk. This ontology covers a broad range of cellular processes, including cell-to-cell communication. The gene ontologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) associated to Compound IVb – the hydrophobic compound lacking the nitro/amine-benzoxadiazole moiety – are related to those of IVa, sharing several GO terms related to metabolic processes, nitrogen compound biosynthesis, and organonitrogen compound biosynthesis. Additionally, IVb includes GO terms related to heterocycle biosynthesis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Changes in the transcriptomics and proteomics landscape, along with the associated gene ontology.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) These panels highlight the common genes and proteins associated with individual compounds, with different colors indicating the distribution of these genes and proteins across various gene ontology terms.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-96343-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Compounds used in the assay and the study design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The compounds used in this assay were selected from a high-throughput screening that aimed to identify flavodoxin binders from a diverse chemical library of 10,000 compounds. Through several rounds of chemical variation and efficacy testing, a family of novel nitrobenzoxadiazol-based antimicrobials emerged, with Compound IV as the lead compound. Compounds IVj and IVk are more soluble derivatives of Compound IV, and IVa is a derivative of Compound IV with an amine functionality. The compounds bearing an amine functionality are narrow-spectrum antimicrobials that exhibit high specificity against <italic>H. pylori</italic> and potentially other gastric <italic>Helicobacter</italic> species but not enterohepatic <italic>Helicobacter</italic> species.

Very few techniques have demonstrated the ability to identify targets at a system biology level. Here, the PISA assay has been used to identify intracellular targets for Compound IV and its derivatives. This is the first time PISA assay, in the form of PISA-Express, has been successfully performed in living bacterial cells, with protocols adapted and modified from previous PISA studies in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sabatier et al., 2021</xref>). The experimental procedure involved exposing the bacteria to two different drug concentrations for 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Afterwards, the cells in each sample were treated and split in two parts: one part was subjected to a temperature gradient and the other one was left without heating. Then, the soluble proteins were identified and quantified using mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Because of the fast-doubling time of bacteria and related proteome expression changes even in a short time of incubation with compounds, the PISA assay was used in the PISA-Express form where PISA results on protein soluble amounts are normalized pairwise on the total protein abundance changes of the same samples relative to controls of PISA and expression assay.</p><p>We have observed several notable trends in the alteration of protein solubility.

Compounds IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>) and IVa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>) specifically change the solubility of CagA and HP_0542, while Compound IVj (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G, H</xref>) changes the solubility HP_0543 in addition to CagA. Only Compound IVb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>) changes the solubility of all three of these proteins. It is worth mentioning that, like other thermal proteome profiling-based assays, PISA assay can identify changes in the solubility of specific target proteins and in that of the protein partners of their complex, as well as any other changes of solubility due to the altered complex formation and post-translational modifications. Changes in the solubility of multiple proteins within a specific complex strengthen the correlation between the drug and the complex itself. On the other hand, our PISA analysis has identified two proteins, FtsA and FtsZ, associated with the Z-ring formation in cell division that are affected by the compounds. Inhibition of Z ring formation has been a proven target for antimicrobial development. The orally bioavailable methylbenzamide antibiotic TXA-709 and its active metabolite TXA-707 target FtsZ and have been tested (Phase I) against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lepak et al., 2015</xref>). Compounds IV and IVb show a clear concentration-dependent targeting of both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, C</xref>), while FtsZ and FtsA are additionally targeted by Compounds IVa and IVj, respectively, albeit without a clear concentration dependency. Another target shared among several compounds is the chaperone protein trigger factor (Tig), which plays a crucial role in facilitating proper protein folding and is indispensable for the survival of bacterial cells. The solubility of this protein has been altered by all the compounds except IVk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I, J</xref>) in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, D, E</xref>). The possibility of Tig interacting with other proteins destabilized by the drug, along with the influence of the heat gradient during the PISA assay, may introduce potential noise in the data. Further investigation is required to confirm the interaction of the drug with Tig.</p><p>We have also identified a few compound-specific proteins having altered stability. Compound IV strongly altered DNA-PolA and HP_1142, which function as DNA helicases, contributing to DNA replication and repair. Compounds IV and IVa altered the stability of PanD and CarA, which are both involved in the pantothenate biosynthesis pathway. Compound IVj targeted ArsR, HP_0543, HP_0853, LigA, and RpsE, involved in interesting pathways. LigA is essential for DNA replication and repair while ArsR is a member of the two-component system ArsS/ArsR that regulates genes involved in biofilm formation and acid adaptation. Compound IVk is the only compound for which we could not detect any statistically significant altered protein with an adjusted p-value (adj.P.Val) of 0.001. However, Compound IVk altered stability of several proteins with a relatively low adj.P.Val (0.005), as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I, J</xref>.

The 20 common essential targets are mostly associated with cell division (e.g., FtsZ), small subunit ribosomal proteins (RspC, RspE, RspL, RplE, and InfC). Furthermore, we identified a few unique changes for Compound IV (DnaN, involved in DNA tethering and processivity of DNA polymerases, and C694_06445, which could be a functional equivalent of delta subunit of DNA polymerase III).

In the case of Compound IVa, no modules were found to have a significant p-value. Therefore, we relied on correlation strength and analyzed the modules ‘brown’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), ‘magenta’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>), and ‘purple’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>) in relation to this compound. Notably, we observed a very similar regulation of CagA in the case of Compound IVa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>) when compared to Compound IV. However, the downregulation of FtsY was not observed in this instance. Instead, we observed PolA and RecN as targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). It is worth mentioning that a single protein can be shared by closely related modules; in this instance, FtsA is present in both the modules ‘brown’ and ‘pink’. Compound IVb shows a significant correlation with the module ‘pink’. We have detected FtsA as a potential target for Compound IVb and in this analysis multiple proteins related to RNA processing, and associated with FtsA were found downregulated in this module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Compound IVj shows five correlated modules and three of them are very similarly regulated modules compared to Compound IV. In module ‘brown’, we have detected six potential targets which include FtsA, PolA, and CagA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Finally, while we have not detected any targets in module ‘pink’ or ‘brown’ associated with Compound IVk, FtsA is upregulated in both modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2F, G</xref>).</p><p>Compound IV does not have any target in the module ‘magenta’, but RimP, which is involved in 30S ribosomal subunit maturation, is prominently downregulated in this module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The module ‘black’ associated with this compound contains Tig, which is involved in facilitating proper protein folding, as a target. Tig downregulates multiple proteins associated closely with S12 ribosomal protein of the 30S subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>) indicating its involvement in stabilization of ribosomal protein. In the Compound IVa-associated module ‘magenta’, we identified ObgE, which is an essential GTPase, as a target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). However, no specific target was detected for the module ‘purple’, except for FliG, which is the flagellar motor switch protein. This protein was found to be downregulated with Compound IVa treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Protein ObgE is also one of the prominent candidate targets associated with Compounds IVb and IVj in the module ‘magenta’ and we have detected the downregulation of multiple proteins related to ABC transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B, D</xref>). We have not identified any significant targets in the modules ‘purple’, ‘greenyellow’, and ‘red’ that associate with Compound IVb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I, J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and modules ‘purple’, ‘black’, and ‘greenyellow’ which associate with IVj (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). In the case of Compound IVk, we have detected four highly correlated modules, including the module ‘turquoise’, which is unique to this compound. Within these modules, we have identified seven potential targets, including helicase, RnhA, and GTPase Era (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Module ‘turquoise’ is highly associated with gene expression, and the imbalance in differential transcripts and proteins may indicate transcriptional and translational decoupling, warranting further study for confirmation. Additionally, in modules ‘brown’ and ‘red’, we have identified two potential targets as hypothetical proteins associated with Compound IVk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2F–H</xref>). In several of our studies, Compound IVk, which has a higher MIC, exhibits markedly different behavior. This difference in behavior may stem from different sources, including intercellular availability, inactivation inside the cell, or loss of target specificity. Multiple studies have previously demonstrated that there is only a 30% chance for a structurally similar compound to have similar biological activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Martin et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Biophysical assays to validate changes in targeted pathway</title><p>Elucidation of the mode of action of antimicrobial drugs has evolved in recent years. There is still considerable debate related to the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their link to DNA damage in bactericidal drug-mediated antimicrobial activity. The investigation of the role of ROS as an overarching mode for bactericidal drug-mediated antimicrobial activity has led to some conflicting evidence either showing a common link between ROS and bactericidal drug-mediated antimicrobial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kohanski et al., 2007</xref>), or demonstrating that the bactericidal activity does not depend on ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Keren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu and Imlay, 2013</xref>). As our group of compounds exhibits a bactericidal behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), we have looked for evidence of ROS generation. Compound IV and its derivatives cause a marked increase in ROS generation when compared to the control (DMSO). Though a degree of heterogenicity is expected due to the cellular stages, distribution and penetration of the drug at an early phase, Compounds IV and IVj exhibit a broader change in ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This indicates that the nitro-bearing groups have a higher propensity to generate ROS. We have also observed that the genes associated with the generation of ROS are significantly overexpressed for Compounds IV, IVb, IVj, and MNZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As described above and depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, multiple DNA damage repair proteins and genes are downregulated in the presence of Compounds IV, IVb, IVj, and MNZ. Additionally, DNA PolA was found to be a major target for Compound IVj. Following these results, we investigated compound-induced DNA damage using the APO BrdU TUNEL assay.

Modes of action of antibacterial compounds have been typically investigated using targeted experiments focusing on specific cellular processes or pathways, which may not capture the full complexity of antibacterial effects or potential resistance mechanisms. Our results show that multi-omics investigation combined with PISA is a useful tool for the discovery of new previously undetected drug-associated potential targets and for the validation of previously described ones.</p><p>We have used here a series of drugs that were initially developed to block Hp-Fld in vitro to showcase a multi-omics-based method for pathway deconvolution that can overcome two main challenges in pathway discovery. First, the detection of new potential targets for feature tailoring of an existing molecule, and second, the validation of the intracellular potential targets previously intended for a specific drug. Traditionally, the antimicrobial drug discovery process focused on identifying essential genes and proteins which could be targeted by inhibitory drugs discovered by phenotype screening. However, there is growing interest in non-essential genes or proteins involved in virulence, quorum sensing, biofilm formation, or immune response evasion. This study identifies four out of our five compounds that induce significant change in the solubility of CagA, the major virulence factor of <italic>H. pylori</italic>. The network analysis of CagA-associated proteins indicates systemic regulation and opens up new possibilities for exploring the efficacy of these drugs in the regulation of the type four secretion system. Nonetheless, all our compounds, except for Compound IVk, additionally target multiple essential proteins. Among the most promising ones is FtsZ, a prominent target in three out of the five compounds tested. Although FtsA has not been categorized as essential, there is direct evidence for the localization of this protein at the cell division site. Along with FtsZ, we have identified FtsA as a potential target for Compounds IV, IVb, and IVj. Our investigation into the systemic changes induced by this interaction spread across the WGCNA module ‘brown’ and module ‘pink’. In the case of Compounds IV and IVj, we have observed a positive correlation with module ‘brown’, and for Compound IVb, a positive correlation with module ‘pink’. Another essential protein target that has been detected across the board is AtpD, a protein belonging to the ATP-synthase complex. In the case of Compound IVj, we have detected four other potential targets from the ATP-synthase complex, namely AtpB, AtpC, AtpF, and AtpG along with AtpD. This poses IVj as a potentially effective ATP-synthase blocker. The ability of IV and IVj to inhibit ATP synthesis has been confirmed and demonstrated by a significant reduction in ATP production (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the validation of the pre-defined target flavodoxin, it is paramount to mention that some targets exhibit very limited shifts in solubility changes upon drug binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Molina et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sabatier et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Savitski et al., 2014</xref>), making the detection of the target difficult at a statistically significant level. In this regard, we have observed shifts in the solubility of flavodoxin for all the compounds, however, only in the case of Compound IVj the change was statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Other limitations of the target discovery process are the poor knowledge of the binding affinity of the compounds to their relative targets and the lack of any structural information about the potential binding site(s). At the methodological level, this research exemplifies the improved resolution of multi-omics data processing through the incorporation of the target deconvolution method. In summary, the study elucidates how the amalgamation of various techniques can foster a comprehensive grasp of intracellular events, thereby aiding in the advancement of antimicrobial drug development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Culturing of <italic>H. pylori</italic></title><p><italic>H. pylori</italic> (ATCC 700392) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA).

To reproduce the biological condition in the stomach, where oxygen levels are relatively low this assay was conducted under hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abass et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>H. pylori</italic> cells were cultured in BHI at 37°C (HypoxicLab, Oxford Optronic-95% N<sub>2</sub>, 5% O<sub>2</sub>, 10% CO<sub>2</sub>, 20% humidity), then transferred into the Don Whitley (i2 workstation) hypoxic chamber (95% N<sub>2</sub>, 5% O<sub>2</sub>, 20% humidity), where cellular OCR was measured.</p><p>The sensor cartridge for Seahorse was hydrated at 37°C a day before each experiment, following the manufacturer’s instructions, under hypoxic conditions. Before cell seeding, the Seahorse 96-well plates were coated by adding 20 μl of a 1× collagen solution in each well, which was prepared from a 20× stock type I solution (Sigma C3867-1VL). After 1 hr, the collagen solution was removed, and the wells were left to dry under a laminar flow hood. The last column of the plate was not coated since it contained the medium alone to allow the addition of sodium sulfite (VWR 0628-500g) during the run. Sodium sulfite (100 mM final concentration) was used as a chemical oxygen scavenger to provide a ‘zero’ oxygen reference. Coating plus medium was used to measure the environmental oxygen levels as a reference during the experiment. The injection ports containing the different stressors/additives (i.e., 10× DMSO, 10× stock drugs, or 10× sulfite) were loaded (20 μl per well) in the Seahorse chamber, 1 hr before the Seahorse run.</p><p>Exponentially growing <italic>H. pylori</italic> cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 4000 rpm) and resuspended in the growth chamber with Seahorse medium (supplemented with 10 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate, and 2 mM glutamine, following the manufacturer’s instructions) to achieve a final OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6. The cells were then seeded on the collagen-coated plate (180 μl per well), except for the last column, and vortexed. After a Seahorse calibration run, the cell plate was loaded into the instrument following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p><p>Measurements were set as follows: 3 min of mixing, where the plate well was allowed to exchange gases with the hypoxic environment, followed by 3 min of measurements. During the 3-min measurement, the 96 probes protruding from the lid were automatically inserted into the cell plate, creating a microchamber per well. This transiently sealed microchamber allowed the instrument to measure the oxygen consumption carried out by the cell monolayer without any gas exchange with the environment. After six baseline measurements, the drug/sulfite was automatically added to each well, as indicated. Kinetics were considered for the first hour to avoid any bias due to cell stress or excessive metabolic activity.</p><p>To compare the different OCR obtained from independent experiments, relative values have been used as follows: OCR of each sample (with six replicates) at 60 min was related to the basal OCR and compared with the same ratio obtained with the sole DMSO (as the untreated reference sample). Values are the means of the replicates ± standard deviation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-96343-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Dataset for publication: Merging Multi-OMICs with Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration Unveils Antibiotic Mode of Action [Dataset].

A few points listed below require further clarification:</p><p>(1) Compounds IVk exhibits markedly different behavior compared to the other compounds. The authors are encouraged to discuss these findings in the context of existing literature or chemical principles.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We have added the following paragraph (Page No-13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>“In several of our studies, compound IVk, which has a higher MIC, exhibits markedly different behavior. This difference in behavior may stem from different sources, including intercellular availability, inactivation inside the cell, or loss of target specificity. Multiple studies have previously demonstrated that there is only a 30% chance for a structurally similar compound to have similar biological activity32.”</italic></p><p>(2) The incubation me for treating H. pylori with the drugs was set at 4 hours for transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, compared to 20 min for PISA analysis. The authors need to explain the reason for these differences in treatment duration.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now explained in Pages 17 and 19, where the following paragraphs have been included</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>“The target deconvolution method aims to evaluate the initial interaction with intracellular proteins. We selected a 20-minute time point based on intracellular ROS generation (not shown). It is a well-reported phenomenon that bactericidal drugs induce early production of ROS.”</italic></p><p><italic>“The incubation time for transcriptomics and proteomics assays was determined based on the Time-Kill Curves assay (Fig. 6(A)). The 4-hour time point shows a significant amount of cell death compared to the control population.”</italic></p><p>(3) The PISA method facilitates the identification of proteins stabilized by drug treatment. DnaJ and Trigger factor (g), well-known molecular chaperones, prevent protein aggregation under stress. Their enrichment in the soluble fraction is expected and does not necessarily indicate direct stabilization by the drugs. The possibility that their stabilization results from binding to other proteins destabilized by the drugs should be considered. To prevent any misunderstanding, the authors should clarify that their methodology does not solely identify direct targets. Instead, the combination of their findings sheds light on various pathways affected by the treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>This is also a very valuable observation. We now clearly state that in new paragraphs at Pages 8 and 13</p><p><italic>Another target shared among several compounds is the chaperone protein trigger factor (Tig), which plays a crucial role in facilitating proper protein folding and is indispensable for the survival of bacterial cells. The solubility of this protein has been altered by all the compounds except IVk (Fig. 2(I-J)) in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. S4(B, D, and E)). The possibility of Tig interacting with other proteins destabilized by the drug, along with the influence of the heat gradient during the PISA assay, may introduce potential noise in the data. Further investigation is required to confirm the interaction of the drug with Tig.</italic></p><p><italic>“The module “black” associated with this compound contains Tig, which is involved in facilitating proper protein folding, as a target, and it down-regulates multiple proteins associated closely with S12 ribosomal protein of the 30S subunit (Fig. S9(D)) indicating its involvement in stabilization of ribosomal protein.”</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) At the end of the manuscript, the authors conclude that four compounds &quot;strongly interact with CagA&quot;. However, detailed molecule/protein interaction studies are necessary to definitively support this claim. The authors should exercise caution in their statement. As the authors mentioned, additional research (not mandated in the scope of this current paper) is necessary to determine the drug's binding affinity to the proposed targets.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the sentence (Page -15) to say:</p><p><italic>“This study identifies four out of our five compounds that induce significant change in the solubility of CagA, the major virulence factor of H. pylori.”</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors should clarify the PISA-Express approach over standard PISA. A detailed explanation of the differences between both methods in the main text is important.</p></disp-quote><p>This was already explained in Page 5 (no changes have been made)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work has an important and ambitious goal: understanding the effects of drugs, in this case antimicrobial molecules, from a holistic perspective. This means that the effect of drugs on a group of genes and whole metabolic pathways is unveiled, rather than its immediate effect on a protein target only. To achieve this goal the authors successfully implement the PISA-Express method (Protein Integral Solubility Alteration), using combined transcriptomics, proteomics, and drug-induced changes in protein stability to retrieve a large number of genes and proteins affected by the used compounds. The compounds used in the study (compound IVa, IVb, IVj, and IVk) were all derived from the precursors compound IV, they are effective against Helicobacter pylori, and their mode of action on clusters of genes and proteins has been compared to the one of the known pylori drug metronidazole (MNZ). Due to this comparison, and confirmed by the diversity of responses induced by these very similar compounds, it can be understood that the approach used is reliable and very informative. Notably, although all compound IV derivatives were designed to target pylori Flavodoxin (Fld), only one showed a statically significant shift of Fld solubility (compound IVj, FIG S11). For most other compounds, instead, the involvement of other possible targets affecting diverse metabolic pathways was also observed, notably concerning a series of genes with other important functions: CagA (virulence factor), FtsY/FtsA (cell division), AtpD (ATP-synthase complex), the essential GTPase ObgE, Tig (protein export), as well as other proteins involved in ribosomal synthesis, chemotaxis/motility and DNA replication/repairs. Finally, for all tested molecules, in vivo functional data have been collected that parallel the omics predictions, comforting them and showing that compound IV derivatives differently affect cellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxygen consumption rates (OCR), DNA damage, and ATP synthesis.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The approach used is very potent in retrieving the effects of chemically active molecules (in this case antimicrobial ones) on whole cells, evidencing protein and gene networks that are involved in cell sensitivity to the studied molecules. The choice of these compounds against H. pylori is perfect, showcasing how different the real biological response is, compared to the hypothetical one. In fact, although all molecules were retrieved based on their activity on Fld, the authors unambiguously show that large unexpected gene clusters may, and in fact are, affected by these compounds, and each of them in different manners.</p><p>Impact:</p><p>The present work is the first report relying on PISA-Express performed on living bacterial cells. Because of its findings, this work will certainly have a high impact on the way we design research to develop effective drugs, allowing us to understand the fine effects of a drug on gene clusters, drive molecule design towards specific metabolic pathways, and eventually better plan the combination of multiple active molecules for drug formulation. Beyond this, however, we expect this article to impact other related and unrelated fields of research as well. The same holistic approaches might also allow gaining deep, and sometimes unexpected, insight into the cellular targets involved in drug side effects, drug resistance, toxicity, and cellular adaptation, in fields beyond the medicinal one, such as cellular biology and environmental studies on pollutants.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Please modify these few concerns:</p><p>- It is unclear from the introduction and discussion whether conventional transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have previously been conducted on the compounds examined in this study. If only targeted studies have been performed please clarify this further.</p></disp-quote><p>To make it more clear, we have added the following paragraph in Page 5:</p><p><italic>“Our investigation into understanding the mode of action of nitro-benzoxadiazole compounds commenced with a comparison of the conventional transcriptional and translational changes induced by these compounds, the vehicle control (DMSO), and the commercially used drug MNZ. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and expressional proteomics were employed to identify transcriptional and translational changes, respectively.”</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The decision to monitor the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) is based on the hypothesis that the drugs would impact flavodoxins function. Could the authors cite specific studies that suggest a reduction in flavodoxin leads to decreased OCR that can be measured?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct to say that we have done this study based on our hypothesis that a reduction in flavodoxin may lead to decreased OCR. To our knowledge, there is no previous studies indicating that so we now clearly state (Page 14) that it is our hypothesis.</p><p><italic>“On the other hand, given that these drugs indicated involvement of multiple factors from the electron transport chain including flavodoxin and we observed significant drop in the ATP production rate (Fig. 6(D)) associated to compounds IV and IVj, we have investigated the changes in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as we hypothesize that a reduction in soluble flavodoxin could lead to decreased OCR”</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Increase font size in some figures and supplemental materials for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewer's comment and have addressed it to the best possible extent in the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Correct figure references throughout the text (example of mistake p4, Fig S1D, p6 S1C).</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the figure references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Check spelling errors, for example, Figure S1B: &quot;library preparation&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the figures and corrected spelling errors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Ensure H. pylori is in italics.</p></disp-quote><p>Done!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure S4: Replace (D) by (E).</p></disp-quote><p>Done!

The modified part now reads:</p><p><italic>…This indicates that the nitro-bearing groups have a higher propensity to generate ROS. We have also observed that the genes associated with the generation of ROS are significantly overexpressed for compounds IV, IVb, IVj, and MNZ (Fig. S12(A)). As described above and depicted in Fig. S12(B), multiple DNA damage repair proteins and genes are down-regulated in the presence of compounds IV, IVb, IVj, and MNZ. Additionally, DNA PolA was found to be a major target for compound IVj. Following these results, we investigated compound-induced DNA damage using the APO BrdU TUNEL assay. All the compounds, particularly IV and IVj, caused significant DNA damage (Fig. 6(C)).</italic></p><p><italic>On the other hand, given that these drugs indicated involvement of multiple factors from the electron transport chain including flavodoxin and we observed significant drop in the ATP production rate (Fig. 6(D)) associated to compounds IV and IVj, we have investigated the changes in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as we hypothesize that a reduction in soluble flavodoxin could lead to decreased OCR.
