muscle and insulin resistance is unclear. Here, we used fixed and live-cell imaging to study microtubule-based GLUT4 trafficking in human and mouse muscle fibers and L6 rat muscle cells. We found GLUT4 localized on the microtubules in mouse and human muscle fibers. Pharmacological microtubule disruption using Nocodazole (Noco) prevented long-range GLUT4 trafficking and depleted GLUT4-enriched structures at microtubule nucleation sites in a fully reversible manner. Using a perifused muscle-on-a-chip system to enable real-time glucose uptake measurements in isolated mouse skeletal muscle fibers, we observed that Noco maximally disrupted the microtubule network after 5 min without affecting insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In contrast, a 2-hr Noco treatment markedly decreased insulin responsiveness of glucose uptake. Insulin resistance in mouse muscle fibers induced either in vitro by C2 ceramides or in vivo by diet-induced obesity, impaired microtubule-based GLUT4 trafficking. Transient knockdown of the microtubule motor protein kinesin-1 protein KIF5B in L6 muscle cells reduced insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation while pharmacological kinesin-1 inhibition in incubated mouse muscles strongly impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Thus, in adult skeletal muscle fibers, the microtubule network is essential for intramyocellular GLUT4 movement, likely functioning to maintain an insulin-responsive cell surface recruitable GLUT4 pool via kinesin-1-mediated trafficking.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>GLUT4</kwd><kwd>insulin

Insulin-resistant human and rodent muscle exhibit impaired insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zierath et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">King et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Etgen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garvey et al., 1998</xref>) and muscle-specific deletion of GLUT4 is sufficient to cause systemic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zisman et al., 2000</xref>). However, the details of GLUT4 regulation – particularly in adult skeletal muscle – and the causes of skeletal muscle insulin resistance remain unclear. In L6 myoblasts and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin resistance not only decreases insulin-stimulated GLUT4 recruitment to the surface membrane, but also affects the distribution of GLUT4 between intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foley and Klip, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that disturbed intracellular sorting of GLUT4 contributes to peripheral insulin resistance.</p><p>Motor protein-mediated trafficking on the microtubule cytoskeleton is well established to allow long-range transport of a diverse assortment of molecules and to position intracellular organelles and membrane structures in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Forges et al., 2012</xref>). For GLUT4, long-range microtubule-dependent GLUT4 movement beneath the plasma membrane has been observed in adipocyte cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lizunov et al., 2005</xref>) and similar long-range movement was also seen in adult rodent skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lizunov et al., 2012</xref>). A requirement for microtubule-based protein trafficking is supported by several observations in cultured cells. Microtubule disruption dispersed perinuclear GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guilherme et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fletcher et al., 2000</xref>) as well as L6 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foley and Klip, 2014</xref>) and impaired GLUT4 membrane insertion in some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foley and Klip, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fletcher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emoto et al., 2001</xref>) but not all studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Molero et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shigematsu et al., 2002</xref>). Neither the requirement of microtubules for intracellular GLUT4 positioning and trafficking nor the influence of insulin resistance on microtubules and/or microtubule-based GLUT4 trafficking have been investigated in adult skeletal muscle fibers.</p><p>Therefore, we presently characterized various aspects of microtubule-based GLUT4 trafficking in predominantly adult human and mouse skeletal muscle. Our findings suggest that an intact microtubule network is required for KIF5B-mediated intracellular GLUT4 movement and maintaining insulin-responsive glucose uptake, and that impaired microtubule-based GLUT4 trafficking is a feature of skeletal muscle insulin resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GLUT4 was enriched at microtubule nucleation sites and traveled on microtubule filaments in adult mouse and human muscle</title><p>To study the involvement of microtubules in GLUT4 trafficking, we first used structured illumination microscopy to image the subsarcolemmal (up to 4 µm into the muscle fiber) microtubule network and GLUT4 in mouse and human skeletal muscle at super-resolution. Due to amenability for live fiber isolation we used flexor digitorum brevis (FDB), a muscle consisting predominantly of type IIa and IIx fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tarpey et al., 2018</xref>), from mice and vastus lateralis, a highly mixed muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Staron, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horwath et al., 2021</xref>), from humans. In both mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) muscle, we observed GLUT4 to be localized on microtubule filaments and to be enriched at microtubule filament intersections, previously identified as microtubule nucleation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oddoux et al., 2013</xref>). Next, to study GLUT4 movement in live muscle fibers, we overexpressed GLUT4-7myc-GFP (GLUT4-GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bogan et al., 2001</xref>) alone or together with mCherry-Tubulin in mouse FDB muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). GLUT4-GFP was localized in the same pattern as endogenous GLUT4 and observed along the microtubule network, including on the more stable subpopulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bulinski and Gundersen, 1991</xref>) of detyrosinated microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) implicated in trafficking of lipid droplets, mitochondria, and autophagosomes in other cells types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mohan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Herms et al., 2015</xref>), as well as on mCherry-Tubulin-labeled microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Live-imaging revealed long-range lateral directional movement of GLUT4 along filamentous tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), corresponding to mCherry-Tubulin containing microtubule filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). The GLUT4 structures occasionally exhibited long tubular morphology (&gt;2 µm) but were mostly minor tubular structures or spheres (size varying from ~0.4 μm<sup>2</sup> down to the unresolvable) observed to undergo budding and fusion events on the microtubule tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). Live-imaging, including fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments, revealed particularly dynamic and bidirectional movement at the microtubule nucleation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). Collectively, a portion of GLUT4 localized to microtubule nucleation sites and on microtubule filaments in adult mouse and human skeletal muscle.

Insulin (30 nM) stimulation increased insulin signaling at the level of Akt Thr308 as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and the microtubule depolymerizing compound Nocodazole (Noco) (13 µM) significantly reduced both the total and the Noco-resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khawaja et al., 1988</xref>) detyrosinated pool of polymerized microtubules by ~90% and ~50%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). We did not observe any significant increase in GLUT4 movement on microtubules upon insulin stimulation but GLUT4 movement was completely prevented by microtubule depolymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Having established that GLUT4 trafficking was dependent on the microtubule network, we next tested if microtubule disruption affected the overall GLUT4 localization and distribution between different compartments. For quantification, we divided the GLUT4 structures into size categories corresponding to (1) large structures at the microtubule nucleation sites (&gt;4 µm<sup>2</sup>), (2) intermediate endomembrane structures (0.4–4 µm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gruenberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>), and (3) the smallest resolvable endomembrane structures (&lt;0.4 µm<sup>2</sup>) including presumably insulin-responsive GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Microtubule disruption by Noco (13 µM) drained the GLUT4 structures at the microtubule nucleation sites and reduced the amount of the smallest structures, while causing an increase in the intermediate structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). These changes were reversed within 9 hr after removal of Noco (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Within the smallest category, there was a shift toward fewer but larger area GLUT4 membrane structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The total number and area of GLUT4 structures did not differ between conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). In a previous study in L6 myoblasts, microtubule disruption prevented pre-internalized GLUT4 from reaching a Syntaxin6-positive perinuclear subcompartment involved in GSV biogenesis and from undergoing insulin-responsive exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foley and Klip, 2014</xref>). We therefore tested in adult muscle, if microtubule disruption similarly prevented accumulation in a perinuclear Syntaxin6-positive subcompartment. However, we observed a limited and Noco-insensitive (in mice) co-localization of Syntaxin6 with either endogenous GLUT4 in human and mouse skeletal muscle, or fluorescent GLUT4-EOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lizunov et al., 2013</xref>) in mouse skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>).

In brief, this chip continuously measures glucose concentration in perifusate post muscle fiber exposure, allowing the estimation of glucose uptake over time. We confirmed the ability of the chip to measure glucose uptake in skeletal muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). Specifically, the chip measured glucose uptake in isolated FDB fibers at ~5 µM glucose concentration sensitivity (defined as a registered fluctuation of thrice the standard deviation [SD] of the baseline measurements) and a temporal resolution of &lt;4 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>). Noco (13 µM) caused complete microtubule disruption in FDB fibers within 5 min similar to a 2-hr treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, acute microtubule disruption (5 min Noco) affected neither basal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I</xref>) nor insulin-induced muscle glucose uptake, whereas 2 hr treatment by Noco or colchicine (25 µM), another microtubule network disrupter, completely blocked insulin-induced muscle glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>). Notably, GLUT4-containing large membrane structures corresponding mainly to microtubule nucleation sites were already reduced after 5 min of Noco exposure, whereas accumulation of GLUT4 in intermediate- and small-sized membrane structures was only observed after 2 hr of Noco exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H</xref>). Thus, an intact microtubule network is not required for the immediate insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation response in adult skeletal muscle fibers. However, prolonged disruption of the microtubule network causes a more pronounced missorting of GLUT4 and renders skeletal muscle unresponsive to insulin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>KIF5B-containing kinesin-1 motor proteins regulate muscle GLUT4 trafficking</title><p>Next we investigated which motor protein(s) mediate microtubule-dependent GLUT4 trafficking in skeletal muscle.

In both soleus and EDL muscle, 2 hr of kinesore (50 μM) exposure strongly impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) without affecting p-Akt Ser473 and slightly increased basal and insulin-stimulated p-TBC1D4 Thr642 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). AMPK is an insulin-independent stimulator of GLUT4 translocation which may indirectly stimulate TBC1D4 Thr642 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kjøbsted et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, phosphorylation of AMPK and downstream ACC2 were stimulated by kinesore in both basal and insulin-stimulated soleus and EDL muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In primary human myotubes differentiated for 7 days kinesore (50 μM) and Noco (13 μM) reduced the glucose uptake and completely blocked the insulin response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Microtubule polymerization in isolated mouse muscle fibers could be abolished pharmacologically within minutes without affecting insulin-stimulated glucose uptake whereas longer pharmacological inhibition progressively caused GLUT4 mislocalization and lowered insulin responsiveness. These data are consistent with a model where microtubules are required for correct intramyocellular GLUT4 compartmentalization but not the ultimate insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface from these compartments. Importantly, microtubule-based GLUT4 movement was impaired in two classical mouse insulin resistance models, short-chain ceramide treatment and diet-induced obesity. These data implicate dysregulation of microtubule-mediated GLUT4 trafficking and their localization in the etiology of adult skeletal muscle insulin resistance.</p><p>What may cause the reduced number of GLUT4 moving on microtubules in insulin-resistant muscle? Based on cell-culture studies, GLUT4 is packaged into specialized GSVs, which upon insulin stimulation can undergo exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fazakerley et al., 2022</xref>). This exocytosis may include an intermediate step involving release and heterotypic fusion of GSVs with transferrin receptor positive endosomes observable using super-resolution quantum dot single GLUT4 particle tracking in isolated mouse soleus and EDL muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hatakeyama and Kanzaki, 2017</xref>). Such a model is consistent with previous reports of insulin-stimulated release of GSVs into an endosomal recycling pool in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coster et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Govers et al., 2004</xref>). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, GSVs are synthesized via the trans-Golgi network and the Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi intermediate compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gould et al., 2020</xref>) by mechanisms involving TBC1D4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruno et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brumfield et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sano et al., 2007</xref>). We note that TBC1D4 phosphorylation on multiple sites is often decreased in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pehmøller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vind et al., 2011</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castorena et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, TBC1D4 phosphorylation is increased after insulin-sensitizing exercise/contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pehmøller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Funai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Treebak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kjøbsted et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kjøbsted et al., 2017</xref>) which might augment the insulin-responsive GLUT4 pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Geiger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Knudsen et al., 2020c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradley et al., 2014</xref>). The presently observed decreased GLUT4 movement on microtubules could reflect impaired availability of GLUT4 for trafficking, i.e. impaired TBC1D4-dependent GSV biosynthesis and/or heterotypic fusion of GSVs with transferrin receptor positive endosomes. Another possibility is that recruitment of GLUT4 onto microtubules, i.e. release of tethered GSVs and/or motor protein interaction, is impaired. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin stimulated the frequency but not movement speed of GLUT4 on microtubules, an effect blocked by a dominant-negative cargo-binding kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1) which impairs KIF5B function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Semiz et al., 2003</xref>). Also, KLC1 was proposed to regulate GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Semiz et al., 2003</xref>) and L6 myoblasts via insulin-regulated interaction with Double C2 domain B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). These data are consistent with our observations of KIF5B-dependent GLUT4 translocation in insulin-stimulated L6 muscle cells. KIF5B was proposed to regulate GSV trafficking via insulin-stimulated binding to TUGUL, a cleavage product of the intracellular GSV tethering protein TUG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Habtemichael et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bogan et al., 2003</xref>). Multiple studies by Jonathan Bogan’s group linked TUG to skeletal muscle insulin-stimulated GLUT4 traffic and glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Löffler et al., 2013</xref>). Insulin-stimulated TUG cleavage and expression of the putative protease Usp25m were reduced in rat adipose tissue after a 3-day high-fat/high-sugar diet-induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Habtemichael et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting possible dysregulation in insulin resistance. Apart from KIF5B and TUG, GLUT4 was proposed to utilize other motor proteins to move on microtubules in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, i.e. dynein via Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang et al., 2001</xref>), and the kinesin-2 family member KIF3A via AXIN and the ADP-ribosylase tankyrase 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Imamura et al., 2003</xref>). Whether any of these mechanisms regulate GLUT4 traffic in skeletal muscle should be tested further.</p><p>Noco treatment potently reduced the number of large GLUT4-containing structures, while causing the number of medium-sized GLUT4-containing structures to increase within 2 hr of treatment. We speculate whether the medium-sized GLUT4 structures are so-called Golgi mini-stacks, small immature membrane compartments of Golgi origin incapable of protein secretion, reported to accumulate in microtubule disrupted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fourriere et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, the membrane structures accumulated in Noco-treated fibers might be internalized GLUT4 in endosomal structures unable to reach microtubule nucleation sites via retrograde transport. Future studies should characterize the nature of these membrane structures by e.g. measuring different compartment-specific protein markers.</p><p>Our glucose uptake time-course data in perifused mouse FDB fibers suggest that microtubules are required to build and maintain the pool of insulin-responsive GLUT4 vesicles near the cell surface observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lizunov et al., 2012</xref>), and that disruption of this process may contribute to insulin-resistant GLUT4 translocation in adult skeletal muscle. If true, then one would predict GLUT4 mislocalization to be observable in unstimulated insulin-resistant skeletal muscle. Consistent with this prediction, Garvey et al. measured GLUT4 content in different sucrose density fractions in human vastus lateralis muscle biopsies and found a basal redistribution of GLUT4 to a denser fraction in type 2 diabetic subjects compared to control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garvey et al., 1998</xref>). Similar observations of altered intracellular GLUT4 distribution were made using a different fractionation protocol in subcutaneous adipose biopsies from type 2 diabetic subjects compared to control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maianu et al., 2001</xref>), implying that GLUT4 mislocalization is a shared hallmark of insulin-resistant muscle and adipose cells. Application of higher-resolution microscopy to the study of basal and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 localization in adult human and rodent insulin-resistant skeletal muscle could help to resolve the relative distribution of GLUT4 between specific membrane compartments.</p><p>A previous study reported that the microtubule disrupting drug colchicine (25 µM for up to 8 hr) had no effect on insulin and contraction-stimulated glucose uptake, whereas Noco (3–83 µM for 30–60 min) potently inhibited glucose uptake in ex vivo incubated adult rat muscle and 33 µM Noco added for &lt;5 min directly inhibited GLUT4 transporter activity into sarcolemma derived giant vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang et al., 2001</xref>). Regarding colchicine, these divergent findings mirror previous studies in 3T3-L1 adipocytes where some support the absent effect of colchicine on insulin-stimulated cell surface GLUT4 translocation/glucose uptake despite strong microtubule disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Molero et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang et al., 2001</xref>) whereas others found colchicine to inhibit insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fletcher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emoto et al., 2001</xref>). The reason for this variation between studies is not readily apparent since the models and colchicine treatment protocols overlap. Regarding Noco, a direct inhibitory effect of 33 µM Noco added for &gt;2 min on GLUT4 activity was suggested by previous 3T3-L1 adipocyte studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Molero et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shigematsu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang et al., 2005</xref>), However, Molero et al. also observed no inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake using 2 µM Noco for 1 hr despite complete disruption of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Molero et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that Noco is useful to study the microtubule-glucose uptake connectivity at low concentrations. Since Noco was shown to inhibit GLUT4 activity within 2 min and we observed no effect of 13 µM Noco in isolated muscle fibers on basal glucose uptake or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake after 5 min at a concentration causing maximal inhibition of microtubule polymerization, we find it unlikely that Noco at the concentration used had major effects on GLUT4 activity.</p><p>We were unable to detect a significant effect of insulin on the number of GLUT4 moving on microtubules in the individual experiments performed in the current study. This contrasts the previously reported observation that rodent skeletal muscle expressing GFP-tagged GLUT4 had increased recovery of fluorescence after photo bleaching when stimulated by insulin, suggesting that insulin increased the overall GLUT4 movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lauritzen et al., 2008</xref>). Meanwhile, in primary and 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell culture total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy studies, insulin increased the number of GLUT4 halting and docking beneath the plasma membrane prior to insulin-stimulated insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lizunov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gonzalez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lizunov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2007</xref>). TIRF imaging of mouse muscle fibers expressing HA-GLUT4-GFP suggested a similar GLUT4 halting and fusion-promoting effect of insulin in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lizunov et al., 2012</xref>). Regarding microtubule dynamics, previous studies reported that insulin increased microtubule polymerization and/or density in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parker et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Olson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dawicki-McKenna et al., 2012</xref>) and in L6 skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2013</xref>) but insulin also decelerated CLASP2-positive MT polymerization in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parker et al., 2019</xref>). In adult muscle, we did not detect any significant effect of insulin on the assessed parameters. Given that insulin may differentially increase or decrease the mobility of subpopulations of GLUT4 and microtubules, it seems likely that our relatively crude analyses of total subsarcolemmal GLUT4 movement could mask larger or even opposite behaviors of specific GLUT4 subpopulations.</p><p>The actin cytoskeleton is known to exhibit extensive interactions with microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pimm and Henty-Ridilla, 2021</xref>). Importantly, the actin cytoskeleton and associated regulators and binding proteins were suggested in L6 muscle cells and adult mouse muscle to be required for skeletal muscle GLUT4-dependent glucose transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sylow et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sylow et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">JeBailey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tong et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brozinick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ueda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Toyoda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kee et al., 2015</xref>), likely by promoting the final steps of GLUT4 docking and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zaid et al., 2008</xref>). In adult muscle, the cytoplasmic beta and gamma-actin isoforms are lowly expressed compared to cultured cells and their individual KO in mouse muscle does not affect insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, making the exact actin isoform and mechanistic involvement of actin unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Madsen et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, multiple studies support a role of actin in regulating adult muscle GLUT4-dependent glucose uptake. Hence, the interconnectivity between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in mediating GLUT4 trafficking should be investigated.</p><p>In conclusion, we presently demonstrated that GLUT4 is present on microtubules in adult mouse and human skeletal muscle and that acute microtubule disruption causes intramyocellular GLUT4 redistribution and eventually decreases insulin responsiveness of glucose transport. Decreased microtubule-dependent GLUT4 movement was observed in in vitro and in vivo mouse insulin resistance models, suggesting that disturbed microtubule-based GLUT4 trafficking is a feature of insulin resistance in adult skeletal muscle.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample obtaining</title><p><italic>Human muscle samples</italic> are tissue from <italic>m. vastus lateralis</italic> from young healthy men fasted for 6–7 hr.

The chip was divided into a tissue chamber and a glucose-sensing chamber connected by tubing. Both chambers were molded based on SU-8 master wafers. The tissue chamber consisted of two identical units each containing three layers of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The glucose-sensing chamber was a single PDMS layer bonded to a glass slide by air plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Fluid connection was achieved by punching holes using biopsy punchers and inserting tubes in the portholes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). A customized electrode was fabricated by threading a working electrode (platinum wire, Ø 51 µm, Teflon coated) and a reference electrode (silver wire, Ø 75 µm, Teflon coated) in the lumen of an 18 G syringe needle and embedding them in fluid epoxy. A counter electrode was attached to the metal of the needle by silver paste (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). On the experimental day, the electrode was carefully polished using fine sand paper and aluminum oxide slurry (0.05 µm particles) and a layer of chloride was deposited on the electrode by immersing it in 3 M KCl and exposing it to six current steps consisting of −20 µA for 1 s followed by 20 µA for 9 s. The working electrode was cleaned electrochemically in 0.1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> by running 10 cyclic voltammogram cycles.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Amira Klip (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This issue of microtubules being required for proper localization of Glut4 into an insulin sensitive compartment is viewed as important, and the data are supportive. However, there are further experiments that should be performed to test or strengthen this point (see Reviewer 2 comments on first weakness, and Reviewer 3 comments on Figure 2 in particular).</p><p>2) The Kinesore data do not appear to support the authors' hypothesis (see Reviewer 2 comments in particular). Please address this issue in a substantive way, with additional data or commentary and appropriate interpretations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Perhaps a better way to probe for the effects of insulin on GLUT4 dynamics would be to use the FRAP assay they employed to measure anterograde and retrograde trafficking in basal condition (FigS1G-H). This assay may be a more robust means of capturing the effects of insulin on GLUT4 dynamics; doing so would greatly strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>The manuscript would benefit from more detailed discussion of their results and perhaps editing of the amount of data presented. Perhaps too much narrative has been removed in trying to aware of the overall the length of the text. There are too many instances where data are presented as an observation but not fully explored. As an example, the statement on line 94-95 is too vague/descriptive as are the data in Figure 1SD. In my view, focusing the manuscript by removing extraneous data and more clearly describing the findings and how they advance our understanding of GLUT4 in muscle will enhance the impact of the work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, there are a number of technical questions (including better analysis of the colocalization of GLUT4 with Syntaxin 6) and throughout there is marked need to include the control of Noco treatment in absence of C2 or insulin.</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>– A and B, nice parallel between mouse and human morphology and microtubule structural similarities. Please comment on fiber types – it appears that the general structure is not dependent on fiber type, but future phenotypes may be explained by fiber type, so it would be useful to introduce this variable early on, or at least in the discussion. Also, please clarify that FDB is used because its amenability for fiber isolation, and discuss how it compares to the intact muscles used.</p><p>Figure 1 – —figure supplement 1 – G and H = Y axis states &quot;normalized&quot; – please specify normalized to what, total fluorescence intensity?</p><p>Figure 2:</p><p>– Data describing GLUT4 dependence on microtubules for traffic is sound, but the dependence of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 traffic on intact microtubules is lacking the essential control of the effect of Noco in the basal state (A-C).</p><p>– While in aggregate the results support the concept that GLUT4 traffic along microtubules is required for proper GLUT4 sortin, but not for acute insulin mobilization of GLUT4 from GSV. However, testing the effect of insulin in all conditions would go a long way to clarify this concept, if possible.</p><p>– Is the effect of Noco on the insulin response (minute) seen also with other stimuli? AICAR? Contraction? It may be that this is work for a future study, and could be commented so.</p><p>– Please consider to stimulate with insulin to mobilize GLUT4, then disrupt microtubules and perform a re-stimulation with insulin – in this way both acute (1 stimulation) and prolonged (re-stimulation) insulin-regulated GLUT4 traffic along microtubules could be examined</p><p>– B-C, Are the data in C the results from 4 experiments, as performed in B? It seems somewhat misleading if the variability within a single experiment is as shown in B, but when pooled in C the effect is now apparent when there was no significant insulin effect in any single experiment. If C is indeed an average of 4 independent experiments, why is only a single experiment shown in B?</p><p>– Please clarify the sources of data for B and C, and include error bars for both B and C. Also specify in C, normalized to what?</p><p>– D-E, 15 hours Noco, then 9 hours recovery – why these hours? If previous experiment used 4 hours, why are 15 hours required to disrupt microtubules in this experiment?</p><p>o Is there a reason why this experiment was not also conducted in the presence of insulin? Similarly, in F-G, would this localization change in presence of insulin?</p><p>– Please indicate &quot;mouse&quot; in G</p><p>– In supplement 1 to this figure:</p><p>– B-C, Normalized to what?</p><p>– D , Why was basal+Noco not tested here but in E-G insulin is not tested?</p><p>– D, Noco treatment back to 4 hours but in F-H treatment is 15 hours please state the rationale for treatment times</p><p>– It appears the Pearson's R value for Syntaxin 6 and GLUT4 was applied to the entire fiber, or is it the Entire image? Fields? In any case, it would be highly useful to segregate colocalization according to depots of GLUT4: at nucleation site clusters, intermediate structures and small structures. This could be far more informative than the overall which will likely muddle any potential colocalization. Additionally, since these are overexpressed proteins, it is important to calculate the colocalization of one protein within the other's pool and vice versa.</p><p>Figure 3:</p><p>– A-B, glucose uptake phenotype also nicely demonstrated for FDB in C-F. Please suggest explanation for why this insulin effect was not apparent in Figure 2?</p><p>– In figure 2, could endogenous GLUT4 be detected in static images to examine localization relative to microtubules in soleus or EDL muscles? This could provide some context as to fiber type specific dependence on microtubules for insulin-mediated GLUT4 traffic.</p><p>– Noco treatment only 2 hours, compared to 4-15 hours when measuring GLUT4 traffic , what is the rationale for this difference?</p><p>– Please provide potential explanations for why for microtubules are important for the acute insulin action on on 2-DG uptake but not GLUT4 traffic. This is a key question that must be addressed.</p><p>– H, What is different from Figure 2E – in 3H the number of small structures is elevated with 2 hours Noco but in 1E they are reduced. Does the presence of insulin alter this distribution?</p><p>– G-H, What does GLUT4 localization look like in presence of insulin +/- Noco?</p><p>Figure 4</p><p>– Nice demonstration of Kinesin-1 dependence. In C, It would be useful to see this performed with insulin +/- Noco and present in Figure 2</p><p>Figure 5:</p><p>– 5B and supplement 1B, why is there no basal + C2? If the conclusion is that C2 inhibits insulin stimulated vesicle movement, it is essential to show that this is not happening in the basal state</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>– The finding that more GLUT4 'vesicles' appear in intermediate and small structures along the microtubule in response to Noco is fascinating. Given that those pools increase, they are unlikely to be the ones responding to insulin, unless they no longer engage with the elements that cause mobilization (whether Kinesin-1 or other). On the other hand, Kinesore causes GLUT4 dispersion into small clusters and promotes translocation to the membrane even additive to insulin's action. Please reconcile these observations.</p><p>– The dispersion of GLUT4 upon activation of Kinesin-1 via Kinesore is also very interesting, but requires further assessment of specificity towards Kinesin-1.</p><p>– One cannot call the 'puncta' vesicles, these are likely aggregates unless the point spread function is calculated for each item and found to be individual</p><p>– Throughout the study there is no mention of the other fiber and motors that contribute to GLUT4 traffic in muscle. In the past the authors have not detected insulin-dependent remodeling of transfected actin, but this does not rule out a dependency of the positioning of the GLUT4 pools on actin cytoskeletal elements. -</p><p>– Key and related to the above is testing whether Noco for 2 h alters any of the known elements of the Rac1 signaling pathway or the proteins regulating actin filaments. There are studies in the literature showing interconnectivity between the microtubule and microfilament networks.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83338.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This issue of microtubules being required for proper localization of Glut4 into an insulin sensitive compartment is viewed as important, and the data are supportive.

The rationale behind choice of muscle and their fiber type distribution has been addressed (line 78-81). Normalization was min-max normalization, which is now specified in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2:</p><p>– Data describing GLUT4 dependence on microtubules for traffic is sound, but the dependence of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 traffic on intact microtubules is lacking the essential control of the effect of Noco in the basal state (A-C).</p></disp-quote><p>The microtubule disruption by nocodazole in the insulin-stimulated state completely blocked all microtubule-mediated GLUT4 movement. This is clear from figure 2 A&amp;B and particularly from the uploaded video showing no microtubule-mediated GLUT4 trafficking following 2h of microtubule disruption. Thus, a further reduction in GLUT4 movement without insulin stimulation is not possible. For this reason, we believe the proposed Noco treated basal fiber control to be redundant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– While in aggregate the results support the concept that GLUT4 traffic along microtubules is required for proper GLUT4 sortin, but not for acute insulin mobilization of GLUT4 from GSV.

Thus, additional GLUT4-GFP electroporation and fiber isolation experiments are not possible to perform within a reasonable time-frame.</p><p>As a proxy measure of GLUT4 mobilization from GSV, we tested whether insulin would reduce the number of small vesicles (&lt;0.4 µm2) in our live imaging experiments shown in figure 2A-B. However, we could not detect any significant insulin regulation by this approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is the effect of Noco on the insulin response (minute) seen also with other stimuli? AICAR? Contraction? It may be that this is work for a future study, and could be commented so.</p></disp-quote><p>This is of course an interesting and important question. We have not studied this. In the new experiments performed in our revision process, we observed a marked increase in AMPK activation (p-AMPK and p-ACC) following kinesore treatment, both in basal and insulin stimulated EDL and soleus muscle. Despite this AMPK activation, we observed no increase in glucose uptake in the basal state and impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. The prediction from these data would be that the effect of Noco/kinesore would also be seen with AICAR/AMPK activation and contractions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please consider to stimulate with insulin to mobilize GLUT4, then disrupt microtubules and perform a re-stimulation with insulin – in this way both acute (1 stimulation) and prolonged (re-stimulation) insulin-regulated GLUT4 traffic along microtubules could be examined</p></disp-quote><p>We stimulated L6 cells with insulin (100nm, 15 min) before 2h ± Noco or Colchicine and then performed re-stimulation with insulin or kept cells basal. There was a clear main effect of both Noco and Colchicine when cells were pre-treated with insulin. Overall, there was no clear effect of microtubule disruption on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation when cells were pre-stimulated with insulin before microtubule disruption. From these data, it seems that, in the L6 cells overexpressing GLUT4, a residual insulin-responsive GLUT4 pool remains after microtubule disruption, even with prior GLUT4 mobilization by insulin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– B-C, Are the data in C the results from 4 experiments, as performed in B?

Each data point set reflects the average effect size from each experiment. In addition to the experiment shown in B, the data in C also originate from the basal and insulin control groups in figure 5.</p><p>Because this particular figure panel was highlighted as confusing by two reviewers and since we could not detect an effect of insulin in single experiments, we decided to remove the panel from the manuscript. We discuss several possibilities for the lack of significant insulin effect on GLUT4 movement in individual experiments in the Discussion section (lines 342 to 361).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please clarify the sources of data for B and C, and include error bars for both B and C.

If previous experiment used 4 hours, why are 15 hours required to disrupt microtubules in this experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>For practical reasons, we choose to do an overnight treatment with nocodazole, then image the fibers in the morning, allow recovery throughout the working day and re-image the fibers again in the afternoon. This amounted to 15h Noco treatment and 9h recovery. As seen from the representative live-imaging of the experiment in 2A-B, the changes induced by microtubule disruption had occurred already after 4h. Hence, we do not believe that a prolonged 15h disruption would be required for our localization observations. However, as also noted by the reviewer in a later comment, the number of small GLUT4 membrane structures was higher after 2h of nocodazole treatment compared to the control condition while it was lower after 15h. We have not investigated this time-dependent effect further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is there a reason why this experiment was not also conducted in the presence of insulin?

Since the correlation between GLUT4 and Syntaxin6 was low already in the basal state and unaffected by nocodazole we did not pursue this hypothesis further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please indicate &quot;mouse&quot; in G</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In supplement 1 to this figure:</p><p>– B-C, Normalized to what?</p></disp-quote><p>We normalized the individual intensity to the average intensity across the full data set.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– D , Why was basal+Noco not tested here but in E-G insulin is not tested?</p></disp-quote><p>The reasoning for the different treatments is similar in figure 2 and in the supplement to figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– D, Noco treatment back to 4 hours but in F-H treatment is 15 hours please state the rationale for treatment times</p></disp-quote><p>The treatment times were different for practical reasons outlined above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It appears the Pearson's R value for Syntaxin 6 and GLUT4 was applied to the entire fiber, or is it the Entire image?

We have reanalysed the data specifically analysing the perinuclear region and using Manders´ correlation to estimate the fraction of GLUT4 in Syntaxin 6 positive regions. We did not see any changes in overlap by Noco treatment (0.269 vs. 0.273, p=0.96).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3:</p><p>– A-B, glucose uptake phenotype also nicely demonstrated for FDB in C-F.

This could provide some context as to fiber type specific dependence on microtubules for insulin-mediated GLUT4 traffic.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this would be possible to do. However, our ex vivo incubation glucose uptake data suggest no major differences between EDL and Soleus. For this reason, we would expect no major fiber type differences and did not prioritize these analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Noco treatment only 2 hours, compared to 4-15 hours when measuring GLUT4 traffic , what is the rationale for this difference?</p></disp-quote><p>Our ex vivo preparations are difficult to keep viable for extended time periods.

This is a key question that must be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We are unsure whether there has been a mistake in posing this comment as we see the opposite, i.e. that microtubules are important for GLUT4 traffic but not acute glucose uptake. Our working hypothesis is that the muscle fiber retains a GLUT4 reservoir that is capable of reaching the surface membrane even in the absence of microtubules, likely from a pre-tethered pool as proposed by Samuel Cushman’s group (PMID: 22297303). This reservoir may allow the muscle fiber to retain a normal initial insulin response on glucose uptake. We discuss this hypothesis in the discussion (lines 308-321).</p><p>If this question instead relates to the fact that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is impaired after 2h of microtubule disruption despite no effect of insulin on microtubule-mediated GLUT4 trafficking, then our response is the following:</p><p>In addition to the 2-DG uptake measurements ±Noco, we have now demonstrated that Kinesore treatment (2h, 50uM) also impairs insulin-stimulated 2-DG uptake in adult skeletal muscle, overall supporting the requirement of microtubule-mediated transport for 2-DG uptake. Additionally we have clearly demonstrated that the microtubules are important for adult muscle GLUT4 traffic. As pointed out, we have not demonstrated that the microtubules are important for the acute action of insulin on GLUT4 traffic in muscle fibers. We hypothesize that a fraction of the insulin-regulated GLUT4 trafficking is dependent on intact microtubules, but we currently do not have sensitive enough tools to fully test this hypothesis as discussed in the current version of the manuscript (lines 341 to 361).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– H, What is different from Figure 2E – in 3H the number of small structures is elevated with 2 hours Noco but in 1E they are reduced. Does the presence of insulin alter this distribution?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not investigated whether insulin would alter this distribution, nor have we investigated why there is a difference between the two time points. It would be really interesting to explore these observations further, especially since the small structures would presumably include insulin-responsive vesicles. However, as also pointed out by reviewer #2, the data would be hard to interpret without identification by compartment specific markers. Since this would require a lot of optimization to set up, we find this to lie beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– G-H, What does GLUT4 localization look like in presence of insulin +/- Noco?</p></disp-quote><p>We quantified the number of small GLUT4 structures following insulin stimulation +/- Noco in the live-imaging experiment in Figure 2, but we did not observe significant changes (see figure 4 in this rebuttal). These data were not included in this manuscript.</p><p>We believe that the lack of effect is due to lack of sensitivity in the image analyses. Supporting this notion, we previously demonstrated, that insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation can occur without discernible visual GLUT4 localization changes in mouse muscle (PMID: 30710396), indicating that higher resolution microscopy and more specific image analyses approaches may be a requirement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4</p><p>– Nice demonstration of Kinesin-1 dependence.

This has made us unsure of the interpretation of the data presented in figure 4C and, also considering also reviewer 2´s comments about too many underexplored observations, we thus chose to remove it from this version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5:</p><p>– 5B and supplement 1B, why is there no basal + C2?

We therefore acknowledged this limitation by changing the wording in the manuscript to reflect that we cannot conclude whether C2 inhibits the effect of insulin (lines 218-222).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion:</p><p>– The finding that more GLUT4 'vesicles' appear in intermediate and small structures along the microtubule in response to Noco is fascinating. Given that those pools increase, they are unlikely to be the ones responding to insulin, unless they no longer engage with the elements that cause mobilization (whether Kinesin-1 or other). On the other hand, Kinesore causes GLUT4 dispersion into small clusters and promotes translocation to the membrane even additive to insulin's action. Please reconcile these observations.</p></disp-quote><p>We included some speculative discussion on the identity of the structures (lines 311-318). Future studies should aim to identify the nature of these structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The dispersion of GLUT4 upon activation of Kinesin-1 via Kinesore is also very interesting, but requires further assessment of specificity towards Kinesin-1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the dispersion of GLUT4 upon kinesore treatment is very interesting but requires further assessment.
