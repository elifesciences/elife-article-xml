Here, we show a prominent role for cohesin in the expression of genes that facilitate neuronal maturation and homeostasis. Unexpectedly, we observed two major classes of activity-regulated genes with distinct reliance on cohesin in mouse primary cortical neurons. Immediate early genes (IEGs) remained fully inducible by KCl and BDNF, and short-range enhancer-promoter contacts at the IEGs <italic>Fos</italic> formed robustly in the absence of cohesin. In contrast, cohesin was required for full expression of a subset of secondary response genes characterized by long-range chromatin contacts. Cohesin-dependence of constitutive neuronal genes with key functions in synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter signaling also scaled with chromatin loop length. Our data demonstrate that key genes required for the maturation and activation of primary cortical neurons depend on cohesin for their full expression, and that the degree to which these genes rely on cohesin scales with the genomic distance traversed by their chromatin contacts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cohesin</kwd><kwd>neurons</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>3D chromatin organization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merkenschlager</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>099276/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merkenschlager</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 1047-2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calderon</surname><given-names>Lesly</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT00427/2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calderon</surname><given-names>Lesly</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01-MH120269</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phillips-Cremins</surname><given-names>Jennifer E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP1OD031253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phillips-Cremins</surname><given-names>Jennifer E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01-NS114226</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phillips-Cremins</surname><given-names>Jennifer E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>4D Nucleome Common Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1U01DK127405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phillips-Cremins</surname><given-names>Jennifer E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

In addition to mediating canonical functions in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nasmyth and Haering, 2009</xref>), cohesin cooperates with CTCF to facilitate the spatial organization of the genome in the nucleus. Cohesin traverses chromosomal DNA in an ATP-dependent manner through a mechanism known as loop extrusion. This process generates self-interacting domains that are delimited by chromatin boundaries marked by CTCF and defined by an increased probability of chromatin contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fudenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwarzer et al., 2017</xref>). The resulting organization of the genome into domains and loops is thought to contribute to the regulation of gene expression by facilitating appropriate enhancer-promoter interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dekker and Mirny, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Merkenschlager and Nora, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beagan and Phillips-Cremins, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCord et al., 2020</xref>) and its disruption can cause human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lupiáñez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spielmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sun et al., 2018</xref>), including neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Won et al., 2016</xref>). Recent studies which induced global cohesin loss on acute timescales resulted in the altered expression of only a small number of genes in a human cell line in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rao et al., 2017</xref>), while later time points after cohesin depletion in vivo revealed more pervasive disruption in expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwarzer et al., 2017</xref>). We recently reported that cohesin loss has modest effects on constitutive gene expression in uninduced macrophages, but severely disrupted the establishment of new gene expression programs upon the induction of a new macrophage state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuartero et al., 2018</xref>). These data support a model in which cohesin-mediated loop extrusion is more important for the establishment of new gene expression rather than maintenance of existing programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuartero et al., 2018</xref>). However, the applicability of this model across other cell types remains unclear, and the extent to which deficits in cohesin function alter neuronal gene expression remains a critical underexplored question.</p><p>Activity-regulated neuronal genes (ARGs) are defined by transcriptional induction in response to neuronal activity, and are important for cellular morphology, the formation of synapses and circuits, and ultimately for learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gallo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greer and Greenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tyssowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yap and Greenberg, 2018</xref>). ARG induction is accompanied by acetylation of H3K27, as well as the recruitment of RNA polymerase 2, cohesin, and other chromatin binding proteins at ARGs and their enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greer and Greenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamada et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yap and Greenberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tyssowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schaukowitch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beagan et al., 2020</xref>). For a subset of ARGs, long-range contacts between enhancers and promoters increase upon stimulation of post-mitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schaukowitch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sams et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beagan et al., 2020</xref>). Among neuronal ARGs, IEGs and, late response genes (LRGs) are known to be activated on different time scales according to distinct mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tyssowski et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, IEGs and LRGs differ significantly in their looping landscape, as IEGs form fewer, shorter enhancer-promoter contacts compared to the complex, long-range interactions formed by many LRGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beagan et al., 2020</xref>). Given the importance of cohesin and regulatory looping interactions for brain function, there is a strong imperative to understand the functional role of cohesin-dependent loops in the establishment and maintenance of developmentally regulated and activity-stimulated neuronal gene expression programs.</p><p>Here, we establish an experimental system to address the role of cohesin in 3D genome organization and gene expression in non-dividing, post-mitotic neurons, independently of essential cohesin functions in the cell cycle. We employ developmentally regulated expression of Cre recombinase under the control of the endogenous <italic>Neurod6</italic> locus (referred to here as <italic>Nex</italic><sup>Cre</sup> according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goebbels et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirayama et al., 2012</xref>) to inducibly deplete the cohesin subunit RAD21 specifically in immature post-mitotic mouse neurons in vivo. Cohesin depletion in immature post-mitotic mouse neurons disrupted CTCF-based chromatin loops, and reduced the expression of neuronal genes related to synaptic transmission, neuronal development, adhesion, connectivity, and signaling, resulting in impaired neuronal maturation. Neuronal ARGs were pervasively deregulated in cohesin-deficient neurons, consistent with a model in which the establishment of new gene expression programs in both macrophages and neurons is driven in part by cohesin-mediated enhancer-promoter contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rajarajan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamada et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sams et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schaukowitch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuartero et al., 2018</xref>). The cohesin-dependence of ARGs was confirmed in an inducible system that allows for proteolytic cohesin cleavage in primary neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weiss et al., 2021</xref>), providing temporal control over cohesin levels on a time scale similar to the establishment of neuronal gene expression programs upon neural stimulation, thus allowing us to disentangle the role for cohesin-mediated chromatin contacts in the maintenance of existing transcriptional programs versus the establishment of new transcriptional programs in neural circuits. Surprisingly, despite pervasive deregulation at baseline, most IEGs and a subset of LRGs remained fully inducible by KCl and BDNF stimulation after genetic or proteolytic depletion of cohesin.</p><p>Cohesin-dependent and -independent ARGs were distinguished not by the binding of cohesin or CTCF to their promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schaukowitch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sams et al., 2016</xref>), but instead by their 3D connectivity. LRGs that depended on cohesin for full inducibility engaged in longer chromatin loops than IEGs, or LRGs that remained fully inducible in the absence of cohesin. Unlike ARGs, the majority of neuronal genes that mediate synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter signaling are constitutively expressed. Nevertheless, as with ARGs, the reliance of these key neuronal genes on cohesin scaled with chromatin loop length. Consistent with a model where short-range enhancer-promoter loops can form in the absence of cohesin, we find that the enhancer activity and short-range enhancer-promoter contacts at the IEG <italic>Fos</italic> remained robustly inducible in cohesin-depleted neurons. Finally, re-expression of RAD21 protein in cohesin-depleted neurons re-established lost chromatin loops and restored wild-type expression levels of disrupted LRGs, and of constitutive neuronal genes engaged in long-range loops. Together, our data support a model where key neuronal genes required for the maturation and activation of primary neurons require cohesin for their full expression. The degree to which neuronal genes rely on cohesin scales with the genomic distance traversed by their chromatin loops, including loops connecting promoters with activity-induced enhancers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conditional deletion of cohesin in immature post-mitotic neurons</title><p>To explore the role of cohesin in post-mitotic neurons, we deleted the essential cohesin subunit RAD21 (<italic>Rad21</italic><sup>lox</sup>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Seitan et al., 2011</xref>) in immature cortical and hippocampal neurons using <italic>Nex</italic><sup>Cre</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goebbels et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirayama et al., 2012</xref>).

To define the role of cohesin in immature post-mitotic neurons we use experimental deletion of the cohesin subunit <italic>Rad21</italic> during a precise developmental window of terminal neuronal differentiation in vivo. We find impaired neuronal maturation and extensive downregulation of genes related to synaptic transmission, connectivity, neuronal development, and signaling in <italic>Rad21</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> <italic>Nex</italic><sup>Cre</sup> neurons. Such gene classes are central to neuronal identity, and their wide-spread downregulation is likely to contribute to the observed maturation defects of <italic>Rad21</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> <italic>Nex</italic><sup>Cre</sup> neurons. Acute proteolysis of RAD21-TEV corroborated a prominent role for cohesin in the expression of genes that facilitate neuronal maturation, homeostasis, and activation.</p><p>We have recently shown that cohesin loss in macrophages results in severe disruption of anti-microbial gene expression programs in response to macrophage activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuartero et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, cohesin loss only moderately affected genes constitutively expressed in uninduced and induced macrophages, supporting a model where cohesin-mediated loop extrusion is more important for the establishment of new gene expression than the maintenance of existing programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuartero et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we extend this model to post-mitotic neurons in the murine brain. The two major ARG classes, IEGs, and LRGs, were broadly downregulated in cohesin-deficient neurons at baseline. However, IEGs and a subset of LRGs remained fully inducible by KCl and BDNF stimulation in the absence of cohesin. IEG-encoded transcription factors such as the AP1 members encoded by <italic>Fos, FosB,</italic> and <italic>JunB</italic> facilitate the induction of LRGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malik et al., 2014</xref>). Our data show that IEG-encoded transcription factors remain fully inducible in cohesin-deficient neurons. The failure to induce a subset of LRGs to wild-type levels is therefore not explained by a lack of IEG-encoded factors. This is in marked contrast to inducible gene expression in cohesin-deficient macrophages. A substantial number of LRGs in macrophages rely on the expression of early-induced interferons (IFN), which act in an autocrine and paracrine manner to support LRG induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glass and Natoli, 2016</xref>). Expression of IFN-dependent LRGs can be partially rescued by provision of exogenous IFN to cohesin-deficient macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuartero et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The reliance of ARGs on cohesin for full activity-induced expression was linked to the scale of chromatin interactions as quantified by the analysis of Hi-C loops. The subset of LRGs that exhibit defects in inducibility in the absence of cohesin is characterized by longer-range chromatin loops than either IEGs or LRGs that remain fully inducible in the absence of cohesin. In addition to defective chromatin architecture, deregulated expression of a particular gene may also arise from disturbances in upstream regulatory mechanisms, such as the activity of specific signaling pathways, or the expression of particular transcription factors. We are not aware of signaling pathways that would unambiguously distinguish the subset of neuronal LRGs that are fully induced in the absence of cohesin from the subset of neuronal LRGs that remain deregulated in the absence of cohesin. As discussed above, TFs encoded by IEGs are required for the induction of LRGs. Of note, these IEGs are fully induced in cohesin-deficient neurons.</p><p>The relationship between loop length and cohesin-dependence of neuronal gene expression extends to constitutively expressed cell type-specific neuronal genes. Neuronal genes related to synaptic transmission and glutamate receptor signaling that were downregulated in cohesin-deficient neurons also engaged in significantly longer chromatin loops than genes in the same GO terms that were not deregulated.</p><p>A subset of looping interactions made by ARGs and neuron-specific genes involve distal enhancers, suggesting that one role for cohesin in the expression of these genes may be to facilitate enhancer-promoter contacts. Our data indicate that specific enhancer-promoter loops at the key neuronal IEGs <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Arc</italic> can occur independently of cohesin in primary neurons. <italic>Fos</italic> enhancer-promoter loops remained responsive to environmental signals. Of note, <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Arc</italic> enhancer-promoter loops that were robust to cohesin depletion are relatively short-range ( &lt;40 kb). By contrast, an inducible 1.68 Mb enhancer-promoter loop at the <italic>Bdnf</italic> locus, a constitutive chromatin loop between <italic>Bdnf</italic> promoter IV and an activity-induced enhancer, and all CTCF-based loops examined were substantial weakened in the absence of cohesin. While longer loops are inherently weaker than shorter loops, the observed differences in loop strength were robust to correction for the distance-dependent background signal. This indicates that our 5 C approach reliably quantifies the strength of both long and short loops.</p><p>In earlier studies, we found that contacts between the <italic>Lefty1</italic> promoter and the +8 kb enhancer, and between <italic>Klf4</italic> and enhancers at +53 kb remained intact in acutely cohesin-depleted ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lavagnolli et al., 2015</xref>).

Analysis of engineered enhancer landscapes in K562 cells indicates graded distance effects: Enhancers at ≥100 kb and 47 kb were highly and moderately dependent on cohesin, respectively, while loss of cohesin actually increased target gene transcription for enhancer distances ≤11 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rinzema et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, promoter capture Hi-C in cohesin-depleted HeLa cells indicates ranges of 10<sup>4</sup>–10<sup>5</sup> bp for retained and 10<sup>5</sup>–10<sup>6</sup> bp for lost interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thiecke et al., 2020</xref>). While these studies suggest that cohesin-dependence of chromatin contacts relates to genomic distance, they fail to link this observation to physiologically relevant gene expression. The new data described here demonstrate scaling of cohesin-dependence with genomic distance in primary neurons, and, importantly, link this finding to critical genome functions, specifically the implementation of cell type-specific gene expression programs during neuronal maturation and activation.</p><p>An open question concerns the mechanisms of enhancer-promoter contacts in the absence of cohesin.

Our data show that H3K27ac and transcription remain inducible at <italic>Fos</italic> enhancers in <italic>Rad21</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> <italic>Nex</italic><sup>Cre</sup> neurons, which could potentially contribute to loop formation. At the <italic>Arc</italic> locus, the persistence of an enhancer-promoter loop in unstimulated cohesin-deficient neurons would be consistent with a role for cohesin-mediated loop extrusion in chromatin state mixing, and the separation of enhancer contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rao et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, enhancer-promoter contacts resist the inhibition of BET proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crump et al., 2021</xref>), selective degradation of BRD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crump et al., 2021</xref>), Mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">El Khattabi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crump et al., 2021</xref>), RNA Polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thiecke et al., 2020</xref>), or inhibition of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">El Khattabi et al., 2019</xref>).

The quality of RNA-seq reads was checked by Fastqc (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>) and aligned to mouse genome mm9 using Tophat version 2.0.11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) with parameters ‘library-type = fr-first-strand’. Gene coordinates from Ensembl version 67 were used as gene model for alignment. Quality metrics for the RNA-Seq alignment were computed using Picard tools verion 1.90 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Picard Toolkit, 2018</xref>). Genome wide coverage for each sample was generated using bedtools genomeCoverageBed and converted to bigwig files using bedGraphToBigWig application from UCSC Genome Browser. Bigwig files were visualised using IGV. After alignment, number of reads on the genes were summarized using HTSeq-count (version 0.5.4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2015</xref>). All downstream analysis was carried out in R (version 3.4.0). Differentially expressed genes between condition were determined using DESEq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Love et al., 2014</xref>). p-values calculated by DESeq2 were subjected to multiple testing correction using Benjamini-Hochberg method. Adjusted p-value of 0.05 was used to select the differentially expressed genes. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering of samples were done on the normalized read counts (rlog) computed using DESeq2. KCl-inducible genes were defined as genes in <italic>Rad21<sup>+/+</sup></italic> neurons with adjusted p&lt;0.05 and log2 fold change ≥1 in KCl1h versus TTX or KCl6h versus TTX.

A single band at 220 bp in each final library was confirmed using an Agilent DNA 1000 Bioanalyzer chip, and library concentration was determined using the KAPA Illumina Library Quantification Kit (#KK4835).

Only reads for which one paired end mapped to a forward/left-forward primer and the other end mapped to a reverse/left-reverse primer were tallied as true counts. Primer-primer pairs with outlier count totals, resulting primarily from PCR bias, were identified as those with a count at least 8-fold higher (100-fold for the lower-quality Arc region) than the median count of the 5 × 5 subset of the counts matrix centered at the primer-primer pair in question; outlier counts were removed.</p><p>Primer-primer pair counts were then converted to fragment-fragment interaction counts by averaging the primer-primer counts that mapped to each fragment-fragment pair (max of 2 if both a forward/left-forward and a reverse/left-reverse primer were able to be designed to both fragments and were not trimmed during outlier removal). We then divided our 5 C regions into adjacent 4 kb bins and computed the relative interaction frequency of two bins (i, j) by summing the counts of all fragment-fragment interactions for which the coordinates of one of the constituent fragments overlapped (at least partially) a 12 kb window surrounding the center of the 4 kb i<sup>th</sup> bin and the other constituent fragment overlapped the 12 kb window surrounding the center of the j<sup>th</sup> bin.

appropriately to environmental stimuli. By combining elegant protein degradation and cell-specific knockout approaches with transcriptional profiling and chromatin structure analysis, this manuscript delineates the contributions of cohesin (a key protein responsible for genome structure and organization), in developmental and activity-dependent gene expression programs as well as chromatin reorganization. These results demonstrate that cohesin is required for the full expression of key genes required for the maturation and activation of cortical excitatory neurons, and reveal a tight correlation between cohesin effects and the genomic distance of higher-order chromatin loops.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76539.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Day</surname><given-names>Jeremy J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/008s83205</institution-id><institution>University of Alabama at Birmingham</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.02.24.432639">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.24.432639v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers agreed that there is somewhat of a disconnect between effects of Rad21 depletion on activity-dependent gene expression and activity-dependent loop formation.

Figure 5 convincingly shows that genes that are downregulated in RAD21 depleted neurons have longer HiC loop length, for both activity regulated genes and constitutive neuronal genes. However, in order to conclude that RAD21 effects on chromatin looping &quot;scales with the genomic distance traversed by their chromatin contacts&quot;, it would seem to be necessary to conduct a more detailed analysis showing that the effects of RAD21 depletion directly correlate with the genomic distance of HiC contacts. By binning HiC lengths and showing average effects of RAD21 depletion on mRNA by bin classes (e.g,. 0-50, 50-100, 100-500, 500+kb loop lengths), it may be possible to address this question. As it stands, we only know that RAD21 downregulated genes tend to have lengthier loops, not that RAD21 effects scale with chromatin loop lengths.</p><p>2. The incorporation of 5C to show the lack of effect for RAD21 depletion on Fos enhancer-promoter looping (Figure 6) is encouraging and confirms the overall model of cohesin-dependent gene expression. However, the observations at Bdnf (a defined SRG, Supp. Figure 11) resemble those at Fos – only constitutive loops are lost following RAD21 depletion, with variable effects on gene basal levels and inducibility. Were the authors able to specifically examine activity-dependent loops that are formed involving SRGs as a result of stimulation? It does not appear that 5C at a more delayed timepoint (e.g. after 6hr of KCl stimulation) was conducted. This would have provided an opportunity to examine the stimulus-dependent loops formed at the Bdnf locus, previously identified by Beagan, et al., (PMID: 32451484). Either way, the manuscript could be improved by addition of the Bdnf figure (Supp. Figure 11) as a main figure in the text.</p><p>3. Prior work demonstrates that AP1 transcription factors serve as a key regulator of stimulus-activated enhancers in cortical neurons (PMID: 25195102). Similarly, evidence from ATAC-seq experiments suggests that IEG enhancers are already fully accessible prior to stimulation (PMID: 32810208). In contrast, AP1 members that comprise part of the IEG program are thought to serve as pioneer transcription factors (in combination with cell-selective TFs) to open chromatin at SRG enhancers. This manuscript would benefit from a more systematic comparison of the effects of RAD21 on inducible vs. constitutive loops, similar to the analysis that was performed with inducible vs. constitutive genes.</p><p>4. Many constitutive neuronal genes are also long genes, and these may be more likely to be disrupted after RAD21 depletion and resulting changes in genome structure and organization. This manuscript should include a supplementary analysis to determine whether RAD21 effects scale with gene length itself, in addition to chromatin loop length.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I feel that a revised version of the paper should address my comments listed here:</p><p>There should be a discussion on whether cohesin dependence is scaling with loop length in other cell types as well.

To me, it is not entirely clear how the Authors arrived at these numbers. The number of activity regulated genes should be in the several hundreds, based on the literature (including the Kim et al., 2010 paper that the Authors cite). In any case, one wonders what type of conclusion can be drawn from such a small set of N-18 IEG genes.</p><p>The Authors , if I understood correctly, probed multiple genomic loci with 5C, but specific information on the sequences and loci probed is hard to find in the paper. From reading the paper, it is clear that c-Fos and BDNF and Arc gene loci (Figures S9-11) were probed with 5C. Please be more specific on the area of genome interrogated with 5C.</p><p>The sensitivity of chromosome conformation capture techniques to detect loops and contacts declines with increasing linear genome distance between the anchors. There should be a discussion and if necessary, a control experiment (I believe in silico may suffice) whether or not the reported cohesion- sensitivity of longer range chromatin loopings could be reflective of the overall lower baseline signal of longer range chromosomal loopings. If so, this would be a significant confound for the Authors conclusion of cohesion dependence scaling with loop length.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My questions about the study fall in two parts.</p><p>First, I am left wondering about the significance of the observations and the way they are presented. The relationship between Rad21 dependence and longer loop length is supported by the data, but I struggled to understand what that might mean. Is there anything else the authors can add about why this might be the case? Is this special in neurons and other postmitotic cells and if so what might that mean? More importantly, the authors include a paragraph in the discussion about how promoter-enhancer interactions might work independent of cohesin, which is interesting, and perhaps it is a major finding of the study that those enhancers do not require Rad21. If this is the most important finding then the fact that this study reaches a different conclusion that Yamada 2019 needs to be directly addressed. That study also knocked out Rad21 in postmitotic neurons (CGNs) but did report disruption of promoter-enhancer loops and activity-induced gene expression. These data may well be stronger than those, but the authors should directly address the differences in the findings.</p><p>Second, given that the authors find the expression of many ion channels and synaptic proteins impacted by the loss of Rad21, they need to consider that any changes they see in impaired induction of activity-regulated genes – such as the reduced activation of Bdnf IV in Suppl Figure 11 – may arise from impaired intracellular signaling rather than a specific effect of Rad21 on the architecture of the Bdnf gene. Controls for the activation of signaling cascades and transcription factors could be added to address this concern. The demonstration that much of the effect of Rad21 knockout on activity-regulated genes is their reduction at baseline is certainly consistent with this idea of reduced synaptic drive to these genes, which is ongoing in cultures. KCl addition may largely overcome those deficits by providing such a strong drive through LVGCCs.</p><p>A few other questions:</p><p>1) When the authors refer to &quot;activity-regulated genes&quot; for example in Figure 2C, do they include only genes induced by neuronal activity or also those repressed by neuronal activity? This distinction is important because the meaning of those genes begin &quot;Up&quot; or &quot;Down&quot; in the Rad21 cKO is very different depending on the sign of their response to neuronal stimulation. This should be explicitly stated.</p><p>2) The data in Figure 3a on the distribution of different cell types in the cortex of Rad21 cKO mice is entirely anecdotal as presented. If the data are to be included they should be quantified and analyzed with appropriate statistics.</p><p>3) The terms IEG and SRG for the ARG classes are used here in a way that is not consistent with the literature. The division between the terms as the authors use them here seems to be time (IEGs early and SRGs late) whereas in the past the terms had more to do with mechanism – IEGs did not require stimulus-induced protein synthesis before they could be turned on whereas SRGs did. (Basically cycloheximide does not block IEG induction but it does block SRG induction). The Tyssowski paper referenced by the authors uses the language PRG for primary response genes that do not require protein synthesis for their induction, and then divide them into early and delayed PRGs for the reflection of time. BDNF is a delayed PRG and following the stimuli used here it does not require protein synthesis for its induction. The authors may want to consider clarifying their use of their terms depending on whether time or mechanism of transcription is their main focus to match other literature.</p><p>4) There is a paper from Kim Nasmyth's lab that knocked out Rad21 in postmitotic neurons of the fly with relatively severe phenotypes. By contrast at least the morphological phenotypes in the images in Suppl Figure 4 seem quite mild. This might be an important point of discussion if it is the case that the consequences of Rad21 function are different by species?</p><p>5) It is a little surprising that all the data from the final paragraphs on activity-regulated genes are in the supplementary figures. This points to evidence that the authors do not consider these to be the most important of their findings, which is slightly out of balance with the attention paid to activity-dependent genes in the text. Perhaps a rewrite of the paper would make the significance of the findings more obvious.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76539.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers agreed that there is somewhat of a disconnect between effects of Rad21 depletion on activity-dependent gene expression and activity-dependent loop formation.

A substantial number of LRGs in macrophages rely on the expression of early-induced interferons (IFN), which act in an autocrine and paracrine manner to support LRG induction (Glass and Natoli, 2016).

There should be a discussion and if necessary, a control experiment (I believe in silico may suffice) whether or not the reported cohesion- sensitivity of longer range chromatin loopings could be reflective of the overall lower baseline signal of longer range chromosomal loopings. If so, this would be a significant confound for the Authors conclusion of cohesion dependence scaling with loop length.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee that &quot;the sensitivity of chromosome conformation capture techniques to detect loops and contacts declines with increasing linear genome distance&quot;, and that it is important to ask whether or not the apparent cohesin-sensitivity of longer chromatin loops could arise simply because longer loops are weaker. We find that the observed strength of longer loops is consistently different between wild-type and cohesin-deficient neurons (New Figure 8 —figure supplement 1a, loops from Figure 1e), and between resting and activated wild-type neurons for the 1.68Mb inducible loop at the <italic>Bdnf</italic> locus (New Figure 8 —figure supplement 1a, loops from Figure 8e). At the <italic>Fos</italic> locus we observe a 155kb CTCF-based, cohesin-dependent loop, and two enhancer-promoter loops that are shorter (20-35kb) and remain fully inducible in cohesin-deficient cells. Despite differences in loop length, cohesin-dependent and cohesin-independent loops at the <italic>Fos</italic> locus are comparable in strength: The observed strength of the CTCF-based, cohesin-dependent loop in wild-type cells is ~1400. Both cohesin-independent inducible loops are comparable in strength to the CTCF-based, cohesin-dependent loop (~1650 in KCl<sup>-</sup>stimulated wild-type cells for the 35 kb loop between <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic> enhancer 1, and ~2900 for the cohesin-independent inducible 20kb loop between <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic> enhancer 2 in KCl<sup>-</sup>stimulated wild-type cells, New Figure 8 —figure supplement 1a, loops from Figure 6e).</p><p>Nevertheless, as stated by the referee, the observed values are highly biased by the distance-dependent background signal, the y-axes are on different scales, and the observed values for loop strength therefore need to be used with caution for claims regarding loop strength. New Figure 8 —figure supplement 1b therefore shows the observed loop strength after correction for the distance-dependent background signal (as described by Beagan et al., 2020). This approach allows an assessment of loop strength across distances. The y-axes are now on the same scale, allowing an appreciation of cohesin effects on loop strength, despite the differences in distance. This analysis indicates that the claimed differences in cohesin-dependence exist, independent of differences in loop length (New Figure 8 —figure supplement 1b). We have revised the discussion to state:</p><p>&quot;While longer loops are inherently weaker than shorter loops, the observed differences in loop strength were robust to correction for the distance-dependent background signal. This indicates that our 5C approach reliably quantifies the strength of both long and short loops&quot;.</p><p>Of note, in addition to the cohesin sensitivity of loop formation itself, our study also links the degree to which gene expression is sensitive to cohesin with the length of chromatin loops that are formed by these genes. For this analysis, we measure deregulated gene expression by RNA-seq of wild-type and cohesin-deficient cells, and relate the results to the length of chromatin loops called in Hi-C data from wild-type cells. In this case, the issue of loop length versus loop strength does not arise, because (i) loops are called in wild type Hi-C and (ii) RNA-seq is not sensitive to loop length.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My questions about the study fall in two parts.</p><p>First, I am left wondering about the significance of the observations and the way they are presented. The relationship between Rad21 dependence and longer loop length is supported by the data, but I struggled to understand what that might mean. Is there anything else the authors can add about why this might be the case? Is this special in neurons and other postmitotic cells and if so what might that mean? More importantly, the authors include a paragraph in the discussion about how promoter-enhancer interactions might work independent of cohesin, which is interesting, and perhaps it is a major finding of the study that those enhancers do not require Rad21. If this is the most important finding then the fact that this study reaches a different conclusion that Yamada 2019 needs to be directly addressed. That study also knocked out Rad21 in postmitotic neurons (CGNs) but did report disruption of promoter-enhancer loops and activity-induced gene expression. These data may well be stronger than those, but the authors should directly address the differences in the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Our findings indicate that short enhancer-promoter loops at the <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Arc</italic> loci form in the absence of cohesin, while a much longer 1.68Mb enhancer-promoter loop at the <italic>Bdnf</italic> locus requires cohesin (new data in revised Figure 8). Constitutive, CTCF-based loops also require cohesin. Correlative evidence shows that genes that are deregulated in cohesin-deficient neurons engage in longer loops than genes that are expressed at wild-type levels. This suggests – but does not prove – that the shorter loops associated with genes expressed at wild-type levels may remain intact in the absence of cohesin.</p><p>The ability of short enhancer-promoter loops to form – or at least persist – in the absence of cohesin does not appear to be unique to neurons or post-mitotic cells. Specifically, shorter enhancer-promoter loops are more likely to persist after acute cohesin depletion in HeLa cells than longer loops (Thiecke et al., 2020). Similarly, two recent preprints report short – but not long – enhancer-promoter loops in the absence of cohesin (Kane et al., 2021; Rinzema et al., 2021).</p><p>We suggest that our data do not contradict the findings reported by Yamada et al., 2019. The Yamada study lacked sufficient resolution for the analysis of individual loops, and the authors performed aggregate loop analysis instead. This approach would not have uncovered a subset of shorter loops that persist in the absence of cohesin. Similarly, the analysis of gene expression by Yamada et al., 2019 grouped genes into modules, and would not have uncovered the subset of inducible genes that remain inducible in the absence of cohesin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, given that the authors find the expression of many ion channels and synaptic proteins impacted by the loss of Rad21, they need to consider that any changes they see in impaired induction of activity-regulated genes – such as the reduced activation of Bdnf IV in Suppl Figure 11 – may arise from impaired intracellular signaling rather than a specific effect of Rad21 on the architecture of the Bdnf gene. Controls for the activation of signaling cascades and transcription factors could be added to address this concern. The demonstration that much of the effect of Rad21 knockout on activity-regulated genes is their reduction at baseline is certainly consistent with this idea of reduced synaptic drive to these genes, which is ongoing in cultures. KCl addition may largely overcome those deficits by providing such a strong drive through LVGCCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee that defects in maturation and connectivity likely contribute to the deregulation of baseline gene expression in <italic>Rad21</italic> NexCre neurons, but can be partially are overcome by stimulation with KCl or BDNF. This is one of the reasons we performed parallel experiments with acutely cohesin-depleted neurons.</p><p>We are not aware of signaling pathways that would unambiguously distinguish the subset of neuronal LRGs that are fully induced in the absence of cohesin from the subset of neuronal LRGs that remain deregulated in the absence of cohesin. We have added to the discussion that TFs encoded by IEGs are required for the induction of LRGs, and that these IEGs are fully induced in cohesin-deficient neurons.</p><p>&quot;IEG-encoded transcription factors such as the AP1 members encoded by <italic>Fos, FosB</italic> and <italic>JunB</italic> facilitate the induction of LRGs (Malik et al., 2014). Our data show that IEG-encoded transcription factors remain fully inducible in cohesin-deficient neurons. The failure to induce a subset of LRGs to wild-type levels is therefore not explained by a lack of IEG-encoded factors. This is in marked contrast to inducible gene expression in cohesin-deficient macrophages. A substantial number of LRGs in macrophages rely on the expression of early-induced interferons (IFN), which act in an autocrine and paracrine manner to support LRG induction (Glass and Natoli, 2016). Expression of IFN-dependent LRGs can be partially rescued by provision of exogenous IFN to cohesin-deficient macrophages (Cuartero et al., 2018)&quot;.</p><p>We agree that the failure of cohesin-deficient neurons to express certain genes at wild-type levels in may not necessarily result from defective chromatin architecture at each deregulated gene, but in some cases may arise from disturbances in upstream regulatory mechanisms, such as the activity of specific signaling pathways or the expression of particular transcription factors. We have added a Discussion section to acknowledge this:</p><p>&quot;In addition to defective chromatin architecture, deregulated expression of a particular gene may also arise from disturbances in upstream regulatory mechanisms, such as the activity of specific signaling pathways, or the expression of particular transcription factors. We are not aware of signaling pathways that would unambiguously distinguish the subset of neuronal LRGs that are fully induced in the absence of cohesin from the subset of neuronal LRGs that remain deregulated in the absence of cohesin. As discussed above, TFs encoded by IEGs are required for the induction of LRGs. Of note, these IEGs are fully induced in cohesin-deficient neurons.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A few other questions:</p><p>1) When the authors refer to &quot;activity-regulated genes&quot; for example in Figure 2C, do they include only genes induced by neuronal activity or also those repressed by neuronal activity? This distinction is important because the meaning of those genes begin &quot;Up&quot; or &quot;Down&quot; in the Rad21 cKO is very different depending on the sign of their response to neuronal stimulation. This should be explicitly stated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for this important comment. We indeed focus our analysis on inducible activity-regulated genes. We now explicitly refer to &quot;inducible ARGs&quot; in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data in Figure 3a on the distribution of different cell types in the cortex of Rad21 cKO mice is entirely anecdotal as presented. If the data are to be included they should be quantified and analyzed with appropriate statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee. Figure 3a of the revised manuscript now presents a quantitative analysis of TBR1<sup>+</sup> and CTIP2<sup>+</sup> neurons in the subplate and in layers 5 and 6 (LV and VI) in control and <italic>Rad21</italic> NexCre brains at E16.5. We have added the following passage to the Results section:</p><p>&quot;While the total numbers of TBR1<sup>+</sup> and CTIP2<sup>+</sup> neurons were comparable in wild-type and <italic>Rad21</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> cortices, TBR1<sup>+</sup> and CTIP2<sup>+</sup> neurons were reduced in the subplate and increased in layers 6 and 7 <italic>Rad21</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> <italic>Nex</italic><sup>Cre</sup> cortices.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The terms IEG and SRG for the ARG classes are used here in a way that is not consistent with the literature. The division between the terms as the authors use them here seems to be time (IEGs early and SRGs late) whereas in the past the terms had more to do with mechanism – IEGs did not require stimulus-induced protein synthesis before they could be turned on whereas SRGs did. (Basically cycloheximide does not block IEG induction but it does block SRG induction). The Tyssowski paper referenced by the authors uses the language PRG for primary response genes that do not require protein synthesis for their induction, and then divide them into early and delayed PRGs for the reflection of time. BDNF is a delayed PRG and following the stimuli used here it does not require protein synthesis for its induction. The authors may want to consider clarifying their use of their terms depending on whether time or mechanism of transcription is their main focus to match other literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a clear definition of gene sets will benefit the manuscript. We used inducible ARGs described by Kim et al., 2010 for our initial analysis. The number of ARGs with assigned P-values across RNA-seq conditions was n = 298 in the RiboTag RNA-seq of <italic>Rad21</italic> NexCre neurons and n = 305 in the RNA-seq analysis of <italic>Rad21</italic> NexCre neurons.</p><p>For the definition of ARG classes we used gene sets curated by Tyssowski et al., 2018. We refer to rapidly induced, translation-independent ARGs as IEGs (these genes are called rIEGs in Tyssowski et al., 2018, and IEGs in Beagan et al., 2020). To describe late-induced ARGs we had initially adopted the term 'SRG' from Beagan et al., 2020. However, in light of the referees' comments we refer to late-induced ARGs as 'LRGs' in the revised manuscript. LRGs are called translation-independent delayed PRGs and translation-dependent SRGs by Tyssowski et al., 2018.</p><p>The number of IEGs as defined by Tyssowski et al., 2018, Supplementary Table 5 is n = 19. Of these, n = 18 had assigned P-values in all conditions of our RNA-seq analysis and informative Hi-C data, and were included in our analysis.</p><p>The number of fully annotated LRGs as defined by Tyssowski et al., 2018, Supplementary Table 5 is n = 149 (comprised of 113 delayed translation-independent PRGs and n = 36 translation-dependent SRGs). Of these, the number of LRGs with assigned P-values across RNA-seq conditions were n = 107 in the RNA-seq analysis of <italic>Rad21</italic> NexCre neurons, n = 101 in the RNA-seq analysis of RAD21-TEV neurons, and n = 99 in the RNA-seq analysis of transiently RAD21-depleted and subsequently reconstituted neurons.</p><p>For inclusion in the comparison of chromatin loop length versus gene expression in cohesin-deficient neurons, ARGs had to meet the following criteria: (i) assigned P-values across RNA-seq conditions, (ii) downregulation or no deregulation across TTX and KCl conditions (ARGs that were downregulated in either TTX or KCl but not in both were excluded), and (iii) informative Hi-C data had to be available for the genomic region of each gene. These conditions were met by n = 18 IEGs, n = 22 downregulated LRGs, and n = 43 non-deregulated LRGs.</p><p>We have added this information to the methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is a paper from Kim Nasmyth's lab that knocked out Rad21 in postmitotic neurons of the fly with relatively severe phenotypes. By contrast at least the morphological phenotypes in the images in Suppl Figure 4 seem quite mild. This might be an important point of discussion if it is the case that the consequences of Rad21 function are different by species?</p></disp-quote><p>The observed changes may appear mild at first sight, but the data in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1a show that neuronal Rad21is required for postnatal viability in mice. We found <italic>Rad21</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> NexCre mice at the expected Mendelian ratios up to the end of gestation, but none were alive by 2 weeks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is a little surprising that all the data from the final paragraphs on activity-regulated genes are in the supplementary figures. This points to evidence that the authors do not consider these to be the most important of their findings, which is slightly out of balance with the attention paid to activity-dependent genes in the text. Perhaps a rewrite of the paper would make the significance of the findings more obvious.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for this important comment. To re-balance the manuscript we have (i) strengthened the developmental aspects of the manuscript by adding the quantitative analysis or cortical layer organisation discussed above (ii) added new data on the formation of an inducible <italic>Bdnf</italic> loop (revised Figure 8) and (iii) moved important data into main figures, specifically <italic>Bdnf</italic> (revised Figure 8), and the rescue of inducible gene expression by cohesin (revised Figure 5d and 6b).</p></body></sub-article></article>
