Effective prevention is urgently needed as the drivers of disease transmission continue to intensify. The key challenge has been developing a widely applicable vaccine that protects against the &gt;300 serovars that can cause leptospirosis. Live attenuated mutants are enticing vaccine candidates and poorly explored in the field. We evaluated a recently characterized motility-deficient mutant lacking the expression of a flagellar protein, FcpA. Although the <italic>fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant has lost its ability to cause disease, transient bacteremia was observed. In two animal models, immunization with a single dose of the <italic>fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant was sufficient to induce a robust anti-protein antibodies response that promoted protection against infection with different pathogenic Leptospira species. Furthermore, characterization of the immune response identified a small repertoire of biologically relevant proteins that are highly conserved among pathogenic Leptospira species and potential correlates of cross-protective immunity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Leptospirosis is a life-threatening disease with flu-like symptoms that is caused by bacteria known as <italic>Leptospira</italic>. It is more common in warmer regions with high rainfall, especially in impoverished areas. The disease is spread in the urine of animals such as rodents, farm animals or dogs. Humans and other animals can get leptospirosis when they come in contact with urine-contaminated water and soil.</p><p>Current measures to control leptospirosis are largely ineffective. Although a vaccine is available for animals, it only protects against a few types of the 300 disease-causing <italic>Leptospira</italic> bacteria. It also fails to stop the bacteria from colonizing the kidneys of the infected animals, which means that vaccinated animals can still spread disease.</p><p>Previous research has shown that inactivating a protein called FcpA, which is necessary for <italic>Leptospira</italic> bacteria to move, can stop them from infecting hamsters. Moreover, when these animals were exposed to the mutant bacteria, they did not get sick nor developed the disease. Here, Wunder et al. tested whether bacteria lacking the FcpA protein could be used as an attenuated vaccine. This form of vaccine contains live bacteria that have been modified to become harmless but are able to train the immune system to produce a long-lasting immune response against the invaders.</p><p>The results showed that a single dose of the vaccine was enough to prevent hamsters and mice from dying of leptospirosis. It also worked against several types of <italic>Leptospira</italic> and could stop them from colonizing mice kidneys. Moreover, Wunder et al. found that the immune system targeted specific proteins that were common to various types of <italic>Leptospira</italic>, which may explain the broad spectrum of protection the vaccine offered.</p><p>Rapid urbanization and climate change are among the main drivers of leptospirosis. An effective vaccine for this disease would reduce the public health burden by providing protection against leptospirosis and by reducing the spread of the disease. A next step will be to ensure the mutant <italic>Leptospira</italic> are safe to use in animals and potentially humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>leptospira</kwd><kwd>live attenuated vaccine</kwd><kwd>leptospirosis</kwd><kwd>cross-protective immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI052473</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wunder</surname><given-names>Elsio A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ko</surname><given-names>Albert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01AI088752</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wunder</surname><given-names>Elsio A</given-names></name><name><surname>Adhikarla</surname><given-names>Haritha</given-names></name><name><surname>Ko</surname><given-names>Albert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01TW009504</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wunder</surname><given-names>Elsio A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ko</surname><given-names>Albert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI121207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wunder</surname><given-names>Elsio A</given-names></name><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name><name><surname>Felgner</surname><given-names>Philip L</given-names></name><name><surname>Ko</surname><given-names>Albert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Science without Borders</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hamond</surname><given-names>Camila</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A single dose of a characterized motility-deficient mutant was sufficient to induce robust anti-protein antibodies' response and cross-protective immunity against death and colonization in two different animal models of leptospirosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Leptospirosis is caused by a genetically and antigenically diverse group of spirochetes of the Leptospira genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Picardeau, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adler, 2015</xref>). Currently the Leptospira genus comprises 64 species with more than 300 serovars, with 17 of those species containing strains that can potentially cause severe disease in humans and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casanovas-Massana et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vincent et al., 2019</xref>). A broad range of mammalian reservoirs harbor the spirochete in their renal tubules shedding the bacteria in their urine for long periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thibeaux et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). Leptospirosis is an environmentally¬†transmitted disease with great health and economic impact in both humans and animals, for which the primary mode of transmission to humans is through contact with contaminated water or soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casanovas-Massana et al., 2018a</xref>).</p><p>Although Leptospira has a worldwide distribution, the large majority of the burden occurs in the world‚Äôs most impoverished populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costa et al., 2015</xref>), where the rapid growth of urban slums worldwide has created conditions for rat-borne transmission. The disease causes life-threatening manifestations such as Weil‚Äôs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ko et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adler, 2015</xref>) and leptospiral¬†pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome (LPHS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gouveia et al., 2008</xref>). A recent study estimated that leptospirosis causes 1.03 million cases and 58,900 deaths each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costa et al., 2015</xref>). Case fatality for Weil‚Äôs disease and LPHS is¬†&gt;10 and¬†&gt;50%, respectively, despite aggressive supportive care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gouveia et al., 2008</xref>). These estimates place leptospirosis as a leading zoonotic cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The burden of leptospirosis will increase as climate and land use change continues to evolve and the world‚Äôs slum population doubles to 2¬†billion by 2025 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">UN-HABITAT, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The public health priority is therefore prevention of leptospirosis before severe complications develop. However, there is no effective control for leptospirosis and safe and efficacious vaccines are not available for human use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Picardeau, 2017</xref>). China and Cuba use whole-cell vaccines in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mart√≠nez et al., 2004</xref>), but they are not licensed to be used elsewhere. Whole-cell vaccines are widely used for veterinary purposes but have significant limitations, since immunity is of short duration and predominantly humoral against LPS, which are serovar-specific moieties. Multivalent vaccines are unable to achieve sufficient coverage against the spectrum of serovars that are important for animal and human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adler, 2015</xref>). Research has thus focused on characterizing surface-associated and host-expressed proteins as sub-unit vaccine candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ko et al., 2009</xref>). To date, these conventional approaches have not yielded candidates and attempts have failed to identify a universal, widely¬†applicable vaccine.</p><p>Current control measures have been uniformly ineffective in addressing the large human and animal global health burden due to leptospirosis, especially in developing countries. Given the limitations of the whole-cell vaccines available and the ineffective attempts to identify protein vaccine candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adler, 2015</xref>), an attenuated-vaccine approach remains a feasible strategy. Attenuation of Leptospira virulence has been long-recognized yet poorly¬†understood phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Srikram et al., 2011</xref>). Until recently, the inability to produce well-defined mutants has preempted efforts to identify a safe and efficacious attenuated-vaccine. However, current advances in genomic tools and whole-genome sequencing data for Leptospira (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thibeaux et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Picardeau, 2017</xref>) have circumvented this limitation and some promising results have been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Srikram et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murray et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Recently, our group identified and characterized a novel flagellar protein in the Leptospira genus involved in the composition of the sheath of the leptospiral flagella, Flagella-coil protein A (FcpA). A mutant deficient in the <italic>fcpA</italic> gene lost its ability to produce translational motility and to penetrate mucous membranes, resulting in loss of kidney colonization and lethality in the hamster model of leptospirosis. Although highly attenuated in the hamster model, a needle inoculation of the mutant produced a transient bacteremia prior to clearance by the host immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wunder et al., 2016a</xref>). In the present study, we evaluated the <italic>fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic> motility-deficient mutant as a potential candidate for a live attenuated-vaccine that could provide a major public health benefit and opportunity to leverage One Health approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A motility-deficient strain as an attenuated-vaccine candidate</title><p>We characterized a previously¬†unidentified flagellar sheath protein (FcpA) that was essential for translational motility and thus for virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wunder et al., 2016a</xref>). Despite the phenotype of complete attenuation, we observed that the L1-130 <italic>fcpA</italic><sup>-</sup> mutant caused a transient systemic infection, which was cleared 7 days after intraperitoneal inoculation of 10<sup>8</sup> leptospires in hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wunder et al., 2016a</xref>). In this study, after inoculation of 10<sup>7</sup> leptospires using the subcutaneous route of infection in hamsters, we detected the¬†presence of DNA of the mutant by qPCR in all the tissues tested, with the exception of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These results were similar to those observed previously, with the wild-type reaching higher number of leptospires in all tissues analyzed, leading to the death or euthanasia of the animals due to clinical signs of disease 5‚Äì7 days after infection. In comparison, the signal for the <italic>fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant strain was undetectable after 7 days with all inoculated animals surviving with no detectable leptospires in either kidney or blood, measured by qPCR and culture. Similarly, no detectable signal was observed for the animals immunized with the L1-130 heat-killed strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We also tested the <italic>fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant in the mouse model using different doses of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although the dose of the wild-type strain was not enough to produce disease and lethality on infected mice, all animals were colonized and the presence of the leptospiral DNA in blood was detectable until the fifteenth day after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, no dose of the <italic>fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant caused colonization (data not shown) and there was a significant difference in the magnitude of dissemination of the mutant in the blood compared to the wild¬†type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). DNA signal of the <italic>fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant was only observed in the blood of animals infected with doses of 10<sup>7</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> until the 13th and 8th day after infection, respectively. Taken together, these results indicate that although the <italic>fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant is attenuated in both the hamster and mouse model, there is a hematogenous dissemination of this mutant, identified by detection of its DNA. The mutant appears to be cleared by the immune system before it results in observable disease or death of the animals. Furthermore, we observed in the mouse model that the dissemination of the mutant is dose dependent. However, it is important to notice that although we do¬†not see any signal of the mutant in doses equal or lower to 10<sup>3</sup> leptospires, the theoretic limit of detection of the qPCR assay used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wunder et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stoddard et al., 2009</xref>)¬†is 100 leptospires/mL of blood which can result in false negative results.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dissemination of L1-130 <italic>fcpA</italic><sup>-</sup> mutant in animal tissues.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Kinetics of infection of L1-130 WT, L1-130 <italic>fcpA</italic><sup>-</sup> vaccine, and L1-130 heat-killed vaccine in blood, kidney, liver, and brain of hamsters after inoculation with 10<sup>7</sup> bacteria.

Immunization with a single dose of the <italic>fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) conferred complete protection against mortality in hamsters from infection with homologous and heterologous serovars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In contrast, immunization with heat-killed leptospires conferred partial protection to the homologous but not against the heterologous serovar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Heat-killed bacterins can give a high protection level against an homologous challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adler, 2015</xref>), but usually the protocol for vaccination includes at least a second dose of the vaccine. Our poor results here with the heat-killed vaccine, especially for the homologous challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), might be due to the lack of a vaccine boost. For the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of the attenuated-vaccine after a single dose, we decided to keep a standard protocol for vaccination and thus using only one dose of the heat-killed vaccine as well. It¬†is important to mention that the strain Hardjo 203 was described to cause only colonization in the hamster model infected by intraperitoneal route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zuerner et al., 2012</xref>). However, in our LD<sub>50</sub> experiments using the conjunctival route we reproducibly observed 25% death rate when using the conjunctival route (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Furthermore, in the non-vaccinated group we observed an overall death rate of 21.4% after challenge with the strain Hardjo 203, but no deaths in the vaccinated group, which explains the wide 95% CI range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and Table S2).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Efficacy of L1-130 <italic>fcpA</italic><sup>-</sup> attenuated-vaccine model.</title><p>Animals were vaccinated with a dose of 10<sup>7</sup> leptospires (hamsters) or a range of doses from 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>1</sup> leptospires (mice) by subcutaneous¬†(SC) route.

These authors made the important finding that immunization with an attenuated, LPS-deficient strain of serovar Manilae conferred varied levels of cross-protection against different species after one or two doses of the attenuated-vaccine. In our experiments, immunization with a single dose of the live <italic>fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant conferred complete protection against death after heterologous infection on both hamster and mouse models. This result is highlighted by the poor performance of the heat-killed vaccine when given in a single dose. Given the promising results obtained with a single dose of the attenuated-vaccine, a boost dose was not evaluated. However, it should be considered for future experiments. Furthermore, we observed that the cross-protection against death after vaccination with the <italic>fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant was dose dependent in the mouse model. In another spirochete, a similar approach has been successfully explored when a single dose of a flagella-less mutant in <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> induced homologous protection in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sadziene et al., 1996</xref>). More recently, a target mutant in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> induced cross immunity, but four immunizations were necessary for full protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hahn et al., 2016</xref>). Previous work with attenuated-vaccine in Leptospira showed evidence of protection against homologous challenge in guinea-pigs, cattle, hamsters, and swine, but only partial cross-protection in hamsters and gerbils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Srikram et al., 2011</xref>).

Other than reduction of lethality, the ability to prevent transmission is a key parameter to determine the success and feasibility of a leptospiral vaccine. Whole-cell vaccines have shown divergent levels of protection against colonization in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sonada et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clough et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolin and Alt, 2001</xref>). In our hamster model we observed a significant reduction of the bacterial burden in the kidney of vaccinated animals, without significant levels of protection. Mice models are good alternatives for sublethal leptospirosis infection and particularly to study renal colonization, compared to the highly susceptible hamster model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gomes-Solecki et al., 2017</xref>). However, the mice model lacks information about susceptibility to a wide range of strains compared to hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gomes-Solecki et al., 2017</xref>), and for that reason we were only able to test serovar Manilae as an heterologous model to the serovar Copenhageni attenuated-vaccine. Previous experiments in mice showed that if the challenge dose is not able to cause death of the animals, a portion of the sublethal dose of leptospires is able to escape the blood defenses and colonize the kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ratet et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the dose of infection necessary to cause disease in natural infection remains unclear, although recent research showed that the numbers of leptospires available in the environment are low on average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casanovas-Massana et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ganoza et al., 2006</xref>).

Serovar-specific protection correlates with agglutinating antibody titers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chapman et al., 1991</xref>), which are directed against lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Challa et al., 2011</xref>). Anti-leptospiral LPS antibodies are generated by whole-cell based vaccines, and the restricted protection these vaccines confer is one of their major limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adler, 2015</xref>). Recently, immunization with an attenuated, LPS-deficient strain of serovar Manilae conferred protection against infection with serovar Pomona and other <italic>L. interrogan</italic>s species, suggesting that anti-Leptospira protein responses are indeed cross-protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Srikram et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murray et al., 2018</xref>). Our results not only corroborate those previous studies, but also shows strong evidence, through passive transfer experiments, that the cross-protection mediated by anti-protein antibodies is transferable.</p><p>Comprehensive high-throughput analysis of the antibody response identified potential protein candidates with a major role on the cross-protection conferred by live-attenuated-vaccine. The attenuated-vaccine induced a robust anti-Leptospira protein antibody response, but these antibodies recognized a limited repertoire of 154 antigens. Although the numbers in our study are higher compared to the 11 proteins reported by a similar study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Srikram et al., 2011</xref>), this difference likely relates to the significantly higher sensitivity of the proteome array compared to the 2-DIGE method used previously. Nevertheless, our approach was validated by the enrichment analysis of the reactive proteins, which showed that proteins classified as OMP and cytoplasmic membrane-associated, and proteins predicted to be involved in cell wall/membrane and intracellular trafficking/secretion were highly enriched among the selected proteins. Moreover, using two animal models and different doses of the vaccine allowed us to reduce this number to 41 selected proteins, characterizing correlates of immunity. By implementing a systematic approach to identifying cross-protective antigens, we address a critical barrier to exploiting this database of genomic information for vaccine discovery.</p><p>Given the limitations of the whole-cell vaccines currently in use, identifying the perfect protein candidate has been a major effort in the field of vaccine development for leptospirosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adler, 2015</xref>). Immunization with Lig proteins or LipL32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conrad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Humphryes et al., 2014</xref>) has been shown to confer protection, albeit not cross-protective immunity, against experimental infection. However, efficacy results have been proven difficult to replicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deveson Lucas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ko et al., 2009</xref>). As of yet we do not know whether a single protein can be immunoprotective or if the additive value of immunity against a group of proteins is essential for cross-immunity. Lately, studies have shown that a chimeric approach has the potential for an effective universal vaccine against leptospirosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Santos and Nascimento, 2018</xref>). Other than Ligs and LipL32, LipL41 has been tested as a vaccine candidate without success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ko et al., 2009</xref>) and LIC20172 and LIC11966 have been identified and tested, respectively, as promising candidates for subunit vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lata et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oliveira et al., 2018</xref>). More recently, a DNA vaccine delivering two leptospiral proteins (RecA and FliD) has shown promising results including high survival rates, sterilizing immunity and heterologous protection, although tested only among two different <italic>L. interrogans</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raja et al., 2018</xref>). A major limitation for vaccine development for leptospirosis is the lack of evidence whether immunological correlates from experimental animals are relevant to human disease. However, our results suggest that the same antigens that¬†confer cross-protective immunity in the attenuated-vaccine model may play a role in naturally¬†acquired immunity in humans.</p><p>This study is the first description of vaccine that elicits cross-protection against disease caused by different species of the genus Leptospira, and that the protection is transferable through anti-protein antibodies. Effective prevention is urgently needed as drivers of disease transmission continue to intensify, like rapid urbanization and climate change. The <italic>fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant induced robust and cross-protective immune responses against protein moieties conserved across pathogenic Leptospira. We identified a small repertoire of biologically relevant proteins that can be used in the field of vaccine and diagnostic development for leptospirosis. Characterization of these proteins as novel putative virulence factors can also provide new insights on the pathogenesis of the disease. Both approaches are currently being tested by our group as we try to identify an absolute correlate of immunity for leptospirosis. Nonetheless, these findings indicate that a single dose of <italic>fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant elicits cross-protective immunity against serovars belonging to species of Leptospira that encompasses the majority of serovars of human and animal health importance. Taken together, those findings highlight the feasibility to use this model to formulate novel approaches for prevention, such as a synergistic development of vaccines for human and animal health in a diverse range of epidemiological settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Fiocruz L1-130 <italic>fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wunder et al., 2016a</xref> doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.13403">10.1111/mmi.13403</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><italic>L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Fiocruz L1-130 <italic>fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Peroxidase AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Immuno Research</td><td valign="top">Cat# 115-035-166 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2338511">AB_2338511</ext-link></td><td valign="top">ELISA (1:50,000) <break/>WB (1:100,000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Peroxidase AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Immuno Research</td><td valign="top">Cat# 107-035-142 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2337454">AB_2337454</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB (1:100,000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Hamster Œ±-<italic>fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic> sera (Hamster polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">See Material and methods <break/>WB (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Hamster control sera (Hamster polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">See Material and methods <break/>WB (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">SureBlue Reserve TMB 1-Component Microwell Peroxidase Substrate</td><td valign="top">SeraCare</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: 5120‚Äì0081</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Sulfuric Acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: 258105</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Proteinase K</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: EO0491</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Platinum Quantitative PCR Supermix-UDG</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: 11730017</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">GraphPad Prism software</td><td valign="top">GraphPad Software</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015807">SCR_015807</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Version 8.0.0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">RStudio software</td><td valign="top">RStudio</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000432">SCR_000432</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Version 1.0.153</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Vaccine and challenge strains</title><p>Leptospires were cultivated in liquid EMJH medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson and Harris, 1967</xref>) supplemented with 1% rabbit serum. <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 <italic>fcpA<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wunder et al., 2016a</xref>) and all the seven different strains used for the challenge experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were incubated up to 7 days at 29¬∞C, till they reached log phase (between 4¬†and¬†5 days of culture).

Hamsters and mice were monitored twice daily for endpoints including signs of disease and death, up to 28-days and 14-days post-infection, respectively. Surviving animals at the end of the experiment or moribund animals presenting with difficulty moving, breathing or signs of bleeding or seizure were immediately sacrificed by inhalation of CO2. Before each blood collection animals were anesthetized by an open-drop method with a mixture of 20% v/v isoflurane in propylene glycol.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6"

We included in the legend of Figure 2 the route of challenged used in those experiments, for both hamsters and mice. We also included a sentence to make it clear that the analysis for efficacy was done using a combination of all experiments.</p><p>With regards the request to include control group in the figure, we appreciate the suggestion. However, since the sections A to E of Figure 2 are analysis regarding the efficacy of the vaccine, which was calculated using the results obtained from the PBS control group, that information can‚Äôt be included on this figure without compromising its purpose. We hope that the information included in the revised Supplementary files 2 and 3 are sufficient to satisfy the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Only one dose of the heat-killed vaccine is used as a control, instead of 2 (subsection ‚ÄúModel for cross-protective immunity to leptospirosis‚Äù). Why was not the vaccine administered as commonly used (i.e., 2 doses)?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the question from the reviewer. Our goal in this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of the attenuated vaccine after a single dose, given that according to our hypothesis the strain was able to multiply in the host and stimulate the immune system, which would be enough to mount a strong immunity. For that reason and to avoid different doses comparisons we decided to keep a standard protocol of vaccination using only dose for all vaccines. To make this decision clear, we added to the Results section a brief explanation that hopefully will satisfy the reviewer and help the readers: ‚ÄúFor the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of the attenuated vaccine after a single dose, we decided to keep a standard protocol for vaccination and thus using only one dose of the heat-killed vaccine as well‚Äù.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did the authors try two doses or more of the fcpA- vaccine? If so, that could be discussed in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed we never tried a boost dose of the attenuated vaccine after the promising results obtained with a single dose. But we acknowledge that for future experiments more doses of the vaccine should be evaluated. We included a sentence in the Discussion section: ‚ÄúGiven the promising results obtained with a single dose of the attenuated vaccine, a boost dose was not evaluated. However, it should be considered for future experiments.‚Äù</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the proteome array, the authors should better explain the rationale for comparing all vaccine doses (mouse) to 10e7 dose (mouse), and not only 10e7 mouse to 10e7 hamster.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers suggestion. We made the decision to consider the analysis of all vaccine doses in mouse given the observation that the protection either for colonization and death in the mouse model was related to the dose of the vaccine. With that analysis, we could identify protein candidates that were potentially involved on those outcomes when performing this combined analysis. We included in the analysis section of the text one sentence to justify the choice: ‚ÄúThe decision of those analysis group was made based on the fact that the high dose of the vaccine in mouse (Mouse 10<sup>7</sup>) was the same as in the hamster experiments (Hamster 10<sup>7</sup>) and was the only dose in mouse that gave 100% protection against death and colonization. Furthermore, the other doses (Mouse all) provided different levels of protection when combining death and colonization and the comparison analysis of all those three groups would increase our chances to identify potential protein targets with a role in those outcomes.‚Äù</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The Discussion should not start with a new introduction but with the major findings. So start with the last sentence of the first paragraph.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer suggestion. We agree that the suggestion improves the message, and we shifted the order of the paragraph starting with the sentence mentioned by the reviewer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
