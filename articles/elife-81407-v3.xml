containing neurotransmitter. Presynaptic output is a function of the density of calcium channels, the dynamic properties of the channel, the distance to docked vesicles, and the release probability at the docking site. We demonstrate that at <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> neuromuscular junctions two different classes of voltage-gated calcium channels, CaV2 and CaV1, mediate the release of distinct pools of synaptic vesicles. CaV2 channels are concentrated in densely packed clusters ~250 nm in diameter with the active zone proteins Neurexin, α-Liprin, SYDE, ELKS/CAST, RIM-BP, α-Catulin, and MAGI1. CaV2 channels are colocalized with the priming protein UNC-13L and mediate the fusion of vesicles docked within 33 nm of the dense projection. CaV2 activity is amplified by ryanodine receptor release of calcium from internal stores, triggering fusion up to 165 nm from the dense projection. By contrast, CaV1 channels are dispersed in the synaptic varicosity, and are colocalized with UNC-13S. CaV1 and ryanodine receptors are separated by just 40 nm, and vesicle fusion mediated by CaV1 is completely dependent on the ryanodine receptor. Distinct synaptic vesicle pools, released by different calcium channels, could be used to tune the speed, voltage-dependence, and quantal content of neurotransmitter release.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>L-type</kwd><kwd>N-type</kwd><kwd>super-resolution microscopy</kwd><kwd>Munc13</kwd><kwd>calcium channels</kwd><kwd>ryanodine receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NeuroNex 2014862</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jorgensen</surname><given-names>Erik M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS034307</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jorgensen</surname><given-names>Erik M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH085927</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zhao-Wen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS109388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zhao-Wen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS094421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maricq</surname><given-names>Andres Villu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 NS084826</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merrill</surname><given-names>Sean A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> presynapse contains two pools of synaptic vesicles at the active zone, coupled to either neuronal-type or muscle-type calcium channels, and to different docking machinery.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synaptic vesicles fuse to the plasma membrane within the presynaptic bouton in a domain called the active zone, and the intricate molecular architecture within the active zone determines the dynamics of the neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guzikowski and Kavalali, 2021</xref>). Vesicle fusion is driven by calcium influx and binding to the calcium sensor synaptotagmin on the synaptic vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geppert et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Littleton et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Ward et al., 2004</xref>). The coupling of calcium channels to fusion sites determines the transfer function of synapses to depolarizing inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eggermann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eguchi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Özçete and Moser, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rebola et al., 2019</xref>), and thus synaptic activity depends on three features of calcium-mediated vesicular fusion: the dynamic properties of the calcium channel, the concentration of calcium at the fusion site, and the release probability of the vesicle. These features are dictated by calcium channel type and location, by the distance to docked vesicles, and by the activity of the priming protein Unc13. Here, we characterize these features at the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> neuromuscular junction.</p><p>Voltage-gated calcium channels are divided into three molecular families: CaV1, CaV2, and CaV3, each with fundamentally different dynamic properties, including voltage-sensitive activation and inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catterall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nowycky et al., 1985</xref>). Each of these channel classes is primarily associated with tissue-specific functions: In muscle, CaV1 (L-type) channels mediate contraction and are coupled to the ryanodine receptor to release internal calcium stores (RyR). In neurons, CaV2 (P/Q, N, and R-type) channels drive synaptic transmission. In neurons and excitable cells, CaV3 (T-type) regulate action potential oscillations and pacemaker frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolphin, 2021</xref>) These tissue-specific roles are not exclusive, for example, the CaV1 variants CaV1.3 and CaV1.4 are associated with neurotransmitter release in hair cells and photoreceptors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dolphin and Lee, 2020</xref>).</p><p>In the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, each class is represented by a single gene: CaV1 (<italic>egl-19</italic>), CaV2 (<italic>unc-2</italic>), CaV3 (<italic>cca-1</italic>), and RyR (<italic>unc-68</italic>). In all animals, CaV2 is the main calcium channel for synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Richmond et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Smith et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tsien et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tsien and Tsien, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>). Unlike other animals, nematodes lack voltage-gated sodium channels and neurotransmission is typically mediated via graded release, however some interneurons use action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mellem et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>unc-2</italic> mutants, which lack the CaV2 channel, the frequency of tonic miniature currents (’minis’) is severely reduced; however, some release remains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Richmond et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tong et al., 2017</xref>). Physiological studies suggest CaV1 can also contribute to neurotransmission; CaV1 channel blockers reduce tonic minis <italic>by half</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tong et al., 2017</xref>). However, the role of CaV1 channels at synapses in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is complicated because CaV1 also contributes to calcium-mediated action potentials in neurons and is required in the body muscle for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liu et al., 2018a</xref>). Finally, the ryanodine receptor also contributes to neurotransmission, and is specifically required for multivesicular release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The distance between the calcium channel and docked and primed vesicle must be very short. After the channels close, diffusion causes a rapid drop in the concentration of calcium at sites of vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dittman and Ryan, 2019</xref>). Free calcium is further reduced by calcium buffers and calcium pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blaustein, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eggermann et al., 2011</xref>). Because intracellular calcium is extremely low (0.05 μM), and levels required for fusion are relatively high (half-maximal 10 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Courtney et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Schneggenburger and Neher, 2000</xref>), the effective range of calcium around a single voltage-gated calcium channel is predicted to be only 20 nm for evoked fusion, a ‘nanodomain’ not much larger than the diameter of the calcium channel itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fedchyshyn and Wang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Weber et al., 2010</xref>). The synaptic vesicle in vertebrates is 45 nm in diameter; in <italic>C. elegans</italic> vesicles are somewhat smaller, 32 nm in diameter; nevertheless, these data suggest that the vesicle must be nearly on top of the calcium channel.</p><p>The presence of vesicles docked at release sites and the probability of vesicle fusion depends on the active zone protein Unc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dittman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>). Unc13 tethers vesicles to the active zone membrane through C2B and C2C domains which flank the MUN domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Imig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Quade et al., 2019</xref>). The central MUN domain interacts with the SNARE protein syntaxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) and promotes the open state of syntaxin to initiate SNARE pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Richmond et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, binding of DAG and calcium to Unc13 regulates the differential release probabilities of primed vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Michelassi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>). In the absence of Unc13, synaptic vesicles fail to dock at release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Imig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Richmond et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Siksou et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that two different classes of voltage-gated calcium channels, CaV2 (UNC-2) and CaV1 (EGL-19) mediate the release of two physiologically distinct pools of synaptic vesicles as described in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tong et al., 2017</xref>). We also show that a third calcium channel, the ryanodine receptor (RyR / UNC-68), is essential for CaV1-mediated vesicle release. Time-resolved electron microscopy in calcium channel mutants demonstrates that these channels mediate fusion of spatially distinct pools of synaptic vesicles in the same synaptic varicosity. Finally, we use super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to demonstrate that CaV2 is localized with UNC-13L at the dense projection, and that CaV1 and RyR colocalize with UNC-13S at distal sites. Altogether, we describe two pools of synaptic vesicles: (1) The central pool is localized adjacent to the dense projection, vesicles are docked by UNC-13L, and released by a dense cluster of CaV2 channels. (2) The lateral pool of vesicles is broadly distributed, docked by UNC-13S, and released by dispersed CaV1 and RyR channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CaV1 and CaV2 calcium channels have partially overlapping functions</title><p>The genome of <italic>C. elegans</italic> contains only a single gene for each major voltage-gated calcium channel class: CaV1 (<italic>egl-19</italic>), CaV2 (<italic>unc-2</italic>), CaV3 (<italic>cca-1</italic>), and a single calcium-gated RyR (<italic>unc-68</italic>) (hereafter, referred to by their common names). Loss of the CaV3 T-type channel does not affect neurotransmitter release in acetylcholine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2018b</xref>). However, loss of any other calcium channel results in impaired neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Richmond et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tong et al., 2017</xref>). Null mutants lacking either CaV2 (<italic>unc-2</italic>(<italic>lj1</italic>)) or RyR (<italic>unc-68</italic>(<italic>e540</italic>)) are viable. <italic>unc-2(lj1</italic>) is a large deletion and frame shift, and <italic>unc-68(e540</italic>) is a G&gt;A splice acceptor mutation near the middle of the protein, likely causing a null phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sakube et al., 1997</xref>; this paper). CaV1 null mutants (<italic>egl-19</italic>(<italic>st556</italic>)) die as embryos due to a loss of muscle function during morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 1997</xref>). We rescued the CaV1 null mutant using a muscle promoter expressed early in development; since this strain lacks CaV1 in the nervous system, we refer to it as ‘CaV1(Δns)’.</p><p>To determine whether these channels function cooperatively or in parallel, we tested for synthetic interactions between mutations of these channel types. The double mutant CaV1(Δns) RyR(-) is viable, and is no worse than the RyR null, consistent with their coupled function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, CaV1(Δns) CaV2(-) double mutants and RyR(-) CaV2(-) double mutants exhibit a synthetic lethal interaction. These data suggest that calcium influx from CaV1-RyR acts redundantly, and in parallel, with CaV2 to sustain neuronal function essential for viability.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>nervous system CaV1 is required for normal behavior and locomotion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Viability of calcium channel double mutants.

To determine if the plasma membrane channels CaV1 and CaV2 are required together for all neurotransmitter release, we blocked CaV1 in the CaV2 null mutant. Application of nemadipine almost completely abolished mini frequency in the CaV2 mutant (+nema 1.7+/-0.6 mini/s). We conclude that all vesicle fusion at neuromuscular junctions relies on CaV1 and CaV2, each contributing about half of the minis, in agreement with an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tong et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, calcium influx through CaV1 is not sufficient for vesicle fusion; CaV1 relies on internal calcium stores released by RyR to fuse synaptic vesicles.</p><p>We further tested the roles of calcium channels using double mutants. We found that the rate of minis in the CaV1(Δns) RyR double mutant (19.6+/-2 mini/s) was similar to the single CaV1(Δns) and RyR mutants, supporting the hypothesis that CaV1 relies on coupling to RyR to activate neurotransmitter release. Because CaV1 CaV2 double mutants exhibit synthetic lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we generated a mosaic CaV2 strain in which the channel was expressed in acetylcholine head neurons using a tissue-specific promoter (‘P<italic>unc-17h</italic>’) in the CaV2 null mutant, referred to as ‘CaV2(Δnmj)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Topalidou et al., 2016</xref>). Expression of CaV2 in head neurons bypassed the synthetic lethality of both the CaV1(Δns) CaV2(-) double mutant, and the RyR(-) CaV2(-) double mutant, but the rescued animals exhibit a synthetic paralyzed phenotype. The mini rates of CaV2(Δnmj) CaV1(Δns) double mutants (12.8+/-2.4 mini/s) and CaV2(Δnmj) RyR double mutants (11.3+/-2.1 mini/s) were significantly reduced, but not completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The remaining neuronal activity in these strains is likely due to CaV2 expression in the sublateral cord motor neurons located in the head and extend long processes that synapse onto body muscles. In summary, these results demonstrate that CaV1 and RyR are interdependent, and act in parallel to CaV2.</p><p>To confirm that the reduction of minis observed in the <italic>unc-68</italic> null mutant was due to an acute loss of RyR function rather than a developmental defect, we blocked RyR by applying dantrolene (10 µM), a specific RyR inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Song et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Xu et al., 2001</xref>), either alone or in combination with the CaV1 blocker nemadipine. The recordings were performed using a low-chloride pipette solution at a holding voltage equal to the chloride equilibrium potential so that only minis mediated by acetylcholine were detected. The frequency of minis was reduced in all treatments compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; wild type 21.7±1.0 mini/s; dantrolene alone 12.36+/-0.6 mini/s; nemadipine alone 15.8+/-0.7 mini/s; dantrolene plus nemadipine 12.2+/-0.9 mini/s). Furthermore, nemadipine did not exacerbate the inhibitory effect of dantrolene on minis. Again, CaV1 is reliant on RyR for neurotransmission.</p><p>To confirm that RyR is acting presynaptically we analyzed strains rescued in neurons or in muscle. Previously, we rescued minis in a null mutant by expressing wild-type <italic>unc-68</italic> in neurons but not muscle cells, suggesting that RyRs regulate minis by acting presynaptically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2005</xref>).

To confirm the presynaptic function of RyRs, we recorded minis from the RyR(Δns) mutant <italic>unc-68(syb216</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The frequency of minis was significantly reduced compared to the wild type (wild type 21.7±1.0 mini/s; RyR(Δns) 15.9±0.6 mini/s; p=0.001). The reduction in minis in RyR(Δns) supports the conclusion that RyR is required presynaptically for normal levels of synaptic vesicle fusion. Mini frequency in RyR(Δns) was slightly higher than pharmacological block by dantrolene (12.36+/-0.6 mini/s; p=0.002). This result is consistent with the observation ~10% of RyR transcripts in neurons are expressed from the ‘muscle’ promoter in this strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Marques et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>RyR is required for multiquantal release</title><p>The amplitude of a miniature currents recorded from the muscle reflects the amount of neurotransmitter released by the synaptic bouton. The mode of mini amplitudes represents miniature currents from single vesicle fusions – single fusions are the most probable event.

Simultaneous fusion of multiple vesicles – multiquantal release – will increase the mean current amplitude. The mean current amplitude from acetylcholine release was significantly reduced by pharmacological or genetic block of RyR in neurons (wild type:12.4±0.6 pA; dantrolene: 8.0±0.3 pA; RyR(Δns): 9.5±0.4 pA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>).

When CaV1 channels are blocked by nemadipine, the remaining miniature currents rely on CaV2 and RyR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and mini amplitudes arising solely from CaV2 were reduced by further blocking RyR (nemadipine: 10.1+/-0.6 pA; dantrolene +nemadipine: 8.2+/-0.24 pA), suggesting that RyR also responds to calcium from CaV2. To estimate individual contributions to multiquantal release, we fit the distribution of current amplitudes assuming simultaneous fusions from multiple single vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In the presence of CaV2 and RyR 34% of currents are multiquantal; blocking RyR reduces multiquantal release to 25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). These fits indicate that RyR contributes to CaV2-mediated vesicle fusion by enhancing multiquantal events, though multiquantal events can also be attributed to CaV2.</p><p>Together, these data demonstrate that CaV2 and CaV1 channels regulate the release of separate synaptic vesicle pools at neuromuscular junctions. CaV1 requires the ryanodine receptor for any vesicle fusion, consistent with the known relationship of these channels in calcium-activated calcium release.

In unstimulated animals, docked vesicles were clustered around dense projections, although many were observed at lateral regions extending hundreds of nanometers from dense projections. Docked vesicles were uniformly depleted after stimulation in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In mutants lacking CaV2 channels, docked vesicles were selectively retained adjacent to the dense projection, but fused normally in regions distal from the dense projection. These results indicate that CaV2 is essential for vesicle fusion at sites adjacent to the dense projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Complete loss of both CaV2 and CaV1 function in the nervous system is lethal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, to assay mutation of both channels in the nervous system we used a weak allele of CaV1; the hypomorph <italic>egl-19(n582</italic>) is viable in double mutants with <italic>unc-2(lj1</italic>). Mutation of the CaV1 channel reduced fusion broadly, although significant vesicle fusions were observed within 100 nm of the dense projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In the absence of RyR only CaV2 is functional, and vesicle fusions were only observed in the 33 nm pool — directly adjacent to the dense projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The CaV1 CaV2 double mutant exhibited no change in the number and distribution of docked synaptic vesicles after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). These data indicate that CaV2 and CaV1 act on two spatially distinct pools of synaptic vesicles at the same synapses in <italic>C. elegans</italic>: a central pool dependent on CaV2 calcium channels and a lateral pool dependent on CaV1 and RyR.</p><p>To more finely partition the fusion domains for which each channel, we binned micrographs into three zones: adjacent to the dense projection (0–33 nm), intermediate active zone (33–165 nm), and lateral active zone (165–594 nm). Baseline docking was increased in the 0–33 nm bin in the CaV2(-) mutants, this trend is consistent with decreased tonic fusion adjacent to the dense projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and release probability of vesicles is reduced adjacent to the dense projection in CaV2(-) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>In the intermediate active zone (33–165 nm), there was no change in the baseline docking of any mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, we observed identical fusion defects in the intermediate zone in the CaV2(-) mutant and RyR(-) mutant, which suggests CaV2 activates RyR to release calcium from internal stores. Activation of RyR by CaV2 is consistent with the multiquantal release mediated by these channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>).</p><p>In the distal active zone (165–594 nm), the probability of vesicle fusion was reduced in CaV1(-) mutants, RyR(-) mutants, and CaV2(-) CaV1(-) double mutants, but slightly increased in CaV2(-) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). An increase in fusion at distal sites in CaV2 mutants might be due to compensatory effects in the expression or organization of CaV1 and RyR.</p><p>Together, electron microscopy indicates that CaV2 mediates fusion of vesicles adjacent to the dense projection, and that CaV1 mediates fusion of vesicles at lateral sites. The ryanodine receptor is essential for vesicle fusion mediated by CaV1 at lateral sites and contributes to vesicle fusion by CaV2 near the dense projection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>CaV2 and CaV1 differentially localized at synapses</title><p>The ultrastructural data suggests that distinct calcium channels act at spatially separate areas of the active zone. To determine if these calcium channels are physically located at these sites, we used fluorescence microscopy. We modified the endogenous genes to encode tags for synthetic fluorescent ligands and performed three-color imaging using the dense projection as an anatomical fiducial at the center of the synapse. Because <italic>C. elegans</italic> synaptic varicosities are less than 1 μm in diameter, superresolution microscopy was required to resolve channel clusters. A segment of the dorsal nerve cord was imaged, and the region of imaging was restricted to a narrow band to avoid potential complications by CaV1 expression in muscle. All imaging was conducted on living, acutely anesthetized nematodes.</p><p>Multiple tagging sites were tested for all genes, but in some cases the tags disrupted function. Therefore, we tagged internal sites within regions of poor conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). For example, CaV2 was tagged with HALO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Los et al., 2008</xref>) in the second extracellular loop near the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kurshan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schwartz and Jorgensen, 2016</xref>). The strains used for three-color imaging exhibited normal morphology and appear to move like wild-type animals, suggesting the tagged proteins are functional. Analysis of specific movements indicated that most locomotory responses are normal; however, the frequency of reversals was increased in all multiply tagged strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E–I</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that the pattern of calcium channels in our fluorescence images matched the arrangement of dense projections, we reconstructed 20 µm of the dorsal nerve cord from serial sections with electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Dense projections at neuromuscular junctions were spaced roughly 1 µm apart in the reconstruction (1.02 / µm). This matches well to the distribution of CaV2 clusters (1.10+/-0.16 µm) along the dorsal cord by super-resolution microscopy, and is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that CaV2 /UNC-2 channels are localized to dense projections by immuno-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gracheva et al., 2008</xref>). To further demonstrate that CaV2 is localized to the dense projection, we compared CaV2 localization with CRISPR-tagged presynaptic active zone proteins, including Neurexin (<italic>nrx-1</italic>), Magi (<italic>magi-1</italic>), SYDE (<italic>syd-1</italic>), Liprin-α (<italic>syd-2</italic>), RIMBP (<italic>rimb-1</italic>), and α-Catulin (<italic>ctn-1</italic>).

The cluster centers are slightly offset (Ᾱ=124 nm), so that 62% of ELKS localizations were within a CaV2 cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>).

In electrophysiological assays, these pools are genetically separable and complementary. Flash-and-freeze electron microscopy revealed that CaV2 channels fuse vesicles near the dense projection at the center of the synapse; whereas CaV1 channels fuse vesicles at lateral sites in the same synapses. Super-resolution imaging indicates that CaV2 channels are compacted at the dense projection into 250 nm clusters, along with the active zone proteins ELKS, neurexin, α-Liprin, and RIMBP. CaV2 is associated with the long isoform of the docking and priming protein UNC-13L. By contrast, CaV1 is dispersed in the synaptic varicosity and is associated with the short isoform UNC-13S.

microscopy</title><p>Super-resolution images were recorded with a Vutara SR 352 (Bruker Nanosurfaces, Inc, Madison, WI) commercial microscope based on single molecule localization biplane technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Juette et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mlodzianoski et al., 2009</xref>). First, 20–30 adult hermaphrodite <italic>C. elegans</italic> expressing HALO- tagged proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Encell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mollwitz et al., 2012</xref> were allowed to lay eggs for 6–8 hr. Adults were moved to a new plate or destroyed. ~2 days later, when L4s were abundant on the plate, but before young adults emerged, animals were washed off using M9 an briefly centrifuged and resuspended in M9 several times to remove bacteria. Dye solution was prepared by suspending 5 nmol of JF dye in 5 µl of fresh DMSO to make 1 mM solution of dye. Five µL of 1 mM solution was added to 95 µl of worms in M9. Animals were stained for 2 hr on an orbital shaker at room temperature in the dark in 50 μM of HTL-JF646, and 50 μM of STL-JF549cp, STL-JF549, or STL-JF549pa (Gift from Luke Lavis, Janelia Farms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grimm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>). Early super-resolution experiments were conducted with JF549-STL or PA-JF549-STL, we later found that a new cell permeable variant cp-JF549-STL improved labeling of channels. After 2 hr, 1 mL of M9 was added to the staining tubes, spun gently on a benchtop centrifuge and aspirated several times to remove dye. Animals were allowed to recover 12 hr at 15degC on agar seeded with OP50 bacteria. Molting is essential to remove non-specific staining of the cuticle. After they had molt, live intact animals were anesthetized in 25 mM NaN3 and regions of their dorsal cords that were positioned directly against the cover glass and away from the intestine. These were imaged with 640 nm excitation power of 10kW/cm2, or 549 nm excitation power of 5kW/cm2 Skylan-S was imaged by 488 nm excitation at 2kW/cm2, while photoactivated by 0.37 mW/cm2 405 nm light. Images were recorded using a 60 x/1.2 NA Olympus water immersion objective and Hamamatsu Flash4 V1 sCMOS, or 60 x/1.3 NA Silicon immersion objective and Orca Fusion BT SCMOS camera with gain set at 50 and frame rate at 50 Hz. Individual laser settings varied per animal to optimize blinking, but typically lasers were set below 12%. Example settings: 9% 646, 7% 549, 4% 488 with 2% 405 activation laser. A minimum of 1000 frames per fluorophore were recorded. Data was analyzed by the Vutara SRX software (version 7.0.0rc39). Single molecules were identified by their brightness frame by frame after removing the background. Identified molecules were localized in three dimensions by fitting the raw data in a 12x12-pixel region of interest centered around each particle in each plane with a 3D model function that was obtained from recorded bead data sets. Fit results were filtered by a density-based denoising algorithm to remove isolated particles. The experimentally achieved image resolution of 40 nm laterally (x,y) and 70 nm axially (in z) was determined by Fourier ring correlation. Localizations were rendered as 80 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>SML analysis</title><p>Localization data was exclusively collected from the dorsal nerve cord, which contains axons and synapses but no neuronal soma. We performed a 3D reconstruction of <italic>C. elegans</italic> dorsal nerve cord to inform region of interest selection from fluorescent images. The orientation of dorsal cord synapses is predictable. Excitatory acetylcholine neurons and inhibitory GABA neurons synapse onto muscle arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These connections are near the edges of the cord bundle. Thus, the roll of the animal affects the orientation of the synapse; en face or axial.</p><p>For single molecule localization experiments, animals were rolled to ensure en face orientation of synapses. Synapses that were in focus and en face were analyzed. The average size of a synapse from the dorsal nerve cord is 579.7 nm (SEM +/-16 nm). Thus, super-resolution analysis regions of interest were narrowed to localizations within 700 nm of the dense projection marker. Localization position data was flattened in the z-dimension due to chromatic aberrations. A script was used to calculate the center of each probe. To compare the distribution of probe A to probe B, an angle between the two clusters centers was calculated. The distribution distances were calculated by measuring the distance along the center-to-center axis from a probe B to the center of cluster A, and cluster B. Nearest neighbor analysis was done with knnsearch. The 95% confidence interval of these distance measurements is considered the diameter of the cluster. Distribution center and range or ‘diameter’ were reported as (mean, 95% CI).

CaV1-SNAP was coupled to JF549cp. CaV1 channels are dispersed in the synapse but also often form small clusters, spatially distinct from CaV2 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). To estimate the number of CaV1 channels, imaging conditions were optimized to maximize localizations from only CaV1 by imaging them first, and estimated their number using three approaches.</p><p>Total blinks. Each blink was assumed to be a channel (total CaV1 blinks Ᾱ=196 ± 37 channels). Since total blinks assumes every channel blinks only once, this method will represent an overcount of the true number of channels. Single channels emit multiple blinks (see next method), thus 200 channels likely represents the maximum number of channels.</p><p>Mean blinks per channel (~60 nm). Spatial information was used to determine how many blinks belong to the same channel – singlet blinks were assigned as a channel, and two or more blinks within 60 nm of each other were assumed to arise from a single channel via DBSCAN, based on a typical confidence interval (We observe 40 nm resolution by Fourier ring analysis, to be conservative a 60 nm arbitrary criterion was used, given that we only include blinks with better than 80 nm localization precision by Cramér-Rao lower bound; for context, a calcium channel with subunits is ~20 nm in diameter). A Poisson distribution was fit to the number of blinks per channel (m=2.7 blinks per channel). Dividing the total number of blinks in synapses by the mean number of blinks per channel produces an estimate of 79±10 CaV1 channels per synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B, C</xref>).</p><p>Photon flux. Every blink has a photon count. The mode number of photons emitted in a blink was determined from <italic>all blinks</italic> at analyzed synapses (Mo = 575 photons / blink; Ᾱ=765 ± 11 photons/ blink; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). Blinks were also clustered into single channels (as described above) and the number of <italic>photons per ‘channel’</italic> was measured. Channels emitted a mean of 1996±489 photons because some channels blinked multiple times. The mode was 550 photons per channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). The mode photon count for channels is similar to the mode photon count of single blinks indicating that most channels blink once. The total number of photons emitted by a synapse for the whole imaging session was divided by the mean number of photons per channel to estimate CaV1 channel count: (75±19 CaV1 channels; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>).</p><p>CaV2 calculations. CaV2-HALO was labelled with JF646. CaV2 channels are tightly localized into ~250 nm diameter clusters coincident with the dense projection. Each synapse contains just one density, but each density has several hundred CaV2 blinks. The number of CaV2 channels in individual boutons was estimated with the following approaches. Total blinks. CaV2 exhibited a mean 569±54 blinks / synapse. Again, as described above total blinks is an overestimate of the number of channels at a synapse.</p><p>Mean blinks or photon flux per channel. CaV2 blinks exhibited a mode of 900 photons. However, CaV2 localizations saturate the dense projection so single channels cannot be isolated. The cluster appears as a uniform mass, because the resolution and precision of our experiments are not adequate to spatially resolve single channels in densely labeled domains. To circumvent this limitation, the maximum number of channels in the density was calculated.</p><p>Cluster diameter – upper bound. An upper bound was estimated for the number of channels by mathematically fitting circles within a larger circle (20 nm channels in a 250 nm cluster) yields a maximum capacity of 120 channels at the dense projection.</p><p>Minimal overlap -- lower bound. The CaV2 clusters appears continuous without cavities, meaning all localizations overlap with neighboring channels. A mathematical fit of 60 nm circles within a 250 nm cluster results in at least 12 channels. Each channel would need to blink 50 times in 1 min. Organic dye blinking photophysics are not well characterized. However, this rate is approximately 10-fold higher than rates experimentally determined, as described below, suggesting there are many more channels.</p><p>Blinking rate. The blinking rate of dyes was used to estimate channel count. Although blinking rates of rhodamine dyes have not been determined, cyanine dyes in oxygen scavenging buffer can blink about six times in one minute depending on the imaging conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Helmerich et al., 2022</xref>). 569 blinks on average were observed from the CaV2 cluster in a one minute imaging interval. If rhodamine dyes are similar to cyanine dyes, then 101±16 CaV2s are present at a single synaptic bouton. Thus, 101 CaV2 channels is the best estimate given our limited knowledge of dye photophysics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>All electrophysiological experiments were performed with young adult hermaphrodites. The animals were immobilized and dissected as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). In experiments to record minis mediated by both GABA and ACh receptors, the extracellular solution contained (in mM) NaCl 140, KCl 5, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 5, dextrose 11 and HEPES 5 (pH 7.2), and the pipette solution containing (in mM) KCl 120, KOH 20, Tris 5, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.25, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 4, sucrose 36, EGTA 5, and Na2ATP 4 (pH 7.2). In experiments to record minis mediated by only ACh receptors, the pipette solution was modified by reducing KCl to 6.8 mM and adding Kgluconate 112.2 mM. The holding voltage used in all the experiments was –60 mV. Dantrolene (D3996, TCI America) and nemadipine-A (SC-202727, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) stock solutions (10 mM) were made in DMSO. In each experiment, 1 µl of the stock solution was first thoroughly mixed with 50 µl of the bath solution in a small centrifuge tube, and then the entire volume of the mixed solution was added to the bath (total volume 1 ml) to reach the final concentration of 10 µM. After adding the dantrolene or nemadipine-A solution, the bath solution was pipetted up and down 5 times using the same pipette (set at 50 µl), and an incubation period of 5 min was allowed prior to starting the electrophysiological recording. The classic whole-cell configuration was used for voltage-clamp recordings with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and the Clampex software (version 10 or 11, Molecular Devices). Data were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz.

The coefficient for the mean of the first gaussian curve was set to the mode amplitude (7 pA ±1).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Reinhard Jahn as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Joshua M Kaplan (Reviewer #2); Kang Shen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers agree that the manuscript addresses a highly interesting question, that the data are generally convincing, and recommend publication after appropriate revision. Whereas reviewers 1 and 3 did not have any significant concerns, Reviewer 2 has given very detailed feedback to the authors that they are encouraged to consider during revision. After internal discussion, the referees agree that the following points should be addressed:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Most importantly, the referees are concerned about possible indirect (long-term) effects of the RYR inactivation in the mutants. They, therefore, recommend adding a series of experiments in which acute pharmacological blockade of calcium release from the ER using appropriate inhibitors (such as CPA) is used, These recordings should be done in all conditions where the RYR mutations were used (i.e. CPA alone, CPA + CaV1 antagonist, and CPA in CaV2 mutants). These additional experiments would considerably strengthen the main conclusions.</p><p>2) The reviewers also agree that it needs to be clarified whether the recording conditions for the mini GAB Aergic and cholinergic minis can be clearly differentiated, considering the high chloride concentrations in the recording electrode. This may just be a clerical error in the methods, but it needs to be ensured that only cholinergic EPSCs are recorded.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As stated, the experiments appear to be of high quality, and I have no suggestions for improvement.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have a few concerns that hopefully can be addressed fairly easily.</p><p>1) Are the ephys recordings in Figure 2 and its supplement a mixture of ACh and GABA synapses? The methods suggest that a high Cl<sup>-</sup> pipet solution was used in these recordings, which would make GABA currents excitatory. Is this correct? If this is the case, any changes in mini rates or amplitudes could reflect changes in the balance of ACh and GABA transmission. It would be much better to isolate the ACh synaptic currents (i.e. using a low chloride internal solution). I don't see how quantal modeling (Figure 2F and G) is possible if this is a mixture of ACh and GABA minis.</p><p>2) Many of the results shown in Figure 2 replicate findings in a prior study (Tong et al., Neuron 2017), including mini rates in WT+Nemad, unc-2, unc-2+Nemad, egl-19(ns), and egl-19(ns)+Nemad. Tong et al. also concluded that half the minis are mediated by UNC-2 and the other half by EGL-19. The text should be revised to indicate which findings are replications of prior studies, and which are new. You should also revise statements in the text claiming that this is the first study to show that UNC-2 and EGL-19 both promote release at this synapse.</p><p>3) The contribution of RYR receptors to release is inferred from the analysis of unc-68(e540) mutants. Consequently, secondary or compensatory effects of the RYR mutations could contribute to the effects reported here. For example, a prior study suggests that the ER network in muscles is fragmented in unc-68 mutants (Maryon, JCS 1998). In addition, long-term changes in ER calcium homeostasis in unc-68 mutants could lead to many downstream physiological defects (including effects of calcium stores levels on surface ion channels). It would strengthen the conclusions if the ephys recordings done in unc-68 mutants (Figure 2, and Figure 2 extended data) could be repeated in animals acutely treated with SERCA inhibitors (e.g. CPA or thapsigargin). Also, is e540 a null allele?

A prior study showed that EGL-19 current amplitudes are not significantly reduced in n582 mutants (Gao, PNAS 2011). This likely explains why the CaV1 defects (Figure 3F) look weaker than those in the RYR mutant defects (Figure 3G). It is surprising that n582 has a stronger defect in the 33 nm window than RYR deficient mutants, which I don't understand. Given these concerns, do the n582 flash-freeze data strengthen any of the conclusions? If these results are retained, the authors need to clearly explain that the n582 mutation may have a fairly mild CaV1 defect.

To address this concern, we performed a new set of electrophysiology experiments with the ryanodine receptor inhibitor dantrolene. We chose dantrolene, instead of the SERCA inhibitors cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) and thapsigargin, to analyze direct inhibition of the ryanodine receptor. In addition, we recorded from <italic>unc-68(syb216)</italic> animals have a deletion of the neuron-specific isoform of the ryanodine receptor to demonstrate that UNC-68 acts presynaptically to regulate minis <italic>(</italic>Marques et al. 2020). These new experiments were performed using a low-chloride pipette solution at a holding voltage equal to the chloride equilibrium potential to isolate minis mediated by ACh transmission, which addresses a major consideration from reviewer 2.</p><p>Mini Frequencies. Dantrolene reduced the frequency of minis in wild-type worms by about 50%. The inhibitory effect of dantrolene was not exacerbated by the CaV1 channel blocker nemadipine, which by itself inhibited the frequency of minis. Miniature current frequencies in the <italic>unc-68(syb216)</italic> strain were reduced compared with the wild type. However, the reduction in minis was less than that caused by dantrolene. This discrepancy is consistent with residual expression of UNC-68 in neurons from the muscle promoter (about 12% of mRNA transcripts in neurons are the <italic>unc-68</italic> muscle isoform) (Marques et al. 2020; Ma et al. 2016). These results (shown in Figure 2C) support our conclusion that presynaptic ryanodine receptors act together with Ca<sub>V</sub>1 to regulate synaptic vesicle exocytosis at the <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuromuscular junction.</p><p>p7 “To confirm that the reduction of minis observed in the <italic>unc-68</italic> null mutant was due to an acute loss of RyR function rather than a developmental defect, we blocked RyR by applying dantrolene (10 µM), a specific RyR inhibitor (Song, Karl, Ackerman, &amp; Hotchkiss, 1993; Xu, Tavernarakis, &amp; Driscoll, 2001), either alone or in combination with the CaV1 blocker nemadipine. The recordings were performed using a low-chloride pipette solution at a holding voltage equal to the chloride equilibrium potential so that only minis mediated by acetylcholine were detected. The frequency of minis was reduced in all treatments compared to the wild type (Figure 2C; wild type 21.7 ± 1.0 mini/s; dantrolene alone 12.36 +/- 0.6 mini/s; nemadipine alone 15.8 +/- 0.7 mini/s; dantrolene plus nemadipine 12.2 +/- 0.9 mini/s). Furthermore, nemadipine did not exacerbate the inhibitory effect of dantrolene on minis. Again, CaV1 is reliant on RyR for neurotransmission.</p><p>To confirm that RyR is acting presynaptically we analyzed strains rescued in neurons or in muscle. Previously, we rescued minis in a null mutant by expressing wild-type <italic>unc-68</italic> in neurons but not muscle cells, suggesting that RyRs regulate minis by acting presynaptically (Liu et al., 2005). Expression from <italic>unc-68</italic> is driven by an upstream muscle promoter and a downstream neuronal promoter (Chen et al., 2017; Marques et al., 2020). To confirm the presynaptic function of RyRs, we recorded minis from the RyR(Δns) mutant <italic>unc-68(syb216)</italic> (Figure 2C). The frequency of minis was significantly reduced compared to the wild type (wild type 21.7 ± 1.0 mini/s; RyR(Δns) 15.9 ± 0.6 mini/s; p=0.001). The reduction in minis in RyR(Δns) supports the conclusion that RyR is required presynaptically for normal levels of synaptic vesicle fusion. Mini frequency in RyR(Δns) was slightly higher than pharmacological block by dantrolene (12.36 +/- 0.6 mini/s; p=0.002). This result is consistent with the observation ~10% of RyR transcripts in neurons are expressed from the “muscle” promoter in this strain (Marques et al., 2020).”</p><p>Amplitude. Pharmacological block of CaV1 with nemadipine or RyR with dantrolene significantly reduces mini amplitude. The effect of dantrolene and nemadipine is no worse than dantrolene alone, and a similar decrease in amplitude is observed in <italic>unc-68(syb216)</italic>. We conclude that acute loss the ryanodine receptor reduces current amplitudes. The most likely cause is due to a loss of multivesicular release driven by calcium from internal stores. Although it is possible that the effect could be due to rapid changes in the postsynaptic receptor field, the modal mini amplitude is unchanged, which suggests a presynaptic loss of multivesicular fusion events. These data can be found in Figure 2E.</p><p>p7-8, “Using recording conditions in which only acetylcholine currents are detected, the modal value of miniature currents was similar in all strains (wild type 8pA, CaV1 block nemadipine 7pA, RyR block dantrolene 5pA, CaV1+RyR block nemadipine+ dantrolene 6pA, RyR(Δns) 6pA), suggesting that the receptor field is similar for most single vesicle fusions. Simultaneous fusion of multiple vesicles – multiquantal release – will increase the mean current amplitude. The mean current amplitude from acetylcholine release was significantly reduced by pharmacological or genetic block of RyR in neurons (wild type:12.4 ±0.6 pA; dantrolene: 8.0 ±0.3 pA; RyR(Δns): 9.5 ±0.4 pA) (Figure 2D,E). The presence of large current events was not reduced by mutation of CaV2 (Figure 2 Supplement D-G). Block of CaV1 by nemadipine caused a decrease in the mean current amplitude (wild type:12.4 ±0.6 pA; nemadipine: 10.1 ±0.6 pA; nemadipine + dantrolene: 8.2 ±0.24 pA), suggesting that CaV1 contributes to multiquantal release. “</p><p>Quanta. We repeated the multiquantal release analysis on the wild-type worms treated with nemadipine alone or dantrolene and nemadipine together. We found that RyR inhibition resulted in the loss of multiquantal events greater than 2 quanta. We conclude that CaV1 and RyR, as well as CaV2 and RyR, are interacting to promote multiquantal release in acetylcholine neurons.

Consequently, secondary or compensatory effects of the RYR mutations could contribute to the effects reported here. For example, a prior study suggests that the ER network in muscles is fragmented in unc-68 mutants (Maryon, JCS 1998). In addition, long-term changes in ER calcium homeostasis in unc-68 mutants could lead to many downstream physiological defects (including effects of calcium stores levels on surface ion channels). It would strengthen the conclusions if the ephys recordings done in unc-68 mutants (Figure 2, and Figure 2 extended data) could be repeated in animals acutely treated with SERCA inhibitors (e.g. CPA or thapsigargin). Also, is e540 a null allele?

This strain lacks the neuron promotor and the neuron-specific exon 1.2; this isoform is expressed 7-fold higher than exon 1.1 in neurons (Marques et al. 2020; Ma et al. 2016).

So, the macroscopic puncta shown in these figures result from superimposing many localizations? If so, please indicate how many localizations are shown for each image. Can you estimate the absolute number of molecules present in each punctum? This would be interesting, especially for CaV2, CaV1, RYR, and UNC-13. Is there any substructure evident in these signals, e.g. nanoclusters of CaV2, CaV1, or RYR. If so, it would be very interesting to provide details about these nanoclusters (size, spatial frequency, number of molecules in each).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is asking two questions: First, are the intensely staining clusters of channels saturated at their centers? Second, can we estimate the number of channels at synapses?</p><p>Method: See improved description under Methods.</p><p>Display. The reviewer’s understanding of the data is correct. The images are plots of localizations from thousands of frames, each point is an (x,y) coordinate from a single blink. These data are collected using a ground-state depletion (GSD) protocol, so that a labelled protein can be stimulated and fluoresce multiples rounds, rather than in PALM mode in which fluors are bleached and thus removed from the sample. GSD leads to an improved signal-tonoise ratio, better spatial resolution, and less undercounting which are all chronic problems in PALM microscopy, but quantitation of proteins is more complicated using GSD. In our data sets, the mean precision of all blinks is 40 nm. For plotting localizations, blinks that had less than an 80 nm precision were discarded, and each blink is plotted using an 80 nm arbitrary point size to reflect this confidence interval. The plotted puncta could arise from blinks from different channels in close proximity, or multiple blinks from a single channel. The intensity and thus saturation of signal is a readout of the number of localizations overlapping in an area. We have included a plot of a synapse which uses translucent dots to illustrate both the center of the blink and confidence interval in the localization, rather than arbitrary dots to represent calcium channels (Reviewer Figure 1). This plot may help the reviewer better understand the discussion of superresolution data, but these plots are visually deceptive because the eye is drawn to the larger, less accurate, localizations. To ascertain protein abundance, rather than just localization, we need to squeeze every last blink from the tag to perform a robust Poisson statistical analysis of the data. However, in the 3-protein localization experiments in this manuscript, we needed to both retrieve a significant number of localizations for each fluor, and also preserve the remaining probes for subsequent localizations. These limitations are described below.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Calcium channel localizations visualized by sphere sized by radial precision.</title><p>It should be noted that large dot size corresponds to less-certain localizations rather than the size of the calcium channel cluster.

We tested labeling efficiency by sequential labeling using different dyes, and found that our protocol saturated both the HALO and SNAP enzymes.</p><p>We performed a Fourier ring analysis of our data and observe a 40 nm resolution, meaning that we can distinguish two points if they are at least 40 nm apart.</p><p>Limits imposed by multiprotein localizations: In our experiments three proteins were localized at the same synapses. A disadvantage of multiprotein localization is that recording conditions must be optimized to retrieve localizations from all 3-colors but imaged sequentially. There are three reasons that our protocol could fail to localize all proteins in the sample.</p><p>(1) Undersampling. Imaging was performed to prevent bleaching subsequent dyes, that is, limited excitation was used to preserve the sample. Thus, some fluors remained dark during recording.</p><p>(2) Ground-state depletion. Dyes were likely destroyed during the intense stimulation required to get all fluors into the dark state.</p><p>(3) Bleaching. Subsequent fluors, particularly red-shifted fluors are bleached from a prior excitation laser, despite gentle laser settings.</p><p>Estimates: Despite these concerns we placed upper and lower limits for the number of channels as described below.</p><p>CaV1 calculations. CaV1-SNAP was coupled to JF549cp ('cell permeable'). CaV1 channels are dispersed in the synapse but also often form small clusters, spatially distinct from CaV2 clusters (Figure 10A). To estimate the number of CaV1 channels, we optimized imaging conditions to maximize localizations from only CaV1 by imaging them first, and estimated their number using three approaches.</p><p>(1) Total blinks. We assumed each blink is a channel (total CaV1 blinks Ᾱ = 196 ± 37 channels) (Figure 10B-C). Total blinks could possibly represent an undercount. Because the process of placing fluors in the dark state requires intense illumination until all fluorescence is in the dark state, some fluors may have been driven to a bleached, and thus irretrievable, condition. On the other hand, fluors blink multiple times using a ground-state depletion protocol. Since total blinks assumes every channel blinks only once, this method will represent an overcount of the true number of channels. Because we observe multiple blinks from single channels (see next method), we think the value of 200 channels likely represents the maximum number of channels.</p><p>(2) Mean blinks per channel (~60 nm). Spatial information was used to determine how many blinks belong to the same channel – singlet blinks were assigned as a channel, and two or more blinks within 60 nm of each other were assumed to arise from a single channel based on a typical confidence interval (our plots exhibit a 40 nm resolution by Fourier ring analysis, to be conservative we use a 60 nm arbitrary criterion given that we only include blinks with better than 80 nm localization precision by Cramér-Rao lower bound; for context, a calcium channel with subunits is ~20 nm in diameter). A Poisson distribution was fit to the number of blinks per channel (m = 2.7 blinks per channel). Dividing the total number of blinks in synapses by the mean number of blinks per channel produces an estimate of 79 ± 10 CaV1 channels per synapse (Figure 10B,C).</p><p>(3) Photon flux. Every blink has a photon count. The mode number of photons emitted in a blink was determined from <italic>all blinks</italic> at analyzed synapses (Mo = 575 photons / blink; Ᾱ = 765 ± 11 photons/ blink) (Figure 10D,E). Blinks were also clustered into single channels (as described above) and the number of <italic>photons per ‘channel’</italic> was measured. Channels emitted a mean of 1996 ± 489 photons because some channels blinked multiple times. The mode was 550 photons per channel (Figure 10D-E). The mode photon count for channels is similar to the mode photon count of single blinks indicating that most channels blink once.</p><p>The total number of photons emitted by a synapse for the whole imaging session was divided by the mean number of photons per channel to estimate CaV1 channel count: (75 ± 19 CaV1 channels)</p><p>Methods associating overlapping blinks can produce an undercount of the true number of channels due to limited resolution; overlapping confidence intervals from adjacent channels will erroneously “chain” multiple channels into a single channel. Methods with a greater than 10nm precision will be needed in the future to accurately count channels.</p><p>Nevertheless, these last two estimates agree quite well. We now report the mean of these values: 77 ±15 CaV1 channels per synapse.</p><p>CaV2 calculations. CaV2-HALO was labelled with JF646. CaV2 channels are tightly localized into ~250nm diameter clusters coincident with the dense projection. Each synapse contains just one density, but each density has several hundred CaV2 blinks. The number of CaV2 channels in individual boutons was estimated with the following approaches.</p><p>(1) Total blinks. CaV2 exhibited a mean 569 ± 54 blinks / synapse. Again, as described above total blinks is an overestimate of the number of channels at a synapse.</p><p>(2) Mean blinks or photon flux per channel. CaV2 blinks exhibited a mode of 900 photons. However, we were unable to associate blinks with a single channel; CaV2 localizations saturate the dense projection. The cluster appears as a uniform mass in our images, because our resolution and precision are not adequate to spatially resolve single channels in densely labeled domains. To circumvent this limitation, the maximum number of channels in the density was calculated.</p><p>(3) Cluster diameter – upper bound. We can estimate an upper bound for the number of channels by mathematically fitting circles within a larger circle (20 nm channels in a 250nm cluster) yields a maximum capacity of 120 channels at the dense projection.</p><p>(4) Minimal overlap -- lower bound. The CaV2 clusters appears continuous without cavities, meaning all localizations overlap with neighboring channels. A mathematical fit of 60 nm circles within a 250 nm cluster results in at least 12 channels. Each channel would need to blink 50 times in 1 minute. Organic dye blinking photophysics are not well characterized. However, this rate is approximately 10-fold higher than rates experimentally determined, as described below, suggesting there are many more channels.</p><p>(5) Blinking rate. The blinking rate of dyes was used to estimate channel count. Although blinking rates of rhodamine dyes have not been determined, cyanine dyes in oxygen scavenging buffer can blink about 6 times in one minute depending on the imaging conditions (Helmerich et al. 2022). We observe 569 blinks on average from the CaV2 cluster in a one minute imaging interval. If rhodamine dyes are similar to cyanine dyes, then 101±16 CaV2s are present at a single synaptic bouton. We think 101 CaV2 channels is the best estimate given our limited knowledge of dye photophysics.</p><p>(6) Calcium sensitivity. Although not fully characterized, we and others suspect calcium causes more rapid blinking of the dye (based on our observation of occasional propagation of a wave of blinks). If this assumption is correct then CaV2-HALO labelled with JF646 may blink more often than solitary tagged proteins because they are tightly localized at the dense projection in close proximity to other potentially open calcium channels, which would cause an overestimate of channels at the dense projection.</p><p>We conclude based on the blinking rate and limits to the size of the dense projection that there are approximately 100 CaV2s at each bouton.</p><p>We have added these points to the Discussion, and have been more explicit in the Methods regarding sample preparation for superresolution imaging. We have also included plots from CaV1 CaV2 and CaV1 ELKS RyR imaging experiments to illustrate photon counting from individual synapses (Figure 10F,G).</p><p>p14, &quot;The number of calcium channels per synapse can be estimated from the single molecule localization data (see Methods for details). CaV1 channels are dispersed in the synapse but often also form small clusters (Figure 10A, F, G). The number of CaV1 channels was calculated from the mean number of blinks per channel, as well as from the total photon flux, converging on 77 ± 15 CaV1 channels per synapse (Figure 10B-E).</p><p>The ryanodine receptor images were suffused with high background fluorescence, and photon flux was not a reliable measure. Using the mean blinks per channel produces an estimate of 29 ± 4 RYR channels per synapse (Figure 10G).</p><p>CaV2 channels are tightly localized to the dense projection (Figure 10F). In our images the cluster appears as a solid mass; the overlap in localization precision made it impossible to assign blinks or photon flux to individual channels in the cluster. However, assuming the blinking rate of rhodamine dyes is similar to cyanine dyes (Helmerich et al., 2022), the frequency of blinking indicates that the cluster contains 101 ±16 CaV2 channels.</p><p>The ~100 CaV2 channels per synapse derived from our single molecule localization data is much higher than the ~35 CaV2.1 channels determined by immunogold labelling synapses in the mouse central nervous system (Holderith et al., 2012; Kusch et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the density of calcium channels at <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuromuscular junctions (91 CaV2 per µm<sup>2</sup>) is similar to mammalian synapses (100-400 CaV2.1 channels per µm<sup>2</sup>). “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Do you have data showing that the tagged UNC-2, EGL-19, UNC-68, and UNC-13 alleles have no effect on function?</p></disp-quote><p>To illustrate the effects of tagging the calcium channels, we have included behavioral data of the multiply tagged strains in Figure 4 supplement E-I.
