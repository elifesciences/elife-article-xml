We found that changes in bitter taste perception have accompanied this adaptation. We show that bitter-sensing mutants of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> undergo a shift in egg laying preference toward ripe fruit. <italic>D. suzukii</italic> has lost 20% of the bitter-sensing sensilla from the labellum, the major taste organ of the head. Physiological responses to various bitter compounds are lost. Responses to strawberry purées are lost from two classes of taste sensilla. Egg laying is not deterred by bitter compounds that deter other species. Profiling of labellar transcriptomes reveals reduced expression of several bitter <italic>Gr</italic> genes (<italic>gustatory receptors</italic>). These findings support a model in which bitter compounds in early ripening stages deter egg laying in most <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, but a loss of bitter response contributes to the adaptation of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to ripe fruit.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>A new agricultural pest has recently emerged in the United States and Northern Europe. The invasive species is a type of fruit fly that normally lives in Southeast Asia called <italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic> (also known as the spotted wing <italic>Drosophila</italic>). This fly poses a threat to fruit crops – including strawberries, blueberries, cherries, peaches and grapes – because, while other fruit flies lay eggs in overripe fruit, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> lays eggs in ripe fruit, leading to agricultural losses.</p><p>This shift in where fruit flies prefer to lay their eggs is related to changes in the senses of smell and touch, and taste could also play a role. Insects have evolved mechanisms that dissuade them from eating or laying eggs in plants with high levels of toxins, which taste bitter. If <italic>D. suzukii</italic> is less sensitive to bitter tastes than other flies, this could help explain why it lays eggs in just-ripe fruit, since the levels of certain bitter compounds are higher in the early stages of ripening than later on.</p><p>To figure out if this is the case, Dweck et al. studied different species of fruit fly. Compared to <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (a fruit fly common in America and Europe that is regularly used in scientific studies), <italic>D. suzukii</italic> had fewer bitter taste receptor neurons on the major taste organ of the fly head. These receptor neurons were also less responsive to a variety of bitter compounds.</p><p>Next, Dweck et al. tested whether <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. suzukii</italic> showed different preferences for where to lay their eggs by offering them strawberry purées made from fruit at different ripening stages. In this experiment, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> preferred to lay its eggs on purées made from unripe or just-ripe strawberries, while <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> showed a preference for fermented (overripe) purée. Furthermore, when <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> flies were genetically modified so that they became less sensitive to bitter taste, they preferred to lay their eggs in ripe (rather than overripe) fruit, similar to <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. These results suggest that taste has a major role in the egg laying preferences of <italic>D. suzukii</italic>.</p><p>Further research is needed to determine which bitter compounds influence egg-laying decisions in each species of fruit fly, and what receptors respond to these compounds. However, Dweck et al.’s results lay the groundwork for new approaches to reducing <italic>D. suzukii</italic>’s impact on agriculture.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>taste system</kwd><kwd><italic>D. suzukii</italic></kwd><kwd>ripe fruit</kwd><kwd>labellum</kwd><kwd>bitter compounds</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R01 DC11697</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carlson</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R01 DC02174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carlson</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R01 DC04729</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carlson</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Life Science Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dweck</surname><given-names>Hany</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The evolutionary transition of the agricultural pest <italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic> to egg laying on ripe fruits was paralleled with several gustatory innovations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A major agricultural pest has recently emerged in dramatic fashion. <italic>Drosophila suzukii,</italic> endemic to Southeast Asia, invaded California in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hauser, 2011</xref>).

A recent study showed that changes in the olfactory and mechanosensory systems contribute to the adaptation of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to its new niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karageorgi et al., 2017</xref>). The study also suggested the possibility that taste may play a role, a suggestion that we explore in the present study.</p><p>Plants produce a vast diversity of toxins to defend themselves against insect attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biere et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frost et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fürstenberg-Hägg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ibanez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">War et al., 2012</xref>).

Insects in turn have evolved mechanisms for detecting these bitter compounds and avoiding them; these compounds thus deter feeding and oviposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briscoe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pontes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Salloum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sellier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wada-Katsumata et al., 2013</xref>). Since levels of bitter compounds differ among various stages of fruit ripening, it seems plausible that the sensitivity of an insect to different bitter compounds may influence its choice of a ripening stage on which to lay eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batista-Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng and Breen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taghadomi-Saberi et al., 2018</xref>).

We do not claim that the loss of bitter responses is the only gustatory change that facilitated the evolutionary transition of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to oviposition on ripe fruit. Sugar responses, for example, may also have changed and may contribute to the transition, a possibility that deserves investigation. Nor is the gustatory system the only sensory system that has adapted in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>: the olfactory and mechanosensory systems have also adapted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karageorgi et al., 2017</xref>). However, our results suggest a major role for bitter sensation in the shift of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to a new niche.</p><p>It is striking that so much of the evolutionary plasticity we have found – anatomical, physiological, and molecular – is in the peripheral taste system, that is, in taste organs. A priori one might have imagined that taste organs could have retained their underlying molecular and cellular underpinnings, with the plasticity occurring exclusively in the central processing of taste input. In fact, a recent study found that evolution of <italic>Drosophila</italic> mating preferences emerged from evolution of a central circuit, with the peripheral detection mechanisms remaining conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seeholzer et al., 2018</xref>). Although we have found extensive changes in the peripheral taste system, we suspect there may also be changes in central circuit mechanisms. For example, we note that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> has lost oviposition response to LOB, to which it has retained much of its physiological response, suggesting the possibility of changes in central circuitry. It seems likely that evolution has operated at a variety of levels in the shift of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to its new niche.</p><p><italic>D. biarmipes</italic> is much closer to <italic>D. suzukii</italic> phylogenetically than to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, <italic>D. biarmipes</italic> did not show the oviposition preference for early ripening stages observed for <italic>D. suzukii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Rather, <italic>D. biarmipes</italic> showed an intermediate phenotype, as it did in another study using different oviposition assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karageorgi et al., 2017</xref>). The <italic>D. biarmipes</italic> taste system also appears intermediate, in the sense that some phenotypes resemble those of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and some those of <italic>D. melanogaster. D. biarmipes</italic> is like <italic>D. suzukii</italic> in that both have four fewer taste sensilla than <italic>D. melanogaster. D. biarmipes</italic> is like <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> in that both show oviposition avoidance to several bitter compounds that did not affect <italic>D. suzukii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The S-a sensilla of <italic>D. biarmipes</italic> are like those of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> in that they retain a substantial response to overripe strawberry, but the S-b sensilla are like those of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> in that they have lost this response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). One interpretation of all these results, taken together, is that evolutionary changes in a common ancestor of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and <italic>D. biarmipes</italic> provided a foundation for further adaptations that allowed <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to occupy its current niche.</p><p><italic>D. suzukii</italic> exemplifies a broad theme in drosophilid evolution: the successful adaptation of a variety of species to a variety of niches. While <italic>D. suzukii</italic> has adapted to occupy ripening stages not exploited by other drosophilids, other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species have adapted to particular host species. For example, <italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic> has specialized on the noni fruit (<italic>Morinda citrifolia</italic>), which is toxic to other species, and <italic>Drosophila erecta</italic> has specialized on screw pine fruit (<italic>Pandanus</italic> spp.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jones, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Linz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Whiteman and Pierce, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Are the features of adaptation that we have observed in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> also found in these other species? <italic>D. suzukii</italic> differs from <italic>D. sechellia</italic> and <italic>D. erecta</italic> in that it has lost taste sensilla from the labellum; <italic>D. sechellia</italic> and <italic>D. erecta</italic> have retained the canonical numbers and map positions of taste sensilla defined originally in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dweck and Carlson, 2020</xref>). However, commonalities in adaptation mechanisms are also suggested by our results. First, analysis of the <italic>D. sechellia</italic> genome suggested that the rapid loss of 12 bitter Grs contributed to a loss of taste responses to bitter secondary metabolites of noni fruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McBride, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McBride et al., 2007</xref>). Our results in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> using RNAseq support this notion that loss of bitter Gr expression may contribute to a shift in evolutionary niche. Second, oviposition preference in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> was found to depend on two genes expressed in the legs, <italic>Obp57d (odorant binding protein)</italic> and <italic>Obp57e,</italic> leading to the suggestion that an evolutionary change in tarsal taste response contributed to its shift in oviposition preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matsuo et al., 2007</xref>). Our results now establish precedent via direct electrophysiological recording for such a change in tarsal response profiles. In fact, our results indicate how functional classes of taste neurons and their tuning breadths expanded or contracted during the evolution of the three species we examined. Plasticity was not restricted to a particular type of taste sensillum or taste organ.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Bitter taste and oviposition</title><p>We have found a shift from overripe toward ripe preference in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> mutants whose bitter taste responses are reduced compared to wild type. We also found that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> has bitter taste responses that are reduced in many ways relative to <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> What is the link between bitter taste and oviposition preference?</p><p>One simple model to explain our results is that bitter compounds in early ripening stages deter oviposition in <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> Loss of bitter response in <italic>Gr33a</italic> mutants <italic>of D. melanogaster</italic> or in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> would reduce detection of these deterrent compounds, and may thereby contribute to a shift toward oviposition on ripe fruits. Thus the loss of bitter-sensing sensilla, bitter Grs, and physiological responses of the remaining sensilla would all represent adaptations that allow <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to occupy a niche whose bitter compounds deter competition from other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. Direct evidence to support this model comes from electrophysiological recordings of S sensilla, the only class of sensilla in which activity can be confidently attributed to bitter-sensing neurons. In the case of both S-a and S-b sensilla, responses to ripe purée of strawberry are severely reduced in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> compared to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>However, although the loss of response in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to bitter compounds in early ripening stages seems likely to contribute to the oviposition shift, further investigation will be required to fully understand the role of bitter taste in the shift. One might have expected an increased response of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to overripe fruit. However, the response of S-a and S-b sensilla to overripe purées is also reduced in <italic>D. suzukii.</italic> This reduced response to overripe strawberry might by itself, according to the simplest model, be expected to favor a countervailing preference for overripe fruit. This finding illustrates that a full appreciation of the role of bitter taste in the evolutionary shift will require a better understanding of the role of bitter neurons in driving oviposition behaviors, in two respects.</p><p>First, previous work has shown that the influence of tastants on oviposition decisions is complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joseph et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joseph and Heberlein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Bitter-sensing neurons are diverse in their specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delventhal and Carlson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dweck and Carlson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>), and the activation of different bitter neurons may have distinct effects, or even opposing effects, on behavioral circuits at certain concentrations or in certain contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joseph et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joseph and Heberlein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Bitter neurons of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. suzukii</italic> are tuned differently and may be sensitive to different natural cues; <italic>D. suzukii</italic> could conceivably have acquired a new response to a bitter compound in ripe strawberry, perhaps in an I sensillum, that favors a shift toward ripe fruits. Clearly, further work will be required to understand which of the evolutionary changes in bitter coding we have observed affect oviposition choices and the mechanisms by which they affect them.</p><p>Second, we emphasize that bitter neurons operate in a larger context; their activities contribute to, but do not alone dictate, oviposition responses. As an illustration, S sensilla in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> gave a greater response to overripe than ripe purée. If bitter-sensing neurons of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> detect deterrent cues in an overripe fruit, why do these flies lay eggs on it? Oviposition decisions are likely made based on an evaluation of many cues, both negative and positive, and it seems likely that positive cues detected by other neurons of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> – for example, by sugar neurons of the taste system or by neurons of other sensory modalities – predominate in the overripe fruit we have tested. By contrast, in a natural environment in which overripe fruits become increasingly covered with diverse populations of microbes, bitter neurons may provide a warning system that detects toxins, responds strongly, and inhibits oviposition.</p><p>Our results lay a foundation for a wide variety of avenues for future investigation. What specific bitter compounds in ripe or overripe strawberries influence oviposition decisions of each species in a natural context? Are the most influential compounds present in other fruits? We have tested individual compounds and purees, but we do not know the identities or quantities of the compounds that a fly encounters while exploring a fruit in nature. Which bitter receptors respond to these compounds, and is their expression reduced in <italic>D. suzukii?</italic> Might the receptors that respond to these compounds have undergone evolutionary changes in their functional characteristics? Finally, how is information about bitter compounds integrated with information about sugars, other tastants, and other cues to guide oviposition, and have there been evolutionary adaptations in the taste circuitry of <italic>D. suzukii?</italic></p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we have identified gustatory innovations – anatomical, physiological, behavioral, and molecular – in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>.

All tastants were dissolved in 30 mM tricholine citrate (TCC), an electrolyte that inhibits the water neuron. All tastants were prepared fresh and used for no more than 1 day. For electrophysiological recordings, tastants were tested at the following concentrations unless otherwise indicated: ARI, 1 mM; azadirachtin (AZA), 1 mM; berberine chloride (BER), 1 mM; CAF, 10 mM; coumarin (COU), 10 mM; DEET, 10 mM; DEN, 10 mM; ESC, 10 mM; gossypol from cotton seeds (GOS), 1 mM; (-)-LOB, 1 mM; saponin from quillaja bark (SAP), 1%; D-(+)-sucrose octaacetate (SOA), 1 mM; SPS, 10 mM; strychnine nitrate salt (STR), 10 mM; TPH, 10 mM; UMB, 10 mM. All compounds were stirred for 24 hr. THE and UMB were additionally heated to increase their solubility, then cooled and tested while in solution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Multiple-choice oviposition assay</title><p>These experiments were carried out in a cage (24.5 cm x 24.5 cm x 24.5 cm) that was equipped with seven Petri dishes (60 mm × 15 mm, Falcon). Each Petri dish was filled with 1% agar containing 10% w/v purée of one of the ripening stages. One hundred 5- to 7-day-old flies (80 females and 20 males) were placed in each cage. Experiments were carried out in a climate chamber (22°C, 60% humidity, in the dark). The number of eggs was counted after 24 hr. The positioning of the oviposition plates was randomized in each replicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Two-choice oviposition assay</title><p>The two-choice oviposition assay was modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joseph et al., 2009</xref>, except that corn meal food was replaced with 1% agar containing 100 mM sucrose. Oviposition plates consisted of plastic Petri dishes (60 mm × 15 mm, Falcon), which were divided into two halves; each half contained either sucrose or sucrose mixed with a bitter compound. Fifty flies (40 females and 10 males), when 5- to 7-day-old, were placed into an oviposition cage (Genesee Scientific) without anesthesia through a small funnel that fits in the lid of the cage, and left for 24 hr in the dark. Experiments were carried out in a climate chamber (22°C, 60% humidity). Eggs on each substrate were counted. An oviposition preference index was calculated as follows: (number of eggs on sucrose substrate – number of eggs on sucrose+bitter substrate)/(total number of eggs on both substrates).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Scanning electron microscopy</title><p>Flies were fixed in a solution of 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, 2% paraformaldehyde, and 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 2 hr in microporous specimen capsules (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Flies were then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol washes until they were incubated overnight in 100% ethanol. Ethanol-dehydrated flies were dried in a Leica CPD300 critical point dryer. Flies were then glued to metallic pegs with graphite conductive adhesive (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Samples were then coated in 2 nm of iridium with a Cressington Sputter Coater and imaged in a Hitachi SU-70 SEM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Electrophysiological recordings were performed with the tip-recording method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hodgson et al., 1955</xref>), with some modifications; 5- to 7-day-old mated female flies were used. Flies were immobilized in pipette tips, and the labellum or the female foreleg was placed in a stable position on a glass coverslip. A reference tungsten electrode was inserted into the eye of the fly. The recording electrode consisted of a fine glass pipette (10–15 µm tip diameter) and connected to an amplifier with a silver wire. This pipette performed the dual function of recording electrode and container for the stimulus. Recording started the moment the glass capillary electrode was brought into contact with the tip of the sensillum. Signals were amplified (10x; Syntech Universal AC/DC Probe; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.syntech.nl">http://www.syntech.nl</ext-link>), sampled (10,667 samples/s), and filtered (100–3000 Hz with 50/60 Hz suppression) via a USB-IDAC connection to a computer (Syntech). Action potentials were extracted using Syntech Auto Spike 32 software. Responses were quantified by counting the number of spikes generated over a 500 ms period after contact. Different spike amplitudes were sorted; we did not convolve all neurons into a single value. However, in nearly all recordings in this study the great majority of the spikes were of uniform amplitude (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B–D</xref>), and those were the spikes whose frequencies we report. Responses to the TCC diluent alone were subtracted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA purification, library preparation, and sequencing</title><p>Labella were meticulously hand-dissected from approximately one-hundred 5-day-old <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, and <italic>D. biarmipes</italic> females. The tissues were collected and mechanically disrupted in lysis buffer (‘RTL lysis buffer’ from Qiagen). Labellar RNA was extracted using the hot acid phenol procedure. Three biological replicates were produced for each species. Libraries were prepared using KAPA mRNA HyperPrep Kit (Kapa Biosystems) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer by the Yale Center for Genome Analysis. Thirty to fifty million 75 bp paired-end reads were obtains per sample. Raw reads are accessible at the Genbank SRA database (BioProject accession number PRJNA670502).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RNA sequencing analysis</title><p>Reads were aligned to the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome (BDGP6), <italic>D. suzukii</italic> genome (version 1.0), or the <italic>D. biarmipes</italic> genome (version 2.0) using TopHat (version 2.1.1). Cufflinks (version 2.2.1) was used to generate de novo GTF files for each species and quantify <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> labellar transcripts (Ensemble annotation version 100) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">2</xref>). IGV, Integrative genomics viewer (version 2.5.3), was used to inspect the read coverage of genes of interest.</p><p>For quantification, only the coding sequence (CDS) of genes was considered and CDS with length differences across species larger than the read length were discarded. Reads were remapped to the curated CDS transcriptomes and counted using HTseq (version 0.6.1). Read 1 and read 2 were analyzed separately. Differential expression (DE) analysis was carried between <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and between <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and <italic>D. biarmipes</italic> using four different pipelines: (i) DESeq2 (version 1.26.0) using ashr for Log Fold Change (LFC) shrinkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stephens, 2017</xref>); (ii) edgeR (version 3.28.1); (iii) NOIseq (version 2.31.0) with counts normalized by length and read depth (TPM); (iv) NOIseq with counts normalized with SCBN (scale-based normalization, version 1.4.0), a recent method optimized for cross species DE analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). The two latter approaches were used to estimate the number of false positive candidates related to minor differences in transcript length. In the case of duplicated genes, the closest ortholog was kept. If this could not be determined, the most abundant was used. Only significant hits (|Log2FC| ≥ 2, adjusted p-value≤0.01) common to all DE analysis methods were considered.</p><p>The hierarchical clustering of DESeq2 and edgeR result matrices was performed using default settings of the pvclust package in R with default settings. By default, reliability of the branching was assessed by generating 1000 bootstrap samples by random sampling. PCA plot was generated using the prcomp and ggbiplot packages in R with DESeq2 and edgeR results and default settings. The gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed using GOrilla.</p><p>RT-qPCR cDNA was made from 300 ng of labellar RNA as template from using EpiScript (Lucigen). Two biological replicates were prepared per species. PCR was carried out with Apex master mix (Genesee Science) using 15 ng of cDNA.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Craig Montell (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our policy on revisions we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>While many <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, including <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, lay eggs on overripe/fermented fruit, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> has undergone a remarkable evolutionary change in preferring to lay eggs on ripe or underripe fruit. The authors use a compelling behavioral assay to demonstrate the shift in ripeness preference, and also to show that bitter chemicals deter egg laying in two <italic>Drosophila</italic> species but not in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. Moreover, mutation of the bitter receptor <italic>Gr33a</italic> partially reverses overripe preference behavior in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, consistent with a role for bitter taste. Then, the manuscript undertakes a comparative physiology of the taste systems between <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>- from anatomical descriptions of taste structures, changes in receptor expression, and changes in bitter receptor responses.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>As you will see below, the reviewers were generally enthusiastic about the paper. The reviewers suggested several additional experiments that would improve the paper- these should be taken as suggestions rather than requirements. In the absence of additional data, the manuscript should be revised to temper conclusions related to comments below. The key issues discussed were (1) that it remains unclear which of the comparative changes observed in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> actually accounts for the evolutionary shift in oviposition preference, and (2) that Figure 6 data counters an interpretation of the role of evolutionary changes in bitter taste and clarification is needed.</p><p>The full reviews are provided below. Additional experiments are not required, but are suggested to improve the paper if feasible. Otherwise, the authors can temper conclusions accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a really fascinating study that investigates gustatory adaptations in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> crop pest, <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. While many <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, including <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, lay eggs on overripe/fermented fruit, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> has undergone a remarkable evolutionary change in preferring to lay eggs on ripe or underripe fruit. The authors use a compelling behavioral assay to demonstrate the shift in ripeness preference, and also to show that bitter chemicals deter egg laying in two <italic>Drosophila</italic> species but not in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. Moreover, mutation of the bitter receptor <italic>Gr33a</italic> partially reverses overripe preference behavior in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, consistent with a role for bitter taste. Then, the manuscript undertakes a comparative physiology of the taste systems between <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>- from anatomical descriptions of taste structures, changes in receptor expression, and changes in bitter receptor responses. There is a lot to like in this very interesting paper.</p><p>What remains unclear is which of the comparative changes observed in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> actually accounts for the evolutionary shift in oviposition preference. Possibilities include changes in receptor expression, receptor recognition properties, signaling pathways, downstream neural circuits, and/or coarse taste morphology. Furthermore, changes in bitter taste signaling in the periphery is likely only part of the story. The authors do appropriately acknowledge some of these outstanding questions in the last paragraph.</p><p>1) Loss of bitter responses appear insufficient to explain the beautiful behavioral results in Figure 1C vs. D. If loss of deterrents were the only factor at play, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> would presumably not prefer extracts 1 and 5, but instead display equal oviposition across all fractions. Why might <italic>D. suzukii</italic> show enhanced attraction to extract 1? On a related note, extract 7 presumably has increased sugar concentrations- why doesn't this contribute to the behavior too? Are sugar responses intact in <italic>D. suzuki</italic>? How do sweet receptor knockouts perform in the behavioral assay?</p><p>2) The different neuronal responses to strawberry extracts reported in Figure 6A are a bit difficult to reconcile. The responses in S sensilla to overripe fruit are stronger than ripe fruit- if these are due to bitter reception alone (as suggested by <italic>Gr33a</italic> knockouts), then first, there are stronger bitter responses to overripe than ripe fruit in S sensilla of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and second loss of such responses would presumably enhance attraction to overripe rather than ripe in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, the opposite of what is seen. Perhaps sweet responses are also lost? Even more complicated scenarios are also possible such as gain in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> of a new bitter response for overripe (such as through altered receptor recognition properties) or even gain of attraction for an underripe fruit component (odor or taste).</p><p>3) Some bitter chemicals were not effective oviposition deterrents in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, yet electrophysiological responses persisted. At face value, this would seem to suggest that the relevant evolutionary adaptations occurred centrally rather than peripherally. The authors should discuss this further.</p><p>4) I recognize that identifying ethologically relevant bitter chemical/receptor pairs is challenging. As is, it is unclear whether changes in receptor expression and electrophysiological responses are relevant to the behavior. Some evolutionary changes seem subtle rather than all-or-nothing (20% reduction in sensilla or partial reduction in taste responses). Possible alterations in receptor recognition properties are not explored and should be discussed. Other interesting experiments to consider here or for future studies: 1) an empty neuron experiment to look for taste receptors that detect strawberry purees, 2) testing a <italic>Gr22f</italic> mutant, if available, in the strawberry puree preference assay, and 3) since it is unclear how general one ligand-receptor pair may be, testing other fruit purees in addition to strawberry to see if the bitter metabolite is a common deterrent present in many fruits.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:Drosophila suzukii</italic> is an agricultural pest that lays eggs on ripe fruit and therefore destroys crops. This is distinct from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> that lays eggs in fermenting fruit. In this work, the authors provide strong evidence supporting the model that distinctions in bitter taste between <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> could account for their behavioral differences. The authors findings are very interesting and the work is a tour-de-force.The authors developed an oviposition assay using purees of strawberries at different stages of ripeness. The results confirmed the preferences of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> for ripe and early ripening stages, and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> on fermented fruit. Interestingly, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> mutants missing a broadly required bitter receptor, <italic>Gr33a</italic>, shifted their oviposition preference so that they behaved more like <italic>D. suzukii</italic>.</p><p>The authors then carefully compared the number, distribution and morphology of the taste sensilla on the labellum, legs and ovipositor. On the labellum they found that the sensilla are fewer in number and linger in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. The sensilla on the female forelegs were similar in both species. However, the morphology of the sensilla on the ovipositor suggests that they do not function in taste. The authors performed an extensive set of tip recordings and identified the response profiles of different sensilla to a variety of tastants. They found that the sensilla could be grouped into four classes. Another interesting observation is that both classes of S-type sensilla in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> were nearly unresponsive to overripe strawberries, which differed from the higher responses of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. The <italic>D. biarmipes</italic> responses were intermediate. In response to ripe strawberries the L-type sensilla from <italic>D. suzukii</italic> were more responsive than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. The authors also examined the coding of tarsal sensilla to bitter tastants. <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. Next, the authors identified bitter chemicals that deter egg laying by <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> but not by <italic>D. suzukii</italic>.</p><p>Finally, the authors conducted transcriptome analyses comparing RNA expression in labella from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and <italic>D. biarmipes</italic>. Among their findings was the observation that multiple <italic>Grs</italic> were expressed at lower levels in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> than one or both of the other two species. They also analyzed differences in the IRs and other families of genes.</p><p>In summary, this an extraordinarily extensive and fascinating study. This paper is highly appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> in its current form. I have one experimental suggestion, which is completely optional.</p><p>Optional experiment</p><p>1) Is there a fitness effect resulting from <italic>Gr33a</italic> mutants eating ripe fruit. In particular Is the fecundity of the <italic>Gr33a</italic> mutant flies that consume ripe fruit reduced?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Host shifts and food specialization are important drivers of ecological diversity. How host preference behaviors diverge and what sensory adaptations underlie their evolution remains largely unknown. In this manuscript, Dweck et al. investigate the peripheral gustatory system of <italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic>, a specialist that oviposits exclusively on ripe fruits, and compare it to two drosophilids that prefer to oviposit on overripe fermenting fruits, the ancestral behavior in this group. Using puréed strawberries as an oviposition substrate, the authors first confirm previous work showing that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> (Karageorgi, 2017) prefers earlier maturation stages than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, while <italic>D. biarmipes</italic> displays no preference. Previous work proposed that gustatory preferences are likely critical in mediating the ecological shift in oviposition preferences. Indeed, Dweck et al. find that <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> mutant for <italic>Gr33a</italic>, a gustatory receptor associated with responses to bitter tastants, shift their preference towards earlier ripening stages. Based on this observation Dweck et al. then perform a thorough description of sensory responses of two major taste organs, the labellum and the foreleg, in response to a panel of 16 bitter ligands. The sensilla of both appendages map to different broadly conserved clusters based on their response profiles, with two of them, “S-a” and “S-b”, broadly tuned towards bitter tastants. Interestingly, in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> the S-a and S-b clusters display attenuated responses to ripe and overripe strawberry purée, leading the authors to propose that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> has a higher threshold for detecting bitter compounds, which in turn could explain the observed differences in oviposition preference. Using an array of behavioral oviposition assays they show that while other species avoid laying eggs on substrates enriched with bitter tastants, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> is generally indifferent to their presence. Finally, Dweck et al. use RNA-Seq experiment to show that several <italic>Grs</italic>, including one that has been linked to bitter detection in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, are expressed at lower levels in the labellum of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> in comparison to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. biarmipes</italic>. Based on these findings, the authors suggest that a shift in bitter taste reception in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> is involved in the shift towards ripe fruit from overripe fruit.</p><p>Overall, this is a well-written manuscript employing a variety of well-executed experimental approaches to study bitter taste perception in an important agricultural pest and how it compares to other related species. The datasets (neurophysiological recordings, electron microscopy, RNA-Seq) will prove valuable in furthering our understanding of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> ecology and have potential importance in developing possible applications for pest management. That said, the main conclusion that divergence in peripheral bitter taste reception is involved in the host shift in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> is not fully supported by the data. Below I outline where I think the data and analyses fall short of the claims being made and offer suggestions about how the manuscript might be improved to get there.</p><p>My primary concern relates to the missing link between the behavioral observations and the neurophysiological and expression data.</p><p>1) The authors use strawberries as an oviposition substrate, but do not provide an analysis of bitter compounds present in the different maturation stages. What are the bitter compounds on the ripe strawberry that deter <italic>melanogaster</italic> and biarmipes but not <italic>D. suzukii</italic>? The missing data prevents the interpretation of the neurophysiological data: It is unclear if any of the 16 bitter tastants tested are of ecological relevance with respect to strawberries or other potential hosts (several such as DEET and denatonium benzoate for example are human-made synthetic compounds). For the same reason the observed indifference of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> towards these compounds in the oviposition assay (Figure 8), although impressive and suggestive, cannot be linked to the behavioral observations in the more natural context.</p><p>In order to make this link, a chemical characterization of the strawberry purees from different maturation stages is required, as well as an expansion of the tastant panel to ecologically relevant bitter tastants that occur in ripe but not overripe strawberries or differ in concentration.</p><p>2) The authors found that two clusters of labellar sensilla “S-a” and “S-b” are broadly responsive to bitter tastants (Figure 4). They also show that both of these clusters elicit higher spiking rates towards overripe than ripe strawberries across all species (Figure 6). These results are contradictory to the main hypothesis that <italic>D. suzukii's</italic> behavioral shift from preferring overripe to ripe fruit as an oviposition substrate reflects species-specific differences in the threshold for bitter perception. According to the author's model, I would expect S-a and S-b sensilla to have a higher response to ripe strawberries in <italic>melanogaster</italic> and biarmipes but not in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>suzukii</italic>. This is not the case in S-a and S-b. Cluster I also elicits higher responses towards overripe strawberries in all three species. It is important that the authors address these contradictions between their model and these functional results.</p><p>3) Another missing link is that of gustatory receptors to bitter tastants and behavior. The authors use previously made <italic>Gr33a</italic> knockout lines in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and show that a loss of function at that locus leads to a shift from overripe to ripe strawberries as preferred oviposition substrate. While the behavior of <italic>Gr33a</italic> mutant <italic>melanogaster</italic> is more <italic>D</italic>. <italic>suzukii</italic>-like, this result unfortunately does not really help in tying together the different experimental avenues undertaken in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. While it does show that the loss of bitter reception can lead to a host shift in <italic>melanogaster</italic>, it is not a convincing analogy to <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, since 1) taste sensilla of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> are responsive to bitter tastants (Figures 4 – 7) and 2) <italic>Gr33a</italic> is not on the list of genes with decreased expression in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> compared to the other species (Figure 9).</p><p>A promising target to test the role of receptor expression differences in oviposition preference behavior seems to be <italic>Gr22f</italic>. The authors show that it is essentially missing from the <italic>D. suzukii</italic>labellar transcriptome, which could suggest that loss of <italic>Gr22f</italic> expression is an important step in the evolution of oviposition behaviors. I suggest testing this by creating null mutants in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. It might also be informative to define the tuning of <italic>Gr22f</italic> copies in D. melanogaster and <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, to test whether it responds to strawberry bitter compounds in either species.</p><p>Beyond my concerns about the interpretation of the experiments and datasets in relation to the main hypothesis, I also have some questions about experimental design and the presentation or interpretation of some of the data.</p><p>Figure 1: How are maturation stages defined in strawberries? Is there an industry standard? It is currently unclear how the many maturation stages can be identified and whether these are of ecological relevance.</p><p>Figure 2: The oviposition index in &quot;Control&quot; females in 2C and 2D is quite different from the wild types in 2B. Could it be that the w- background interferes with oviposition behavior? What are the numbers of eggs laid in the different conditions and across genotypes? It would be good to exclude that there is an effect of genetic background on egg production and egg laying.</p><p>Figures 4, 5 and 7: Gustatory sensilla are innervated by multiple neurons. How were spikes counted? Did the authors separate different spike amplitudes? Convolving all neurons of a sensillum into a single value might complicate linking receptors to GSN responses in the future.</p><p>Figure 6B: As pointed out above, S-a and S-b sensilla seem to respond more strongly to ripe than overripe strawberry. To allow for this comparison by the reader, please also include a comparison between ripe vs. overripe for S-a and S-b within each species.</p><p>Figure 6C and D: Why is the response to overripe strawberry tested? In light of the hypothesis and oviposition behavior in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> it would be more informative to test the ripe maturation stage instead.</p><p>Figure 9: While the differential expression data and the discussion indicate that <italic>Grs</italic> are expressed at lower levels in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> in comparison to the other species, this should be statistically tested. Do the observed patterns differ from a differential expression pattern expected by chance? Potential reasons for the observation of lower levels of expression for <italic>Grs</italic> should be taken into account. Does <italic>D. suzukii</italic> have less GSNs than the other species? Does <italic>D. suzukii</italic> have more cells of other tissues than the other two that would lead to a relative reduction of reads derived from GSNs in the transcriptome?</p><p>It is hard to extract important information on how groups of genes differ in their expression between the three species from the volcano-plots provided. I suggest making a heatmap of all 9 biological replicates and indicate important genes/gene families therein. This would help identify genes differentially expressed in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> compared to the other two.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64317.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] What remains unclear is which of the comparative changes observed in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> actually accounts for the evolutionary shift in oviposition preference.

Convolving all neurons of a sensillum into a single value might complicate linking receptors to GSN responses in the future.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We did in fact separate different spike amplitudes; we did not convolve all neurons into a single value. However, in nearly all recordings in this study the great majority of the spikes were of uniform amplitude (e.g. Figures 5, 7B-D), and those were the spikes whose frequencies we report. We have now clarified this point in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6B: As pointed out above, S-a and S-b sensilla seem to respond more strongly to ripe than overripe strawberry. To allow for this comparison by the reader, please also include a comparison between ripe vs. overripe for S-a and S-b within each species.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have added a graph showing the data from Figure 6 as a comparison between ripe v. overripe for S-a and S-b within each species (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C, D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6C and D: Why is the response to overripe strawberry tested? In light of the hypothesis and oviposition behavior in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> it would be more informative to test the ripe maturation stage instead.</p></disp-quote><p>We were originally testing an alternative hypothesis for which the comparison shown in Figure 6C, D provided the most direct test. That said, the amplitude of the spikes elicited by ripe and overripe strawberry are the same, but the frequency is higher for the overripe stimulus, so the test shown in this figure is more sensitive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 9: While the differential expression data and the discussion indicate that Grs are expressed at lower levels in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> in comparison to the other species, this should be statistically tested. Do the observed patterns differ from a differential expression pattern expected by chance? Potential reasons for the observation of lower levels of expression for Grs should be taken into account. Does <italic>D. suzukii</italic> have less GSNs than the other species? Does <italic>D. suzukii</italic> have more cells of other tissues than the other two that would lead to a relative reduction of reads derived from GSNs in the transcriptome?</p><p>It is hard to extract important information on how groups of genes differ in their expression between the three species from the volcano-plots provided. I suggest making a heatmap of all 9 biological replicates and indicate important genes/gene families therein. This would help identify genes differentially expressed in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> compared to the other two.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not make our description of the analysis sufficiently clear. The lower levels of the indicated <italic>Grs</italic> in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> were in fact tested statistically, in four different pipelines; we have conservatively reported only those genes that were altered in expression level by at least four-fold (not two-fold), with an adjusted p-value of p&lt;0.01 (not p&lt;0.05), in all four pipelines (i.e. they were not statistically significant in only one, two or three pipelines). We have now made this clearer in the text.</p><p>We have expanded the text to provide a reason why the reduced expression levels of certain <italic>Grs</italic> are unlikely due to a paucity of neurons or an abundance of nonneuronal cells in the labellum of <italic>D. suzukii:</italic> levels of the <italic>IR</italic> co-receptors <italic>IR25a</italic> and <italic>IR76b,</italic> as well as the pan-neuronal genes <italic>elav</italic> and <italic>nsyb</italic>, are similar in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. suzukii.</italic> &quot;The <italic>IR</italic> co-receptor genes <italic>IR76b</italic> and <italic>IR25a</italic> were expressed at similar levels across the three species (Supplementary files 3, 4, i.e. they did not meet the statistical criteria). We note that the comparable expression of these genes, which are broadly expressed in taste neurons (Sanchez-Alcaniz et al., 2018), as well as the comparable expression of the pan-neuronal genes <italic>elav(embryonic lethal abnormal vision)</italic> and <italic>nsyb (neuronal Synaptobrevin)</italic>, argues against the possibility that the reduced expression of certain <italic>Grs</italic> in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> is a simple consequence of fewer neurons or more non-neuronal cells in the <italic>D. suzukii</italic> labellum.&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
