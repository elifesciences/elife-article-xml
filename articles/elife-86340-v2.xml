learning remains largely unclear. We analyzed a large amount of coordinate-localized two-photon imaging data from cerebellar Crus II in mice undergoing ‘Go/No-go’ reinforcement learning. Tensor component analysis revealed that a majority of climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells were reduced to only four functional components, corresponding to accurate timing control of motor initiation related to a Go cue, cognitive error-based learning, reward processing, and inhibition of erroneous behaviors after a No-go cue. Changes in neural activities during learning of the first two components were correlated with corresponding changes in timing control and error learning across animals, indirectly suggesting causal relationships. Spatial distribution of these components coincided well with boundaries of Aldolase-C/zebrin II expression in Purkinje cells, whereas several components are mixed in single neurons. Synchronization within individual components was bidirectionally regulated according to specific task contexts and learning stages. These findings suggest that, in close collaborations with other brain regions including the inferior olive nucleus, the cerebellum, based on anatomical compartments, reduces dimensions of the learning space by dynamically organizing multiple functional components, a feature that may inspire new-generation AI designs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>climbing

learning theory asserts that machine learning algorithms necessitate as many training data samples as the number of their parameters for correct generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr"

al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wurman et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, although the cerebellum contains tens of billions of neurons and even more synapses, and is involved in diverse functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Strick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sokolov et al., 2017</xref>), each of which may require a different coding scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Zeeuw and Ten Brinke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Zeeuw, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Zeeuw et al., 2021</xref>), animals can learn new behaviors within thousands of trials, for which the cerebellum is mainly responsible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolph et al., 2012</xref>). To reconcile these observations, previous theories have proposed that cerebellar compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson and Oscarsson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ito, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nisimaru et al., 2013</xref>) and spike synchronization drastically reduce effective numbers of learning parameters (degrees of freedom) and enable learning from small samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kawato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tokuda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cortese et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kawato et al., 2021</xref>). On one hand, the cerebellar cortex is organized into multiple longitudinal compartments with different intrinsic neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson and Oscarsson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ito, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apps and Garwicz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apps et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sugihara and Shinoda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sugihara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Voogd and Ruigrok, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kano et al., 1990</xref>), each forming a computational unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Outstandingly in each of these, aldolase C (AldC)-positive and negative zones represent distinct information in adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Zeeuw and Koekkoek, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wylie et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schonewille et al., 2006</xref>) and in eyeblink conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hesslow, 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hesslow, 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mostofi et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, this compartmentalization constitutes, at least in part, dimension reduction for cerebellar functions related to eye movement and conditioning. On the other hand, synchronization of climbing fiber (CF) activity, which mainly originates from inferior olivary neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Llinas et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blenkinsop and Lang, 2006</xref>), contributes strongly to cerebellar functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eccles et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nietz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sedaghat-Nejad et al., 2022</xref>). During acquisition of complex behaviors in motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Welsh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoogland et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wagner et al., 2021</xref>) or reward processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wagner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heffley and Hull, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heffley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kostadinov et al., 2019</xref>), CF synchrony might provide flexible dimension control of neural dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kawato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tokuda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kawato et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoang et al., 2020a</xref>). Moreover, synchrony is high within cerebellar compartments, but not across them, implying a structure-function relationship between cerebellar compartments and synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ozden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Gruijl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsutsumi et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is unclear how compartments and synchronization together facilitate dimension reduction for learning of cognitive functions, for which genetic prewiring is unlikely to be sufficient.</p><p>To shed light on mechanisms of dimension reduction in the cerebellum, we systematically examined two-photon recordings of CF inputs to Purkinje cells in eight AldC compartments of mice learning an auditory discrimination Go/No-go task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tsutsumi et al., 2019</xref>). This task requires reinforcement learning guided by reward, and necessitates, 1. accurate timing control of licking to obtain a reward, 2. learning based on reward prediction error, 3. reward processing, and 4. inhibition of licking to the No-go-cue. We applied a hyper-acuity spike timing detection algorithm with 10 ms resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoang et al., 2020b</xref>) to estimate timing of complex spikes (CSs), which were reliably recorded by calcium imaging. Tensor component analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Williams et al., 2018</xref>) of CS activity revealed that 50% of the variance was explained by only four clearly separable components (TC1-4), each corresponding to one of the above four functions. Furthermore, spatial distributions of these four components were markedly different, with functional boundaries between the medial and lateral Crus II and across AldC compartments. Ten-millisecond (ms) resolution analyses revealed that CS synchrony of a specific component was high for a specific engaged cue-response condition, and was spatially localized within corresponding compartments. Tensor components were shaped by bidirectional synchrony-response changes during the course of learning. These results demonstrate that the cerebellum reduces dimensions of activity in a large number of neurons to a much smaller number of components by a synchronization scheme that conforms to a specific task. Behaviorally, across animals, changes in CS synchrony during learning of TC1 neurons were correlated with changes in lick fluctuation in Go trials. In regard to learning, changes in relative proportion of TC2 neurons were correlated with changes in performance of No-go trials. These results indirectly suggested causal relationships of TC1 with timing control and TC2 with cognitive error learning. Interestingly, we also found that individual anatomical compartments and even single PCs can contain signals from multiple components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kitazawa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sendhilnathan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ikezoe et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Markanday et al., 2021</xref>).

Firings for each class of topTC neurons varied considerably with learning stages, while maintaining roughly the same temporal profiles of the corresponding TCs (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref> PSTH temporal profiles at the three learning stages with the corresponding temporal profiles of TCs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>We found that synchrony strengths (estimated as the summation of cross-correlograms in ± 10ms around the center time bin, see Methods) within topTC neurons (0.40±0.17, 0.36±0.17, 0.33±0.17 and 0.19±0.13 for TC1-4, respectively) were significantly larger than those across topTCs (0.12±0.09, p&lt;0.0001 for all pairwise comparisons between within- and across- topTC populations, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We further investigated synchrony strengths for specific cue-response conditions in which TC1-2 were engaged. More specifically, synchrony strength (which was normalized by the number of spikes) of topTC1 neurons in HIT trials (0.40±0.17) and that of topTC2 neurons in FA trials (0.37±0.17) were significantly stronger than those in other cue-response conditions (0.19±0.11 and 0.23±0.14 for topTC1-others and topTC2-others, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This tendency was observed even on a single-trial basis, and strong instantaneous synchrony (total number of synchronous firings in 30 ms bins in a window of 300ms before the first lick onset, see Methods) was found in TC1-HIT and TC2-FA trials at the and learning stages, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Furthermore, such synchrony dynamics were well aligned with the spatial distribution of topTC1-2 (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

To test these possibilities, we investigated synchrony-behavior correlations in the three response windows, namely, early lick (0–0.5 s), reward lick (0.5–2 s) and succeeding lick (2–4 s).

Note that synchronous CS-triggered lick responses of topTC1 and topTC2 neurons in the reward lick and succeeding lick windows were small and unchanged during learning, suggesting that TC1-TC2 were neither related to rewards nor their sensorimotor feedback. Moreover, multiple regression analysis of the two early lick variables (Go and No-go) with instantaneous synchrony of the four topTC neurons combined indicated that lick-latency fluctuation in Go trials was only correlated with synchrony of topTC1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), whereas the early lick rate in No-go trials was most strongly correlated with synchrony of topTC2 neurons, although moderate correlations with synchrony of topTC1 and topTC4 neurons were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>The multiple regression analysis indicated that synchrony of TC1 neurons was strongly correlated with lick-latency fluctuation in Go trials, but that of TC2 neurons was not the only determinant of the early lick rate following No-go cues. Therefore, we hypothesized that an increase in TC1 synchrony would cause a decrease in lick-latency fluctuation in Go trials and that a decrease in the fraction of TC2 neurons would cause a decrease in fraction incorrect for No-go trials. We tested these hypotheses by comparing these changes across mice. For that purpose, we first classified all recorded neurons into one of the TC1-4 populations based on their TC coefficients (see Methods). By investigating inter-subject variability (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref> for data of individual mice), we found that the amount of change in instantaneous synchrony in TC1 neurons was significantly and negatively correlated across animals with the amount of change in lick-latency fluctuation in Go trials (slope = –0.25, p=0.02, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

By assuming that a single spike independently triggers a lick event consistent with the CS-triggered lick histogram, we derived the likelihood of licking events, given the spike train (see Methods for details). As a result, synchronous CSs of topTC1-2 neurons predicted occurrence of lick events statistically better than all CSs of topTC1-2 neurons, all CSs of all neurons in the same recording session, or the chance level for which no correlation between CS and lick events was assumed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). At the individual trial level, synchronous CSs of topTC1 and topTC2 neurons were the best predictors for approximately 50% of all lick events in HIT and FA trials, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4C</xref>).

We visualized such overlap by mixing the coefficients of TC1-4 for individual neurons using CMYK colors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and found that neurons representing different TCs could reside in the same compartments.

Interestingly, while fractions of TC2 and TC4 neurons in the lateral Crus II (AldC compartments 7+to 5-) changed in opposite directions (one-way ANOVA, p&lt;0.0001 for changes in fractions across the three stages, n=150 sessions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), their summation remained unchanged at about 60% even at the session level (ANOVA and pairwise t-tests, p&gt;0.3), suggesting that TC2 neurons were converted into TC4 neurons during learning.</p><p>Next, we constructed a multiple linear regression model to evaluate simultaneous dependence of synchrony strength on geographic distance and TC distance (difference in TC coefficients) of given pairs of neurons (see Methods for details). Note that this regression model is practically plausible, thanks to a relatively weak correlation between the two explanatory variables (geographical distance vs. TC distance, correlation coefficient <italic>R</italic>=0.14, n=170,396 neuronal pairs). We found that the synchrony strength was significantly and negatively correlated with both geographic distance (slope = –0.0004, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and TC distance (slope = –0.07, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These results suggest that geographically close neurons tend to be more synchronized than distant ones, and that neurons with similar TC coefficients tend to be more synchronized than those with different TC coefficients, even when canceling out the other factor.</p><p>We further investigated how boundaries of AldC expression determine synchrony strength in addition to geographic and TC distances among neurons, by pooling neuronal pairs into within- (n=87,192 pairs) and across-compartment (n=83,204 pairs) groups. We found that synchrony strength was higher for the within-compartment group (mean ± std, 0.18±0.12) than for the across-compartment group (0.13±0.09, one-way ANOVA p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). As expected, both geographic distance and TC distance were lower for the within-compartment group than for the across-compartment counterpart (geographic distance, 43±31 and 114±53 μ<italic>m;</italic> TC distance, 0.30±0.31 and 0.39±0.33 for within-compartment and across-compartment groups, respectively, p&lt;0.0001 for all pairwise comparisons using one-way ANOVA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The significance of our work is calcium imaging of CF inputs spanning the entire dorsal surface of Crus II during a reward-driven Go/No-go learning task. This allowed us to study functional differences between Aldolase-C compartments in a single task that required various cerebellar functions. Our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tsutsumi et al., 2019</xref>) suggested that distinct characteristics of CF inputs can be presented simultaneously in multiple cerebellar compartments. However, because analyses in that study were performed for calcium responses with a relatively low temporal resolution (less than 10 Hz) and after the learning is completed, that is, after mice reach the expert level, it remained unclear which neural mechanisms are important and how they are organized as cerebellar components as learning progresses. In the present study, we expanded the analysis of CF inputs throughout the course of learning. Furthermore, timing of complex spikes (CSs) was estimated at 100 Hz resolution using the hyperacuity algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoang et al., 2020b</xref>). Then trial-averaged CS activities were decomposed using tensor component analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Williams et al., 2018</xref>). Three main new findings were drawn based on those two technical advances. First, we found that all CS activity can be decomposed into only four components (TC1-4), which capture key features of behavior and learning. This is a significant dimension reduction performed by the cerebellum. We also found that compartmental representations of these populations align well with functional and anatomical boundaries between medial and lateral parts of Crus II, as well as expression of Aldolase-C. Second, CS synchrony, measured at single-trial level, was concentrated among neurons that belong to the same components. Furthermore, the synchrony strength in different components may change in the opposite direction during learning, suggesting that CS synchrony is the neural mechanism that drives organization of those components. Third, we suggested that, increase of CS synchrony in TC1 neurons may behaviorally decrease the lick fluctuation in Go trials across animals. In parallel for cognitive learning, a decrease of the relative proportion of TC2 neurons may decrease cognitive error of No-go cues across animals. Together, these results indirectly imply causal relationships of TC1 with timing control and TC2 with cognitive error learning. In summary, our study suggested that bi-directional synchronous response-associated changes in CF activities, finely constructed on compartmental structure, could reduce the dimension of the learning space and thus provide a flexible learning scheme in diverse cerebellar functions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Multiple cerebellar components in a single task</title><p>One of the valuable features of this study was that we applied the hyperacuity algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoang et al., 2020b</xref>) to estimate CS timings from calcium responses with 10 ms resolution. This enabled us to study a huge number of neurons (&gt;6000) with hyperacuity resolution (10ms) along a whole process of cognitive and motor learning, with precise spatial localization guided by boundaries between Aldolase-C (AldC) zones. Tensor component analysis (TCA) of this high spatio-temporal resolution CS data revealed four distinct components that may be involved in different learning-related functions (see Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> for principal component analysis of the same CS data). Notably, the first two components are in good agreement with the dichotomy in the literature that CFs either function as “error signals” or “timing signals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mauk et al., 2000</xref>). In particular, the TC1 population consisted of neurons in AldC-positive zones with fast responses in the HIT condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). During learning, increased CS synchrony in TC1 neurons was correlated with the decrease of lick-latency fluctuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, spike-triggered lick responses of TC1 neurons were almost zero for negative time lag and sharply rose in positive time lag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Strikingly, analysis of inter-subject variability across 17 mice showed that the change in CS synchrony of TC1 neurons was negatively correlated with change in lick-latency fluctuation in Go trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These results suggest that CFs projecting to TC1 neurons convey “timing signals” to control early licks, in accordance with timing control hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Welsh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wagner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Llinás, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohmae et al., 2017</xref>). That is, increased CS synchrony could stabilize the timing of motor commands by canceling noisy synaptic inputs to the IO, or contributing to timed motor initiation by evoking rebound firing in downstream cerebellar nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tsutsumi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tang et al., 2019</xref>), possibly leading to more precise timing control with less fluctuation. In contrast, the TC2 population, distributed mostly in the lateral Crus II, showed very fast responses in the FA condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As learning proceeded, TC2 synchronous firings in the FA condition decreased dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and such a decrease was highly correlated with a decrease in the early lick rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, the change in the relative proportion of TC2 neurons was positively correlated with the change in the fraction incorrect of No-go cues across animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These results suggested that TC2 neurons convey cognitive “error signals” (unwarranted licks) specific to the No-go cue, in accordance with the Marr-Ito-Albus hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kawato et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marr, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albus, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ito, 1970</xref>). Together with decoding analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>) and muscimol injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>), all of those results suggested causal relationships of TC1 with timing control and TC2 with cognitive learning.</p><p>In contrast to TC1 and TC2 populations that exhibited marked learning effects, the TC3 population showed only slight changes in CF firing and synchrony, except for becoming silent at the final learning stage for the FA condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The correlation between CSs of TC3 neurons with reward licks was high for HIT trials across all learning stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting the role of TC3 in reward processing. We also found that TC4 is only related to CR trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Increased CS firing in TC4 neurons with learning, especially in AldC compartment 6+, led to the hypothesis that TC4 induces more successful suppression of early licks after the No-go cue, that is, an increase of CR trials and decrease of FA trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Spike-triggered lick responses supported this idea; TC4 firings were correlated with suppression of licks following No-go cues compared to those in the pre-cue period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>From a conceptual standpoint, the fact that motor, cognitive and reward elements are simultaneously represented by the four TCs suggest a new direction for future investigations of CF activity. That is, populations of PC populations may optimize distinct sub-goals using their own neural mechanisms, but they may collectively serve a single task. To observe these phenomena, the task should be complex enough to include several behavioral elements requiring different PC populations, although the importance of these elements may vary depending upon the task. For instance, we insisted that learning in TC2 neurons is more important for the cognitive aspect of the present Go/No-go tasks, because the reward acquisition is determined by correct cue discrimination, while improved motor skills by learning in TC1 neurons would only maximize the reward amount per time. In eye-blink conditioning, which may contain similar cognitive and motor elements, timing control is more crucial than cue recognition because the conditioned response (e.g. closing the eyelid) requires more temporal precision.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Dimension reduction in the cerebellum</title><p>From a computational learning-theory point of view, it is striking and extremely important that only four components seem to account for a wide variety of CF responses of Purkinje cells in eight AldC compartments. We found that four TCs accounted for more than 50% of the variance of 6,445 neurons in four cue-response conditions, while about 20 TCs are needed to explain the same amount of variance for shuffled data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consequently, significant dimension reduction (fivefold) was demonstrated by the permutation test. It is worth noting that these four components also explain main learning effects in the Go/No-go experiment, that is, more precise timing control, error decrease, reward processing, and successful lick suppression. Dimension reduction was further confirmed by conventional principal component analysis (PCA) showing d=67 dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mazzucato et al., 2016</xref>), significantly smaller than &gt;6000 recorded neurons, explained 65% of variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Such dimension reduction by the cerebellum in Go/No-go tasks is remarkable compared to other brain regions in various tasks, although dimension reduction may depend on complexity of the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). Considering various factors involved in learning, such as auditory sensory inputs to the cerebellum representing different frequencies, relevant deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN), timing of licks with respect to auditory cues, and rewards, degrees of freedom of the Go/No-go tasks are huge. If a learning system possesses many degrees of freedom, a huge training dataset is theoretically required. But mice learned auditory discrimination Go/No-go task within hundreds of trials. This implies that the cerebellum reduces the degrees of freedom significantly, thanks to its zonal structure as well as effective mechanisms of dimension control by upstream networks such as gap-junctions in IO neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoang et al., 2020a</xref>). Dimensional reduction is certainly beneficial for the whole brain during learning, by facilitating the coordination between the cerebellum, the cerebral cortex, and the basal ganglia in different learning stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bostan and Strick, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wagner and Luo, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kawato and Cortese, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kostadinov and Häusser, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wagner et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>CS synchrony drives dynamic organization of functional components</title><p>We found that CS synchrony was significantly stronger within TCs than across TCs, and the highest synchrony was observed when TCs function in their dedicated cue-response conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). While CS synchrony was dependent on AldC expression and geographic distance, as already reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoogland et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsutsumi et al., 2015</xref>), our analysis further showed that synchrony was stronger for pairs of neurons with smaller difference in their cue responsiveness, estimated by the TC distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>). Together, these results suggested that synchronization, partially guided by anatomical structure, dynamically organizes diverse functions represented by TCs.</p><p>Remarkably, we also found that CS synchrony is spatially and temporally dynamic, in concert with the organization of TCs. That is, synchronous firing decreased in TC2 neurons for the FA, but it increased in TC1 neurons for the HIT condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Such opposite changes in CS synchrony were strongly correlated with changes in cue responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This phenomenon raised an important question of which factor, CSs or their synchrony, drives licking behaviors. Our decoding analysis indicated that synchronous CSs better predict licking events than ordinary CSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Furthermore, previous studies showed that highly synchronous CSs caused a large drop in DCN activity while isolated CSs produced only weak inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). These results together supported the view that synchronous CS activity shapes DCN output generating motor commands. If that is true, why does CS synchrony change in an opposite direction among different neuronal populations, for example TC1 vs. TC2? We have two plausible explanations for this. One mechanistic explanation could be different synaptic plasticity rules between AldC-positive and -negative zones. Note that TC1 is mainly distributed in AldC-positive zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Zeeuw, 2021</xref>). Another functional hint may come from desired outputs of cerebellar coding in a particular process. Enhanced CS synchrony in TC1 would induce synchronous activation of Purkinje cell ensembles, which in turn, would tune downstream systems to facilitate initiation and coordination of precise timing control of movement. In contrast, strong CS synchrony in TC2 neurons at the initial learning stage would reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional cognitive error signals for fast learning. At later stages, low CS synchrony would increase the dimensionality of cerebellar output for fine and sophisticated learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kawato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tokuda et al., 2013</xref>). This argument was supported by the result showing that dimensions of CS firings in TC1 and TC2 neurons decreased and increased, respectively, in accordance with changes in their CS synchrony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). These opposite changes in the dimension could be realized by interaction between electrical synapses in the IO and positive feedback loop of PC, DCN, and IO, but future experiments are needed to test these possibilities.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Duality of motor control and cognitive learning in TC2 neurons</title><p>Beside their correlation with error signals, synchronized CSs of TC2 neurons may also convey motor commands to control early licks in No-go trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Such a duality of motor control and cognitive learning has never been reported, despite a mixed representation of error information and motor-related variables, for example direction of movement, in CSs was observed in hand movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kitazawa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sendhilnathan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ikezoe et al., 2023</xref>) and saccade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Markanday et al., 2021</xref>). This finding implies that synchronized CSs of TC2 neurons do not simply multiplex complementary behavioral information. Rather, they contribute to generation of motor commands in downstream systems to inhibit the licking following No-go cues. One possible interpretation is that PCs, which are involved in cognitive learning, are assumed to modulate simple spikes (SSs) that also induce licks in FA trials. Long-term depression (LTD) may occur by co-activation of parallel fibers and CF inputs to these PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito and Kano, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jörntell and Hansel, 2006</xref>). As a result, simple spikes (SSs) tend to be modulated so that fewer erroneous licks are generated. We note that suppression of SSs may drive the movement in other learning schemes. For instance, in eye-blink conditioning, SS suppression is correlated with conditioned blink responses on a trial-by-trial basis in awake mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">ten Brinke et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting that TC2 and TC4 neurons (both responded actively to the No-go cue) possess not only almost identical temporal response profiles and overlapping spatial distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), but also the largest overlap among TCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, although fractions of TC2 and TC4 neurons decreased and increased significantly, summation of their fractions remained unchanged during the course of learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We hypothesized that TC2 and TC4 neurons are of the same neuron population, but that they changed their cue-response specificity (FA to CR) due to LTD of parallel-fiber-Purkinje-cell synapses guided by CF inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yamamoto et al., 2002</xref>). Future simultaneous recordings of SSs and CSs as well as downstream systems may reveal neural mechanisms of TC2 and TC4 neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>CFs multiplex various information</title><p>Limitations of the current study are that activities of the four TC populations described above were of neurons sampled in different recording sessions, and that we did not investigate in detail single populations throughout learning. Thus, monitoring population activities as learning proceeds, combined with causal analysis of neuronal responses and behavior changes, is needed to understand diverse CF functions across TC populations. This is particularly crucial because CFs may multiplex motor, cognitive and reward-related information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kitazawa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sendhilnathan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ikezoe et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Markanday et al., 2021</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, we highlighted this possibility by showing a mixed tensor representation of 6445 individual neurons in the cerebellar cortex. Even though each TC has a unique zonal distribution, individual zones or even neurons may represent multiple TCs and may be involved in different cerebellar functions. However, unlike previous studies, multiplexing of CFs in the present study was derived solely from TC coefficients of the neurons. A formal encoding analysis in future work may reveal what variables single CFs multiplex in the Go/No-go task.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All experiments were approved by the Animal Experiment Committees of the University of Tokyo (#P08-015) and the University of Yamanashi (#A27-1), and carried out in accordance with national regulations and institutional guidelines.

Specifically, the selected topTC1-4 neurons (see Methods) were separately classified as k-means clusters #2, #4, #1 and #3, respectively, with a little overlap between TC2-TC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We further compared the results of PCA at the basis of single-trial and trial-averaged. In particular, we computed PSTHs for single trials (sampled in [-0.5–2] sec after cue onset, bin size of 50ms) for all neurons, which resulted in a data matrix of 216901 trials x 50 time-points. For trial-averaged data, trials of a single neuron were averaged according to the four cue-response conditions (HIT, FA, CR and MISS), resulting in a data matrix of 25780 averaged trials x 50 time-points (6445 neurons x 4 conditions = 25,780 averaged trials). PCA for the two data matrices showed comparable VAF profiles, with the dimension d=24 and d=42 for the trial-averaged and single-trial data, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This result supported our trial-averaging approach, which diminished trial-by-trial variability while retaining comparable dimensions. Note that although the recording sessions spanned the course of learning, high correlations in PSTHs of neurons in different learning stages guaranteed that identified common components for all data were reliable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using MATLAB software.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Martijn Schonewille (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The comparison of calcium responses and synchrony of calcium responses across a large extent of the cerebellar cortex during a single behavioral task, and over the course of learning is a major strength. The study would benefit from additional analyses to support the central claims. Also the clarity of the writing and presentation of the data could both be improved substantially.</p><p>1) Additional analysis is needed to support the central claim that the complex spike responses in Crus II during the Go/No Go auditory discrimination task are &quot;low dimensional.&quot; This additional analysis should establish the relevant standard(s) against which dimensionality is assessed -- the observed dimensionality is &quot;low&quot; relative to what expectation? The additional analyses should also address the following specific concerns about factors could cause an underestimation of the true response dimensionality:</p><p>– Four TCs accounting for half of the variance still leaves the potential for plenty of additional dimensionality.</p><p>– Using trial-averaged data rather than single trial responses.</p><p>– Limited task complexity (Gao, Trautmann et al. bioRxiv 2017).</p><p>– Olivary neurons, which have a long refractory period, may have a long autocorrelation time constant, which has also been identified as a factor that could limit dimensionality of neural responses (Gao, Trautmann et al. bioRxiv 2017), although this might(?) be thought of a mechanism through which the olive accomplishes dimensionality reduction.</p><p>The speculation in the text about neural dynamics within the olive implementing (vs inheriting) the decomposition of the task-related neural responses into a few TCs is not addressable without additional experiments, and should be tempered accordingly.</p><p>2) Statistical tests should be conducted to determine the statistical significance of changes in the amount of synchronization with learning, in particular, the central claims of increased synchronization in neurons contributing to TC1, which selectively respond during &quot;hit&quot; trials; and decreased synchrony in neurons contributing to TC2, which selectively respond during &quot;false alarm&quot;/FA trials.</p><p>3) Clarify what the main advance is over Tsutsumi et al. 2019 and other work regarding the correspondence of functional classification of neurons with AldoC expression and boundaries. Substantiate claims with statistical tests, e.g., comparing the similarity of the calcium response measure(s) in neurons with same vs different AldoC expression, controlling for distance between neurons (across vs within AldoC expression boundaries). Revise Figure 6 to better illustrate the claims.</p><p>4) The figures and legends should be revised to provide sufficient information for the reader to fully understand what is being shown in each plot, because some of the basics are currently lacking, as the reviewers noted with reference to many specific examples. Also a number of plots are lacking in error bars, confidence intervals, and/or statistics. In addition, the authors should make it clear that the data in the present manuscript were not just collected in the same manner as in Tsutsumi et al. 2019, as indicated in the Methods, but are actually the very same data set, if that is the case.</p><p>5) The text should be revised to improve clarity in the following areas: a) statements about what are the central new experimental findings compared to previous work of the authors and others; b) statements about what are the conclusions that are the most solidly supported by the data, and their relation to previous work; c) distinguish speculation that goes well beyond the data (there is a lot of it) versus conclusions that are strongly supported by the data. Relating the specific findings in the paper to big concepts is a strength, but blurring the line between conclusion and speculation makes it difficult for the reader to know what to take away, and some of the speculation should be substantially toned down or removed entirely. One important point where the discussion could be improved is the text describing the major longstanding hypotheses in the field about the function of the climbing fibers in response timing vs learning, and how exactly the present data inform those ideas, compared to previous work e.g., Kitazawa et al. Nature 1998.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, this manuscript addresses an important question with an elegant technical approach and careful analysis. While the dataset is strong, there are some important points that I think could be addressed to improve the quality of the manuscript as a whole:</p><p>In the discussion, I think it would be interesting to relate these finding to those in eyeblink conditioning, for a couple of reasons. First, it would be important to discuss to what extent the go/no-go task is more 'cognitive' than eg. eyeblink conditioning. If I understand correctly, mice can start licking from cue onset, and only have to discriminate between the frequencies (if this is not the case, what happened if mice licked before the response period started in Go trials? Were these trials included, was there a timeout of 4.5 s as well?). Given the similarities, I think it would be interesting to also compare the results to those obtained using eyeblink conditioning. Eg. regarding the statement in line 433-437 suggesting that less simple spikes cause less lick, while in eyeblink conditioning fewer SSs actually drive the movement, instead of blocking the erroneous movement. Similar for lines 498-501, in which the authors explain how synchronized CSs drive a decrease in CN activity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As noted above, the trial-averaged TCA makes me wonder just how similar climbing fibers from different recording sessions truly are, beyond similarities in trial-averaged activity. While a single-trial analysis is of course not possible here, I wonder if the authors can quantify the extent to which changes across learning in, for example, TC1 neurons in one zone of crus II correlate with TC1 neurons (from distinct recording sessions) in another zone of crus II, but for the same animal. This might lend additional credence to the appropriateness of trial-averaged TCA for extracting common components from non-simultaneous recording sessions.</p><p>As noted above, the idea that the several dominant tensor components reflect an olivary decomposition of task dynamics is not exactly tested in the present manuscript. The most natural test would have been to modify the behavior to clearly add or subtract a relevant task dimension, and then to examine the resulting crus II climbing fiber decomposition. However, even absent this more direct test, the authors might consider analyzing inter-subject variability. Are differences between mice in behavioral performance or behavioral strategy reflected in a different relative presence of different TCs?</p><p>As also noted, I am curious whether the authors can glean additional information about the role of increased vs decreased CF synchronization in learning. While it is likely implausible to causally test this idea, there may be interesting instrumental analyses that can better characterize the relationship of each to behavior and learning. For individual subjects, does synchronization within TC1 increase at roughly the same rate during learning that synchronization within TC2 decreases? Are the magnitudes of TC1 v TC2 synchrony changes (anti-)correlated for individual subjects?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86340.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The comparison of calcium responses and synchrony of calcium responses across a large extent of the cerebellar cortex during a single behavioral task, and over the course of learning is a major strength. The study would benefit from additional analyses to support the central claims.

The additional analyses should also address the following specific concerns about factors could cause an underestimation of the true response dimensionality:</p><p>– Four TCs accounting for half of the variance still leaves the potential for plenty of additional dimensionality.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we needed objective quantification of ‘low dimensionality’ of CF responses. For quantitative estimation of the dimension reduction, we shuffled the spiking data among all recorded neurons in all trials. We then constructed the same analyses of PSTHs and TCA for the shuffled data as was used for the original data (see Methods for details). The result showed that about 20 components are needed to explain approximately 50% of the variance of the shuffled data, indicating that the dimension of the real data was reduced five-fold compared with the shuffled data (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1A). We also agree that as the reviewer argued, 50% variance still leaves many potential dimensions, but selection of the four TCs was objectively determined by stability of TCA solutions (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1B). Furthermore, the remaining 50% of the variance not explained by the four TCS doesn't seem functionally important because increasing the number of components separated the components with slight differences only in temporal profiles (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1C). It is also important that the four selected TCs were functionally relevant, as shown by strong correlations of neuronal activity and behavior.</p><p>Estimation of the neural-task complex (NTC) using PCA proposed in Gao et al. (2017) is an efficient way to find upper bounds of the dimensionality of neural data, but it requires smoothly evolving neural activity patterns and continuous stimuli. For Go/No-go data, stimuli (Go and No-go cues) were discrete, resulting in four separate cue-response conditions (HIT, FA, CR, and MISS). Furthermore, neural activity patterns change within a recording session. Still, as a validation of our approach, we conducted conventional PCA for the Go/No-go data and found a good consistency between PCA and TCA. Briefly, the tensor vector 6445 x 4 x 50 was concatenated across cue-response conditions so that the input vector became 6445 x 200 (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1A). PCA of this 6445 x 200 vector showed that the Go/No-go data was low dimensional, i.e. d=67 dimensions, estimated as in Mazzucato et al. (2016), explained 65% of variance. Altogether these analyses supported our claim that Go/No-go data is low dimensional relative to the &gt;6,000 neurons recorded. Interestingly, k-means clustering of the PC scatter further confirmed the similarity in neuron classification by PCA and TCA (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Using trial-averaged data rather than single trial responses.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer’s comment regarding trial-averaged data, we conducted PCA on a trial basis and found that VAF profiles of trial-averaged and single-trial data were comparable, with 24 and 42 dimensions, respectively (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1C). This result supported our trial-averaging approach, which diminished trial-by-trial variability while retaining comparable dimensions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Limited task complexity (Gao, Trautmann et al. bioRxiv 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>From the cerebellum's viewpoint, the number of degrees-of-freedom in Go/No-go tasks is huge. For the output dimension, we could approximate the number of relevant deep cerebellar neurons as 10,000. Auditory sensory inputs to the cerebellum representing different frequencies could be at least 1,000. Relevant timing of licks with respect to auditory cues could be 100. The number of liquid rewards could vary from 0 to 5. Then, the degrees-of-freedom are 10,000 x 1,000 x 100 x 6 = 600,0000,000. This is vastly larger than the number of recorded &gt;6000 neurons. Therefore, dimension reduction is crucial for mice to learn the Go/No-go tasks in hundreds of trials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Olivary neurons, which have a long refractory period, may have a long autocorrelation time constant, which has also been identified as a factor that could limit dimensionality of neural responses (Gao, Trautmann et al. bioRxiv 2017), although this might(?) be thought of a mechanism through which the olive accomplishes dimensionality reduction.</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous study of spontaneous IO activity showed that the increased time constant of auto-correlation would indeed increase the dimensionality (Hoang et al., PLOS Comp. Biol. 2020). More specifically, following an injection of carbenoxolone, which blocked IO gap-junctions, both the dimensionality and auto-correlation of IO neurons increased. By contrast, following an injection of picrotoxin, a GABAergic blocker, the dimensionality and auto-correlation decreased (Figure 2&amp;3, Hoang et al., PLOS Comp. Biol. 2020). Importantly, in that study, we found that CS synchrony controls the dimensionality of IO neurons. This was also supported by the present study, showing decreased and increased dimensionality of TC1 and TC2 neurons after learning, respectively, in directions opposite to changes in their CS synchrony (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1D). We mentioned these points in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The speculation in the text about neural dynamics within the olive implementing (vs inheriting) the decomposition of the task-related neural responses into a few TCs is not addressable without additional experiments, and should be tempered accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the editor's comment, thus we removed Figure 7 and revised the Discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Statistical tests should be conducted to determine the statistical significance of changes in the amount of synchronization with learning, in particular, the central claims of increased synchronization in neurons contributing to TC1, which selectively respond during &quot;hit&quot; trials; and decreased synchrony in neurons contributing to TC2, which selectively respond during &quot;false alarm&quot;/FA trials.</p></disp-quote><p>The present Figure 4E plots the accumulated cross-correlograms (CCGs) of selected TC1/TC2 neurons; thus, statistical tests were not applicable. To address the reviewer’s comment, we estimated synchrony strength in HIT trials (+/- 10 ms around the center bin of CCGs) of selected TC1 neurons for the three learning stages. Statistical tests confirmed a significant increase in synchrony strength during learning. Similarly, we found a significant decrease of synchrony strength in FA trials of TC2 neurons. We included histogram plots of synchrony strength for TC1/TC2 neurons in the revised Figure 4E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Clarify what the main advance is over Tsutsumi et al. 2019 and other work regarding the correspondence of functional classification of neurons with AldoC expression and boundaries.</p></disp-quote><p>The significance of our work was calcium imaging of CF inputs spanning the entire dorsal surface of Crus II in a reward-driven Go/No-go learning task. This allowed us to study functional differences between Aldolase-C compartments in a single task that requires various cerebellar functions. Our previous study (Tsutsumi et al. 2019) suggested that distinct characteristics of CF inputs can be presented simultaneously in multiple cerebellar compartments. However, because analyses in that study were performed for calcium responses with a relatively low temporal resolution (less than 10 Hz) and after learning was completed, i.e. after mice reached expert level, it remained unclear which neural mechanisms are important and how they are organized as cerebellar components as the learning progresses. In the present study, we expanded the analysis of CF inputs throughout the course of learning. Furthermore, timing of complex spikes (CSs) was estimated at 100 Hz resolution using the hyperacuity algorithm. Then trial-averaged CS activities were decomposed using tensor component analysis. We discussed these points in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Substantiate claims with statistical tests, e.g., comparing the similarity of the calcium response measure(s) in neurons with same vs different AldoC expression, controlling for distance between neurons (across vs within AldoC expression boundaries). Revise Figure 6 to better illustrate the claims.</p></disp-quote><p>For quantification of differences in calcium response with respect to AldoC expression and boundaries, we compared, with statistical tests, the firing rate of lateral vs. medial and AldC positive vs. negative zones in various conditions of the cue-response condition, learning stages, and temporal windows. The results indicated that the entire CSs in Go/No-go data possesses several distinct components, each with unique firing properties. These components were determined mainly by the cue-response condition and temporal window, and moderately dependent on AldC expression and boundaries. From this viewpoint, we included these results in the revised Figures 2E-I as a motivation for the application of TCA to identify those components.</p><p>We also investigated the CS synchrony between neurons across and within AldoC expression. Synchrony strength was estimated as a function of intercellular distance and response similarity, defined by the cosine distance of the 4 TC coefficient vectors. We found significant negative correlations of CS synchrony vs. cellular/TC distances (Figures 6D-E). When grouping neurons by AldoC expression, we found a tendency for higher CS synchrony and larger response similarity for “within-zone” compared to those of “across-zone” (Figure 6F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The figures and legends should be revised to provide sufficient information for the reader to fully understand what is being shown in each plot, because some of the basics are currently lacking, as the reviewers noted with reference to many specific examples. Also a number of plots are lacking in error bars, confidence intervals, and/or statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the s.e.m and statistics particularly for Figures 1 B&amp;D, 2K, 4D. We also improved the figures in general by providing more information in legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the authors should make it clear that the data in the present manuscript were not just collected in the same manner as in Tsutsumi et al. 2019, as indicated in the Methods, but are actually the very same data set, if that is the case.</p></disp-quote><p>Tsutsumi et al. (2019) analyzed only one-third of the Go/No-go data, i.e. after mice reached expert level, n = 79 sessions, while our paper analyzed all 6,445 neurons during the course of learning (n = 236 sessions). We stated this in the Methods, Results, and Discussion in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The text should be revised to improve clarity in the following areas: a) statements about what are the central new experimental findings compared to previous work of the authors and others; b) statements about what are the conclusions that are the most solidly supported by the data, and their relation to previous work; c) distinguish speculation that goes well beyond the data (there is a lot of it) versus conclusions that are strongly supported by the data. Relating the specific findings in the paper to big concepts is a strength, but blurring the line between conclusion and speculation makes it difficult for the reader to know what to take away, and some of the speculation should be substantially toned down or removed entirely.</p></disp-quote><p>Three main new findings were drawn based on our technical advances. First, we found that all CS activity can be decomposed into only four components (TC1-4) which capture key features of behavior and learning. This is a significant dimensional reduction performed by the cerebellum. We also found that compartmental representations of these populations align well with functional and anatomical boundaries between medial and lateral parts of Crus II, as well as expression of Aldolase-C. Second, CS synchrony, measured at the single-trial level, was concentrated among neurons that belong to the same components. Furthermore, synchrony strength in different components may change in the opposite direction during learning, suggesting that CS synchrony is the neural mechanism that drives organization of those components. Third, we demonstrated across-animal correlation, suggesting that increase of CS synchrony in TC1 neurons behaviorally decreases the lick fluctuation in Go trials. For cognitive learning, across-animal correlation was found, which suggests that a decrease of the relative presence of TC2 neurons decreases cognitive error of No-go cues across animals. Together, these results indirectly imply causal relationships of TC1 with timing control and TC2 with cognitive error learning. In summary, our study suggested that bi-directional synchronous response-associated changes in CF activities, finely constructed on compartmental structure, could reduce dimensions of the learning space, to provide a flexible learning scheme in diverse cerebellar functions. We clearly stated all these new findings at the beginning of the Discussion.</p><p>Also in the revised manuscript, we included some results to strengthen arguments about dimension reduction (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1DE, Figure 6 —figure supplement 1) and bi-directional changes in synchronization (Figure 4E). In the Discussion, as suggested by the reviewers, we summarized findings that were solidly supported by data and their related interpretations. Speculations that went beyond data were substantially toned down, e.g. transformation of TC2 to TC4, or removed entirely, e.g self-organization of components, Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One important point where the discussion could be improved is the text describing the major longstanding hypotheses in the field about the function of the climbing fibers in response timing vs learning, and how exactly the present data inform those ideas, compared to previous work e.g., Kitazawa et al. Nature 1998.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we expanded the discussion about possible functions of TC1 and TC2 in timing control and error-based learning. From a conceptual standpoint, these findings suggest a new direction for future investigations of climbing fiber activity. That is, populations of PCs may optimize distinct sub-goals using their own neural mechanisms, but they may collectively serve a single task.</p><p>On one hand, our analysis was consistent with previous studies that demonstrated mixed representation of error, motor, and reward parameters in CF inputs (Kitazawa et al. 1998; Markanday et al. 2021; Sendhilnathan et al. 2021; Ikezoe et al. 2022). However, unlike previous studies, multiplexing of CFs in the present study was derived solely from TC coefficients of neurons. On the other hand, our analysis further suggested a duality of motor control and cognitive learning in TC2 neurons, which has never been reported. More specifically, beside their correlation with error signals, synchronized CSs of TC2 neurons may also convey motor commands to control early licks in No-go trials. This finding implies that synchronized CSs of TC2 neurons do not simply multiplex complementary behavioral information. Rather, they contribute to generation of motor commands in downstream systems to inhibit licking following No-go cues. We discussed those points in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, this manuscript addresses an important question with an elegant technical approach and careful analysis. While the dataset is strong, there are some important points that I think could be addressed to improve the quality of the manuscript as a whole:</p><p>In the discussion, I think it would be interesting to relate these finding to those in eyeblink conditioning, for a couple of reasons. First, it would be important to discuss to what extent the go/no-go task is more 'cognitive' than eg. eyeblink conditioning. If I understand correctly, mice can start licking from cue onset, and only have to discriminate between the frequencies (if this is not the case, what happened if mice licked before the response period started in Go trials? Were these trials included, was there a timeout of 4.5 s as well?). Given the similarities, I think it would be interesting to also compare the results to those obtained using eyeblink conditioning. Eg. regarding the statement in line 433-437 suggesting that less simple spikes cause less lick, while in eyeblink conditioning fewer SSs actually drive the movement, instead of blocking the erroneous movement. Similar for lines 498-501, in which the authors explain how synchronized CSs drive a decrease in CN activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Behaviorally, Go/No-go tasks are more complex than eye-blink conditioning. For the former, mice need to distinguish two types of stimuli (Go and No-go cues) by two types of response (lick or no-lick), resulting in four types of cue-response conditions (HIT, FA, CR and MISS). For eye-blink conditioning, temporal association of conditioned stimulus, e.g tone, with unconditioned stimulus, e.g. air-puff, is required to produce a timely conditioned response, e.g blink. Thus Go/No-go and eye-blink conditioning may contain both cognitive and motor elements. However, the cognitive element is more important for Go/No-go tasks, because the reward acquisition depends on correct cue discrimination and improved motor skills only maximizes the reward amount for correct responses. By contrast, in eye-blink conditioning, the movement requires more temporal precision; thus, the motor element is more important.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that while suppression of SSs drives the movement in eye-blink conditioning (ten Brinke et al., Cell Reports, 2015), it might block erroneous movement following No-go cues. We discussed these points in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>As noted above, the trial-averaged TCA makes me wonder just how similar climbing fibers from different recording sessions truly are, beyond similarities in trial-averaged activity. While a single-trial analysis is of course not possible here, I wonder if the authors can quantify the extent to which changes across learning in, for example, TC1 neurons in one zone of crus II correlate with TC1 neurons (from distinct recording sessions) in another zone of crus II, but for the same animal. This might lend additional credence to the appropriateness of trial-averaged TCA for extracting common components from non-simultaneous recording sessions.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment, for individual animals, we computed the Pearson correlation of PSTHs for TC1 neurons in HIT trials and TC2 neurons in FA trials, with neurons being further divided into two pools representing “within zone” and “across zone”. Note that here TC1/TC2 neurons were sampled from all recording sessions/learning stages. The baseline level was computed from all neurons in the same recording sessions. The results indicated that correlations between TC1/TC2 neurons were significantly higher than baseline for both conditions, supporting our TCA to extract common components from non-simultaneous recording sessions. We added this result in Figure 6 —figure supplement 1D.</p><p>We further note that although TCA was conducted for trial-averaged data (PSTHs), analysis of CS synchrony was on a trial basis. The fact that CS synchrony was higher with the same TCs than across TCs (Figure 4A) indicated a strong similarity in firing activity of neurons of the same TCs on a trial basis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As noted above, the idea that the several dominant tensor components reflect an olivary decomposition of task dynamics is not exactly tested in the present manuscript. The most natural test would have been to modify the behavior to clearly add or subtract a relevant task dimension, and then to examine the resulting crus II climbing fiber decomposition. However, even absent this more direct test, the authors might consider analyzing inter-subject variability. Are differences between mice in behavioral performance or behavioral strategy reflected in a different relative presence of different TCs?</p></disp-quote><p>For implementation of this idea, we first computed the fraction of TC1/TC2 neurons as functions of behavioral performance, i.e. fraction correct for Go, and fraction incorrect for No-go. As expected, we found positive correlations, i.e. fraction correct for Go increases and fraction of TC1 neurons increases, and vice versa for TC2-Nogo, for most animals. When all 17 animals combined, the increasing rate of the TC1 fraction during learning equals the decreasing rate of the TC2 fraction (Figure 5 —figure supplement 3). Strikingly, by analyzing inter-subject variability as the reviewer suggested, we found that change in a fraction of TC2 neurons was positively correlated with the change in fraction incorrect of No-go cues across animals. This result indirectly suggested a causal relationship of TC2 with cognitive error learning. We included this important result in Figure 5F and mentioned this finding in the Abstract, Results and Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As also noted, I am curious whether the authors can glean additional information about the role of increased vs decreased CF synchronization in learning. While it is likely implausible to causally test this idea, there may be interesting instrumental analyses that can better characterize the relationship of each to behavior and learning. For individual subjects, does synchronization within TC1 increase at roughly the same rate during learning that synchronization within TC2 decreases?

We tested this hypothesis and found that across 17 animals, the amount of change in instantaneous synchrony of TC1 neurons was significantly and negatively correlated with the amount of change in lick-latency fluctuation in single Go trials (Figure 5E). Again, this finding indirectly suggested a causal relationship that CFs projecting to TC1 neurons convey “timing signals” to control early licks, because more synchronization could stabilize the timing of motor commands by canceling noisy synaptic inputs to the IO, possibly leading to more precise timing control with less fluctuation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
