α-synuclein (αSyn) associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the activation of this pathway is mainly by targeting lysosomal enzymic activity. Here, we focused on the autophagosome-lysosome fusion process around the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) regulated by lysosomal positioning. Through high-throughput chemical screening, we identified 6 out of 1200 clinically approved drugs enabling the lysosomes to accumulate around the MTOC with autophagy flux enhancement. We further demonstrated that these compounds induce the lysosomal clustering through a JIP4-TRPML1-dependent mechanism. Among them, the lysosomal-clustering compound albendazole promoted the autophagy-dependent degradation of Triton-X-insoluble, proteasome inhibitor-induced aggregates. In a cellular PD model, albendazole boosted insoluble αSyn degradation. Our results revealed that lysosomal clustering can facilitate the breakdown of protein aggregates, suggesting that lysosome-clustering compounds may offer a promising therapeutic strategy against neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the presence of aggregate-prone proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>alpha-synuclein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000646</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science London</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18K15464 21K07425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sasazawa</surname><given-names>Yukiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000646</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science London</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18KK0242 18KT0027 22H02986</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saiki</surname><given-names>Shinji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lysosomal clustering around the microtubule-organizing centre would be a promising therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>PD, the second most prevalent progressive neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease, is characterized by dopamine depletion due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. PD affects a broad range of motor and nonmotor functions and develops in approximately 1% of individuals over the age of 65. One primary therapy for PD is dopamine supplementation, often through medications like levodopa. While levodopa has a transformative effect, its chronic use can result in adverse effects, such as wearing off and dyskinesia. Since current treatments do not prevent the loss of dopaminergic neurons, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to address the challenges of PD.</p><p>The aggregation and deposition of the αSyn protein, also known as Lewy bodies, within dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra play a critical role in the etiology of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Spillantini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Postuma et al., 2015</xref>). Research interest is increasing in the induction of autophagy, a primary protein degradation system that removes αSyn aggregates, using small-molecule compounds as a therapeutic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Webb et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2020b</xref>). During autophagy, an isolation membrane engulfs part of the cytoplasm, forming a double-membraned vesicle known as an autophagosome. This organelle then fuses with lysosomes, creating autolysosomes where lysosomal hydrolases break down the vesicle’s contents. Notably, rapamycin, a recognized autophagy inducer, can inhibit αSyn aggregation in vivo and improve motor functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crews et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dehay et al., 2010</xref>). However, even with the discovery of autophagy inducers, no fully effective treatment has been established. For instance, while nilotinib boosts autophagic αSyn clearance in αSyn transgenic PD model mice, its performance in clinical trials was underwhelming. Therefore, compounds that can dismantle aggregated proteins using innovative mechanisms need to be developed.</p><p>Recent studies have highlighted the importance of lysosomal distribution in regulating autophagy and its associated genes. Lysosomes clustering around the (MTOC) are pivotal in managing autophagic flux. The close physical association between these clustered lysosomes and autophagosomes facilitates their fusion as well as inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Korolchuk et al., 2011</xref>). The transport of lysosomes to the MTOC is dependent on the dynein/dynactin complex and involves several protein pathways: (i) the small GTPase Rab7–Rab7 effector Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johansson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rocha et al., 2009</xref>; (ii) the transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1)–apoptosis-linked gene 2 (ALG2) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2016</xref>; and (iii) the lysosomal membrane protein TMEM55B-JNK-interacting protein 4 (JIP4) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Willett et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, we recently identified an additional pathway involving the phosphorylated JIP4–TRPML1–ALG2 complex induced by oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sasazawa et al., 2022</xref>). We also hypothesize that the phosphorylation status of JIP4 at T217 by CaMK2G serves as a controlling switch, altering its binding affinity and thus dictating the pathway activated by JIP4.</p><p>Notably, disruptions in lysosome and autophagosome transport can contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. For example, dynactin mutations are linked to Perry’s Disease, a rare hereditary neurodegenerative condition marked by autosomal dominant parkinsonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Konno et al., 2017</xref>). Such mutations disrupt lysosomal distribution, leading to impaired autophagy and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ishikawa et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a causative protein in PD, is essential in regulating autophagosome and lysosomal trafficking, particularly in partnership with JIP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonet-Ponce et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kluss et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kluss et al., 2022b</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, mounting evidence suggests that protein aggregates, including those causing neurodegenerative diseases, accumulate around MTOCs and are degraded via the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Proteasome inhibitors, for example, aggregate near the nucleus and undergo autophagic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jänen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Choi et al., 2020a</xref>). In the same vein, the pathogenic protein mutant huntingtin, linked to Huntington’s disease, forms aggresomes near the nucleus and is degraded by autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Waelter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, the αSyn aggregates that form Lewy bodies in patients with PD accumulate near the MTOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Olanow et al., 2004</xref>), hinting at the possibility that MTOC-centric autophagy facilitates their removal. Prior research has shown that Arl8b overexpression inhibits the degradation of αSyn-A53T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Korolchuk et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that lysosomal retrograde trafficking is vital in the breakdown of αSyn-A53T.</p><p>Therefore, we hypothesize that compounds that induce lysosomal clustering near MTOCs could minimize the distance between lysosomes, autophagosomes, and degradation substrates, thereby enhancing the degradation of protein aggregates. Guided by this concept, we developed a screening system that employed high-content image screening to identify a novel set of autophagy inducers that encourage lysosomal clustering. We further demonstrated that these compounds effectively degrade αSyn aggregates, underscoring the potential of enhancing lysosomal clustering as a strategy for eliminating protein aggregates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell-based screening for compounds inducing lysosomal clustering</title><p>To identify compounds that enhance the degradation of αSyn aggregates, we first screened for the ability to induce lysosomal clustering and then assessed their autophagy-inducing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Method for screening lysosomal-clustering compounds.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme for the process of screening for lysosomal-clustering compounds.

As a starting point, we engineered SH-SY5Y cells to stably express both LGP120-mCherry (a lysosomal marker) and GFP-γ-tubulin (an MTOC marker) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Using the INCellAnalyzer2200, we captured fluorescence images of GFP and mCherry. The distribution of lysosomes was then quantified using ImageJ software. We determined the MTOC location using the GFP-γ-tubulin spot signal, then enclosed the MTOC in a circle roughly 7 µm in diameter. The intensity of the LGP120-mCherry signal within this circle was gauged, and its ratio to the overall intensity for the cell was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This ratio, when related to the control, was defined as the lysosomal clustering value.</p><p>To verify the accuracy of our approach, we cultivated the cells under starvation conditions, using this as the positive control, and subsequently assessed lysosomal distribution. Starvation resulted in evident lysosomal clustering, noticeable in fluorescence images and corroborated by the elevated lysosomal clustering value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), thereby underscoring the utility of our high-content image-screening system.</p><p>Using this screening method, we assessed approximately 1200 compounds, all of which are clinically approved in Japan. Of these, 63 exhibited a high lysosomal clustering value greater than 1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Topoisomerase inhibitor and benzimidazole-induced lysosomal clustering and autophagy</title><p>To identify the autophagy inducers, we assessed the autophagic activity of the selected compounds using RFP–GFP tandem fluorescent-tagged LC3 (R-G-LC3) as a second screening test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takayama et al., 2017</xref>). We established SH-SY5Y cells that stably expressed R-G-LC3. During the fusion of autophagosomes with mammalian lysosomes in these cells, GFP fluorescence is quenched due to its pH sensitivity and subsequently degraded by lysosomal proteases. In contrast, RFP is resistant to both acidic conditions and lysosomal proteases, resulting in accumulation in lysosomes. The distinct properties of RFP and GFP enabled us to evaluate autophagic activity precisely by measuring the RFP/GFP fluorescence ratio in a cell using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identification of autophagy inducers via lysosomal clustering.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SH-SY5Y cells expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) tandem fluorescent-tagged LC3 (<bold>R–G–LC3</bold>) were analyzed by flow cytometer after treatment with 63 lysosomal-clustering compounds for 20 hr.

Interestingly, these two processes employ distinct pathways influenced by the phosphorylation status of JIP4. Specifically, oxidative stress results in the phosphorylation of JIP4 at T217 through CaMK2G activation, regulating lysosomal retrograde transport in tandem with TRPML1 and ALG2. In contrast, starvation mediates lysosomal retrograde transport predominantly through the TRPML1–ALG2 and TMEM55B–JIP4 pathways without JIP4 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sasazawa et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Given this background, we determined whether lysosomal clustering induced by topo-i and benzimidazole is dependent on JIP4 phosphorylation. We employed Jak3 inhibitor VI, previously identified as an inhibitor of the JIP4 kinase CaMK2G, which regulates oxidative stress-induced lysosomal clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sasazawa et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, Jak3 inhibitor VI effectively suppressed lysosomal clustering induced by the three topo-i compounds. In contrast, the effects of benzimidazole remained largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Moreover, Phos-tag sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analyses revealed that all three topo-i compounds induced JIP4 phosphorylation, an effect counteracted by Jak3 inhibitor VI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). siCaMK2G also inhibited lysosomal clustering induced by all three topo-i compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). In addition, Ca2<sup>+</sup> imaging showed that teniposide, but not albendazole, upregulated Ca2<sup>+</sup> flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that CaMK2G-phosphorylated JIP4 is pivotal for topo-i-induced lysosomal clustering. In addition, rescue experiments in JIP4 KO SH-SY5Y cells, which re-expressed either flag-tagged wild-type JIP4 or a phosphorylation-defective variant (T217A JIP4), revealed that only the cells with wild-type flag-JIP4 could recover the teniposide-induced lysosomal clustering phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). This underscores the indispensability of JIP4 phosphorylation at T217 for the changes in lysosomal distribution induced by topo-i. In summary, while topo-i-induced lysosomal clustering is promoted by phosphorylated JIP4 (T217) in conjunction with TRPML1 (but not ALG2), benzimidazole-driven lysosomal retrograde transport, exemplified by albendazole, engages the TRPML1–JIP4–ALG2 and Rab7 pathways.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Lysosomal clustering induced by topoisomerase inhibitor requires JIP4 phosphorylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SH-SY5Y cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), teniposide (10 μM), amsacrine (10 μM), etoposide (10 μM), albendazole (10 μM), oxibendazole (1 μM), or mebendazole (5 μM) with or without Jak3 inhibitor VI for 4 hr.

Conversely, in the presence of albendazole or under starvation conditions in JIP4 KO cells, the accumulation of autolysosomes at the cell periphery was infrequently observed. This supports the presumption that lysosomal clustering induced by albendazole or starvation is also mediated by pathways other than JIP4, such as the Rab7-mediated pathway.</p><p>Furthermore, autophagosomes that did not colocalize with lysosomes were detected in the cytoplasm following treatments with teniposide and albendazole and under starvation conditions in JIP4 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, indicated by a white arrow). These findings imply that teniposide- and albendazole-induced autophagy stimulates JIP4-dependent lysosomal movement to induce autophagy and facilitate the formation of autolysosomes. Moreover, these results suggest the potential role of JIP4, not only in lysosomal retrograde transport, but also in autophagosomal retrograde transport. In summary, in JIP4 KO cells, lysosomes and autophagosomes are directed toward the cell periphery, thereby retaining some level of autophagic flux.</p><p>In addition, to assess the ability of lysosomal-clustering compounds to induce autophagy by promoting the formation of autolysosomes, we compared the autophagic activity between Halo-LC3 and co-treatment with Torin1, which does not induce lysosome clustering, and a lysosomal-clustering compound. Cotreatment with Torin1 and teniposide or albendazole-induced autophagy more effectively than Torin1 treatment alone, without affecting mTOR inhibition activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These findings indicate that the induction of autophagy by lysosome-clustering compounds is not caused by autophagosome formation but by the formation of autolysosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Albendazole-degraded proteasome inhibitor MG132-induced aggregates</title><p>Because topo-i exhibits cytotoxicity and is clinically used as an anti-cancer drug, we explored the ability of albendazole to induce protein aggregate degradation through autophagy.

MG132, a well-known proteasomal inhibitor, increased p62 and poly-ubiquitinated protein levels in the Triton-X insoluble fraction. This increase declined time-dependently after the washout of MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Furthermore, the reduction in p62 and ubiquitin levels following the MG132 washout was markedly suppressed in autophagy-deficient FIP200 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These results show that basal autophagy degrades the MG132-induced protein aggregates.

The effects of albendazole, however, were suppressed in FIP200 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

Subsequently, we assessed the αSyn concentration in the Triton-X insoluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). The introduction of αSyn fibrils notably increased αSyn-GFP levels, indicating αSyn aggregation in the Triton-X insoluble fraction. However, these levels decreased post-fibril washout after an 8 hr culture with standard media. This decline was mildly inhibited by bafilomycin A1, suggesting that basal autophagy degrades aggregated αSyn. Furthermore, albendazole treatment caused a marked tendency toward decreased αSyn-GFP levels compared with DMSO treatment. This decrease was also hindered by bafilomycin A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>). This pattern indicates that albendazole mediates αSyn aggregate degradation through autophagy. Moreover, to evaluate the degradation ofαSyn monomers by albendazole, we used SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing αSyn-Halo, to measure αSyn degradation by quantifying the cleaved Halo. Albendazole treatment induced a higher cleavage rate of Halo than DMSO treatment for 8 hr, suggesting that albendazole can degrade both αSyn monomers and aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The unchanged αSyn-GFP levels in the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) are likely due to the abundance of soluble αSyn-GFP. Therefore, albendazole enhances the autophagy-mediated degradation of αSyn-GFP aggregates and monomers.</p><p>Next, we investigated the degradation of αSyn-GFP aggregates by Torin1, which induces autophagy, but not lysosomal clustering. Torin1 also induced the degradation of aggregates, which was inhibited by bafilomycin A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). However, the degradation activity of albendazole was more vigorous than that of Torin1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Moreover, we found that Torin1 exhibited higher autophagic induction activity than albendazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

We created a high-throughput screening system to quantify lysosomal accumulation by quantifying lysosomes located within a circular region centered on the MTOC. This was achieved through image analysis using INCellAnalyzer2200 and ImageJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We discovered that topo-i and benzimidazole promoted lysosomal clustering via the JIP4–TRPML1 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Specifically, topo-i induced lysosomal clustering through the phosphorylation of JIP4 at T217 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Compounds that stimulate lysosomal clustering also facilitate the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes near the MTOC by transporting autophagosomes via JIP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, albendazole-induced lysosomal accumulation around αSyn aggregates surrounding the nucleus, subsequently degrading these aggregates in a lysosome-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Our results indicate that lysosomal clustering plays a significant role in αSyn degradation. Thus, novel lysosomal-clustering agents have potential clinical applications through the targeting of αSyn aggregation in PD.</p><p>Topo-i and benzimidazole induce lysosomal clustering through distinct mechanisms. In our study, topo-i-driven lysosomal transport was regulated by JIP4 and TRPML1, but not by ALG2. This transport relies on the phosphorylation of JIP4 at T217 by CaMK2G. However, a previous study found that oxidative stress-induced lysosomal retrograde transport is influenced by the phosphorylated–JIP4–TRPML1–ALG2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sasazawa et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, topo-i induces lysosomal clustering via a unique mechanism, involving p-JIP4 and TRPML1 without ALG2. Considering that TRPML1 acts as a reactive oxygen species sensor in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), topo-i may induce ROS production and stimulate TRPML1. Therefore, we assessed intracellular ROS in response to topo-i. Topo-i, such as teniposide, etoposide, and amsacrine, significantly increased ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Moreover, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a ROS scavenger, partially attenuated topo-i-induced lysosomal clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Based on the activity of CAMK2G siRNA, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>, and S5, topo-i may activate TRPML1 in a ROS-dependent manner and increase PI(3,5)P2 binding with TRPML1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dong et al., 2010</xref>).

Benzimidazole binds to β-tubulin, disrupting microtubule-based processes in parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lacey, 1988</xref>). We observed that oxibendazole, even in low concentrations, promoted lysosomal clustering. However, at high concentrations, it disrupted tubulin production, thereby inhibiting lysosomal clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). We hypothesized that tubulin polymerization induced by benzimidazole plays a key role in inducing lysosomal clustering. To clarify this, we observed the behavior of tubulin filaments in response to various albendazole concentrations under confocal microscopy. Under conditions where albendazole was administered to induce lysosomal clustering, tubulin filaments were observed only near the MTOC, and the filaments in the cell periphery were disassembled. In contrast, when exposed to higher albendazole concentrations, tubulin filaments throughout the cell were disassembled, resulting in the inhibition of lysosomal clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). This would explain why benzimidazole exerts lysosomal clustering activity within a narrow concentration range.</p><p>Interestingly, benzimidazole not only failed to induce lysosomal clustering in HeLa cells, but it also transported lysosomes to the cell periphery. Moreover, this drug failed to induce autophagy flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Therefore, we examined the relationships between tubulin depolymerization and lysosomal clustering induced by albendazole in HeLa cells and found that albendazole did not induce lysosomal clustering but rather inhibited it at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A, D and E</xref>). Interestingly, similar to SH-SY5Y cells, a low albendazole concentration (10 μM) induced tubulin depolymerization only at the cell periphery, whereas a high concentration (100 μM) depolymerized the entire cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). However, unlike SH-SY5Y cells, no characteristic accumulation of tubulin filaments was observed near the MTOC under low albendazole concentration (10 µM); instead, they were arranged around the nucleus. Concurrently, lysosomes were around these dispersed tubulin filaments. Therefore, the differences in the effects of benzimidazole in HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells lie in the dose-dependent effects on the state of tubulin filaments.</p><p>Under <italic>JIP4</italic>, <italic>TRPML1</italic>, <italic>ALG2,</italic> and <italic>Rab7</italic> silencing, lysosomes may fail to interact with microtubules, resulting in the inhibition of lysosomal clustering.

It is associated with the PD-related protein LRRK2 in JIP4-mediated lysosomal positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonet-Ponce et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boecker et al., 2021</xref>) and is involved in oxidative stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sasazawa et al., 2022</xref>), pH regulation, and various cellular functions.</p><p>Lysosomal clustering promotes the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and assists in breaking down aggregates and other cellular components. Previous studies reported that lysosomal retrograde transport enhances the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes during nutrient starvation, thus triggering autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Korolchuk et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with these findings, our study showed that in JIP4 KO cells, Halo-LC3 degradation was inhibited, implying the significant role of JIP4 in this process.</p><p>Ubiquitinated protein, p62 aggregation, and the proteasome itself, when blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, are eventually degraded via the autophagy-lysosome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jänen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Choi et al., 2020a</xref>). Moreover, forcing lysosomes to the cell periphery by overexpressing Arl8b inhibits the breakdown of aggregates induced by MG132 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zaarur et al., 2014</xref>). Our research provides the first evidence for the involvement of lysosomal clustering in the degradation of MG132-induced aggresomes and αSyn fibril transduction.</p><p>Notably, we showed that suppressing lysosomal clustering via the JIP4–pathway inhibits αSyn degradation. Furthermore, by inducing lysosomal clustering, albendazole can degradeαSyn aggregates more effectively than Torin1. Our results highlight the critical role of lysosomal clustering in enhancing protein aggregate degradation.</p><p>Aggregates formed by the mutant huntingtin protein associated with Huntington’s disease are typically found both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. These aggregates attract autophagosomes via the autophagy adapter CCT2, leading to their autophagy-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma et al., 2022</xref>). During this process, the recruitment of lysosomes to the aggregates is evident. In our studies, we also observed increased lysosomal clustering and elevated LC3-II levels in the insoluble fraction during αSyn aggregate formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). This observation suggests that LC3-II binds to αSyn aggregates, and the subsequent accumulation of autophagosomes and lysosomes around the aggregates stimulates autophagy, leading to αSyn aggregate degradation. Receptor proteins may link LC3-II to αSyn and the degradation of huntingtin protein aggregates.</p><p>Overall, our results emphasize that lysosomal clustering is pivotal in aggregate degradation. Albendazole, by enhancing autophagy through lysosomal accumulation, is a promising therapeutic agent that can be administered to break down αSyn aggregates in Lewy body disease associated with PD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>A chemical library consisting of about 1,200 clinically approved drugs in Japan was supplied by Prof. Hideyuki Saya (Fujita Medical University, Japan).

compounds fostering lysosomal clustering to enhance the clearance of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative disorders. The data were collected and analyzed using solid and validated methodology. While a deeper mechanistic understanding would have strengthened the study, the work will be of interest to cell biologist work on autophagy and lysosome and medical biologists working on neurodegenerative diseases.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98649.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03cve4549</institution-id><institution>Tsinghua University</institution></institution-wrap><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors' note: this paper was reviewed by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</ext-link>.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98649.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General Statements [optional]</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the review of our paper entitled “Identification of novel autophagy inducers by accelerating lysosomal clustering against Parkinson's disease” (RC-2023-02232). We have carefully read the critiques and planed experiments. Below we include point-by-point responses to the questions raised by the reviewers. We believe this revision plans appropriately addresses the issues raised by Reviewers. Finally, all the authors would like to thank again the Editor and Reviewers for improving our manuscript by providing their invaluable comments and suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point-by-point description of the revisions</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>The manuscript by Date et al. employed a cell model by stably expressing LGP120-mCherry and GFP-γ-tubulin to carry out high-content screening in search of chemical compounds that enhance lysosomal clustering and autophagy. They found 6 clinically approved drugs categorized as topoisomerase II inhibitors and the benzimidazole class. They further validated these compounds by a set of well-designed experiments including autophagy flux assays and mTOR dependence. In the mechanistic study, they demonstrated the compounds induce lysosomal clustering in a JIP4-TRPML1-dependent manner. In a PD cell model, one of the compounds albendazole exhibited the effect on boosting the degradation of insoluble α-synuclein. The study is of interest, and the cell model and the approach generated by the authors would be transferable for future studies of other high-content imaging screening. Most of the data is clear and convincing.</p><p>Major comment</p><p>1) In addition to its role in facilitating a-syn turnover by autophagy, Is the chemical protective against a-syn toxicity?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the Reviewer, we examined the cytotoxicity of αSyn aggregates in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing αSyn-GFP by LDH assay. As shown in the revised version of Figure 1, αSyn aggregates induced by introducing αSyn fibrils into SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing αSyn-GFP did not exhibit any cytotoxicity. In addition, we observed no significant change in cell death after 8 hours of treatment with albendazole compared with DMSO.</p><p>Previous studies have reported that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with PD with a triplication of the human <italic>SNCA</italic> genomic locus exhibited reduced capacity for differentiation into dopaminergic or GABAergic neurons, decreased neurite outgrowth, and lower neuronal activity compared with control cultures, albeit without showing cytotoxicity (<italic>Cell Death and Disease</italic> 6: e1994, Oliveira et al., 2015). Given this context, we were thus unable to conduct the suggested assessment due to technical limitations. Therefore, we consider the evaluation of the recovery of αSyn toxicity by drug treatment challenging in this cellular model using fibril αSyn.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please elaborate why albendazole does not change the levels of soluble a-syn, but those of insoluble, as shown Figure 8D.</p></disp-quote><p>The unchanged αSyn-GFP levels in the soluble fraction (Figure 8D) are likely due to the abundance of soluble αSyn-GFP. To evaluate the autophagic degradation of αSyn monomers, we used SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing αSyn-Halo and measured αSyn degradation by quantifying cleaved Halo. As shown in the revised version of Figure 2, albendazole treatment induced a higher cleavage rate of Halo than DMSO treatment for 8 h, suggesting that albendazole degrades both αSyn monomers and αSyn aggregates. We have added the data in Figure 8—figure supplement 1A, and the description of these experiments in the Results section (page 10, lines 362 to 367).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 6A shows that some of the compounds (Teniposide, Amsacrine) affect the levels of JIP4. Can albendazole also reduce JIP4 levels. It might be interesting to test this, as JIP4 is important for lysosomal clustering.</p></disp-quote><p>As the Reviewer pointed out, JIP4 is essential for lysosome accumulation. However, our data showed decreased JIP4 levels with the addition of lysosomal-clustering compounds. We hypothesized that this response was caused by the autophagy-induced degradation of JIP4. The decrease in JIP4 levels was detected by western blot after 4 h of treatment with 10 μM of teniposide. Moreover, the decrease in JIP4 levels induced by teniposide was suppressed by co-treatment with bafilomycin A1, indicating that JIP4 was degraded by teniposide-induced autophagy, as shown in the revised version of Figure 3. We have added the data in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and the related description of these experiments in the Results section (page 8, lines 289 to 296).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>The writing is good generally. Please tide up the text in a few occasions to make the expressions more formal.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised our manuscript to adopt a more formal tone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Significance: The study generated a new approach for high-throughput screening of compounds to enhance lysosomal clustering.</p><p>Audience: Basic and clinical research</p><p>Expertise: Programmed cell death, neurodegenerative diseases</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>In this study, the authors focused on lysosome positioning and autophagy activity to search for novel agents effective against Parkinson's disease. As a result, several compounds were successively identified, including Topoisomerase inhibitors and Benzimidazole. Authors showed that these agents regulate lysosomal positioning through different pathways but commonly require JIP4 to regulate lysosomal positioning and subsequent autophagy. They also showed that albendazole treatment promoted the degradation of insoluble ubiquitinated proteins and αSyn in cultured cells.</p><p>Major Comments.</p><p>1) Two compounds, for instance teniposide and albendazole both requires JIP4 and/or TRPML1 to regulate lysosomal positioning and autophagy but their action seems different. What is the actual mechanism by which these compounds require JIP4/TRPML1. How inhibition of Topoisomerase leads to increase of JIP4 phosphorylation? Do teniposide and albendazole both affect calcium release from TRPML1?</p></disp-quote><p>We previously reported that acrolein/H2O2 accelerates lysosomal retrograde trafficking by TRPML1 and phosphorylated JIP4. Mechanistically, JIP4 was phosphorylated by CaMK2G activated by ca<sup>2+</sup> released from TRPML1 (<italic>EMBO J</italic> 41: e111476, Sasazawa et al., 2022). TRPML1 acts as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensor in lysosomes (<italic>Nat Commun</italic> 7: 12109, Zhang et al., 2016). We concluded that acrolein induces ROS production, which then activates TRPML1. (<italic>EMBO J</italic> 41: e111476, Sasazawa et al., 2022). Therefore, topoisomerase inhibitors (topo-i) may induce ROS and stimulate TRPML1. We examined intracellular ROS levels in response to topo-i. As shown in revised Figure 4A, the topo-i teniposide, etoposide, and amsacrine significantly increased ROS levels. Moreover, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, an ROS scavenger, partially attenuated lysosomal clustering induced by topo-i (revised Figure 4B). In addition, ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging showed that teniposide, but not albendazole, upregulates ca<sup>2+</sup> flux (revised Figure 4C). Based on the activity of CaMK2G siRNA as shown in Figure 5D, 5E, and Figure 5—figure supplement 1, topo-i may activate TRPML1 in a ROS-dependent manner and increase PI(3,5)P2 binding with TRPML1 <italic>(Nat Commun</italic> 1, 38, Dong et al., 2010). Consecutive ca<sup>2+</sup> release via TRPML1 activated CaMK2G and is followed by enhanced lysosomal transport toward the MTOC via JIP4 phosphorylation.</p><p>We have added the revised Figure 4A and 4B data in Discussion—figure supplement 1A and 1B, and the related description of these experiments in the Discussion section (page 11, lines 406 to 415). We have also added the data in revised Figure 4C to Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and the related description of these experiments in the Results section (page 8, lines 269 to 271).</p><p>Conversely, we showed that benzimidazoles, including albendazole, induce lysosomal clustering mediated by JIP4, TRPML1, ALG2, and Rab7. Moreover, benzimidazoles showed lysosomal clustering activity within a narrow concentration range, as shown in Discussion—figure supplement 2C. Benzimidazoles inhibit tubulin polymerization (<italic>Int J Paras</italic> 18:885–936. Lacey et al., 1988). We hypothesized that the effect of tubulin polymerization induced by benzimidazole plays a key role in the induction of lysosomal clustering as described in the Discussion section. To clarify this, we observed the behavior of tubulin filaments in response to various albendazole concentrations under confocal microscopy. As shown in revised Figure 4D, conditions where albendazole was administered to induce lysosomal clustering, tubulin filaments were observed only near the MTOC, and the filaments in the cell periphery were disassembled. In contrast, when exposed to higher albendazole concentrations, tubulin filaments throughout the cell were disassembled, resulting in the inhibition of lysosomal clustering This would explain why benzimidazole exerts lysosomal clustering activity within a narrow concentration range. Under <italic>JIP4</italic>, <italic>TRPML1</italic>, <italic>ALG2</italic> and <italic>Rab7</italic> silencing, lysosomes may fail to interact with microtubules, resulting in the inhibition of lysosomal clustering. We postulated that albendazole-induced lysosomal clustering is not mediated by factors activated by specific stimuli in lysosomal transport but, rather, is induced by spatially constraining conventional lysosomal transport mediated by various adaptors (i.e., JIP4, TRPML1, ALG2, and Rab7) through tubulin disassembly. We have added the data in Discussion—figure supplement 2C and D and the related description of these experiments in the Discussion section (page 12, lines 435 to 443).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should clarify the functional advantage of these drugs identified in this study as drugs for Parkinson's disease by comparing with known autophagy inducers such as Torin1 or rapamycin.</p></disp-quote><p>To evaluate the functional advantage of lysosome-clustering compounds over Torin1, we evaluated the degradation activity of insoluble αSyn induced by the addition of αSyn fibrils to αSyn-GFP cells. Torin1 induced the degradation of insoluble αSyn by autophagy, as shown in revised Figure 5A. However, the degradation activity of albendazole was more vigorous, as shown in revised Figure 5B. In contrast, we observed that Torin1 exhibited more autophagic induction activity than albendazole, as assessed using Halo-LC3. Similar results were obtained with teniposide (revised Figure 5C). These results suggest that albendazole, with its ability to concentrate lysosomes around the degradation substrate, facilitates more effective degradation of insoluble αSyn than Torin1. This presents a significant advantage in the development of therapeutics for Parkinson's Disease. Moreover, Torin1 acts on the upstream signals of autophagy by inhibiting mTORC1, potentially impacting diverse cellular responses. Conversely, compounds that induce lysosomal clustering target the final step of autophagic degradation, which may have fewer side effects. We have added the description of these experiments in the Results section (page 10, lines 369 to 375) and the Discussion section (page 13 lines 479 to 481) and presented the data in Figure 8—figure supplement 1B－E and Figure 6D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to the previous question, in Figure 6A and B additional data comparing novel compounds with established autophagy inducers, such as torin1 and rapamycin, should be included and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in a previous response, we evaluated the autophagic induction activity of Torin1, and the results have been added to Figure 6D. In addition, co-treatment with Torin1 and teniposide or albendazole induced autophagy more effectively than Torin1 treatment alone, without affecting mTOR inhibition activity (revised Figure 4C). These findings indicate that the induction of autophagy by lysosomal clustering compounds is not caused by autophagosome formation but by the formation of autolysosomes. We have added a description of these experiments in the Results section (page 9, lines 319 to 325) and have added the data in Figure 6D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should examined whether increased degradation of insoluble proteins and αSyn are dependent on JIP4.</p></disp-quote><p>As the Reviewer suggested, we have examined whether lysosomal accumulation through the JIP4-TRPML1 pathway is crucial for the degradation of αSyn aggregates. We evaluated the degradation activity of insoluble αSyn induced by the addition of αSyn fibrils to αSyn-GFP cells when JIP4, TMEM55B, or TRPML1 were knocked down. Interestingly, the insoluble fraction assay showed that JIP4 and TRPML1 knockdown regulated the decrease of αSyn-GFP and p-αSyn levels in the insoluble fraction for both DMSO and albendazole treatments. The results were particularly more pronounced with TRPML1 knockdown. However, the knockdown of TMEM55B did not produce such findings (revised Figure 6). These data suggest that lysosomal clustering via the JIP4–TRPML1 pathway plays a significant role in αSyn degradation. We have added a relevant description in the Results section (page 10, lines 376 to 380) and have added the data in Figure 8—figure supplement 1F and 1G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Authors only utilized. SH-SY5Y cells in this study. It is important to examine whether these compounds also regulate lysosomal positioning and autophagy in other cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>As per the Reviewer’s suggestion, we evaluated the lysosomal-clustering activity induced by topo-i and benzimidazole in human adenocarcinoma HeLa cells. As shown in revised Figure 7A and 7B compounds do not induce lysosomal clustering or autophagy in HeLa cells. Furthermore, in the case of benzimidazole, they transport lysosomes to the cell periphery. Previously, we found that oxidative stress accumulates lysosomes in a neuroblastoma-specific manner through the TRPML1–phosphoJIP4-dependent mechanism (<italic>EMBO J</italic> 41: e111476, Sasazawa et al., 2022). Since we have demonstrated that topo-i-mediated lysosomal trafficking is dependent on the TRPML1–phosphorylated JIP4 complex, we hypothesized that several molecules involved in lysosomal trafficking are absent in HeLa cells.</p><p>In contrast, we showed that albendazole-induced lysosomal clustering is due to tubulin depolymerization. Therefore, we examined the relationships between tubulin depolymerization and lysosomal clustering induced by albendazole in HeLa cells and found that albendazole did not induce lysosomal clustering but rather inhibited it at higher concentrations (revised Figure 7B). Interestingly, similar to SH-SY5Y cells, a low albendazole concentration (10 μM) induced tubulin depolymerization only at the cell periphery, whereas a high concentration (100 μM) depolymerized the entire cell (revised Figure 7C). However, unlike SH-SY5Y cells, no characteristic accumulation of tubulin filaments was observed near the MTOC under low albendazole concentration (10 µM); instead, they were arranged around the nucleus. Concurrently, lysosomes were around these dispersed tubulin filaments. Therefore, the differences in the effects of benzimidazole in HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells lies in the dose-dependent effects on the state of tubulin filaments. We have added a relevant description in the Discussions section (page 12, lines 425 to 429, and 444 to 461).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors conclude that the six compounds do not mediate mTOR signaling in Figure 3, but should more carefully describe in the manuscript why they performed this experiment and what the results mean for.</p></disp-quote><p>As per the Reviewer’s advice, we have changed the description in the manuscript as follows:</p><p>Previous studies have shown that lysosomal retrograde transport regulates autophagic flux by facilitating autophagosome formation by suppressing mTORC1 and expediting fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes (Kimura et al., 2008; Korolchuk et al., 2011). Conversely, we recent found that acrolein/H2O2 induces lysosomal clustering in an mTOR-independent manner (Sasazawa et al., 2022). In this study, we aimed to identify pharmacologic agents that act downstream rather than upstream in the autophagy pathway, with the goal of minimizing side effects. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of the compounds on the mTOR pathway. As shown in Figure 3, these compounds induced lysosomal clustering without affecting mTOR activity, indicating their potential as promising candidates for PD therapy. We have added the description of these experiments in the Results section (page 6, lines 203 to 209 and line 218 to 219).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments.</p><p>1) The name of the compound should be written in the red point of Figure 2A.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the names of the six compounds identified and are listed in Figure 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding images of Figure 2B, the magnified images and quantitative data should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included magnified images, as well as the quantitative results of lysosome clustering analysis using INCellAnalyzer2200 in Figure 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The results of Figure 2C need to be explained more carefully.

Since Figure 3 focuses on mTOR signaling, we preferred to retain the figure number.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the statistical analysis of Figure 4B, the clustering value was increased by siRILP, which should be briefly described in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>On the contrary, the enhancement of lysosomal retrograde transport in <italic>RILP</italic> knockdown cells in Figure 4B suggests the potential involvement of RILP in anterograde transport. However, to the best of our knowledge, no reports have investigated this matter. We presume that negative feedback mechanisms may be present. We have added this description to the Results section (page 7 lines 240 to 243).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 4A and B, it is possible that the knockdown efficiency of siRILP and siTMEM55B was not sufficient to observe the effect on lysosomes, and this concern should be described in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We established starvation conditions, which induce TMEM55B-dependent lysosomal retrograde transport, as a positive control and evaluated the lysosomal induction activity of compounds when TMEM55B was knocked down. As shown below, lysosome accumulation was suppressed only when subjected to starvation treatment, indicating sufficient knockdown efficiency of TMEM55B. These compounds induced lysosomal clustering independently of TMEM55B, unlike under starvation conditions. We have added a description of these experiments in the Results section and presented the data in Figure 4—figure supplement 2A (page 7, lines 234 to 239).</p><p>On the other hand, we were unable to establish a positive control for RILP knockdown experiments because conditions that regulate RILP-dependent lysosomal distribution dependent are not understood. While we cannot completely rule out the possibility of insufficient knockdown efficiency, considering that RILP knockdown appears to paradoxically enhance lysosomal induction, as mentioned above, it is reasonable to assume that the knockdown effect has occurred.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors should add the results of the WB experiment showing the amount of JIP4 protein in Figure 5G.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added western blot data that introduce flag-JIP4 into JIP4KO SH-SY5Y cells, which are presented in Figure 5G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 5F, images of JIP4KO cells that do not express FLAG-JIP4 should be added as controls, and further quantification should be done on cells in all three conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added immunofluorescence data that do not express flag-JIP4 in Figure 5F, which had been obtained simultaneously during the acquisition of other images. Furthermore, we quantified lysosomal distribution, which is shown in Figure 5E.

Subsequently, we quantified the proportion of lysosomes contained within that region in cells expressing flag-JIP4 (revised Figure 9B).

Briefly the authors screened a library of clinically approved compounds for inducers of lysosomal clustering followed by a secondary screen for autophagy inducers. By this two-step procedure, the authors identified three topoisomerase inhibitors and three anthelmintics as hits. Next, the authors unveiled that lysosomal clustering induced by these compounds is independent of mTORC1 but requires TRPML1 and JIP4. Moreover, the topoisomerase inhibitors hits involved phosphorylation of JIP4 while the anthelmintics additionally required Rab7 and ALG2. Intriguingly, the authors found that lysosomal clustering was prerequisite to autophagy induction. Focusing on the class of anthelmintics (i.e. albendazole) the authors showed that these induce autophagy to degrade aggregates formed upon proteasome inhibition. Lastly, the authors demonstrated that albendazole also led to increased degradation of αSyn aggregates through autophagy induction.</p><p>Major points</p><p>1) Most importantly, the authors need to tone down the significance of their findings throughout the manuscript.
