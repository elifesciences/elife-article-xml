During its eponymous action – that is, the retrieval of serotonin from the extracellular space – SERT undergoes a conformational cycle. Typical inhibitors (antidepressant drugs and cocaine), partial and full substrates (amphetamines and their derivatives), and atypical inhibitors (ibogaine analogues) bind preferentially to different states in this cycle. This results in competitive or non-competitive transport inhibition. Here, we explored the action of <italic>N</italic>-formyl-1,3-bis (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-prop-2-yl-amine (ECSI#6) on SERT: inhibition of serotonin uptake by ECSI#6 was enhanced with increasing serotonin concentration. Conversely, the K<sub>M</sub> for serotonin was lowered by augmenting ECSI#6. ECSI#6 bound with low affinity to the outward-facing state of SERT but with increased affinity to a potassium-bound state. Electrophysiological recordings showed that ECSI#6 preferentially interacted with the inward-facing state. Kinetic modeling recapitulated the experimental data and verified that uncompetitive inhibition arose from preferential binding of ECSI#6 to the K<sup>+</sup>-bound, inward-facing conformation of SERT. This binding mode predicted a pharmacochaperoning action of ECSI#6, which was confirmed by examining its effect on the folding-deficient mutant SERT-PG<sup>601,602</sup>AA: preincubation of HEK293 cells with ECSI#6 restored export of SERT-PG<sup>601,602</sup>AA from the endoplasmic reticulum and substrate transport. Similarly, in transgenic flies, the administration of ECSI#6 promoted the delivery of SERT-PG<sup>601,602</sup>AA to the presynaptic specialization of serotonergic neurons. To the best of our knowledge, ECSI#6 is the first example of an uncompetitive SLC inhibitor. Pharmacochaperones endowed with the binding mode of ECSI#6 are attractive, because they can rescue misfolded transporters at concentrations, which cause modest transport inhibition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>uncompetitive inhibition</kwd><kwd>use dependence</kwd><kwd>solute carrier</kwd><kwd>serotonin transporter</kwd><kwd>pharmacochaperoning</kwd><kwd>drugs of abuse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P31813</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sandtner</surname><given-names>Walter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P31255-B27</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sucic</surname><given-names>Sonja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001821</institution-id><institution>Vienna Science and Technology Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LSC17-026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freissmuth</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical and electrophysiological approaches show that the amphetamine derivative ECSI#6 is an uncompetitive inhibitor of the serotonin transporter and thus the first ever characterized ligand of a solute carrier of this type.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The transporters for the monoamines serotonin (SERT), dopamine (DAT), and norepinephrine (NET) are members of the solute carrier-6 (SLC6) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kristensen et al., 2011</xref>). The uptake of their eponymous substrates is fueled by the electrochemical gradient of sodium; in addition, DAT and NET can harvest the membrane potential, while SERT utilizes the potassium gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhat et al., 2021c</xref>). These driving forces support a remarkable concentrative power, which allows for effective removal of the cognate substrates from the extracellular space. SERT, NET, and DAT are closely related. Accordingly, their pharmacology shows a continuum from compounds, which bind to all three transporters (e.g., cocaine), to drugs with exquisite selectivity (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). Monoamine transporters are targets for both, therapeutically relevant drugs (e.g., antidepressants) and for illicit substances. Accordingly, the chemical space of ligands has been extensively studied resulting in a very rich pharmacology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sitte and Freissmuth, 2015</xref>). Originally, ligands for monoamine transporters have been classified as either non-transportable inhibitors or exogenous substrates/releasers. Inhibitors bind to and block reuptake through the transporter (e.g., cocaine, tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs). In contrast, exogenous substrates/releasers (e.g., amphetamines) induce efflux of the endogenous monoamine by switching the transporter from the physiological forward transport mode into an exchange mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sitte and Freissmuth, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hasenhuetl et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>More recently, the prevailing dichotomous classification was challenged by the discovery of compounds, which act as partial substrates and/or atypical inhibitors of monoamine transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rothman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmitt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sandtner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hasenhuetl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Niello et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Niello et al., 2020</xref>). Partial substrates do not elicit reverse transport to the same extent as full releasers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rothman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sandtner et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, there is a continuum, which ranges from full releasers over partial releasers to atypical inhibitors: minor modifications of the amphetamine- or cathinone-based structures suffice to reduce the efficacy of release and to eventually produce atypical inhibitors or allosteric modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sandtner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Niello et al., 2019</xref>). Typical inhibitors bind to the outward-facing conformation of the monoamine transporters. In contrast, atypical inhibitors trap the transporter in distinct conformational states, which are visited during the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhat et al., 2019</xref>). Numerous disease-associated mutations have been identified in neurotransmitter transporters, which result in misfolding of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhat et al., 2021b</xref>). Atypical inhibitors and partial substrates are of interest, because they can act as pharmacochaperones and correct the folding defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhat et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we studied the inhibition of SERT by the amphetamine derivative ECSI#6 [<italic>N</italic>-formyl-1,3-bis (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-prop-2-yl-amine], which was identified as a synthesis byproduct of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (‘ecstasy’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pifl et al., 2005</xref>). Our experiments show that ECSI#6 is, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported uncompetitive inhibitor of SERT. This mode of inhibition was accounted for by preferential binding of ECSI#6 to the inward-facing state. Finally, consistent with this binding mode, ECSI#6 also acted as a pharmacochaperone: cellular preincubation with ECSI#6 restored export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and substrate transport by a misfolded SERT variant.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cocaine, noribogaine, and ECSI#6 exhibit differences in the ability to block SERT uptake</title><p>Affinity estimates of exogenous ligands to monoamine transporters can be evaluated by their ability to block either the functional uptake of a tritiated substrate or binding of a high-affinity radiolabeled inhibitor to the transporter. For the uptake inhibition experiments, we calculated IC<sub>50s</sub> for the ability of cocaine, noribogaine, or ECSI#6 to block transport of 0.1 µM [<sup>3</sup>H]5-HT by SERT either in the absence (IC<sub>50(0.1)</sub>) or prior preincubation of either 1 µM (IC<sub>50(1)</sub>) or 10 µM (IC<sub>50(10)</sub>) cold 5-HT. Cocaine blocks SERT uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H]5-HT with an IC<sub>50(0.1)</sub> of 9.96 µM (95% CI: 8.7–11.4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, solid blue curve). The IC<sub>50(1)</sub> was indistinguishable from IC<sub>50(0.1)</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, blue dashed curve, IC<sub>50</sub>=9.8 µM, 95% CI: 7.1–13.6), while IC<sub>50(10)</sub> was right shifted by ~4-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, blue dotted curve, IC<sub>50</sub>=34.6 µM, 95% CI: 24.8–48.3). This right shift is expected and readily explained; increasing concentrations of unlabeled 5-HT in the uptake inhibition assay inhibits cocaine binding to SERT in a competitive manner. Noribogaine, on the other hand, blocked substrate uptake of SERT more potently in the presence of unlabeled 5-HT (cf. solid, dashed, and dotted green lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, IC<sub>50(0.1)</sub>: 5.68 µM [95% CI: 4.36–7.39], IC<sub>50(1)</sub>: 2.39 µM [95% CI: 1.84–3.09], IC<sub>50(10)</sub>: 1.89 µM [95% CI: 1.46–2.44]). In the presence of unlabeled 5-HT, this left shift in potency was more prominent with ECSI#6 (cf. solid, dashed, and dotted red lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, IC<sub>50(0.1)</sub>: 440.5 µM [95% CI: 325.8–595.6], IC<sub>50(1)</sub>: 74.14 µM [95% CI: 55.4–99.22], IC<sub>50(10)</sub>: 19.28 µM [95% CI: 13.23–28.09]). These observations clearly show that noribogaine and ECSI#6 bind to SERT with higher affinity in the presence of a substrate. Thus, their mode of binding to the transporter differs from that of cocaine.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of serotonin transporter (SERT)-mediated [<sup>3</sup>H]5-HT uptake by cocaine, noribogaine, and ECSI#6.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The chemical structures of cocaine, noribogaine, and ECSI#6.

After 24 hr, inhibition of substrate uptake by cocaine (<bold>B</bold>), noribogaine (<bold>C</bold>), or ECSI#6 (<bold>D</bold>) was determined as outlined under Materials and methods in the absence of additional unlabeled 5-HT (circles and solid lines, IC<sub>50(0.1)</sub>) or in the presence of 1 µM (squares and dashed lines, IC<sub>50(1)</sub>), 3 µM (diamonds and dashed-dotted lines in D; IC<sub>50(3)</sub>), or 10 µM 5-HT (triangles, dotted lines, IC<sub>50(10)</sub>) of unlabeled 5-HT. Paroxetine (10 µM) was used to determine nonspecific uptake, which was ~5% of total uptake. Uptake was normalized to the specific uptake in the absence of inhibitors (4.2±0.6 pmol min<sup>–1</sup> 10<sup>–6</sup> cells), which was set to 100% (i.e., no inhibition) to account for inter-experimental variations.

There are two explanations for the left shift in the uptake inhibition by ECSI#6 (and by noribogaine) in the presence of increasing concentrations of 5-HT: (i) binding of 5-HT to SERT results in a conformational transition, which exposes a binding pocket for ECSI#6 (and for noribogaine). (ii) Alternatively, uptake of 5-HT by SERT results in the accumulation of the K<sup>+</sup>-bound conformational intermediate(s), which display a higher affinity for ECSI#6 or noribogaine (we emphasize that accumulation in the K<sup>+</sup>-bound intermediates is a consequence of the slow return of the K<sup>+</sup>-bound transporters from the inward- to the outward-facing conformation). The first model posits that serotonin and ECSI#6 are bound simultaneously. This has been observed with serotonin and carbamazepine, which can bind concomitantly to the outward-facing state of SERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacobs et al., 2007</xref>). We resorted to radioligand binding experiments with [<sup>3</sup>H]citalopram to address which of the two possibilities can explain the experimental observation: [<sup>3</sup>H]citalopram is a radiolabeled high-affinity inhibitor of SERT, which binds to the outward-facing conformation. Membranes harboring SERT were incubated with 3 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]citalopram and logarithmically spaced concentrations of ECSI#6 (and the reference compounds cocaine and noribogaine) in the presence of 120 mM NaCl, which promotes the outward-facing conformation. It is evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> that addition of 1 or 10 µM 5-HT shifted the displacement curve of ECSI#6 to the right to an extent which was comparable to that seen with cocaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and noribogaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We transformed the data summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref> by plotting the reciprocal of bound radioligand as a function of inhibitor concentration to yield Dixon plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>): the x-intercept corresponds to -IC<sub>50</sub> of the inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bulling et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, Dixon plots allow for differentiating mutually exclusive from mutually non-exclusive binding, if one inhibitor (i.e., cocaine, noribogaine, or ECSI#6) is examined at a fixed concentration of the second inhibitor (i.e., serotonin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Segel, 1975</xref>): if binding of the two inhibitors is mutually non-exclusive, a family of lines of progressively increasing slope, which intersect at -IC<sub>50</sub>, is to be seen. In contrast, if the two inhibitors bind to the same site, the slope of the inhibition curves is not affected and the x-intercept (i.e., -IC<sub>50</sub> of the variable inhibitor) is shifted to more negative values. It is evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref> that the presence of 1 and 10 µM serotonin progressively shifted the (expected) x-intercept for cocaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), noribogaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), and ECSI#6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, binding of serotonin and one of these three ligands to SERT was mutually exclusive.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of [<sup>3</sup>H]citalopram binding by cocaine, noribogaine, and ECSI#6.</title><p>(<bold>A–G</bold>) Inhibition of [<sup>3</sup>H]citalopram binding to serotonin transporter (SERT) by cocaine (A, D; blue curves), noribogaine (B, E; green curves), or ECSI#6 (C, F; red curves).

Assays in the presence of 120 mM NaCl were done with 2–3 µg membranes; for assays with 120 mM KCl, 7–8 µg of membranes were used to improve the dynamic binding range. The specific binding values for assays with the 120 mM NaCl and 120 mM KCl buffer were 25±14 and 21±5 fmol assay<sup>−1</sup>, respectively.

The transport cycle of SERT can be addressed by whole-cell patch clamp recordings; electrophysiological recordings of currents through SERT provide unmatched temporal resolution of ligand and co-substrate binding and unbinding events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hasenhuetl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hasenhuetl et al., 2015</xref>). When challenged with a substrate like 5-HT or amphetamines, SERT carries inward currents. These are comprised of an initial transient peak current and a steady current. The peak current reflects the initial synchronized movement of substrate and co-substrate through the membrane electric field. The steady current arises from an uncoupled current; the underlying channel mode is visited from the K<sup>+</sup>-bound inward-facing state. Thus, the steady current reflects the continuous cycling of the transporter in the forward transport mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schicker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sandtner et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, inhibitors only elicit a minor peak current on application to SERT-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burtscher et al., 2018</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, cocaine and noribogaine induced transient peak currents, while ECSI#6 failed to do so. In the presence of physiological ion gradients and in the absence of substrate, SERT dwells primarily in the outward-facing conformation. A precondition for a ligand to elicit a peak current is, therefore, the ability to bind to outward-facing states. The failure of ECSI#6 to produce a peak current is, thus, consistent with the interpretation that this compound binds exclusively to inward-facing states. It should be noted, however, that cocaine and noribogaine carry a charge while ECSI#6 does not. Thus, it is not possible to formally rule out the alternative explanation that ECSI#6 fails to generate a peak current, because it is uncharged. We relied on measuring the time course of inhibition of the substrate-induced steady current through SERT to infer the kinetics of inhibitor binding: we first applied 5-HT at a saturating concentration, which elicited the peak current and the steady-state current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). After 5 s, the cells were superfused with inhibitors in the continuous presence of the substrate. ECSI#6 and the reference compounds cocaine and noribogaine (red, blue, and green trace, respectively, in the magnified section in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) led to a rapid inhibition of the substrate-induced current, which was rapidly reversed by removal of the inhibitor. The inhibitor-induced suppression of the steady current was adequately described by a mono-exponential decay. The rate constant reflects the apparent rate of association (k<sub>app</sub>) of the inhibitors. In a simple bimolecular reaction (corresponding to binding of the inhibitor to SERT), raising the inhibitor concentration is predicted to result in accelerated binding. This was not the case for cocaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>): as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bulling et al., 2012</xref>), the k<sub>app</sub> of cocaine only increased in the very low concentration range and leveled off at about 2 s<sup>–1</sup>. This is expected for a typical inhibitor, which interacts with the outward-facing conformation of SERT, because the binding is limited by the return step from the inward-facing to the outward-facing state. This is the rate-limiting reaction in the transport cycle of SERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schicker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hasenhuetl et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, k<sub>app</sub> for both, noribogaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and ECSI#6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), increased in a linear manner as their concentrations were raised. This can only be achieved, if noribogaine and ECSI#6 bind to the inward-facing conformation of SERT directly. Noribogaine was ~10-fold more potent than ECSI#6 in imposing the block on the substrate-induced current through SERT. We obtained estimates for the k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> of noribogaine and ECSI#6, respectively, from the slopes and the y-intercepts of the linear regression in panels D and E. The extracted k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> values were 1.7*10<sup>5</sup>±1.6*10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> and 1.4±0.3 s<sup>–1</sup> and 2.1*10<sup>4</sup>±3.5*10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> and 1.7±0.5 s<sup>–1</sup>, for noribogaine and for ECSI#6, respectively. However, these rate constants do not allow for estimating a kinetically calculated K<sub>D</sub>. In fact, the rate of the inhibitor-induced current block is comprised of both (i) the binding rates of the inhibitor and (ii) the rates of the conformational transitions, which SERT undergoes during substrate transport.

Plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> is the block of the serotonin-induced current as a function of the co-applied ECSI#6 concentration. The current was evoked by a saturating concentration of 5-HT (30 µM) and inhibited by 3, 10, 30, and 100 µM co-applied ECSI#6, respectively (the inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> shows representative current traces). A fit of an inhibition curve to the data points yielded an IC<sub>50</sub> value of approx. 5 µM. This value was lower but still in reasonable agreement, with the IC<sub>50</sub> obtained in the radioligand uptake assay for the condition where the 5-HT concentration had been saturating (cf. dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; 10 µM 5-HT). In the uptake assay the IC<sub>50</sub> value of ECSI#6 dropped to about 0.5 mM, in the presence of a low 5-HT concentration (i.e., 0.1 µM). In contrast to uptake experiments, electrophysiological recordings also allow for assessing the apparent affinity of ECSI#6 for SERT in the absence of the substrate. This can be achieved by employing the protocol depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> (see representative current traces on the left-hand side): we first applied 30 µM 5-HT to a cell expressing SERT for 0.5 s to elicit a peak current (i.e., a control pulse). We then reapplied 30 µM 5-HT after superfusing the cell with 100 µM ECSI#6 for 1 s (second upper trace in panel H). We chose this time period because it had been sufficient to allow for a full current block in the other protocol (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>): the amplitude of the peak current following the pre-application of 100 µM ECSI#6 was essentially identical to the prior control pulse. When we pre-applied 100 µM ECSI#6 for a longer period (i.e., 3 s) the amplitude of the two peak currents also remained the same (cf. lower traces in panel H). The right-hand panel shows the summary of several experiments. Plotted in the graph is the ratio of the second and first pulse, which was always close to one. We previously used this protocol to assess the binding kinetics of cocaine, methylphenidate, and desipramine on SERT and DAT. Pre-application of these inhibitors consistently led to a concentration-dependent reduction in the peak current amplitude of the second pulse in comparison to the first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hasenhuetl et al., 2015</xref>). The lack of inhibition, thus, indicates that the affinity of ECSI#6 in the absence of 5-HT is low. To obtain estimates for the affinity of ECSI#6 for SERT in the absence of 5-HT we would need to apply this compound at much higher concentrations. This, however, is not possible, because ECSI#6 is poorly soluble in aqueous solutions (i.e., max. 0.03 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">chemicalize, 2022</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref> shows representative traces of 5-HT-induced currents recorded from SERT-expressing cells in the absence (in blue) and presence of 100 µM ECSI#6 (in red) in the electrode solution: when applied from the intracellular side, ECSI#6 did not cause an appreciable current block. The right-hand panel summarizes the current amplitude obtained from cells measured in the absence (blue open circles) and the presence of intracellular ECSI#6 (open circles in red). These data seem to indicate that ECSI#6 binds to SERT from the extracellular side. Yet this conclusion can be challenged based on the following consideration: in earlier experiments, ibogaine, the parent compound of noribogaine, was found to block HERG channels when applied from the bath solution but failed to do so when added to the electrode solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thurner et al., 2014</xref>). However, at a lower intracellular pH (i.e., pH 5.5), ibogaine gained the ability to inhibit HERG from the intracellular side (i.e., via application through the electrode). Conversely, ibogaine was less effective when applied to an acidified bath solution. These observations led to the conclusion that ibogaine blocked HERG from the cytosolic side: because the molecule in its neutral form was so diffusive, a low intracellular pH was required to force its protonation and thus preclude diffusion from the interior of the cell. ECSI#6 is presumed to also be very diffusible given its estimated log p value and polar surface area of 2.48 and 66 Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">chemicalize, 2022</xref>). However, ECSI#6 harbors an amide nitrogen (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and thus remains neutral in the experimentally accessible pH range. Hence, it is not possible to verify to which side of SERT it binds.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ECSI#6 can rescue a folding-deficient SERT mutant</title><p>In the ER, the folding trajectory of SERT moves through the inward-facing conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiba et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freissmuth et al., 2017</xref>).

E<sub>MAX</sub> and EC<sub>50</sub> for noribogaine and ECSI#6 were determined by fitting the data to the equation for a rectangular hyperbola (95% CI in parenthesis): for noribogaine and ECSI#6, E<sub>MAX</sub> was 69.5% (59.2–79.7) and 52.0% (44.6–59.5), and EC<sub>50</sub> was 0.46 µM (0.15–0.77) and 2.9 µM (1.1–4.7), respectively.

Untreated cells were taken as negative controls (second lane in the representative blot). Membrane proteins extracted from these cells were denatured and resolved with SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes.

Aliquots of the lysate (20 µg) were subjected to enzymatic digestion by endoglycosidase H (Endo H). Endo H specifically cleaves core glycans to generate the lower molecular weight deglycosylated (<bold>D</bold>) from the core-glycosylated species (<bold>C</bold>).

In the model, the transport cycle begins with the binding of sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and substrate (S) to SERT to the apo outward-facing state (To).

In contrast, it is necessary to posit preferential binding of ECSI#6 to the TiK state of SERT for recapitulating the experimental observations by the synthetic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We extracted from these simulations the IC<sub>50</sub>-values for uptake inhibition by ECSI#6 in the presence of 0.1 and 10 μM 5-HT: the ratio IC<sub>50(0.1)</sub>/IC<sub>50(10)</sub> was 20.6, which is reasonably close to the shift of 17.2 observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. This value matches the ratio of occupancy of the TiK state at 10 and 0.1 μM 5-HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, increasing 5-HT concentrations raise the availability of SERT in the TiK state and this – rather than the affinity of ECSI#6 – accounts for the enhanced ability of ECSI#6 to block 5-HT transport. This interpretation was further substantiated by simulations, where the affinity of ECSI#6 to the TiK state was varied: a variation of the K<sub>D</sub> over three orders of magnitude did not alter the IC<sub>50(0.1)</sub>/IC<sub>50(10)</sub> ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Interestingly the IC<sub>50(0.1)</sub>/IC<sub>50(10)</sub> ratios remain high, if ECSI#6 binding is assumed to have a preference to other inward open transporter states (i.e., Ti, TiS, and TiNaS). As expected, if ECSI#6 is assumed to bind preferentially to the outward-open states (i.e., ToK, To, and ToNa), the IC<sub>50(0.1)</sub>/IC<sub>50(10)</sub> ratios decrease below 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). An exception is the high IC<sub>50(0.1)</sub>/IC<sub>50(10)</sub> ratio, which is observed, if ECSI#6 binding is assumed to the ToNaS state. This, however, requires binding to an allosteric site, which is unlikely: none of our experimental observations support occupancy of this state by ECSI#6. Thus, the most plausible explanation is the binding of ECSI#6 to the TiK state. We estimated the binding affinity of ECSI#6 for TiK from the synthetic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>): a K<sub>D</sub> of 12 µM sufficed to reproduce all experimental data. In contrast, it was only possible to emulate the experimental data by assuming that the binding affinities to the other preferred states (i.e., TiS, TiS, TiNaS, and ToNaS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) were higher, that is, in the submicromolar range for TiS, TiS, TiNaS or 1 µM for ToNaS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Thus, preferential binding of ECSI#6 to these states (rather than TiK) allows for a possible, but highly unlikely solution.</p><p>Finally, we also interrogated the model to account for the shift in the concentration-response curves for uptake inhibition by noribogaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>); the shift was less pronounced than that seen for ECSI#6. These observations can be accounted for in the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>) by assuming preferential binding of noribogaine to both, the ToNa and the TiK states of SERT. If K<sub>D</sub> for ToNa is assumed to be 10 times larger than the K<sub>D</sub> for TiK, the kinetic model simulations yield an IC<sub>50(0.1)</sub>/IC<sub>50(10)</sub> ratio of 5 for noribogaine. This ratio is reasonably close to the ratio of 3, which was observed in the actual experiments. We also systematically varied the ratio of K<sub>D</sub>(ToNa)/K<sub>D</sub>(TiK) to examine the ratio required to reach a ratio IC<sub>50(0.1)</sub>/IC<sub>50(10)</sub> of 17–21, that is, the range seen with ECSI#6. As evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>, the K<sub>D</sub>(ToNa) must be 100- to 1000-fold larger than K<sub>D</sub>(TiK). Hence, based on these calculations, it is appropriate to conclude that ECSI#6 has a much higher preference for binding to TiK than noribogaine. In contrast, the binding mode of noribogaine is mixed. This accounts for the observation that the phenotypic consequence of noribogaine binding is a type of uptake inhibition, which is intermediate between that of cocaine and that of ECSI#6.</p><p>We verified this interpretation by simulating the saturation kinetics of 5-HT transport by SERT in the presence of the inhibitor. For noribogaine, the simulations show a reduction in the V<sub>max</sub> of 5-HT transport with increasing noribogaine concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>); the concentration-dependent drop in V<sub>max</sub> was in reasonable agreement with the experimental observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, if the K<sub>M</sub> of 5-HT transport by SERT was plotted as a function of noribogaine concentration, the analysis revealed an initial drop in K<sub>M</sub>, which leveled off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This finding is consistent with binding of noribogaine to both, ToNa and TiK state of SERT. The initial drop in K<sub>M</sub> is too small to allow for its detection within the experimental inter-assay variation of K<sub>M</sub> estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), while the reduction in V<sub>max</sub> is readily seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Hence, based on experimental observations, uptake inhibition by noribogaine is classified as non-competitive. We stress, however, that this neglects the complex binding mode of noribogaine. In contrast, the simulations of substrate transport in the presence of ECSI#6 recapitulated the reduction in the K<sub>M</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> of 5-HT transport by SERT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and D</xref>), which was seen in the actual experiments summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, F and I</xref>, and thus confirmed the uncompetitive mode SERT of inhibition.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Interrogating the kinetic model to analyze the inhibition of substrate transport by serotonin transporter (SERT) by noribogaine and ECSI#6.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Simulations of the saturation kinetics of SERT in the presence of the indicated concentrations of noribogaine (<bold>A</bold>) or ECSI#6 (<bold>B</bold>).

Here, we identify ECSI#6 as a SERT inhibitor with unique properties that are not matched by any of the known ligands: Substrate enhanced the ability of ECSI#6 to inhibit transport resulting in a progressive lowering of the IC<sub>50</sub> with increasing concentrations of substrate. In a reciprocal manner, ECSI#6 decreased the K<sub>M</sub> and the V<sub>max</sub> of SERT for substrate translocation. This is the hallmark of uncompetitive inhibition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an uncompetitive inhibitor of SERT and, in fact, of any transporter. Uncompetitive inhibition is rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cornish-Bowden, 1986</xref>). In enzymes, uncompetitive inhibition requires binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme-substrate complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cornish-Bowden, 1986</xref>). Accordingly, the kinetic model also offered allosteric binding of ECSI#6 to the fully loaded outward-facing transporter that is, the ternary complex ToNaS of SERT, substrate and sodium – as one possible solution. However, several arguments rule out this solution: (i) The simulations showed that ECSI#6 must bind with K<sub>D</sub> of 1 µM to ToNaS to recapitulate the experimental data. However, in the presence of sub-saturating 5-HT (10 µM), the affinity estimate of ECSI#6 was &gt;30-fold lower ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). (ii) It is also evident from our observations that ECSI#6 and serotonin were not bound simultaneously to SERT: raising the serotonin concentration shifted the curves for a displacement of [<sup>3</sup>H]citalopram by ECSI#6 to the right. Thus, ECSI#6 binds to the same site as serotonin, albeit in a different mode: binding of ECSI#6 was favored in the presence of potassium. The resulting affinity estimate (5 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) was in the range of the K<sub>D</sub>-values for the inward-facing potassium-bound conformation of SERT TiK required by the kinetic model to recapitulate the experimental data. (iii) The electrophysiological recordings showed that the block of the steady-state, transport-associated current was imposed by ECSI#6 upon binding to an inward-facing state of SERT. (iv) This conclusion was also confirmed by the other solutions provided by the kinetic model: in these solutions, uncompetitive inhibition by ECSI#6 was accounted for by binding of ECSI#6 to the inward-facing states of SERT. We note that an allosteric action of ECSI#6 – that is, binding to the inward-facing ternary complex TiNaS – was also permitted by the model. However, we consider this unlikely a realistic solution, because – as already pointed out – binding of ECSI#6 and serotonin was mutually exclusive. Hence, we do not consider the analogy of an enzyme-substrate complex, which recruits the inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cornish-Bowden, 1986</xref>), appropriate to understand the mechanisms underlying uncompetitive inhibition of SERT by ECSI#6. In ligand-gated ion channels, uncompetitive inhibition is observed with open channel blockers. This is exemplified by the NMDA-receptor, where dizocilpine maleate/MK-801, memantine, ketamine, and related compounds require the presence of agonists to reach their binding site and to establish blockage of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>). This use-dependent inhibition is more useful as a starting point than the enzyme-substrate complex to understand the mechanisms underlying uncompetitive inhibition of SERT by ECSI#6: in the presence of physiological ion gradients, SERT accumulates in the outward-facing state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schicker et al., 2012</xref>). Serotonin is required to drive SERT into the transport cycle, where SERT accumulates in the inward-facing state, because the return step (TiK → ToK, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) is rate-limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schicker et al., 2012</xref>). This causes the inhibitory action of ECSI#6 to be use-dependent, that is, enhanced by substrate. Thus, preferential binding of ECSI#6 to the potassium-bound, inward-facing state of SERT (TiK) is sufficient to account for all experimental data.</p><p>Our detailed analysis also sheds light on the enigmatic properties of ibogaine. Ibogaine and its more potent analog noribogaine have been classified as non-competitive inhibitors. This mode of inhibition was attributed to their trapping the transporter in the inward-facing conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacobs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korkhov et al., 2006</xref>). In fact, the structure of the complex of ibogaine and SERT reveals an inward-facing conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coleman et al., 2019</xref>). Surprisingly, however, ibogaine binds to SERT from the extracellular side; it cannot gain access to SERT via the inner vestibule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burtscher et al., 2018</xref>). Access from the extracellular side also explains, why ibogaine and carbamazepine, which binds to the vestibular (S2) site, can be bound concomitantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sarker et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, sole binding of ibogaine or noribogaine to the inward-facing conformations ought to cause uncompetitive inhibition in a manner similar to ECSI#6. The current observations solve this conundrum: the kinetic model showed that an interaction of noribogaine with both, the sodium-bound, outward-facing state (ToNa) and the potassium-bound, inward-facing state (TiK) of SERT, was required to recapitulate the experimental observations. The kinetic model also revealed the predicted uncompetitive component, which was, however, too small to be detectable in the experimental noise. It is worth pointing out that the overall K<sub>M</sub> of substrate transport is a compound parameter, which is affected by both, the rates of individual partial reactions and the occupancy of the individual states in the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schicker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schicker et al., 2022</xref>). Based on the insights provided by the combination of experimental observations and kinetic modeling, we conclude that, in contrast to ECSI#6, noribogaine has a mixed binding mode.</p><p>The endpoint of the folding trajectory of a protein is a minimum energy conformation. The outward- and the inward-facing conformation are equivalent stable folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ponleitner et al., 2022</xref>). The ionic conditions in the ER differ from those at the cell surface. The absence of a sodium gradient favors the inward-facing conformation of SERT and other SLC6 transporters. Thus, it is reasonable to posit that their folding trajectory visits the inward-facing conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiba et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freissmuth et al., 2017</xref>). This conjecture is supported by the observation that mutations, which trap SERT in the inward-facing state, act as second site suppressors: they restore export from the ER and cell surface delivery of folding-deficient mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koban et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, many compounds, which act as pharmacochaperones on SERT or DAT, are atypical inhibitors with appreciable affinity for the inward-facing state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhat et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El-Kasaby et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhat et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kasture et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asjad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beerepoot et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sutton et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, based on its preferential binding to the inward-facing state of SERT, ECSI#6 was predicted to have pharmacochaperoning activity. This prediction was verified with SERT-PG<sup>601,602</sup>AA: pretreatment with ECSI#6 corrected the folding defect of this mutant, because it restored export from the ER and substrate transport by SERT-PG<sup>601,602</sup>AA. In addition, the administration of ECSI#6 to flies resulted in the delivery of the mutants to the presynaptic specialization of the axonal projection to the fan-shaped body. We note, though, that noribogaine was more efficacious as a pharmacochaperone: E<sub>max</sub> of pharmacochaperoning, that is, the extent to which substrate transport was restored at saturating concentrations – was consistently higher with noribogaine than with ECSI#6. Variable efficacy of pharmacochaperones was noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhat et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sutton et al., 2022</xref>). Efficacy also depends on the nature of the mutation: individual mutants are stalled at different positions within the energy landscape of the folding trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freissmuth et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El-Kasaby et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">El-Kasaby et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koban et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, individual mutants must differ in their susceptibility to pharmacochaperoning. In addition, in a given folding-deficient mutant, closely related compounds differ in E<sub>max</sub> of pharmacochaperoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhat et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sutton et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, pharmacochaperoning efficacy is also an intrinsic property of a compound linked to its chemical structure. Presumably, for a given mutant, variation in pharmacochaperoning efficacy reflects the different ability of individual compounds to stabilize one or several folding intermediates. There are four mechanisms, which account for pharmacochaperoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marinko et al., 2019</xref>): (i) binding to and stabilization of the folded state shifts the folding equilibrium and prevents the backward reaction; (ii) binding to folding intermediates smoothens the energy landscape and precludes stalling of the trajectory in unproductive traps of local minima; (iii) prevention of aggregate formation; and (iv) dissolution of aggregates can maintain or restore the folded state. The latter two mechanisms are immaterial to SERT: misfolded SERT does not form aggregates in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderluh et al., 2014</xref>). The EC<sub>50</sub> of ECSI#6 for pharmacochaperoning was lower than the concentration required for half-maximum inhibition of substrate uptake at saturating substrate. This is circumstantial evidence for an action of ECSI#6 on folding intermediates. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, because ECSI#6 was more potent a pharmacochaperone than a transport inhibitor, it is an attractive starting point to search for more efficacious compounds with pharmacochaperoning activity. In addition, in vivo, the action of ECSI#6 on serotonergic transmission is likely to differ from typical competitive inhibitors: because of the uncompetitive mode of its inhibition, ECSI#6 is predicted to cause a use-dependent block of SERT. Serotonergic pathways, which when activated, are more susceptible to modulation by ECSI#6. The reverse is true for competitive – that is, surmountable – inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and materials</title><p>The HEK293 cells were purchased from ATCC (# CRL-1573; ATCC, USA) and authenticated by STR profiling at the Medical University of Graz (Cell Culture Core Facility).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christof Grewer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. In general, the reviewers found the study to be interesting and compelling. However, the following clarifications, and in some cases additional data, would make the study more complete.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors suggest that serotonin and ECSI#6 cannot bind simultaneously to the transporter, however, no direct evidence for this conclusion is provided. Either provide data to support this claim or revise the text for a more balanced interpretation.</p><p>2) The question remains as to how ECSI#6 accesses the inward-facing binding site. Is this compound expected to permeate across the membrane, or is it slowly transported across and then binds to the intracellular side? To elaborate on this, studies including ECSI#6 in the recording electrode may provide further information on this point.</p><p>3) Please elaborate on why displacement experiments were not carried out with cocaine. Since cocaine is a competitive inhibitor but does not induce transport (i.e. doesn't induce the formation of the inward-facing conformation), it should act in a competitive mechanism with ECSI#6.</p><p>4) Dose-response relationships for the electrophysiological experiments would be a useful alternative method to validate the radiotracer flux data. Either provide some experimental data on this or explain why these experiments are not possible.</p><p>5) In the in-vivo <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaging data, the SERT fluorescence with WT protein is strong, but there is no clear fluorescence in the drug-treated image from the PG mutant. In this context, it is expected that there would be additional intracellular staining for ER-resident SERT. If the cell bodies of these cells are elsewhere this should be clearly pointed out. Please explain or provide additional images to clarify.</p><p>6) The Western blot demonstrating enhanced glycosylation in the presence of Noribogaine or ECSI#6 could be strengthened. The increased band at a high molecular weight that the authors attribute to the fully glycosylated form is visible. However, this smear, and the band below, look quite different from those in the blot shown in the El-Kasaby et al. reference, raising concerns that the band could be aggregated or dimerized protein rather than a glycosylated form. This concern could easily be addressed by control experiments with appropriate glycosidases, as shown in the reference.</p><p>6) Please address the author recommendations listed by the reviewers below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 1B.

It should be explicitly mentioned that To is the outward-facing apo state.</p><p>Line 586-590. This point is confusingly written and I didn't understand. It should be clarified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>- I would like to have access to the raw data of the experiments.</p><p>- The authors use a lot of text to explain their findings and interpretation, which I like. Nonetheless, in places, I find the paper hard to read, which may be caused by the choice of wording. For instance: line 296, &quot;accumulation&quot;, Line 309-130, &quot;accordingly&quot;.…appreciable binding can be measured, line 395: it is unclear how continuous cycling would lead to a current for an electroneutral transporter. It would help to explicitly mention that the current is uncoupled.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 1A: Should the pKa of these inhibitors be given?</p><p>Whenever the term &quot;affinity&quot; is used (except in binding studies), it probably should be replaced by &quot;apparent affinity&quot;.</p><p>Figure 2: It would be useful if panels A-C and D-F would have the same x-axis scale, so the reader can more easily compare the IC50 values in the absence and presence of K<sup>+</sup>.</p><p>Line 302: For the reader unfamiliar with SERT pharmacology, it should be explained why citalopram was used for the binding inhibition experiments.</p><p>Figure 3 D-F: The plots should be made in a regular x-y fashion, with a linear x (concentration) axis scale. That would make it easier to see if the cocaine data adhere to the regular competitive enzyme inhibition mechanism equation, in which Km is expected to increase in a linear fashion with inhibitor concentration. My feeling is that the slope of that curve is too shallow for cocaine to account for the full competitive mechanism.</p><p>Line 393: It is evident from the data that cocaine and noribogaine induce a peak current, but ECSI#6 does not. However, the authors do not explain why this is the case. This seems to be an important detail that could further inform on the inhibition mechanism.</p><p>Figure 4 D-E: Linear kapp vs concentration relationships are typically observed in situations where ligand binding is rate limiting, often under diffusion control. From the slope of the relationship, the bimolecular rate constant for binding can be obtained. What is this value? I assume that it is far below a diffusion-controlled rate constant?</p><p>Figure 5D: This Western blot is not very convincing. (1) The band at 110 kD is very weak, and this reviewer has trouble reconciling the bands with the data shown in Figure 5E. (2) What is the band at 60 kD? This blot needs further explanation.</p><p>Figure 7 legend: No information is given on the microscopic rate constants for inhibitor binding/dissociation. Are these assumed to be in equilibrium with respect to the other transport steps?</p><p>Figure 8: The plots of simulated vmax vs. inhibitor concentration should also be shown.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82641.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors suggest that serotonin and ECSI#6 cannot bind simultaneously to the transporter, however, no direct evidence for this conclusion is provided.

We refer the reader to Segel’s textbook on enzyme kinetics (new ref. 18) on using Dixon plots in the presence of two inhibitors. The pertinent description is on p. 9, lines 12-22 and reads as follows: “We transformed the data summarized in Figures 2A-C by plotting the reciprocal of bound radioligand as a function of inhibitor concentration to yield Dixon plots (Figure 2D-F): the x-intercept corresponds to -IC50 of the inhibitor [18]. Thus, Dixon plots allow for differentiating mutually exclusive from mutually non-exclusive binding, if one inhibitor (i.e., cocaine, noribogaine or ECSI#6) is examined at a fixed concentration of the second inhibitor (i.e., serotonin) [18]: if binding of the two inhibitors is mutually non-exclusive, a family of lines of progressively increasing slope, which intersect at -IC50, is to be seen. In contrast, if the two inhibitors bind to the same site, the slope of the inhibition curves is not affected and the xintercept (i.e, -IC50 of the variable inhibitor) is shifted to more negative values. It is evident from Figure 2D-E that the presence of 1 and 10 µM serotonin progressively shifted the (expected) x-intercept for cocaine (Figure 2D), noribogaine (Figure 2E) and ECSI#6 (Figure 2D). Thus, binding to SERT of serotonin and of these three ligands was mutually exclusive.” Based on the Dixon plots, we feel that our conclusion is justified, i.e., binding of serotonin and ECSI#6 (and of the other ligands) is mutually exclusive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The question remains as to how ECSI#6 accesses the inward-facing binding site. Is this compound expected to permeate across the membrane, or is it slowly transported across and then binds to the intracellular side? To elaborate on this, studies including ECSI#6 in the recording electrode may provide further information on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We did the suggested experiments: the data are summarized in panel I of Figure 4 and described in the first paragraph on p. 15, which also explains why this experiments is possibly inconclusive due to the high diffusivity of ECSI#6:</p><p>“Figure 4I shows representative traces of 5-HT induced currents recorded from SERT expressing cells in the absence (in blue) and presence of 100 µM ECSI#6 (in red) in the electrode solution: when thus applied from the intracellular side, ECSI#6 did not cause an appreciable current block. The right-hand panel summarizes the current amplitude obtained from cells measured in the absence (blue open circles) and presence of intracellular ECSI#6 (open circles in red). These data seem to indicate that ECSI#6 binds to SERT from the extracellular side. Yet this conclusion can be challenged based on the following consideration: in earlier experiments, ibogaine, the parent compound of noribogaine, was found to block HERG channels when applied from the bath solution but failed to do so when added to the electrode solution [27]. However, at a lower intracellular pH (i.e., pH 5.5), ibogaine gained the ability to inhibit HERG from the intracellular side (i.e., via application through the electrode). Conversely, ibogaine was less effective when applied to an acidified bath solution. These observations led to the conclusion that ibogaine blocked HERG from the cytosolic side: because the molecule in its neutral form was so diffusive, a low intracellular pH was required to force its protonation and thus preclude diffusion from the interior of the cell. ECSI#6 is presumed to also be very diffusible given its estimated logP value and polar surface area of 2.48 and 66 Å2, respectively. However, ECSI#6 harbors an amide nitrogen (see Figure 1A) and thus remains neutral in the experimentally accessible pH range. Hence, it is not possible to verify to which side of SERT it binds.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please elaborate on why displacement experiments were not carried out with cocaine. Since cocaine is a competitive inhibitor but does not induce transport (i.e. doesn't induce the formation of the inward-facing conformation), it should act in a competitive mechanism with ECSI#6.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not quite understand this comment from reviewer#1, because displacement experiments were done with cocaine (Figure 2A, new Figure 2G/previous Figure 2D). However, if the reviewer questions why we do not use cocaine rather than 5-HT, in the three-way competition experiment, it is precisely, because we wanted to compare the action/binding mode of ECSI#6 to that of cocaine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Dose-response relationships for the electrophysiological experiments would be a useful alternative method to validate the radiotracer flux data. Either provide some experimental data on this or explain why these experiments are not possible.</p></disp-quote><p>These experiments were done and are shown in (the new) panels G and H of Figure 4; the pertinent description is in the second paragraph of p. 14 and reads:</p><p>“The protocol depicted in Figure 4B can also be used to gauge the apparent affinity of ECSI#6 for SERT in the presence of 5-HT. Plotted in Figure 4G is the block of the serotonin-induced current as a function of the co-applied ECSI#6 concentration. The current was evoked by a saturating concentration of 5-HT (30µM) and inhibited by 3, 10, 30 and 100 µM co-applied ECSI#6, respectively (the inset in Figure 4G shows representative current traces). A fit of an inhibition curve to the data points yielded an IC50 value of approx. 5 µM. This value was lower but still in reasonable agreement, with the IC50 obtained in the radioligand uptake assay for the condition where the 5-HT concentration had been saturating (cf. dashed line in Figure 1C; 10 µM 5-HT). In the uptake assay the IC50 value of ECSI#6 dropped to about 0.5 mM, in the presence of a low 5-HT concentration (i.e., 0.1 µM). In contrast to uptake experiments, electrophysiological recordings also allow for assessing the apparent affinity of ECSI#6 for SERT in the absence of the substrate. This can be achieved by employing the protocol depicted in Figure 4H (see representative current traces on the left-hand side): we first applied 30 µM 5HT to a cell expressing SERT for 0.5 s to elicit a peak current (i.e., a control pulse). We then reapplied 30 µM 5-HT after a superfusing the cell with 100 µM ECSI#6 for 1 s (second upper trace in panel H). We chose this time period because it had been sufficient to allow for full current block in the other protocol (see Figure 4G): the amplitude of the peak current following pre-application of 100 µM ECSI#6 was essentially identical to the prior control pulse. When we pre-applied 100 µM ECSI#6 for a longer period (i.e., 3 s) the amplitude of the two peak currents also remained the same (cf. lower traces in panel H). The right-hand panel shows the summary of several experiments. Plotted in the graph is the ratio of the second and first pulse, which was always close to one. We previously used this protocol to assess the binding kinetics of cocaine, methylphenidate and desipramine on SERT and DAT. Pre-application of these inhibitors consistently led to a concentration dependent reduction in the peak current amplitude of the second pulse in comparison to the first [23]. The lack of inhibition, thus, indicates that the affinity of ECSI#6 in the absence of 5-HT is low. To obtain estimates for the affinity of ECSI# for SERT in the absence of 5-HT we would need to apply this compound at much higher concentrations. This, however, is not possible, because ECSI#6 is poorly soluble in aqueous solutions (i.e., max. 0.03 mg/ml).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the in-vivo <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaging data, the SERT fluorescence with WT protein is strong, but there is no clear fluorescence in the drug-treated image from the PG mutant. In this context, it is expected that there would be additional intracellular staining for ER-resident SERT. If the cell bodies of these cells are elsewhere this should be clearly pointed out. Please explain or provide additional images to clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified Figure 6 to include, in all instances, images of the posterior brain, where the neurons (FB6K) reside, from which the serotonergic projections originate. These images visualize expression of membrane-anchored GFP (mCD8GFP; in panel B), immunoreactivity of serotonin (panel B’), wild type SERT (panels C’,D’,E’) and mutant SERT-PG601,602AA (panels F’,G’,H’) in the soma. The description of these panels has been added to the pertinent sentences starting on p. 20, line 6 from bottom to the end of end of the first paragraph p. 21, which read:</p><p>“These projections (Figure 6A-A’’) and the FB6K-type neurons, from which they originate in the posterior brain (Figure 6B-B’’) can be visualized by expressing membrane-anchored GFP (i.e. GFP fused to the C-terminus of murine CD8; [36]) under the control of TRH-T2A-Gal4. Similarly, when placed under the control of TRH-T2A-Gal4, YFP-tagged wild-type human SERT was expressed in the FB6K-type neurons (Figure 6C’) and delivered to the fan-shaped body (Figure 6C). In contrast, in flies harboring human SERT-PG601,602AA, the transporter was visualized in the soma of FB6K-type neurons (Figure 6F’), but the fan-shaped body was devoid of any specific fluorescence (Figure 6F). However, if three-day old male flies expressing human SERTPG601,602AA were fed with food pellets containing 100 µM ECSI#6 or 100 µM noribogaine for 48 h, fluorescence accumulated to a level, which allowed for delineating the fan-shaped body (Figure 6G and H, respectively). This show that ECSI#6 and noribogaine exerted a pharmacochaperoning action in vivo, which partially restored the delivery of the mutant transporter to the presynaptic territory. As expected, in flies harboring wild-type human SERT, feeding of ECSI#6 and noribogaine did not have any appreciable effect on the level of fluorescence in the fan-shaped body (Figure 6D and E, respectively). “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The Western blot demonstrating enhanced glycosylation in the presence of Noribogaine or ECSI#6 could be strengthened.

We stress that the resolution very much depends on the electrophoretic conditions. We addressed the reviewers’ criticism by carrying out the recommended deglycosylation experiments: a representative experiment is shown in (the new) panel F of Figure 5, with lysates prepared from HEK293 cells expressing wild type SERT, from untransfected HEK293 cells and from HEK293 cells, which had been preincubated with 30 µM cocaine, 100 µM ECSI#6 and 30 µM noribogaine. The experiment confirms the band assignment with the upper band(s) M representing the mature glycostylated species (which are resistant to deglycosylation by endoglycosidase H) and the lower band C corresponding to the coregylcoylated species (which are susceptible to cleavage that (as expected) the mature band show a representative degylcosylation by endoglycosidase H). We also think that the immunoblot in panel F ought to satisfy the aesthetic criticism: the bands are sharper/less smeared.</p><p>The description of panel F can be found on p. 18, starting in line 7 from bottom to end of page, and reads: “We confirmed the band assignment by enzymatic deglycosylation (Figure 5F): the upper bands (labeled M), which appeared in cells incubated in the presence of ECSI#6 and of norbogaine, were resistant to deglycosylation by endoglycosidase H (which cannot cleave mature glycans). In contrast, the core-glycosylated species (labeled C), was susceptible to cleavage by endoglycosidase H resulting in the appearance of the deglycosylated band D.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Figure 1B.

These are comprised of an initial transient peak current and a steady current. The peak current reflects the initial synchronized movement of substrate and co-substrate through the membrane electric field. The steady current arises from an uncoupled current; the underlying channel mode is visited from the K<sup>+</sup>-bound inward-facing state. Thus the steady current reflects the continuous cycling of the transporter in the forward transport mode [24,25].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Figure 1A: Should the pKa of these inhibitors be given?</p><p>Whenever the term &quot;affinity&quot; is used (except in binding studies), it probably should be replaced by &quot;apparent affinity&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not see any advantage in reporting pKa (rather than non-logarithmically transformed data); we agree with the reviewer that the term apparent affinities is preferable, when inhibition of the transport cycle is being referred to (appropriate changes were made in the text as recommended). – make sure if apparent affinity was used as mandated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: It would be useful if panels A-C and D-F would have the same x-axis scale, so the reader can more easily compare the IC50 values in the absence and presence of K<sup>+</sup>.</p></disp-quote><p>We have redrawn all graphs (including the uptake inhibition curves in Figure 1) such that the xaxes have an identical scale (and an axis-break to show the control values at 0 inhibitor).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 302: For the reader unfamiliar with SERT pharmacology, it should be explained why citalopram was used for the binding inhibition experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide an explanation, why we used tritiated citalopram as a radioligand (on p. 9, lines 6 to 10):</p><p>“We resorted to radioligand binding experiments with [<sup>3</sup>H]citalopram to address which of the two possibilities can explain the experimental observations: [<sup>3</sup>H]citalopram is a radiolabeled high-affinity inhibitor of SERT, which binds to the outward facing conformation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 D-F: The plots should be made in a regular x-y fashion, with a linear x (concentration) axis scale.

However, the authors do not explain why this is the case.

We provide two alternative explanations for why ECSI#6 failed to produce a peak current (on. p. 13, lines 14 to 21 of the second paragraph). “In the presence of physiological ion gradients and in the absence of substrate, SERT dwells primarily in the outward-facing conformation. A precondition for a ligand to elicit a peak current is, therefore, the ability to bind to outward facing states. The failure of ECSI#6 to produce a peak current is, thus, consistent with the interpretation that this compound binds exclusively to inward facing states. It should be noted, however, that cocaine and noribogaine carry a charge while ECSI#6 does not. Thus, it is not possible to formally rule out the alternative explanation that ECSI#6 fails to generate a peak current, because it is uncharged.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 D-E: Linear kapp vs concentration relationships are typically observed in situations where ligand binding is rate limiting, often under diffusion control. From the slope of the relationship, the bimolecular rate constant for binding can be obtained. What is this value? I assume that it is far below a diffusion-controlled rate constant?</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted the requested analysis. We inserted the following text starting on line 8 to the end of the first paragraph on p. 14:</p><p>“We obtained estimates for the k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> of noribogaine and ECSI#6, respectively, from the slopes and the y-intercepts of the linear regression in panels D and E. The extracted k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> values were 1.7*10<sup>5</sup>±1.6*10<sup>4</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>*s<sup>-1</sup> and 1.4±0.3 s<sup>-1</sup> and 2.1*10<sup>4</sup>±3.5*10<sup>3</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>*s<sup>-1</sup> and 1.7±0.5 s<sup>-1</sup>, for noribogaine and for ECSI#6, respectively. However, these rate constants do not allow for estimating a kinetically calculated K<sub>D</sub>. In fact, the rate of the inhibitor-induced current block is comprised of both, (i) the binding rates of the inhibitor and (ii) the rates of the conformational transitions, which SERT undergoes during substrate transport. Thus, the protocol employed (cf. Figure 4B) does not afford an accurate determination of inhibitor binding rates.” We hope that this explanation addresses the question of the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5D: This Western blot is not very convincing.
