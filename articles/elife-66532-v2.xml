degenerative joint disorder, is characterized by joint pain and disability. Available treatments fail to modify osteoarthritis progression and decrease joint pain effectively. Here, we show that intermittent parathyroid hormone (iPTH) attenuates osteoarthritis pain by inhibiting subchondral sensory innervation, subchondral bone deterioration, and articular cartilage degeneration in a destabilized medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model. We found that subchondral sensory innervation for osteoarthritis pain was significantly decreased in PTH-treated DMM mice compared with vehicle-treated DMM mice. In parallel, deterioration of subchondral bone microarchitecture in DMM mice was attenuated by iPTH treatment. Increased level of prostaglandin E2 in subchondral bone of DMM mice was reduced by iPTH treatment. Furthermore, uncoupled subchondral bone remodeling caused by increased transforming growth factor Î² signaling was regulated by PTH-induced endocytosis of the PTH type 1 receptorâtransforming growth factor Î² type 2 receptor complex. Notably, iPTH improved subchondral bone microarchitecture and decreased level of prostaglandin E2 and sensory innervation of subchondral bone in DMM mice by acting specifically through PTH type 1 receptor in Nestin<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal stromal cells. Thus, iPTH could be a potential disease-modifying therapy for osteoarthritis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Over time the cartilage between our bones gets worn down, and this can lead to a painful joint disorder known as osteoarthritis. Nearly 40 million people with osteoarthritis in the United States experience chronic pain. Although there are a number of drugs available for these patients, none of them provide sustained pain relief, and some have substantial side effects when ingested over a long period of time.</p><p>Bone tissue is continuously broken down into minerals, such as calcium, that can be reabsorbed into the blood. In 2013, a group of researchers found that the tissue in the layer of bone below the cartilage â known as the subchondral bone â is reabsorbed and replaced incorrectly in patients with osteoarthritis. This irregular âremodelingâ stimulates nerve cells to grow into the subchondral layer, leading to increased sensitivity in the joint.</p><p>A protein called parathyroid hormone, or PTH for short, plays an important role in the loss and formation of bone. A drug containing PTH is used to treat patients with another bone condition called osteoporosis, and could potentially work as a treatment for osteoarthritis pain.</p><p>To investigate this, Sun et al. â including some of the researchers involved in the 2013 study â tested this drug on a mouse model that mimics the symptoms of osteoarthritis. This revealed that PTH significantly decreases the number of nerves present in the subchondral bone, which caused the mice to experience less pain. PTH also slowed down the progression of osteoarthritis, by preventing the cartilage on the subchondral layer from deteriorating as quickly. Sun et al. found that the subchondral bones of treated mice also had a more stable structure and reduced levels of a protein involved in the reabsorption of bone.</p><p>The results suggest that PTH is able to correct the errors in bone remodeling caused by osteoarthritis, and that this drug could potentially alleviate patientsâ chronic pain. This drug has already been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and could be used in clinical trials to see if PTH has the same beneficial effects on patients with osteoarthritis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>parathyroid hormone</kwd><kwd>osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>subchondral bone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01AG066603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01 AG068997</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parathyroid hormone attenuates osteoarthritis pain and joint degeneration by modification of subchondral bone remodeling and could be a potential disease-modifying therapy for osteoarthritis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoarthritis is the most common degenerative joint disorder in the USA and a leading cause of disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murray et al., 2012</xref>). Chronic pain is a prominent symptom of osteoarthritis, affecting nearly 40 million people in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peat et al., 2001</xref>). Pain itself is also a major risk factor for the development of functional limitation and disability in patients with osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lane et al., 2010</xref>). Unfortunately, treating osteoarthritis pain is challenging and represents a substantial unmet medical need. Available therapies (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics, and steroids) do not provide sustained pain relief and can have substantial adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geba et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karlsson et al., 2002</xref>). Inadequate control of chronic osteoarthritis pain is a major reason that patients seek surgical treatment.</p><p>The sources and mechanisms of osteoarthritis pain may be multifactorial. Some studies have focused on synovial inflammation and cartilage degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mathiessen and Conaghan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malfait and Schnitzer, 2013</xref>). Yet, osteoarthritis pain can manifest during very early stages of the disease, in the absence of synovial inflammation and independently of progressive cartilage degeneration. Many patients have radiographic osteoarthritic changes but no symptoms, whereas others have osteoarthritis pain with no radiographic indications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dieppe and Lohmander, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hannan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bedson and Croft, 2008</xref>). Some patients have bilateral radiographic evidence of knee osteoarthritis yet have unilateral knee pain. Little attention has been paid to subchondral bone to control osteoarthritis pain. Intriguingly, subchondral bone marrow edemaâlike lesions are highly correlated with osteoarthritis pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yusuf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kwoh, 2013</xref>). Zoledronic acid, which inhibits osteoclast activity, reduces the size of bone marrow edemaâlike lesions and concomitantly alleviates pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laslett et al., 2012</xref>). Analysis of data from the National Institutes of Health Osteoarthritis Initiative reported that patients taking bisphosphonates experienced significantly reduced knee pain at years 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laslett et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, patients with osteoarthritis report rapid and obvious pain relief after removal of deteriorated subchondral bone with overlying cartilage through knee replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Isaac et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reilly et al., 2005</xref>). Articular cartilage, which is characteristically aneural and avascular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhosale and Richardson, 2008</xref>), is incapable of generating pain primarily, suggesting that subchondral bone is a major source of osteoarthritis pain.</p><p>Aberrant subchondral bone remodeling is a critical factor in pathological changes of osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhen and Cao, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhen et al., 2013</xref>), and sensory innervation induced by netrin-1 from aberrant subchondral bone remodeling is responsible for osteoarthritis pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, locally elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) activate sensory nerves in porous endplates, leading to sodium influx through Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 channels, to mediate spinal hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ni et al., 2019</xref>). We have shown that bone homeostasis is maintained by temporal-spatial activation of transforming growth factor Î² (TGF-Î²) to couple bone resorption and formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tang et al., 2009</xref>), in which subchondral bone is maintained in a native microarchitecture with blood vessels and nerves intertwined under normal conditions. However, excessive active TGF-Î² in the subchondral bone induces aberrant bone remodeling at the onset of osteoarthritis to promote its progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhen et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, high levels of active TGF-Î² recruit mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and osteoprogenitors in clusters, leading to abnormal bone formation and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Parathyroid hormone (PTH), a U.S. Food and Drug Administrationâapproved anabolic agent for osteoporosis, regulates bone remodeling and calcium metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crane and Cao, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qiu et al., 2010</xref>). The parathyroid gland, the main production site of PTH, evolved in amphibians and supported the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life, allowing terrestrial locomotion in previously aquatic vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Okabe and Graham, 2004</xref>). PTH prevents cartilage degeneration and/or the deterioration of subchondral bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sampson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellido et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lugo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eswaramoorthy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cui et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morita et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), induces cartilage regeneration or chondrocytes proliferation in osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sampson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Petersson et al., 2006</xref>), and stimulates subchondral bone and articular cartilage repair of focal osteochondral defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orth et al., 2013</xref>). PTH also interacts with local osteotropic factors to orchestrate the coupling of bone resorption and formation in an anabolic signaling network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qiu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pfeilschifter et al., 1995</xref>), and PTH and TGF-Î² work in concert to exert their physiological activities in bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qiu et al., 2010</xref>). TGF-Î² elicits its cellular response through the ligand-induced formation of a heteromeric complex containing TGF-Î² types 1 (TÎ²RI) and 2 (TÎ²RII) kinase receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wrana et al., 1992</xref>). We have shown that PTH induces endocytosis of PTH type one receptor (PTH1R) with TÎ²RII as a complex, and both PTH and TGF-Î² signaling are co-regulated during endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qiu et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we investigated whether intermittent parathyroid hormoneÂ (iPTH) could attenuate osteoarthritis pain by modifying cartilage degeneration, subchondral bone microarchitecture, and subchondral sensory innervation. We found that iPTH reduces osteoarthritis pain and attenuates progression of osteoarthritis by attenuating subchondral bone deterioration and cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, iPTH reduces sensory innervation and the level of PGE2 in the subchondral bone and improves subchondral bone remodeling specifically through PTH1R on Nestin<sup>+</sup> MSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>iPTH attenuates osteoarthritis pain and articular cartilage degeneration</title><p>To examine the effect of iPTH on osteoarthritis pain, we generated a DMM model of osteoarthritis in 10Â weekÂ old mice, administered daily PTH subcutaneously beginning 3 days after surgery, and assessed pain behavior during the following 8 weeks. We assessed threeÂ types of pain behavior: secondary hyperalgesia, primary hyperalgesia, and gait deficit. Secondary hyperalgesia of the affected hind paw was analyzed weekly by measuring 50% paw withdrawal threshold (50%Â PWT).

Joint replacement is the only alternative for end-stage osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the development of an effective disease-modifying treatment for osteoarthritis is needed. We found that PTH reduced sensory innervation and the level of PGE2 in subchondral bone through inhibition of aberrant subchondral bone remodeling, which resulted in osteoarthritis pain relief. Importantly, PTH also attenuated osteoarthritis progression by inhibiting deterioration of subchondral bone microarchitecture and cartilage degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of PTH-induced pain relief and attenuation of joint degeneration in osteoarthritis.</title><p>Aberrant mechanical stress induces uncoupled remodeling of subchondral bone due to excessive TGF-Î² at onset of osteoarthritis and subsequently generates a pathological microenvironment with significantly increased PGE2 level and other inflammatory factors when reaching a certain threshold.

We have previously shown that aberrant subchondral bone is a critical source of pain in osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Abnormal subchondral bone remodeling induces aberrant sensory innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>), and elevated PGE2 induces hypersensitivity through sensory nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ni et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, PTH improved primary and secondary knee hyperalgesia and gait deficits in DMM mice. Furthermore, PTH effectively reduced the density of sensory nerve in the subchondral bone in DMM mice. In the <italic>Pth1r</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice after DMM surgery, PTH failed to improve osteoarthritis pain and reduce the sensory innervation and the level of PGE2 in the subchondral bone, but PTH worked effectively in <italic>Pth1r<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice. We found that the density of CGRP<sup>+</sup> sensory nerve fibers in the synovium increased post DMM surgery. This could be the reason that the pain behavior was not completely disappeared in the PTH treatment mice. The density of CGRP<sup>+</sup> sensory nerve fibers in the synovium remained unchanged after PTH injection. PTH has been shown to inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory modulators, including COX2, in the synovial membrane of the osteoarthritis animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lugo et al., 2012</xref>). Also, the inflammatory response of synovial membrane was also reported to remain unaffected with PTH treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orth et al., 2013</xref>). The pain that originates from synovium partially reflects the severity of osteoarthritis and further limits overuse of knee joint. Considering that the articular cartilage has no nerve and blood vessel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaible, 2012</xref>), PTH-induced decrease of osteoarthritis pain is primarily due to its effect on subchondral bone.</p><p>Blood vessels and nerve fibers often course alongside each other because they share similar mechanisms of wiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carmeliet and Tessier-Lavigne, 2005</xref>); therefore, nerve fibers may undergo similar remodeling pattern to vessels with iPTH treatment. Co-immunostaining showed that CGRP<sup>+</sup> nerve fibers is largely colocalized with endomucin+ vessels in the subchondral bone, both significantly decreased with iPTH treatment. The expression of PTH1R in arteriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Massfelder et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Song et al., 2009</xref>) and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Funk et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Isales et al., 2000</xref>) has been reported in previous studies. Noteworthy, endogenous PTHrP downregulates the expression of PTH1R in vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Song et al., 2009</xref>). As we all know, the vessel volume is significantly increased in the subchondral bone in osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhen et al., 2013</xref>). PTH may inhibit vascularization or angiogenesis by negatively modulating the expression of PTH1R in the subchondral bone, where the vessel formation is usually accompanied by nerve growth. Thus, PTH reduces sensory innervation in the subchondral bone in association with decrease of blood vessels.</p><p>Sensory innervation promotes osteoblast bone formation and suppresses osteoclast bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ishizuka et al., 2005</xref>). We have shown that sensory nerve regulates bone homeostasis and promote regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). The ablation of sensory innervation by genetic or pharmacological approaches consistently results in decreased bone mass in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukuda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brazill et al., 2019</xref>). PTH induces osteoclastic bone resorption in coupling osteoblast bone formation during bone remodeling. Increased osteoclasts secrete PDGF-BB for type H vessel formation in support of the bone remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xie et al., 2014</xref>). Accumulatively, the daily injection of PTH increases bone formation with net decrease of both total vessel formation and nerve innervation as the porous subchondral bone was decreased with new bone formation during the dynamic process. Therefore, iPTH decreased sensory nerve and attenuated osteoarthritis pain by a decrease of porous subchondral bone.</p><p>The abnormal microarchitecture of subchondral bone caused by aberrant subchondral bone remodeling plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pan et al., 2012</xref>). The maintenance of active TGF-Î² levels in a spatial and temporally manner is essential for coupled bone remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tang et al., 2009</xref>), but excessive active TGF-Î² signaling in the subchondral bone leads to aberrant bone remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhen et al., 2013</xref>). PTH has been shown to preserve microarchitecture of subchondral bone and improves subchondral bone reconstitution of osteochondral defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellido et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morita et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dai et al., 2016</xref>). The decreased bone density and aberrantly elevated TGF-Î² levels were simultaneously occurred in the subchondral bone at the early stage of osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhen et al., 2013</xref>). PTH induces internalization of PTH1R together with TÎ²RII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qiu et al., 2010</xref>). iPTH improves the pathological subchondral bone microenvironment by downregulating the TGF-Î² signaling through endocytic complex of PTH1R and TÎ²RII.</p><p>Aberrant mechanical stress induces subchondral bone uncoupled remodeling at the onset of osteoarthritis and subsequently generates a pathological microenvironment with significantly increased PGE2 level and other inflammatory factors when reaching a certain threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rahmati et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, subchondral bone has been shown as a source of inflammatory mediators and osteoarthritis pain. The abnormal microarchitecture of subchondral bone in osteoarthritis dramatically changes the stress distribution on articular cartilage. iPTH modulates the mechanical stress distribution on articular cartilage by improving microarchitecture of the subchondral bone. As a result, the production of pro-inflammatory factors, such as PGE2, in subchondral bone is reduced. iPTH also has been shown to ameliorate both hyperplasia and fibrosis in osteoarthritis preceded by osteoporosis and inhibit expression of pro-inflammatory modulators, including COX2, in synovial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lugo et al., 2012</xref>). We revealed that iPTH have a therapeutic effect on osteoarthritis and pain by improving subchondral bone microenvironment through remodeling. For example, unmineralized or low mineralized bony tissues in the subchondral bone marrow cavity, not on the bone surface, were the typical osteoarthritis pathological change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhen et al., 2013</xref>). The newly formed osteoid islets in the subchondral bone marrow were almost diminished in osteoarthritis mice with daily PTH injection.</p><p>Articular cartilage degeneration is the primary concern in osteoarthritis. PTH has been reported to inhibit cartilage degradation, terminal differentiation, and apoptosis of chondrocytes and to promote regeneration of articular cartilage in osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sampson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellido et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lugo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Petersson et al., 2006</xref>). The studies on PTH effect on osteoarthritic subchondral bone showed iPTH administration resulted in improvement of subchondral bone structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellido et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orth et al., 2013</xref>) or contradict result of induction of osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Orth et al., 2014</xref>). PTH effect on the subchondral bone remains unclear. The current study provides evidence for the mechanism to clarify the different results. The result of PTH induction of osteoarthritis was conducted in normal mice rather than osteoarthritis animal models. In normal mice with no joint osteoarthritis, their subchondral bones have normal bone density and appropriate microstructure, which are in balance with articular cartilage. iPTH treatment generates additional new bone on top of normal subchondral bone density and structure. As a result, the changes of subchondral bone disrupt its balanced interplay with articular cartilage and leads to cartilage degeneration. Whereas in osteoarthritis mice, the subchondral bone is pathologically changed from coupled remodeling to uncoupled remodeling with porous structure. iPTH administration stimulates osteoclast remodeling andÂ generates new bone to improve its structure quality and its interaction with articular cartilage. More importantly, the beneficial effect of PTH on subchondral bone deterioration and pain relief was diminished in the osteoarthritis <italic>Pth1r<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice. The protective effects of PTH on cartilage degeneration were also impaired in <italic>Pth1r<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice. Thus, our data reveal that PTH protects articular cartilage from degeneration through both articular cartilage and subchondral bone.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal to pSmad2/3</td><td>Santa Cruz</td><td>sc-11769</td><td>1:50</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal to Osterix</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab22552</td><td>1:600</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal to TÎ²RII</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab186838</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal to Î²-actin</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>CST3700</td><td>1:3000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal to COX2</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab15191</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal to MMP13</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab39012</td><td>1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Chicken polyclonal to Nestin</td><td>Aves Labs</td><td>NES0407</td><td>1:300</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal to CGRP</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab81887</td><td>1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rat monoclonal to Substance P</td><td>Santa Cruz</td><td>sc-21715</td><td>1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rat monoclonal to endomucin</td><td>Santa Cruz</td><td>sc-65495</td><td>1:50</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal to PIEZO2</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab243416</td><td>1:300</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal to P2 Ã 3</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab10269</td><td>1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57BL/6J mice</td><td>Charles River Laboratories</td><td>Strain Code: 27</td><td>C57BL/6 background</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Pth1r<sup>fl/fl</sup></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kobayashi et al., 2002</xref></td><td>Charles River Laboratories</td><td>C57BL/6 background</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Nestin-creERT2</td><td>Stock No: 016261</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>C57BL/6 background</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>human PTH (1-34)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>P3796</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence- based reagent</td><td>Nestin-creERT2 forward</td><td>N/A</td><td>PCR Primer</td><td>5â²â3â²: ACCAGAGACGGAAATCCATCGCTC</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Nestin-creERT2 reverse</td><td>N/A</td><td>PCR Primer</td><td>5â²â3â²: TGCCACGACCAAGTGACAGCAATG</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Pth1r loxP allele forward</td><td>N/A</td><td>PCR Primer</td><td>5â²â3â²: TGGACGCAGACGATGTCTTTACCA</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Pth1r loxP allele reverse</td><td>N/A</td><td>PCR Primer</td><td>5â²â3â²: ACATGGCCATGCCTGGGTCTGAGA</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Graphpad 8.0</td><td>N/A</td><td>Statistical Analysis</td><td>Graph preparation</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>SPSS, 15.0</td><td>N/A</td><td>Statistical Analysis</td><td>Statistical analysis</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and in vivo treatment</title><p>We purchased male C57BL/6J mice (wild-type [WT] mice) from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA).

All experiments were performed and analyzed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamers et al., 2001</xref>). Gait analysis was performed in a room that was dark except for the light from the computer screen. Briefly, mice were trained to cross the catwalk walkway daily for 7 days before surgery. During the test, each mouse was placed individually in the catwalk walkway and allowed to walk freely from one side to the other side of the walkwayâs glass plate. Light from an encased fluorescent lamp was emitted inside the glass plate and completely internally reflected. When the mouse paws contacted the glass plate, light was reflected down, and the illuminated contact area was recorded with a high-speed color video camera positioned under the glass plate and connected to a computer running CatWalk XT software, v9.1 (Noldus Information Technology). Comparison was made between the left hind paw and right hind paw in each run of each animal. We calculated the following gait parameters: left hind paw (LH)/right hind paw (RH) contact area, LH/RH intensity, and LH/RH swing speed.</p><p>The 50% PWT was measured by von Frey hair algesiometry. Mice were habituated to elevated plexiglass chambers and wire mesh flooring before assessments of allodynia. Then, ipsilateral hind paw mechanosensitivity was measured using a modification of the Dixon up-down method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dixon, 1980</xref>). Allodynia was evaluated by applying von Frey hairs in ascending order of bending force (force range: 0.07, 0.40, 0.60, 1.0, 1.4, 2.0, 4.0, or 6.0 g). The von Frey hair was applied perpendicular to the plantar surface of the hind paw (avoiding the toe pads) for 2â3 s. If no response, the next higher strength of hair was used, up to the maximum level of 6 g of bending force. If a withdrawal response occurred, the paw was re-tested, starting with the next descending von Frey hair until no response occurred. Four more measurements were made after the first difference was observed.

A 5Â mmÂ diameter sensor tip of an applied force gauge (SMALGO algometer; Bioseb, Pinellas Park, FL) was used for the vocalization thresholds. The pressure force on the knee was increased at 50 g/s until an audible vocalization was made while the mice were restrained gently by the investigator. The curve of the pressure force was recorded by using BIO-CIS software (Bioseb) to ensure the force increased gradually. A cutoff force of 500 g was used to prevent trauma to the joint. The test was performed twice at an interval of 15 min, and the mean value was recorded as the nociceptive threshold.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Î¼CT</title><p>We dissected the left knee of mice free of soft tissue and fixed the samples in 10% buffered formalin for 48 hr.

administrating intermittent parathyroid hormone (iPTH) to treat osteoarthritis (OA) pain by inhibiting subchondral bone deterioration and subchondral sensory innervation in an OA mouse model of destabilized medial meniscus (DMM). You demonstrated that iPTH reverses defects of subchondral bone structure, sensory innervation and increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in subchondral bone area in DMM mice. You also found that increased transforming growth factor Î² (TGF-Î²) signaling during OA development caused uncoupled subchondral bone remodeling, which is regulated by PTH-induced endocytosis of the type 1 PTH receptor (PTH1R) / type 2 TGF-Î² type 2 receptor (TGFÎ²R2) complex. iPTH improved subchondral bone microarchitecture, and decreased level of PGE2 and sensory innervation in subchondral bone area of DMM mice.

The authors need to discuss external effect of iPTH besides Nestin-expressing cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestions. We made the relevant discussion in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Articular cartilage degeneration is the primary concern in osteoarthritis. In this study, iPTH demonstrated its protective effect on cartilage and subchondral during OA progression. Deletion of <italic>PTH1R</italic> in Nestin-expressing cells of PTH1R<sup>-/-</sup> mice, the protective effect on cartilage remained although the effect on subchondral bone was impaired (as shown in Figure 7B), likely due to severe deterioration of subchondral bone in PTH1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our result is consistent with previous literatures that PTH inhibit cartilage degradation, terminal differentiation, and apoptosis of chondrocytes and to promote regeneration of articular cartilage in osteoarthritis (1-4).</p><p>Regarding synovium, we did not observe significant change in PTH-treated and PBS-treated DMM mice. The synovial cells do express PTH1R, and PTH has been shown to inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory modulators, including COX2, in the synovial membrane of the OA animal model (5). Also, the inflammatory response of synovial membrane was also reported to remain unaffected after systemic application of PTH in osteochondral defects (6). In our study, we found that the effect of PTH on relieving OA pain was remarkably blunted in the NestinCre:: PTH1R<sup>f/f</sup> mice, indicating that PTH ameliorates OA pain primarily by targeting subchondral bone.

The findings with respect to pain alleviation are novel, but they are minimal, and the statistical test used to demonstrate significant effects is inadequate, suggesting that the p values for significance for some of the data will be lower or become insignificant. In addition, some of the data confirm published effects of PTH in OA or are anticipated. Thus, although the data point to possible effects of iPTH on pain relief in OA, they do not represent a significant advance on whatâs already known about PTH in this model.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments. Many papers about PTH effects on OA have been published. However, they primarily investigated the effects of PTH on articular cartilage for OA treatment. OA pain is less likely derived from articular cartilage as it does not have nerve fibers and blood vessels. Instead, OA pain can be developed at a very early stage without inflammation and independent of progressive cartilage degeneration. Many asymptomatic patients have osteoarthritic radiographic changes while other patients have OA pain but with no radiographic findings. Our recent report demonstrated that subchondral bone osteoclasts induce sensory innervation for OA pain. Indeed, OA patients recerived knee replacement feel rapidly pain relief after removal of deteriorated cartilage and partial subchondral.</p><p>Pain is the most prominent symptom of OA, affecting nearly 40 million in the US alone, which may be either chronic or episodic pain. Pain is the reason people seek medical attention, and itself is a risk factor for the development of future functional decline. Increase of pain is a predictor of physical functional limitation and disability. Targeting OA pain clarified the primary effects of PTH on subchondral bone or articular cartilage. The current study in this manuscript attempts to demonstrates that PTH reduces OA pain and attenuates the progression of OA through remodeling of subchondral bone deterioration.</p><p>In addition, there were few papers about PTH on OA subchondral bone, primarily performing <sub>Âµ</sub>CT and histology analysis of subchondral bone changes. For an example, intermittent injection of PTH (iPTH) was applied in normal mice rather than OA animal models, leading to onset of OA (Orth et al., 2014). Apparently, the messages regarding the effect of PTH on OA is confusing. The objective of this study is also to provide a mechanistic insight into the effects of PTH on OA to clarify the perplexing issues. There are several novel findings regarding mechanism of the effects of PTH on OA subchondral bone:</p><p>First, iPTH stimulates new bone formation through osteoclastic bone remodeling. In normal mice with no joint OA, their subchondral bones have normal bone density and appropriate microstructure, which are in balance with articular cartilage. iPTH treatment generates additional new bone on top of normal subchondral bone density and structure. As a result, the changes of subchondral bone disrupt its balanced interplay with articular cartilage, leading to the cartilage degeneration. In OA, the subchondral bone is pathologically changed to porous structure due to uncoupled remodeling. iPTH administration stimulates osteoclast remodeling generates new bone to improve its structure quality and its interaction with articular cartilage. More importantly, the NestinCre::PTH1R<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (KO mice) were the first time created in this study. The beneficial effect of PTH on pain relief and prevention of subchondral bone deterioration were not observed in the KO mice.</p><p>In our previous study, we found that there were unmineralized or low mineralized bony tissues in the bone marrow cavity, as isolated osteoid islets in the OA subchondral bone (Zhen et al., 2013). These osteoid islets were not observed in the sham-operated control mice. In the present study, we showed that the newly formed osteoid islets in the subchondral bone marrow cavity were decreased with daily PTH injection.</p><p>Aberrant mechanical stress induces uncoupled remodeling of subchondral bone at onset of OA and subsequently generates a pathological microenvironment with significantly increased PGE2 level and other inflammatory factors when reaching a certain threshold (Rahmati et al., 2016). Importantly, subchondral bone has been shown as a source of inflammatory mediators and OA pain. The abnormal microarchitecture of subchondral bone in OA dramatically change the stress distribution on articular cartilage. iPTH modulates the mechanical stress distribution on articular cartilage by improving microarchitecture of the subchondral bone to reduce production of pro-inflammatory factors. iPTH also has been shown to ameliorate both hyperplasia and fibrosis in OA preceded by osteoporosis, and inhibit expression of pro-inflammatory modulators, including COX2, in synovial membrane (Lugo et al., 2012). In the current study, we revealed that iPTH have a therapeutic effect on OA and pain by improving subchondral bone microenvironment through remodeling, which was blunted in the NestinCre::PTH1R<sup>f/f</sup> mice.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have substantially revised the Discussion section to clarify and highlight the significance and novelty of our study. We also improved the description of statistical analysis by adding new information. As suggested, we reanalyzed the data of</p><p>50%PWTs and PAMWTs by two-way repeated-measurement ANOVA with Bonferroniâs posthoc test. All sets of data at (2 weeks), 4 weeks, and 8 weeks were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroniâs post-hoc test. The therapeutic effects of PTH remains significant.

For other comparisons among multiple groups, we used one-way ANOVA with Bonferroniâs post hoc test.

The data showed that PTH significantly improve all the indices, especially starting from 4 weeks after DMM surgery. The differences between the PTH group and vehicle group in 50%PWTs, PAMWTs, and gait analysis at 8 weeks remained significant (p&lt; 0.01). Our results are comparable to the published studies conducting similar behavior tests (e.g. Joen et al., 2017 and Lee et al., 2018), the ratio of value of absolute difference to largest value of indices rangee from 10% to 20%.</p><p>Our results showed that the 50%PWTs of the ipsilateral limb in the PTH group is around 50% more than the vehicle treated group, starting from 5 weeks after surgery.

Regarding gait analysis parameters, including paw intensity, contact area and swing speed, they were around 15% to 20% more than the vehicle-treated group at week 8 after DMM surgery.

The details of the quantitative analysis has been added in the corresponding figure legend. In our previous study, we have shown that decreased bone density promotes PGE2 production by osteoblasts (Chen et al., 2019), whereas osteocytes do not secrete PGE2 for low bone density. Increase of COX2 expression and elevated PGE2 levels in OA subchondral bone are associated with spontaneous OA pathological changes in mice (Tu et al., 2019). We have quantified the PGE2 levels of entire subchondral bone, and calculated the COX2 positive cells in both the BM and subchondral bone matrix in parallel. We found that PGE2 produced in both BM and bone matrix contributes to subchondral bone-related OA pain.</p><p>The synovial cells do express PTH1R, and PTH has been shown to inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory modulators, including COX2, in the synovial membrane of the OA animal model (Lugo et al., 2012).

The changes of subchondral bone were measured by <sub>Î¼</sub>CT for the effect of PTH in the published data. In our recent study, we found that the porosity of bone induces sensory innervation and increases local PGE2 levels (Ni et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019) to stimulate nociceptors of pain. The objective is to determine the porous structure of subchondral bone during OA progression, and whether daily injection of PTH could improve the porous structure. As shown in Figure 3A-B, subchondral bone cavities were seen in the OA mice whereas PTH treatment significantly reduced the porosity structure and reduced sensory innervation (Figure 2A-E, and Figure 3A-B). Illustration of improvement of the porosity is a necessary base to understand the elevated levels of PGE2 for the OA pain and effect of PTH on the attenuation of OA pain by blunting the noxious stimuli of PGE2 on innervated nociceptors in the subchondral bone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3F.

These osteoid islets were not observed in the sham-operated control mice. In the present study, we showed that the newly formed osteoid islets were decreased with daily PTH injection.

However, in the current study, we attempt to investigate whether PTH-induced endocytosis of T<sub>Î²</sub>RII and inhibition of TGF-<sub>Î²</sub> signaling improve the microarchitecture of subchondral bone in OA animal model. We found that PTH modulates TGF-<sub>Î²</sub> signaling to restore coupled bone remodeling, and subsequently maintain the microarchitecture of subchondral bone in OA mice. As a result, PTH downregulates PGE2 production and subsequent pain signals by normalizing the microstructure of subchondral bone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5.

After re-analyzing the 50%PWTs and PAMWTs by two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, the difference remains significant, which suggests that PTH is effective in preventing OA pain. In the experiments examining the treatment effect of PTH (Figure 5), we found PTH also attenuated OA pain even when the deterioration of cartilage and subchondral bone is already developed in mice at week 4 after DMM surgery. In detail, 50%PWTs of ipsilateral limb in PTH group was around 20% higher than the vehicle-treated group. Regarding PAMWTs, it was over 15% higher in the PTH group than that of the vehicle-treated group.

The KO mice provided the possibility to distinguish the effect of PTH on the subchondral bone from its effect on articular cartilage or synovium The beneficial effect of PTH on pain relief and prevention of subchondral bone deterioration not observed in the KO mice. While previously published researches primarily focus on the effect of PTH on articular cartilage, we are particularly investigating subchondral bone as a major resource for OA pain. Specifically, we found that PTH maintains the microstructure of subchondral bone by modulation of TGF-<sub>Î²</sub> signaling in OA. The effect of PTH was abolished when PTH1R was specifically deleted in the nestin positive stromal cells. This is for the first time to investigate the mechanism of PTH in OA pain relief by normalizing the microstructure of subchondral bone and subsequent reduction of PGE2 levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer B</p><p>The authors aim to analyze the effects of intermittent parathyroid hormone (iPTH) treatment on osteoarthritis (OA) progression and pain sensitivity. They show that iPTH attenuates OA pain by inhibiting subchondral sensory innervation, subchondral bone deterioration, and articular cartilage degeneration in a destabilized medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model. In addition, increased level of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in subchondral bone of DMM mice was reduced by iPTH treatment. Effects of TGFÃ signalling were reduced by endocytosis of the PTH type 1 receptorâtransforming growth factor Î² type 2 receptor (TÃRII) complex.

Have the authors checked the effect of iPTH treatment on angiogenesis? This is quite important for understanding the possible mechanism by which iPHT reduces density of CGRP positive nerve fibres in the subchondral bone as the authors have not provided a reliable explanation for this specific observation. This could be done with appropriate immunostaining of existing sections.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, the co-staining of the sensory nerve (CRGP) and vessel (endomucin), and corresponding quantification have been added (Figure 2 E-F and Figure 6D-F). PTH induces osteoclastic bone resorption in coupling osteoblast bone formation during bone remodeling, and increased osteoclasts secrete PDGF-BB for type H vessel formation in support of the bone remodeling. This is a dynamic activity. Accumulatively, the daily injection of PTH for 4 to 8 weeks increases bone formation with net decrease of both total vessel formation and nerve innervation as the porous subchondral bone was decreased with new bone formation. The discussion has been added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sensory nerves are characterized not only by CGRP but also by Substance P (SP). In particular, SP is a pronounced peripheral occurring neuropeptide often found colocalized together with CGRP. Have you stained for SP-positive nerve fibres in response to iPTH application? This might be quite interesting in the light that iPTH may not change nerve fibre density but shift neuropeptide production from CGRP to SP.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we performed immunofluorescence staining to label the SP positive nerve fiber, and the representative image and quantification were added in the revised manuscript (Figure 2C and D). We found that the density of SP was also reduced in the subchondral bone with iPTH treatment in OA. SP is secreted by sensory nerve fibers and share a similar distribution pattern with CRGP+ fibers. The decrease of CGRP<sup>+</sup> fibers and SP in the subchondral bone with iPTH treatment suggests SP is largely secreted from CGRP<sup>+</sup> fibers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A highlight of OA is osteophyte formation also in the DMM model. Osteophytes can be responsible for increased pain sensation and abnormal gait behaviour. Have you detected osteophytes and if yes, is there any effect of iPTH treatment on osteophyte formation or osteophyte structure?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your suggestion. We performed additional <sub>Î¼</sub>CT analysis specifically examining the size of osteophyte in OA mice. We did not observe significant difference in osteophyte formation between iPTH and vehicle in DMM mice, in consistence with published data âtreatment with Zol and PTH did not influence the size of the osteophyte formationâ in the OA model (Bagi et al., 2015). The quantification of volume of osteophyte in each group were add in the revised manuscript (Figure 2I-J, 6I-J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific points Results</p><p>Why is there no overlap of P2X3, PIEZO2 and CGRP positive neurons (Figure 2A)?</p></disp-quote><p>Likely, they were not good sequential sections. In the revised manuscript, we performed co-immunostaining of P2X3 with CGRP, and PIEZO2 with CGRP for nociceptors in the subchondral bone. The results showed CGRP+ nerve fibers partially overlap with P2X3+ or PIEZO2+ nerve fibers (Supplementary Figure 1A-B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not possible to decide for the reader whether the osteoids are located at the bone surface or not (Figure 3F). How did you specify this location?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, osteoids are normally located at the bone surface in WT mice. When osteoids are not on the bone surface as âosteoids isletsâ, indicating the uncoupled formation of pathological changes. In the revised manuscript, we performed sequential sections to confirm the isolation and provide quantification of âosteoid isletsâ in the subchondral bone cavity (Figure 3 F-H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion</p><p>It should be discussed why the density of CGRP positive fibres in the synovium remains unchanged after PTH treatment whereas in the subchondral bone their density decreases.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your suggestion. We have revised the Discussion section and added new information regarding the change of sensory nerve in the synovium and the subchondral bone in the revised manuscript.</p><p>In general, PTH attenuates OA by both maintaining microstructure of the subchondral bone and the protection of articular cartilage. As shown in our study, PTH effectively reduce density sensory nerve and vessel in the subchondral bone in DMM mice. The effect of PTH on OA pain is less due to direct protection of cartilage because cartilage is aneural and lack of vessel.</p><p>Furthermore, when systemic application of PTH was used for the repair of nonosteoarthritic, focal osteochondral defects in vivo, synovial membrane remained unaffected (Orth et al., 2013). In our study, we do not find a significant difference in nerve density between PTH and vehicle group (Figure 2 G and H). This finding indicates PTH does not have a direct effect on nociceptive innervation in the synovium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It should be also discussed why reduction of sensory nerve fibers in the subchondral bone only has a pain reducing effect. What is the possible contribution of the unchanged density of sensory nerve fibres in the synovium to the pain sensation?</p></disp-quote><p>It has been reported that sensory innervation promotes osteoblast bone formation and suppresses osteoclast bone resorption (Li et al., 2017 and Ishizuka et al., 2005). We have shown that sensory nerve regulates bone homeostasis and promote regeneration (Chen et al., 2019). The ablation of sensory innervation by genetic or pharmacological approaches consistently results in decreased bone mass in adult mice (Chen et al., 2019; Brazill et al., 2019 and Fukuda et al., 2013).</p><p>As discussed above, PTH induces osteoclastic bone resorption in coupling osteoblast bone formation during bone remodeling. Increased osteoclasts secrete PDGF-BB for type H vessel formation in support of the bone remodeling. This is a dynamic activity. Accumulatively, the daily injection of PTH for 4 to 8 weeks increases bone formation with net decrease of both total vessel formation and nerve innervation as the porous subchondral bone was decreased with new bone formation. Therefore, iPTH decreased sensory nerve and attenuated OA pain by a decrease of porous subchondral bone.</p><p>Sensory nerve in the synovium likely also contributes to pain in OA. However, we did not observe a significant effect of PTH on the nociceptive innervation in the synovium membrane. Experiments of Nestin Cre-PTH1R f/f mice suggest the beneficial effect of PTH primarily through its effect on subchondral bone.</p><p>As suggested, the discussion has been added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Materials and methods</p><p>Mice and in vivo treatment</p><p>Please specify nature of PTH and include information about origin.

How is this contradiction explained? Similarly, osteoarthritis is currently regarded as an inflammatory disorder. Do the findings of the current study support the inflammatory theory? If not, how are the mechanistic differences explained?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the constructive suggestions. Yes, iPTH has been reported to trigger the onset of OA in animal models, in which iPTH was administrated in the normal mice rather than OA animal models (Orth et al., 2014). iPTH stimulates new bone formation through osteoclastic bone remodeling. In normal mice with no joint OA, their subchondral bones have normal bone density and appropriate microstructure, which are in balance with articular cartilage. iPTH treatment generates additional new bone on top of normal subchondral bone density and structure in mice without OA. As a result, the changes of subchondral bone disrupt its balanced interplay with articular cartilage and leads to degeneration. In OA, the subchondral bone is pathologically changed to a porotic structure due to uncoupled remodeling. iPTH administration stimulates osteoclast remodeling generates new bone to improve its structure quality and its interaction with articular cartilage.</p><p>Aberrant mechanical stress induces uncoupled remodeling in the subchondral bone at onset of OA and subsequently generates a pathological microenvironment with significantly increased PGE2 level and other inflammatory factors when reaching a certain threshold (Rahmati et al., 2016). Importantly, subchondral bone has been shown as a source of inflammatory mediators and OA pain. The abnormal microarchitecture of subchondral bone in OA dramatically change the stress distribution on articular cartilage. Also, iPTH modulates the mechanical stress distribution on articular cartilage by improving microarchitecture of the subchondral bone to reduce production of pro-inflammatory factors. iPTH also has been shown to ameliorate both hyperplasia and fibrosis in osteoarthritis preceded by osteoporosis, and inhibit expression of pro-inflammatory modulators, including COX2, in synovial membrane (Luo et al., 2012). In the current study, we reveal that the therapeutic effect of iPTH on OA and pain by improving subchondral bone microenvironment through remodeling, which was blunted in the NestinCre::PTH1R<sup>f/f</sup> mice.</p><p>The Discussion and related references have been added in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
