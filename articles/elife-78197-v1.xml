They exist as homodimeric proteins, as in the case of activin A (ActA; InhβA/InhβA) or activin C (ActC; InhβC/InhβC), or as heterodimers, as with activin AC (ActAC; InhβA:InhβC). While the biological functions of ActA and activin B (ActB) have been well characterized, little is known about the biological functions of ActC or ActAC. One thought is that the InhβC chain functions to interfere with ActA production by forming less active ActAC heterodimers. Here, we assessed and characterized the signaling capacity of ligands containing the InhβC chain. ActC and ActAC activated SMAD2/3-dependent signaling via the type I receptor, activin receptor-like kinase 7 (ALK7). Relative to ActA and ActB, ActC exhibited lower affinity for the cognate activin type II receptors and was resistant to neutralization by the extracellular antagonist, follistatin. In mature murine adipocytes, which exhibit high ALK7 expression, ActC elicited a SMAD2/3 response similar to ActB, which can also signal via ALK7. Collectively, these results establish that ActC and ActAC are active ligands that exhibit a distinct signaling receptor and antagonist profile compared to other activins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transforming growth factor beta</kwd><kwd>Activin</kwd><kwd>Adipocyte</kwd><kwd>Signaling</kwd><kwd>activin-like kinase 7</kwd><kwd>Activin C</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM134923</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Thomas B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activin class member, activin C, is a canonical TGFβ family member that signals through the type I receptor, action receptor-like kinase 7 and is resistant to follistatin antagonism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The activins are multifunctional secreted proteins that play critical roles in growth, differentiation, and homeostasis in a wide variety of cell types. As part of the greater TGFβ family, the activins are dimeric in nature and built from two inhibinβ (Inhβ) chains of approximately 120 amino acids (e.g. activin A [ActA] is built from two InhβA chains) that are tethered by a disulfide bond. Members of the activin class include ActA, activin B (ActB), activin C (ActC), and activin E (ActE), and extend to include GDF8 (myostatin) and GDF11. The Inhβ chains share high sequence identity, such that InhβA and InhβB are 63% identical, with InhβC ~50% identical to both InhβA and InhβB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thompson et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to homodimer formation, several combinations of heterodimers have been observed, such as activin AB (ActAB) formed between InhβA and InhβB chains, as well as the heterodimer activin AC (ActAC) comprises InhβA and InhβC chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakamura et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mellor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mellor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler et al., 2005</xref>). While heterodimers can form, most studies have focused on the homodimeric forms of the ligands. In addition, due to their established biological roles, many studies have focused on characterizing the ligands ActA and ActB; however, few studies have characterized the ligands ActC or ActE, especially regarding their ability to signal.</p><p>The InhβC subunit was first identified from a human liver cDNA library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">H tten et al., 1995</xref>). Its biological role was initially unknown due to the absence of hepatic phenotypes in InhβC knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lau et al., 2000</xref>). Expression of InhβC is highest in the liver but has also been detected in reproductive tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gold et al., 2009</xref>). InhβC has been proposed to function as an ActA antagonist, as coexpression of InhβA and InhβC results in the formation of the heterodimer ActAC, which is a less active signaling molecule than ActA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mellor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gold et al., 2009</xref>). For example, ActAC is less potent than ActA in IH-1 myeloma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Olsen et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, InhβC expression in the presence of InhβA not only reduces ActA levels but also forms the less potent ligand ActAC. It has also been proposed that ActC directly antagonizes ActA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gold et al., 2009</xref>). The mechanism for this is thought to be the binding of a non-signaling ActC to the ActA receptors, acting as a competitive inhibitor. These two mechanisms are similar to how inhibin-α (Inhα) forms heterodimers with InhβA chains to form inhibin A, reducing ActA production, and by competitively blocking ActA receptor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Namwanje and Brown, 2016</xref>). The similarities were confirmed through studies which showed that in Inhα knockout mice, which develop female reproductive tumors and have abnormally high levels of ActA resulting in cachexia, the ActA levels can be suppressed by over-expression of InhβC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bi et al., 2016</xref>). While almost all studies have suggested an inhibitory role of InhβC, a recent study showed that ActC relieved chronic neuropathic pain in mice and rats, functioning similarly to TGFβ1, suggesting an agonistic role of the ActC ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>TGFβ ligands are processed from precursor proteins comprises a prodomain, which aids in proper folding and ligand maturation, and a C-terminal signaling domain, which forms the covalent dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The latter assemble receptor complexes on the cell surface containing a symmetrical positioning of two type I and two type II serine-threonine kinase receptors, which results in the activation of a SMAD signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). There are seven type I receptors in the family termed activin receptor-like kinases 1 through 7 (ALK1-7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Derynck and Budi, 2019</xref>). For ligands of the activin class, the type II receptors bind with high affinity (nM) to each individual chain in the dimer, with the low-affinity type I receptors binding at a composite interface formed by the two dimer chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goebel et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goebel et al., 2019b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Differences in type I receptor utilization by ActA, ActAC, and ActC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic displaying formation of activin A (ActA), activin AC (ActAC), and activin C (ActC) from dimerization of inhibinβA (blue) and inhibinβC subunits (green).

In general, each member signals through ALK4, whereas GDF8 and GDF11 extend specificity to ALK5 and ActB to ALK7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hinck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Structural and biochemical studies have made strides in illuminating the determinants of specificity between the activins and the type I receptors, providing context for the different biological roles of each activin member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goebel et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goebel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sako et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Groppe et al., 2008</xref>). ALK4 and ALK5 expression is relatively widespread, while ALK7 is primarily expressed in the adipose and reproductive tissues, and also in the brain and pancreatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bondestam et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlsson et al., 2009</xref>). While ALK7-specific signaling has been linked to cancer cell apoptosis, its role in adipose tissue is more well-studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Michael et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li and Ventura, 2019</xref>). ActB signaling via ALK7 in adipose tissue suppresses lipolysis and downregulates adrenergic receptors, facilitating fat accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yogosawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, loss of signaling in ALK7 knockout mice renders the animals resistant to diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yogosawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the other activin ligands, limited information is available for the signaling capacity of ActC and whether the homodimer can actually activate SMAD molecules. One hypothesis is that ActC is a non-signaling molecule and simply a non-functional byproduct of expressing InhβC in the presence of InhβA. Given this uncertainty, we sought to characterize the signaling capacity of ActC across the panel TGFβ type I receptors. We demonstrate that homodimeric ActC can act as a potent activator of SMAD2/3 and does so with high specificity via the type I receptor, ALK7. Additionally, unlike the rest of the activin class, ActC has a much lower affinity for the type II receptors, ActRIIA and ActRIIB. Intriguingly, ActC is not antagonized by follistatin, which potently neutralizes ActA, ActB, GDF8, and GDF11. Finally, we demonstrate that ActC can activate SMAD2/3 signaling similarly to ActB in mature adipocytes in an ALK7-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activin C induces SMAD2/3 phosphorylation through ALK7</title><p>Cell-based reporter assays have long been used to measure SMAD activation. To investigate ActC’s ability to induce canonical SMAD2/3 signaling like other activins, we performed luciferase reporter assays in an activin-responsive HEK293T cell line stably transfected with (CAGA)<sub>12</sub>-luciferase (luc) plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goebel et al., 2022</xref>). Purified recombinant activin ligands (ActA, ActAC, ActC, and ActB) were titrated to generate EC50 curves. In this format, ActA stimulated a response at a lower ligand concentration than either ActAC or ActB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left panel). In contrast, ActC did not induce reporter activity up to concentrations of 5 nM. Of note, ActAC showed about half of the activity of ActA, consistent with ActAC being less potent than ActA but more potent than ActC. Neither ActAC nor ActC activated a SMAD1/5/8-dependent reporter in an osteoblast cell line, in contrast to the robust response observed with BMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right panel).</p><p>Though the above data show that ActC does not signal like other activin ligands, HEK293 cells endogenously express only two of the three SMAD2/3 type I receptors, ALK4, and ALK5, with little to no expression of ALK7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bu et al., 2018</xref>). To address this limitation, we applied a heterologous system developed to interrogate specific signaling from individual type I receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goebel et al., 2019a</xref>). Here, a point mutation was introduced into each type I receptor (ALK4 S282T [ALK4<sub>st</sub>], ALK5 S278T [ALK5<sub>st</sub>], or ALK7 S270T [ALK7<sub>st</sub>]) that rendered it resistant to the small molecule kinase inhibitor, SB-431542, while maintaining ligand-induced activation. HEK293T (CAGA)<sub>12</sub>-luc reporter cells were transiently transfected with the modified receptors, then co-treated with the indicated ligands and SB-431542 to suppress signaling from endogenous receptors. In the presence of ALK4<sub>st</sub>, ActA, ActAC, and ActB, but not ActC, stimulated reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In ALK5<sub>st</sub>-transfected cells, none of the activins stimulated reporter activity, while GDF11, a known ALK5 ligand, served as a positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As expected, ActB and, to a much lesser extent, ActA induced reporter activation when ALK7<sub>st</sub> was transfected into the HEK293T (CAGA)<sub>12</sub>-luc reporter cells. Strikingly and unexpectedly, ActAC and ActC activated (CAGA)<sub>12</sub>-luc activity in the presence of ALK7<sub>st</sub> to a similar extent as ActB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>These data suggested that ActC can signal specifically through ALK7. To further validate these results, we utilized an antibody that was developed to specifically bind and neutralize ligand signaling through ALK7. Following treatment with the anti-ALK7 antibody, ActB signaling via ALK7st was significantly reduced while ActC signaling was nearly abrogated completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The specificity of the antibody for ALK7 was confirmed as ActA signaling via ALK4<sub>st</sub> was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Taken together, these data show that the activin ligands have differential type I specificities. ActA signals predominantly through ALK4; ActB and ActAC signal through ALK4 and ALK7; while ActC signals exclusively through ALK7.</p><p>Since ActC does not signal through ALK4, we wanted to test whether or not ActC could act as an antagonist of ActA signaling, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gold et al., 2009</xref>). Along these lines, titration of ActC against constant ActA resulted in no significant reduction in signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results show that extracellular ActC does not antagonize ActA signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Activin C and activin AC interact with and require activin type II receptors to signal</title><p>In addition to the type I receptors, TGFβ family ligands must bind type II receptors to generate intracellular signals. Ligands of the activin class generally bind the type II receptors ActRIIA and ActRIIB with high affinity (pM-nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goebel et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sako et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pearsall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harrison et al., 2006</xref>). Previous studies showed that ActAC binds ActRIIB with lower affinity than ActA, suggesting that the InhβC chain has a diminished type II interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gold et al., 2013</xref>). Given the new finding that ActC is a signaling molecule, we sought to determine and compare the binding affinities of ActA, ActAC, and ActC to ActRIIA, and ActRIIB using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In this experiment, type II receptor extracellular domains (ECDs) fused to an antibody Fc fragment were captured using a protein A biosensor chip, while ActA, ActAC, or ActC were titrated as the analyte. For both ActRIIA-Fc and ActRIIB-Fc, binding affinity was highest for ActA (equilibrium constant [apparent K<sub>D</sub>] of 22 pM and 8.1 pM, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, top row). ActAC also bound ActRIIA and ActRIIB with high affinity, although slightly weaker than ActA (150 pM and 90 pM, respectively), suggesting that the InhβC chain diminishes the overall type II affinity of the dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, middle row). ActC binding to ActRIIA and ActRIIB was much weaker, with a significantly faster dissociation rate than either ActA or ActAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, bottom row). While ActA had no apparent preference for one type II receptor, consistent with previous studies, ActC had a higher affinity for ActRIIA than ActRIIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goebel et al., 2019a</xref>).

Both ActA and ActAC, but not ActC, formed a stable complex when incubated with either ActRIIA or ActRIIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We therefore tested binding of the heterodimeric ActRIIB-ALK7-Fc to ActA, ActAC, and ActC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). ActA bound ActRIIB-ALK7-Fc (296 pM) with sevenfold lower affinity than ActRIIB-Fc (42 pM), indicating ALK7 did not contribute to binding, consistent with ActA not signaling via ALK7. Interestingly, significant binding was observed for both ActC (2 nM) and ActAC (51 pM) to ActRIIB-ALK7. While for ActAC, binding to ActRIIB-ALK7-Fc was slightly higher than binding to ActRIIB-Fc (64 pM), a dramatic difference was observed for ActC where binding was increased 40-fold over ActRIIB-Fc alone. Similar studies were performed with ActRIIB-ALK4-Fc. As expected ActA bound with high affinity to ActRIIB-ALK4-Fc while ActAC had a much weaker interaction (457 pM), and ActC failed to bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

An antibody that simultaneously blocks both ActRIIA and ActRIIB more potently inhibited signaling of each activin ligand than the single-target antibodies, indicating that ActRIIA and ActRIIB were redundant. ActAC signaling in the untransfected/untreated CAGA-luc cells was also inhibited by type II receptor neutralization in a similar manner to ActA and ActB. Again, ActC did not signal under these assay conditions unless ALK7<sub>st</sub> was added. Here, both ActAC and ActB signaling was readily inhibited by type II receptor blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). ActC signaling was significantly reduced when ActRIIA was blocked and to a lesser extent with blocking ActRIIB.

In this study, we identified ActC as a bona fide signaling ligand with distinct molecular properties from other activin class ligands.</p><p>ActC signals through ALK7, whereas ActAC uses both ALK4 and ALK7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, ligands that contain an InhβC subunit can bind and act through ALK7. This is similar to what was previously described for ligands containing an InhβB subunit, like ActB and ActAB. In contrast, ActA does not signal through ALK7. Interestingly, the heterodimer ActAC was more potent than ActC, which has similarly been reported for other heterodimers in the family, such as BMP2/4 and BMP2/7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aono et al., 1995</xref>).

Initial studies implicated the wrist region, including the prehelix loop, as a major contributor towards type I receptor specificity, as swapping this region could alter type I receptor specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cash et al., 2009</xref>). More recent studies have identified residues in the fingertip region of the ligand as also have a major role in type I receptor specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goebel et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aykul et al., 2020</xref>). Given the low-affinity nature of the type I receptors for ligands across the activin family, the current thought is that subtle differences at the type I: ligand interface dictate receptor specificity. Interestingly, fingertip residues that are important for ActA and GDF11 binding to type I receptors are divergent in ActC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) and could account for the latter’s lack of signaling through ALK4. Most notably, a recent crystal structure of ActA in complex with ALK4 shows that D406 of ActA forms a hydrogen bond with the mainchain of ALK4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). The corresponding residue is an arginine in ActC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goebel et al., 2022</xref>). On the receptor side, the β4-β5 loop is important for ligand recognition and is three residues shorter in ALK7 than in ALK4 and ALK5, possibly to accommodate the larger arginine residue, which, in models, extends toward this loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Certainly, structures of ALK7 in complex with ActC or other ligands will help determine how specificity for ALK7 is acquired. Regardless, it seems that differences in the ligand fingertip and/or prehelix loop, coupled with differences in the receptor β4-β5 loop, dictate type I receptor specificity in the activin class.</p><p>In general, activin class ligands bind activin type II receptors with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goebel et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goebel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harrison et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thompson et al., 2003</xref>). Conversely, ActC exhibits weak binding to both ActRIIA and ActRIIB. ActAC binds the type II receptors but with reduced affinity compared to ActA. Thus, the InhβC subunit appears to reduce affinity for the activin type II receptors. Nevertheless, the type II receptors are required for ActC signaling, as the ligand’s activity was abrogated by activin type II receptor neutralizing antibodies and inhibin A. Unlike the other members of the activin class, ActC binds both type I and type II receptors with low affinity but is still able to signal. One possible explanation is avidity from binding contribution both the type I and type II receptors are needed for ActC to signal. This is supported by SPR studies with the heteroreceptor combination of ALK7-ActRIIB, which has a higher affinity for ActC than either receptor alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It has been suggested that exogenous ActC can directly antagonize ActA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gold et al., 2009</xref>) whereby ActC might bind type II receptors but not signal functioning as a competitive inhibitor to ActA. Our data challenges this idea as exogenous ActC does not antagonize ActA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), likely due to lack of ALK4 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and weak binding to ActRIIA, ActRIIB, and the fusion ActRIIB-ALK4-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, the main mechanism of ActC antagonism of ActA is likely through heterodimer formation, where the ActAC ligand signals less potently through ALK4, while gaining the ability to signal through ALK7, when present.</p><p>Another unexpected characteristic of ActC is its interaction or lack thereof with the extracellular antagonists, the follistatins. Given ActC’s structural similarity to other activin class members, it was unexpected that neither Fst-288 nor Fstl3 inhibited ActC. Similarly, suppression of ActAC signaling was less significant compared to the other activin ligands, ActA and ActB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This indicates that the InhβC chain limits follistatin binding and confers resistance to antagonism. The biological implications of follistatin resistance will need to be further explored, but it is tempting to speculate that the presence of follistatin would interfere with ligands that signal through ALK4, providing a permissive environment for the lower affinity ActC to bind type II receptors and signal via ALK7. Additionally, the presence of follistatin, while limiting ActA and ActB signaling, would still permit ActAC signaling via ALK4.</p><p>Having low affinity for the type II receptors and resistance to follistatin distinguishes ActC from the other members of the activin class and raises the question as to what confers differences in ligand properties, especially given their &gt; 50% sequence identity. Comparison across the activins revealed conservation of the shared type II/follistatin binding surface except for a single residue, centrally located in the interface. While most activins have an alanine at this position, InhβC contains a glutamine akin to the glutamate within the TGF-β’s (TGF-β 1–3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Converting this residue to an alanine in ActC resulted in a ligand with a higher affinity for ActRIIA and increased sensitivity to follistatin. While not the only molecular difference, it appears that InhβC has evolved a single substitution centrally located in a major binding epitope compared to other activin class members that suppresses its interaction with follistatin and type II receptors. Comparison across different species shows this deviation is conserved in mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, fish are divergent and possess the alanine version of InhβC similar to InhβA and InhβB. This bifurcation in conservation suggests differentially evolved activin ligands exist in the two taxa and might provide clues as to the biological function of ActC in different species.</p><p>Physiological roles for ActC and ActAC have not yet been established. However, given the ability of the ligands to signal via ALK7, we turned our attention to adipocytes. Human adipose tissue is a major site of both ActB and ALK7 expression, where the pair induces pro-obesity signaling outcomes, such as catecholamine resistance or inhibition of lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ibáñez, 2021</xref>). In this study, we show that ActC regulates adipocyte differentiation differently than ActA or ActB. While both ActA and ActB exhibit potent inhibitory effects in cultured adipocytes, ActC does not. This difference is explained, in part, by the ability of ActA and ActB, but not ActC, to signal via ALK4, which is present in pre-adipocytes and throughout their maturation and differentiation. In contrast, ActC can signal in adipose tissue only once ALK7 is expressed, which occurs in the later stages of adipocyte differentiation. In this context, ActC negatively regulates lipase expression, lipid content, and elicits a SMAD2 response similar to that of ActB. In addition to ActB and ActC, the TGFβ ligand, GDF3, can also signal through ALK7. GDF3 signaling is supported by the co-receptor Cripto and is implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis and adipocyte function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, taken together, it appears that several TGF-βligands have evolved the ability to signal in adipocytes depending on the receptor/co-receptor profile.</p><p>Given that ActC expression and secretion is highest within the liver, a tissue with low ALK7 expression, it is possible that ActC acts as a hepatokine functioning systemically in fat regulation (; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmitt et al., 1996</xref>). Unlike ActB, ActC is not antagonized by follistatin and may therefore serve as an uninhibited, basal signal in the face of variable follistatin expression, such as during thermogenesis in adipocytes following cold exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braga et al., 2014</xref>). Another possible role might be during liver regeneration, as ActAC and ActC have been observed in serum, coinciding with a surge of follistatin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gold et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Another member of the activin class, ActE, is expressed highest in the liver and has been implicated as a hepatokine with a role in energy homeostasis; however, whether ActE can signal and, if so, through which receptors, has yet to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sugiyama et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, ActE has a glutamine in position 267, similar to ActC, and a leucine in position 265, replacing the conserved isoleucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These amino acid differences likely reduce ActE’s affinity for the type II receptors and follistatin, similar to ActC. Given these similarities, it is possible that there is functional overlap between ActC and ActE, possibly in the liver-adipose signaling axis.</p><p>Throughout the body, there are a variety of activins with differential receptor and antagonist binding, yielding a variety of potential signaling capacities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our results indicate that ActC can act as a canonical TGFβ ligand, transducing SMAD2/3 responses similar to ActA and ActB while avoiding inhibition through the follistatin family of antagonists. This observation challenges current thinking that ActC acts solely as an activin antagonist. Different than ActB, which can signal through both ALK4 and ALK7, ActC is specific for ALK7 and shows a preference for the type II receptor ActRIIA. Future studies will need to address the different biological roles of ActC and ActAC signaling through ALK7, with an initial focus on adipose tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>ActRIIA and ActRIIB</title><p>The extracellular domains of human ActRIIA (residues 1–134) and rat ActRIIB (residues 1–120) were produced as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goebel et al., 2019a</xref>).

In another set of experiments, differentiated-SVF cells were treated with ActA, ActB, or ActC (2 nM) for 1hr ± anti-ALK7 antibody (30 µg/ml). Concentrations were selected based on in vitro cell-based assays. At the end of the treatments, cells were lysed using RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors and western analysis was performed using anti-pSMAD2 (Cell Signaling, 138D4, Danvers, MA) or anti-SMAD2/3 antibodies (Millipore, 07–408, Burlington, MA). 3T3-L1 cells were purchased from ATCC and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Adipocyte RNA extraction</title><p>Cells were collected in TRIzol and RNA was extracted following the manufacturer’s protocol (Zymo Research). Total RNA from SVF or 3T3-L1 adipocyte-differentiated cells (at day 10 of differentiation) (200 ng) was reverse transcribed using (MMLV) reverse transcriptase following the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Expression of genes encoding the <italic>Pparg2</italic>, <italic>Cebpa</italic>, and <italic>Pnpla2</italic> was analyzed in duplicate qPCR reactions using EvaGreen Master mix (ABMMmix-S-XL; Diamed) on a Corbett Rotorgene 6000 instrument (Corbett Life Science, Mortlake, NSW, Australia). Gene expression was determined relative to the housekeeping gene <italic>Rpl19</italic> using the 2-ΔΔCt method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Livak and Schmittgen, 2001</xref>). Primer sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Adipocyte images and Oil Red O staining</title><p>Before and after day 10 of differentiation, adipocyte images were acquired with an Axiocam 506 mono camera (Zeiss, White Plains, NY) using ZEN 2.3 pro (Zeiss) software. For Oil Red O (ORO) staining, cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 10% formalin buffered solution for 10 min. After fixation, cells were washed in 60% isopropanol and stained in an ORO solution (2:3 v/v H<sub>2</sub>O: isopropanol, containing 0.5% ORO, Sigma O0625) for 1 hr. After staining, cells were washed in PBS and dye from lipid droplets was extracted by adding pure isopropanol for 10 min in a rotor shaker. Dye per well was quantified by absorbance at 500 nm in EZ Read 2000 microplate reader (Biochrom, Holliston, MA). After washing with PBS, cells were digested using a 0.25% Trypsin solution in PBS-EDTA for 24 hr at 37°C. DNA was quantified using a NanoDrop, and cell lipid content was normalized by the corresponding cell DNA content per well.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"

The authors show that Activin C stimulates SMAD2/3 signaling via the type I receptor ALK7. However, Activin C binds the cognate Activin type II receptor with a lower affinity than Activin A or Activin B and is resistant to the extracellular antagonist Follistatin. Collectively, these data clarify the biological activity of Activin C and provide an important foundation for further research on Activin signaling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78197.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Roger J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0464eyp60</institution-id><institution>University of Massachusetts Medical School</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Hinck</surname><given-names>Andrew P</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.16.484571">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.16.484571v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew P Hinck (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, there are no major technical concerns regarding the results the authors report, though a few points are listed below:</p><p>1. Since the authors have fit their cell-based reporter data to dose response curves, they should report the fitted EC50 values (and errors), and other parameters such as slope, in a supplementary data table.</p><p>2. Unlike efforts that were made to understand and experimentally evaluate the type II receptor binding preferences of ActC (compared to ActA and ActB), no experimental effort was made to understand and evaluate the underlying basis of ActC's unique type I receptor binding preference; in the absence of this (which is understandable, given the much greater complexity compared to the situation with type II receptor binding), it would nonetheless be helpful for the readers if the authors could add a supplementary figure showing the main interactions between activin class ligands and their type I receptors and as best as possible compare the corresponding positions to those in Alk7 and ActC.</p><p>3. It is stated in the Discussion, that ActC may bind to the type I and type II receptors cooperatively; however, it is unclear what specifically is meant by this; are they suggesting that there is positive allostery with one receptor enhancing the binding affinity of the other (which would be unique to this type I-type II receptor pair in the TGFbeta family) or are they suggesting avidity effects are at play and an enhanced affinity is observed due to the simultaneous binding of both type I and type II receptors at non-overlapping (and non-interacting sites) (which would not be unique to this type I-type II receptor pair in the TGFbeta family)?</p><p>As evidence for &quot;cooperatively, they cite the higher affinity of the Alk7-ActRIIB heterodimer for ActC compared to either receptor alone; in my mind, the simplest explanation for this is effects arising from avidity, not positive allostery; to conclude positive allostery would require performing an experiment in which the binding of one of the receptors is measured in the absence and presence of a saturating concentration of the other receptor. In light of the potential confusion surrounding this point, the authors should clarify what they mean by cooperativity.</p><p>4. In order to determine to what extent ActC IAP recapitulates ActRII binding affinity (compared to ActA), the authors should fit the data shown in Figure 5F and report the values in Supplementary Table 1; they should also mention this value in the Results section of the text.</p><p>5. There are two typos in the Introduction – on line 41, 'heterodimers have can form&quot; is non-sensical on line 53 a reference is missing.</p><p>6.

To clarify, we believe that the ActC’s receptor binding might be driven by avidity given our data with the ALK7-ActRIIB heterodimer.
