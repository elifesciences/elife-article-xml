Indeed, haploinsufficiency of lactate transporter monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) in mice reportedly promotes resistance to hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Here, we used adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to deliver thyroxin binding globulin (TBG)-Cre or lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (Lrat)-Cre to MCT1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice on a choline-deficient, high-fat NASH diet to deplete hepatocyte or stellate cell MCT1, respectively. Stellate cell MCT1KO (AAV-Lrat-Cre) attenuated liver type 1 collagen protein expression and caused a downward trend in trichrome staining. MCT1 depletion in cultured human LX2 stellate cells also diminished collagen 1 protein expression. Tetra-ethylenglycol-cholesterol (Chol)-conjugated siRNAs, which enter all hepatic cell types, and hepatocyte-selective tri-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl galactosamine (GN)-conjugated siRNAs were then used to evaluate MCT1 function in a genetically obese NASH mouse model. MCT1 silencing by Chol-siRNA decreased liver collagen 1 levels, while hepatocyte-selective MCT1 depletion by AAV-TBG-Cre or by GN-siRNA unexpectedly increased collagen 1 and total fibrosis without effect on triglyceride accumulation. These findings demonstrate that stellate cell lactate transporter MCT1 significantly contributes to liver fibrosis through increased collagen 1 protein expression in vitro and in vivo, while hepatocyte MCT1 appears not to be an attractive therapeutic target for NASH.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NASH</kwd><kwd>NAFLD</kwd><kwd>stellate cells</kwd><kwd>liver fibrosis</kwd><kwd>RNAi therapeutics</kwd><kwd>AAV</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK116056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Min</surname><given-names>Kyounghee</given-names></name><name><surname>Yenilmez</surname><given-names>Batuhan</given-names></name><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Elleby</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Lifshitz</surname><given-names>Lawrence M</given-names></name><name><surname>Raymond</surname><given-names>Naideline</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsagkaraki</surname><given-names>Emmanouela</given-names></name><name><surname>Harney</surname><given-names>Shauna M</given-names></name><name><surname>DiMarzio</surname><given-names>Chloe</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name><name><surname>Czech</surname><given-names>Michael P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK103047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Min</surname><given-names>Kyounghee</given-names></name><name><surname>Yenilmez</surname><given-names>Batuhan</given-names></name><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Elleby</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Lifshitz</surname><given-names>Lawrence M</given-names></name><name><surname>Raymond</surname><given-names>Naideline</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsagkaraki</surname><given-names>Emmanouela</given-names></name><name><surname>Harney</surname><given-names>Shauna M</given-names></name><name><surname>DiMarzio</surname><given-names>Chloe</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name><name><surname>Czech</surname><given-names>Michael P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK030898</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Min</surname><given-names>Kyounghee</given-names></name><name><surname>Yenilmez</surname><given-names>Batuhan</given-names></name><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Elleby</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Lifshitz</surname><given-names>Lawrence M</given-names></name><name><surname>Raymond</surname><given-names>Naideline</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsagkaraki</surname><given-names>Emmanouela</given-names></name><name><surname>Harney</surname><given-names>Shauna M</given-names></name><name><surname>DiMarzio</surname><given-names>Chloe</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name><name><surname>Czech</surname><given-names>Michael P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stellate cell lactate transporter MCT1 significantly contributes to liver fibrosis through increased collagen 1 protein expression in vitro and in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease, afflicting over a quarter of the world’s population. It describes a spectrum of liver diseases ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Younossi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Estes et al., 2018</xref>). Steatosis is considered relatively benign as lifestyle modifications can reverse fatty liver to a healthy condition. On the other hand, NASH is characterized by severe steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Severe fibrotic stages of NASH can develop into permanent liver damage, and the disease can progress to cirrhosis and hepatoma. Currently, NASH is a leading cause for liver transplantation, and there is no FDA-approved therapeutic for NASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Estes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diehl and Day, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedman et al., 2018</xref>). Since NASH is closely associated with the hallmarks of type 2 diabetes and obesity, including chronic overnutrition, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia, it is likely that substrate overload to the liver contributes to its cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedman et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, NAFLD and NASH patients display hyperactive liver tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux due to an overabundance of upstream metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">García-Ruiz and Fernández-Checa, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sunny et al., 2017</xref>). These findings suggest that lowering substrate influx to the liver is a promising strategy to prevent and possibly alleviate steatosis and NASH.</p><p>Human subjects with type 2 diabetes and obesity reportedly have increased plasma lactate levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lovejoy et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawford et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Juraschek et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Juraschek et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DiGirolamo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sabater et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jansson et al., 1994</xref>). Lactate is produced and released into the circulation when cellular glycolytic flux surpasses mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Once considered to be simply a metabolic waste product, lactate is now recognized as a primary fuel for the TCA cycle in liver and thus an essential energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rabinowitz and Enerbäck, 2020</xref>). Additionally, it is a critical regulator that contributes to whole-body energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Under physiological conditions, cellular lactate levels are tightly controlled by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). MCTs are members of the solute carrier 16A (SLC16A) family, which are proton-coupled transmembrane protein transporters. Among 14 MCT isoforms, only MCTs 1–4 have been shown to transport monocarboxylate molecules such as lactate, pyruvate, short-chain fatty acids, and ketone bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Felmlee et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, MCT1 is denoted as a primary lactate transporter as it is the most widely distributed MCT isoform in various metabolic tissues and has a high affinity for lactate, maintaining basal cellular homeostasis according to transmembrane lactate gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halestrap, 2013</xref>). Reportedly, MCT1 haploinsufficiency in mice reduces MCT1 protein levels to nearly half in major metabolic tissues such as liver, brain, and white adipose tissues, and these mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity and liver steatosis and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lengacher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carneiro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hadjihambi et al., 2023</xref>). The role of MCT1 in hypothalamus and adipose tissues in these phenotypes was ruled out, as selective MCT1 depletion in those tissues either increased food intake and body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elizondo-Vega et al., 2016</xref>) or enhanced systemic inflammation and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the question of which tissue or tissues are responsible for the phenotype of whole-body MCT1 haploinsufficiency is not solved.</p><p>The above considerations suggest the possibility that MCT1KO in one or more liver cell types may explain the effects of MCT1 haploinsufficiency in mice. Since hepatocytes account for the majority of liver cells and have high rates of lipogenesis and triglyceride (TG) accumulation, lactate levels governed by hepatocyte MCT1 could be involved in regulating steatosis. On the other hand, while hepatic stellate cells account for only 5–10% of the hepatic cell population, they are the major cell type contributing to hepatic fibrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wake, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mederacke et al., 2013</xref>). Fate tracing studies have revealed that 82–96% of myofibroblasts are derived from hepatic stellate cells, which are liver-specific pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mederacke et al., 2013</xref>). During NASH progression, multiple liver injury signals stimulate the transition of vitamin A-storing quiescent hepatic stellate cells into fibrogenic, proliferative myofibroblasts that produce and secrete collagen fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trautwein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Puche et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsuchida and Friedman, 2017</xref>). As a result, healthy hepatic parenchyma is replaced with a collagen-rich extracellular matrix, turning the liver into a hardened and scarred tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mehal et al., 2011</xref>). In general, major organ fibrosis is directly correlated with morbidity and mortality, contributing up to 45% of deaths in developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wynn, 2008</xref>). Thus, targeting activated hepatic stellate cells has become a major strategy in NASH therapeutics development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsuchida and Friedman, 2017</xref>). However, the role of MCT1 in hepatic stellate cells activation or fibrogenesis has not been investigated.</p><p>The aim of the present studies was to investigate the role of hepatic lactate transport via MCT1 in lipid metabolism and fibrogenesis in NASH, and to determine its potential suitability as a therapeutic target. Two key unanswered questions were of particular interest: (1) is it hepatocyte-specific MCT1 depletion that protects mice with MCT1 haploinsufficiency from liver lactate overload and NAFLD and (2) does liver stellate cell MCT1 promote hepatic fibrogenesis that occurs in NASH? We tested the possible enhancement of lipogenesis and fat accumulation via MCT1 function specifically in hepatocytes using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated thyroxin binding globulin (TBG)-Cre MCT1KO in MCT1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, and in other experiments by silencing hepatocyte MCT1 with tri-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl galactosamine (GN)-conjugated siRNA. These experiments showed that hepatocyte MCT1 loss decreased expression of enzymes in the de novo lipogenesis (DNL) pathway, but did not diminish overall steatosis. Surprisingly, hepatocyte MCT1KO increased liver fibrosis in two mouse models of NASH. In contrast, hepatic stellate cell-selective MCT1KO, achieved by injection of AAV9-lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (Lrat)-Cre into MCT1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, did attenuate collagen production and fibrosis.

To determine which hepatic cell type derived the opposite fibrotic phenotypes of MCT1, we first hypothesized that GN-MCT1-siRNA activates M2 pro-fibrogenic macrophage more than Chol-MCT1-siRNA does. Since Zhang et al. have demonstrated that histone lactylation via lactyl-CoA intermediate drives the shift of M1 macrophages into pro-fibrogenic M2-like macrophage polarization upon bacterial exposure, the epigenetic contribution of lactate via lactylation has started to be appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaffney et al., 2020</xref>).

Interestingly, another report claims targeting MCT1-mediated lactate flux attenuates pulmonary fibrosis by preventing macrophage profibrotic polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">He et al., 2023</xref>). These findings suggest the possibility that reduced histone lactylation in macrophages, indirectly affected by MCT1 depletion in the stellate cells, prevents fibrogenesis and inhibits pro-fibrogenic M2 macrophage polarization. Thus, representative M1 pro-inflammatory macrophage and M2 pro-fibrogenic macrophage markers were monitored in our experiments. However, GN-MCT1-siRNA treatment caused comparable M1/M2 macrophage activation levels to Chol-MCT1-siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

Furthermore, we propose that in the case of MCT1 depletion in hepatocytes, lactate present in the hepatic blood flow that has not been taken up by hepatocytes is redirected to other hepatic cell types, including hepatic stellate cells. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether lactate itself acts as a fibrogenic inducer in cultured LX2 cells treated with increasing doses of sodium lactate (NaLac: 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 mM) for 48 hr and then harvested. However, no increase in collagen mRNA or protein levels upon lactate treatment was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>), suggesting that lactate itself may not be a fibrogenic inducer. We then investigated whether lactate assists in collagen production in the presence of other potent fibrogenic inducers, such as TGF-β1. LX2 cells were treated with three different conditions for 48 hr: (1) TGF-β1 only, (2) TGF-β1 with sodium pyruvate (NaPyr: 1 mM), and (3) TGF-β1 with the combination of sodium pyruvate (1 mM) and sodium lactate (10 mM) matched to the physiological lactate:pyruvate (L:P) ratio. Interestingly, the combination treatment of sodium pyruvate (1 mM) and sodium lactate (10 mM) significantly enhanced both mRNA and protein expressions of collagen 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–E</xref>). As the cells were grown in the high glucose (25 mM) DMEM condition, we further tested if MCT1 depletion can inhibit both endogenous and exogenous lactate-mediated collagen 1 production. MCT1 depletion in LX2 cells prevented TGF-β1-stimulated collagen 1 production in both conditions where lactate was solely generated by endogenous glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>) and where exogenous lactate was supplied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>).

As a result, we observed that MCT1-siRNA significantly decreased the phosphorylated SMAD3 (pSMAD3) protein level and the pSMAD3/SMAD3 ratio in the absence of TGF-β1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), implying the potential regulatory effect of MCT1 on the TGF-β1-SMAD3 axis. Interestingly, however, in the presence of TGF-β1 pretreatment, the contribution of pSMAD on MCT1’s inhibitory effect on collagen 1 production was limited. While MCT1 depletion inhibited collagen production, the significant decrease of pSMAD3/SMAD ratio was only shown upon low concentrations of TGF-β1 (0, 1, 2.5 ng/ml) pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). This data suggests that both SMAD3-dependent and independent MCT1 regulation may be relevant to the TGF-β1-induced collagen production in which MAPK, NF-kB, and PI3K are potential mediators in SMAD3-independent TGF-β1 pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Derynck and Zhang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). However, the mechanism of these pathways and biological consequences are still not fully understood.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>MCT1 depletion enhanced fibrogenic gene expression levels in human hepatoma HepG2 cells</title><p>The direct effect of MCT1 depletion in HepG2 hepatocytes was also investigated by transfection with either NTC-siRNA or MCT1-siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>).

However, HepG2-derived conditioned media-treated LX2 cells did not change the expression of fibrogenic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These data are consistent with the idea that enhanced fibrogenesis due to GN-MCT1-siRNA treatment of mice may be a direct effect of hepatocyte MCT1 depletion. However, hepatic stellate cells are thought to be the primary producers of collagen, contributing 10–20 times more collagen than hepatocytes or endothelial cells, respectively, in rodent systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friedman et al., 1985</xref>). Thus, this issue will require additional work to fully understand the basis for the effect of GN-MCT1-siRNA treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The major finding of this study is that MCT1 function in hepatic stellate cells promotes collagen 1 expression, as MCT1 depletion in this cell type, either in vitro in cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or in vivo in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), attenuates fibrotic collagen 1 protein production. We also provided evidence that lactate may enhance TGF-β1-induced collagen production via MCT1 in studies in cultured LX2 cells. The finding in mice was made by generating novel AAV9-Lrat-Cre constructs that can be injected into MCT1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice to elicit stellate cell-selective MCT1 depletion, as verified by isolation and <italic>Slc16a1/Mct1</italic> mRNA analysis in liver cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Previous use of Lrat-Cre for germline transmission had validated constitutive gene KO selectively in hepatic stellate cells in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mederacke et al., 2013</xref>), while our AAV-Lrat-Cre construct allows inducible gene KO, eliminating time-demanding mouse crossing and breeding. Surprisingly, MCT1KO in hepatocytes, both in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B</xref>), evoked the opposite effect: a robust upregulation of collagen 1 expression and fibrosis. This may be an effect of increased local lactate to enhance stellate cell collagen production, but may also be in part a cell-autonomous effect in hepatocytes, as we observed increased collagen 1 expression in Hep2G cells upon silencing <italic>SLC16A1/MCT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). The hepatocyte-selective MCT1KO caused increased total fibrosis, evidenced by trichrome staining of liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>), while the stellate cell MCT1KO was associated with a trend toward diminished trichrome staining that did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). Nonetheless, taken together, our data suggest that lactate flux via MCT1 in hepatic stellate cells strongly promotes collagen 1 translation or inhibits protein turnover rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of stellate cell MCT1KO was observed only at the collagen 1 protein level, while the hepatocyte MCT1KO affected both collagen mRNA and protein. The exact mechanism needs to be further investigated, but one possibility is that increased import of lactate into hepatic stellate cells serves as a precursor for glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline synthesis, as suggested in other systems such as cancer or pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pérez-Escuredo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamanaka et al., 2019</xref>). This could potentially explain why MCT1 depletion in stellate cells has a greater translational effect on collagen expression rather than transcriptional regulation.</p><p>Strong support for the above conclusions was obtained in an alternative experimental model of NASH—genetically obese ob/ob mice on a GAN diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yenilmez et al., 2022</xref>). In these experiments we employed chemically stabilized siRNA, taking advantage of RNA modifications 2-fluoro, 2-<italic>O</italic>-methyl ribose, and phosphorothioate backbone replacement to block siRNA degradation and immune responses as well as enhance in vivo delivery effectiveness and silencing longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behlke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khvorova and Watts, 2017</xref>). Conjugation of such siRNA compounds with GN promotes binding to the asialoglycoprotein receptor that is primarily expressed in hepatocytes at high levels, and we confirmed hepatocyte-selective gene silencing with such constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). Moreover, injection of GN-MCT1-siRNA did not affect MCT1 expression in other major tissues including inguinal white adipose tissue, gonadal white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, intestine, heart, lung, kidney, and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G and H</xref>). Hepatocyte-selective MCT1 silencing strongly upregulated collagen 1 in livers of ob/ob mice on a GAN diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>), as did hepatocyte-selective MCT1KO in the CDHFD mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In contrast, Chol-conjugated, chemically modified siRNA targeting MCT1 silenced the gene in all three liver cell types tested, including hepatic stellate cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>), and did attenuate liver collagen 1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). This result is consistent with the idea that depleting MCT1 in stellate cells decreases collagen 1 production, as shown by MCT1KO in stellate cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> also show the effectiveness of RNA interference (RNAi) in interrogating cell-specific processes in liver, and highlight the multiple advantages over traditional small molecule inhibitors in developing therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bumcrot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aagaard and Rossi, 2007</xref>). To date, five RNAi-based therapeutic agents have received FDA approvals targeting multiple disease areas, and a great many clinical trials of oligonucleotide therapeutics are in progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Padda et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Traber and Yu, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mullard, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of gene expression profiles also showed that hepatic MCT1 positively regulates the levels of SREBP1 and ChREBP, major transcription factors regulating liver lipid metabolism, as well as their target DNL genes. These effects were apparently not sufficient to reverse severe steatosis in the genetically obese NASH mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), although a slight decrease in mean lipid droplet size was observed. The remaining steatosis may be attributed to the continuous supply of fatty acids from adipose tissue lipolysis, which accounts for up to 65% of hepatic fat accumulation as opposed to only 25% coming from hepatic DNL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Donnelly et al., 2005</xref>). While recognizing that the decreased expression of DNL genes does not necessarily indicate an inhibited fatty acid synthesis rate, we also cannot rule out the possibility of compensatory effects from other MCT isoforms that are expressed. However, since MCT1 haploinsufficiency showed greatly reduced HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, the discrepancies with our data may be due to other tissues being involved or the different mouse models used. Overall, it is clear from our studies that steatosis is not much affected by hepatic MCT1 depletion in two models of NASH in mice. A possible future strategy for NASH therapeutics may be to combine the depletion of MCT1 in stellate cells to decrease fibrosis with a potent anti-steatosis target such as DGAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yenilmez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calle et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Loomba et al., 2020</xref>) which we and others have shown is effective in reducing steatosis when depleted. Although there are still remaining challenges in developing a successful hepatic stellate cell-selective delivery system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poelstra, 2020</xref>), ongoing studies are identifying promising candidates such as M6P-polyethylene glycol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhu and Mahato, 2010</xref>), IGF2R-specific peptide coupled nanocomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>), and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To understand the underlying mechanism by which hepatic MCT1 depletion drives the downregulation of DNL genes expression, we investigated AMPK activation, as pAMPK has a negative regulatory effect on SREBP1 and ChREBP activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kawaguchi et al., 2002</xref>). Indeed, hepatic MCT1 silencing enhanced AMPK phosphorylation, consistent with the previous MCT1 haploinsufficient mice study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carneiro et al., 2017</xref>). These data are also in line with another study in which MCT1 inhibition reduced ATP production and activated AMPK, thus deactivating SREBP1c and lowering levels of its target SCD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). It remains to be examined whether other mechanisms are also at play that connect MCT1 function in liver to DNL gene regulation.</p><p>In summary, the data presented here highlight hepatic stellate cell MCT1 as a potential therapeutic target to prevent NASH fibrogenesis related to collagen 1 production. Its utility as a therapeutic target is complicated by our finding that MCT1 depletion in hepatocytes actually increases fibrosis. This work highlights the importance of contemplating cell-type specificity when developing therapeutic strategies, especially in systems of complex cellular landscapes such as NASH.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Oligonucleotide synthesis</title><p>The 15–20 or 18–20 sequence oligonucleotides were synthesized by phosphoramidite solid-phase synthesis on a Dr Oligo 48 (Biolytic, Fremont, CA, USA), or MerMade12 (Biosearch Technologies, Novato, CA, USA) using 2ʹ-F and 2ʹ-O-Me phosphoramidites with standard protecting groups (Chemgenes, Wilmington, MA, USA).

They generate multiple tools to test this hypothesis, which they combine with mouse diets that induce fatty liver, steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Novel findings include that deletion of hepatocyte MCT1 does not change liver lipid content, but increases liver fibrosis. Deletion of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) MCT1 does not substantially affect any liver parameter, but concomitant HSC MCT1 deletion does reverse fibrosis seen with hepatocyte MCT1 knockout or knockdown. In both models, plasma lactate levels do not change, suggesting that liver MCT1 does not substantially affect systemic lactate. In general, the data match conclusions of the manuscript, and the studies are well-conducted and well-described. Further work would be necessary to dissect mechanism of fibrosis with hepatocyte MCT1, and whether this is due to changes in local lactate (as speculated by the authors) or another MCT1 substrate. This would be important to understand this novel potential cross-talk between hepatocytes and HSCs.</p><p>A parallel and perhaps more important advance is the generation of new methodology to target HSC in mice, using modified siRNA and by transduction of AAV9-Lrat-Cre. Both methods would reduce the need to cross floxed mice with the Lrat-Cre allele, saving time and resources. These tools were validated to an extent by the authors, but not sufficiently to ensure that there is no cross-reactivity with other liver cell types. For example, AAV9-Lrat-Cre-transduced MCT1 floxed mice show compelling HSC but not hepatocyte Mct1 knockdown, but other liver cell types should be assessed to ensure specificity. This is particularly important as overall liver Mct1 decreased by ~30% in AAV9-Lrat-Cre-transduced mice, which may exceed HSC content of these mice, especially when considering a 60-70% knockdown efficiency. This same issue also affects Chol-MCT1-siRNA, which the authors demonstrate to affect hepatocytes and HSC, but likely affects other cell types not tested. As this is a new and potentially valuable tool, it would be important to assess Mct1 expression across more non-parenchymal cells (i.e. endothelial, cholangiocytes, immune cells) to determine penetration and efficacy.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89136.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this study, the authors seek to answer two main questions: (1) Whether interfering with lactate availability in hepatocytes through depletion of hepatocyte specific MCT-1 depletion would reduce steatosis, and (2) Whether MCT-1 in stellate cells promote fibrogenesis.

Even with the added in vitro data (Figure 8, Supplementary Figure 6), however, a clear mechanistic explanation for how MCT1 is modulating/inhibiting fibrosis in hepatic stellate cells is lacking and this represents a key area for future exploration. The authors provide interesting follow up experiments that suggest lactate can potentiate TGF-β1 signaling, a phenomenon that has previously been described in pulmonary fibrosis. Additionally, MCT1 depletion decreased the pSMAD3/SMAD ratio, but this was overcome with higher doses of TGB- β1 ligand.

Ultimately, the paper opens more questions than it answers: why does decreasing MCT1 expression in hepatocytes exacerbate disease, while silencing MCT1 in fibroblasts seems to alleviate collagen deposition? Mechanistic studies in isolated hepatocytes and stellate cells could enhance the work further to show the disparate pathways that mediate these opposing effects. The work highlights the complexity of cellular behavior and metabolism within a disease environment but does little to mechanistically explain it.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article

To ensure the specificity of our novel AAV-Lrat-Cre construct, it would be fair to test its distribution among all possible hepatic cell types, including endothelial cells, cholangiocytes, and other immune cells, as suggested. Our efforts in this study were primarily focused on the major cell types thought to contribute to NASH, namely hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and in particular hepatic stellate cells. The reasons for this focus were:</p><p>1. Our primary goal was to investigate the role of MCT1 in hepatic fibrogenesis. According to Manderacke et al. (2013, Nature Comm), hepatic stellate cells account for the dominant proportion (82-96%) of myofibroblast progenitors, which produce collagen fibers. While there may be interesting roles of MCT1 in those other cell types, to elucidate MCT1's role in fibrogenesis, focusing on the dominant fibrogenic cell type, hepatic stellate cells, was the most appropriate approach for this goal.</p><p>2. Considering the proportion of each hepatic cell type in the liver, hepatocytes constitute the majority (60-70%), followed by endothelial cells (15%), immune cells (10%), and stellate cells (5%), among others.</p><p>3. The AAV-Cre system is highly specific to its promoter, in this case, Lrat, which has been well established in multiple previous studies to exhibit high specificity for hepatic stellate cells in the liver.We will certainly conduct more comprehensive biodistribution studies in the future, as we believe that our AAV-Lrat-Cre system could be a valuable tool in this field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study, the authors seek to answer two main questions: (1) Whether interfering with lactate availability in hepatocytes through depletion of hepatocyte specific MCT-1 depletion would reduce steatosis, and (2) Whether MCT-1 in stellate cells promote fibrogenesis.

A more detailed discussion regarding how lactate availability would regulate two different processes in two different cell types would be helpful. The authors employ several mouse models and in vitro systems to show that MCT1 inhibition in hepatic stellate cells reduces the expression of COL-1. The significance of the findings is moderately impacted due to the following considerations:</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: We have included additional in vitro data in order to provide a more comprehensive discussion of MCT1's potential role in regulating collagen production. Please refer to the new Figure 8, Supplementary Figure 6, and the results section (Potential Mechanism). Also note that our original hypothesis was that depleting MCT1 specifically in hepatocytes would protect mice with MCT1 haploinsufficiency from liver lactate overload and NAFLD. Furthermore, we postulated that this protection might prevent NASH progression since lipotoxicity-driven hepatocyte damage is a central factor in NASH pathogenesis. However, our findings did not support this hypothesis.We found only one brief article (2015, Z Gastroenterol et al., &quot;Functional effects of monocarboxylate transporter 1 expression in activated hepatic stellate cells&quot;) that discussed the potential role of MCT1 depletion in hepatic stellate cells in regulating collagen production or fibrosis, as mentioned in their abstract. Unfortunately, the DOI for this article is not functional, and the data cannot be located. Moreover, when we attempted to replicate their results, we were unable to do so, leading us to report our own findings in the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. Fibrosis in human NAFLD is a significant problem as a predictor of liver related mortality and is associated with type 1 and type 3 collagen. However, the reduction in COL1 in stellate cells did not amount to a reduction in liver fibrosis even in cell specific KO (in Fig 7E, there is no indication of whether Sirius red staining was different between HSC KO and control mice- the authors mention a downward trend in the text). The authors postulate that type 1 COL may not be the more predominant form of fibrosis in the model. This does not seem likely, since the same ob/ob mouse model was used to determine that fibrosis was enhanced with hepatocyte specific MCT-1 KO and decreased with Chol MCT-1KO. Measurements of different types of collagens in their model and the effect of MCT-1 on different types could be more informative. In particular, although collagens are the structural building blocks for hepatic fibrosis, fibrosis can also be controlled by matrix remodeling factors such as Timp1, Serpine 1, PAI-1 and Lox.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: We monitored the expression levels of matrix remodeling factors, such as Timp1 (Figure 5C, 5F). There was no change in expression upon Chol-MCT1-siRNA treatment, while a significant increase was observed upon GN-MCT1-siRNA treatment. This trend was similar to collagen expression in both cases. Regarding the different types of collagen, instead of measuring each individual type of collagen, we conducted Sirius red and trichrome staining, which enabled us to detect multiple types of collagen simultaneously (Figure 5G, Figure 7D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The authors use multiple animal models including cell specific KO to conclude that stellate cell MCT-1 inhibition decreases COL-1. However, the mechanisms behind this reduced expression of COL-1 are not discussed or explored, making it descriptive.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: We agree that the mechanisms involved are not fully defined but have added new data (Figure 8, Supplement Figure 6) and text to discuss possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Different types of diets are used in this study which could impact lactate availability. Choline deficiency diets are reported to cause weight loss, and importantly have none of the metabolic features of human NASH. Therefore, their utility is doubtful, especially for this study which proposes to investigate if metabolic dysregulation and substrate availability could be a tool for therapy.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: Unfortunately, none of the rodent models used to study NASH completely replicate the condition in human patients, each having its own set of advantages and drawbacks. In line with the concern raised by reviewer #2, there has been a shift away from the use of severely detrimental methionine and choline-deficient diets in contemporary NASH research. Instead, diets that combine methionine and other amino acids with cholinedeficient diets, in conjunction with high-fat diets, have become more popular. The diet we employed in our study consists of high-fat diet combined with choline-deficient diets. We believe that our findings, which are consistent and established across two distinct NASH pathogenesis models and genetic backgrounds, lend additional robustness to our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Hepatocyte specific MCT-1 KO mice seem to have increased COL-1 production, despite no noticeable difference in hepatocyte steatosis. The reasons for this are not discussed. Fibrosis in NASH is thought to be from stellate cell activation secondary to signals from hepatocellular damage. There is no evidence that there was a difference in either of these parameters in the mouse models used.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: While lipotoxicity-driven liver damage remains a central aspect of NASH pathogenesis, the traditional two-hit theory has become less tractable, giving way to the multi-hit theory in the NASH field. The current debate revolves around whether steatosis is a decisive factor and requirement for NASH fibrogenesis. Our previous publication (Yenilmez et al., 2022, Mol Ther) demonstrated that nearly complete resolution of steatosis did not prevent other NASH features like inflammation and fibrosis, indicating the existence of multiple factors beyond steatosis in NASH pathogenesis. We believe that steatosis and fibrosis influence each other but can also develop independently.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. The authors report that serum lactate levels did not rise after MCT-1 silencing, but the reasons behind this are unclear. There is insufficient data about lactate production and utilization in this model, which would be useful to interpret data regarding steatosis and fibrosis development. For example, does the MCT-1 KO prevent hepatocyte and stellate cell net import or export of lactate? What is the downstream metabolic consequence in terms of pyruvate, acetylCoA and the NAD/NADH levels. Does the KO have downstream effects on mitochondrial TCA cycling?</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: Due to both biological and technical challenges (which are described in the new draft), conducting a comprehensive metabolomics study comparing hepatocyte MCT1 KO to hepatic stellate cell MCT1 KO was not feasible. It is important to note that MCT1 can also transport other substrates that are often overlooked, including pyruvate, short-chain fatty acids, and ketone bodies. Also, in addition to MCT1, there are at least two other functional isoforms of MCT: MCT2 and MCT4. Regrettably, due to these biological and technical complications, conducting a comprehensive metabolomic analysis is extremely complicated and difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, some insights are gained from a study involving MCT1 chaperone protein Basigin/CD147 knockout (KO) mice in a high-fat diet- induced hepatic steatosis model. Basigin acts as an auxiliary protein for MCT1, and its absence leads to improper localization and stabilization of MCT1, effectively simulating a state of MCT1 deficiency. In this context, hepatic lactate levels were reduced by half, and other metabolites such as pyruvate, citrate, α-ketoglutarate, fumarate, and malate were significantly decreased. While we must exercise caution when extrapolating these findings to our MCT1 study, they suggest that multiple metabolites, particularly pyruvate, may play a crucial role in the context of MCT1 deficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f. MCT-1 protein expression is measured only in the in vitro assay. Similar quantitation through western blot is not shown in the animal models.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: We monitored MCT1 protein expression with either Western blot (Fig 2D, 2E (in vitro)) or immune-histology (Fig 4B, 4C (in vivo, ob/ob + GAN diet NASH model), Sup Fig 5F, 5G (in vivo, MCT1 f/f + CDHFD model)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>A major finding of this work is that loss of monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), specifically in stellate cells, can decrease fibrosis in the liver.

As also mentioned elsewhere, it is important to know whether lactate import or export (or the transport of another molecule-like ketone bodies, for example) is the decisive role of MCT1 for this phenotype. Beyond that, it would be interesting, albeit more difficult, to determine how that metabolic change leads to these fibrotic effects.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: Described above to Reviewer #2</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Kuppfer cells are initially analyzed and targeted. These cells may play a major role in fibrotic response. It will be interesting to determine the effects of lactate metabolism in other cells within the microenvironment, like Kuppfer cells, to gain a complete understanding of how metabolism is altered during fibrotic change.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: To address the potential involvement of inflammatory cells, we added new data to the manuscript (Supplement Figure 4). Given the distinct hepatic cellular distribution of Chol-MCT1-siRNA and GN-MCT1-siRNA, the opposite fibrogenic phenotype observed may be attributed to MCT1’s role in non-hepatocyte cell types such as the inflammatory Kupffer cells and the fibrogenic hepatic stellate cells. To determine which hepatic cell type drives the opposite fibrotic phenotypes, we first hypothesized that GN-MCT1-siRNA activates M2 pro-fibrogenic macrophages more than Chol-MCT1-siRNA does. The representative M1/ M2 macrophage polarization gene markers were monitored in Kupffer cells. However, GN-MCT1-siRNA treatment caused comparable M1/M2 macrophage activation levels to Chol-MCT1-siRNA treatment (Supplement Figure 4A, 4B). These data suggest that the opposite fibrotic phenotypes caused by the different siRNA constructs are not due to M1/M2 macrophage polarization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The timing of MCT1 depletion raises concern, as this is a largely prophylactic experiment, and it remains unclear if altering MCT1 would aid in the regression of established fibrosis. Given the proposal for translation to clinical practice, this will be an important question to answer.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: Agree these are important experiments for future evaluation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>As above, in general, the conclusions match the data presented. The one exception is the authors discussion point that these data show the importance of lactate flux in fibrosis. As MCT1 has other substrates, it does not seem this is definitively due to lactate flux. It would be helpful to have additional experiments to clarify mechanism by which loss of hepatocyte MCT1 leads to increased fibrosis, while loss of HSC MCT1 reverses this finding. This may aid in concluding that altered fibrosis is in fact due to lactate flux in these cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: Described above to Reviewer #2</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it is unclear why the authors switched NASH models for the two tools generated (GAN diet for siRNA, CDHFD for AAV). Similarly, methodology to assess fibrosis switched between these two experiments - i.e. Sirius Red staining for siRNA-treated GAN diet-fed mice vs. Trichrome staining for AAV-transduced CDHFD-fed mice. These changes make it difficult to perform cross-comparisons of the data, to explain (for example), why GN-siRNA to Mct1 reduced body weight but AAV8-TBG-Cre did not. Similarly, GN-siRNA increased liver Col1a1 protein but AAV8-TBG-Cre did not. These differences could be explained by model system, or tool efficacy/off-target effects.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: We agree that different model systems can explain difference in results, but there is also an advantage of using different models and various methodologies as preclinical tests of consistency of data on NASH under different conditions. There are no perfect mouse models for human NASH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Phenotyping is also incomplete for the latter experiment, in particular amount of liver lipid content –</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: We estimated lipid content by H&amp;E (Fig 6E, F). In some experiments, we focused mostly on COL1 protein expression, as this rather than mRNA is the functional aspect of fibrosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>This study could benefit from standardization of the types of diet used across all animal models and a more comprehensive focus on the metabolic/substrate availability and utilization aspects of NAFLD and NASH affected in the mouse models with MCT-1 dependent lactate transport deficiency.

Our histology images did not reveal significant changes in cell morphology or integrity and there were no notable changes in caspase protein levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>In Fig 4G, there is an increase in the number of lipid droplets with Chol- MCT-1 siRNA compared to GN-MCT1-sirRNA, suggesting that the stellate cell component might be responsible for this finding. The possible reasons for this are not discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: The effects in Fig 4G were exceedingly small and there is no difference in total TG in these experiments, so it is hard to interpret these data and provide logical explanations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Fig 5A.

The graph in Fig 5represents a comparison between NTC-siRNA and MCT1-siRNA. It's important to note that, typically, ob/ob mice fed either a chow diet or a high-fat diet do not exhibit fibrogenic phenotypes within this time frame (3 weeks of dietary intervention).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are many mis-statements throughout the text.Page 6 - &quot;MCT1 silencing significantly inhibited Tgf1β-stimulated ACTA2 mRNA expression as well as collagen 1 protein production&quot; but it is not stated that CO1A1 mRNA is unchanged in Fig 1C.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: We observed no change in CO1A1 mRNA levels (Fig 1C), so we focused on collagen 1 protein production (Fig 1B) on page 6. Given the consistent trend observed in Chol-MCT1-siRNA (Fig 5C), we proposed the possibility of MCT1's influence on collagen translation or protein turnover on page 11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 7- &quot;.......our Chol-MCT1-siRNA does not require transfection reagents as it is fully chemically modified&quot;. What does fully chemically modified mean and why does this mean in terms of transfection efficiency.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: One of the primary challenges in utilizing RNAi as a therapeutic approach has been the effective in vivo delivery strategy, particularly concerning stability and longevity against systemic nucleases. Recent developments in siRNA duplex chemical modification strategies, such as 2-Fluoro and 2-O-Methyl ribose substitutions, as well as phosphorothioate backbone replacements, have addressed these challenges Please see Figure 3. In our current study, we employed 'chemically fully modified' siRNA, featuring several key modifications: (1) every single ribose is chemically modified to 2-F or 2-OMeribose, (2) phosphorothioate backbone replacement, (3) 5'-end of the antisense strand modification to (E)-Vinyl-phosphonate, and (4) 3'-end of the sense strand linkers such as Cholesterol or Tri-N-Acetyl-galactosamine. These chemical enhancements significantly improve transfection efficiency, longevity, and selectivity, setting it apart from traditional siRNA lacking such chemical modifications. A prior study from the Khvorova lab has demonstrated substantial efficiency differences between partially and fully modified siRNA in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 7- the results present for Fig 2 ignores Fig, 2C, if this is important it needs to be described if not, please delete.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: The dose-response potency results, crucial for identifying the most potent Chol-MCT1-siRNA compound, are depicted in Figure 2C. The wording &quot;(Figure 2C)&quot; has been inserted in the sentence as follows. “The silencing effect on Mct1 mRNA was monitored after 72 hours (Figure 2B). Several compounds elicited a silencing effect greater than 80% compared to the NTC-siRNA. The two most potent Chol-MCT1-siRNA, Chol-MCT1-2060 (IC50: 59.6nM, KD%: 87.2), and Chol-MCT1-3160 (IC50: 32.4nM, KD%: 87.7)(Figure 2C) were evaluated for their inhibitory effect on MCT1 protein levels (Figure 2D, 2E).

Is this total Mlxipl mRNA or can you distinguish between the alpha and beta variants.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: We adhered to NCBI nomenclature, where 'SREBP1' and 'ChREBP' represent proteins, not mRNA. The Mlxipl mRNA we tested pertains to total Mlxipl mRNA.

Both GN-MCT1-siRNA and Chol-MCT1-siRNA strongly decreased the mRNA and protein levels related to representative DNL genes (Supplement Figure 4A-4D). Intriguingly, both modes of hepatic MCT1 depletion also inhibited expression of the upstream regulatory transcription factors SREBP1 and ChREBP.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are no molecular weight markers in supplement Fig 4C and D. Is the Srebp1c blot for the nuclear or precursor form?</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: The Srebp1c blot presented represents the precursor form. I have edited the figure legend accordingly. It's worth noting that the cleaved form of Srebp1c either exhibited significantly lower expression compared to its precursor form or displayed comparable expression between the control group and the MCT1 depletion group.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Changes in mRNA and protein do not always reflect changes in activity (allosteric regulation). If you want to draw any conclusions about de novo lipogenesis you need to directly measure fatty acid synthesis rates from a carbohydrate precursor.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: We completely agree. Therefore, in the current study, we emphasized two key points: (1) hepatic MCT1 depletion affects the expression levels of representative DNL genes, and (2) however, this regulation was insufficient to resolve the steatosis phenotypes in our NASH model. We have added the text “while recognizing that the decreased expression of DNL genes does not necessarily indicate inhibited fatty acid synthesis rate” on page 15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Figure 1 - Are there changes to fibroblast phenotype with TGF-beta stimulation and are these changes reversed with MCT1 siRNA-mediated silencing, or is this purely an expression phenomenon?</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: This study was designed to assess the preventative effect of MCT1 silencing on Tgf1β-induced fibrosis, rather than a reversal study. As detailed in the methods section, LX2 cells were initially cultured in DMEM/high glucose media with 2% FBS. The following day, we transfected the cells with either NTC-siRNA or MCT1-siRNA (IDT, cat 308915476) using Lipofectamine RNAi Max (ThermoFisher, cat 13778075) for 6 hours in serum-reduced Opti-MEM media (ThermoFisher, cat 31985062). Subsequently, the cells were maintained in serum-starved media, with or without 10ng/ml of recombinant human Tgf1β (R&amp;D Systems, cat 240-B/CF), for 48 hours before harvesting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is lactate import/export itself responsible for this phenotype? It is presumed that MCT1 depletion alters import/export of lactate and subsequently modulates this phenotype, but this is never shown experimentally. Does lactate accumulate in these cells or in the medium in culture? The foundation of the paper rests on this hypothesis, so we believe that this is critical to establish. This is particularly relevant as MCT1 has been proposed to function primarily as a lactate importer, so the availability of medium lactate could be easily modulated to determine whether that mimics MCT1 loss.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: To address the underlying mechanism of MCT1/Lactate in stellate cells, we added a new figure to the manuscript (Figure 8). We had previously conducted an experiment to determine whether MCT1 depletion in LX2 cells in vitro influences extracellular lactate concentrations in DMEM/high glucose (25mM glucose) media supplemented with 1mM sodium pyruvate but without sodium lactate. Interestingly, we found no significant difference in extracellular glucose and lactate concentrations, which remained at 25mM and 5mM, respectively. These concentrations were comparable between groups, regardless of MCT1 loss. Additionally, we investigated the effects of MCT1 silencing in the presence of potent fibrogenic inducer TGF-β1. Intriguingly, MCT1 depletion effectively prevented TGF-β1-induced collagen production, irrespective of lactate (+/- pyruvate) supply in the media. LX2 cells with MCT1 depletion exhibited reduced collagen 1 production when lactate was solely generated by endogenous glycolysis (Figure 8F) and when exogenous lactate was supplied (Figure 8G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 - It is compelling that the Chol-MCT1-siRNA compounds are effective at targeting MCT1. However, is it clear how specific the siRNA target is? Are other MCT genes affected as well (if the siRNAs target areas of homology, for example)? Given that this siRNA strategy is used going forward and proposed as a therapeutic, it would be important to discuss and perhaps characterize off-target effects. A simple BLAST search for homology for the chosen siRNAs could help answer this question.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE:</p><p>1. We designed the siRNA to specifically avoid any potential off-target effects on MCT1's 14 isoforms, and this approach aligns with the results obtained from the NCBI-BLAST analysis.</p><p>2. While there are 14 isoforms of MCTs, only the first four are functional. To assess the off-target effect of Chol-MCT1-siRNA on MCT2 and MCT4 (MCT3 was excluded due to its limited expression in retinal pigment epithelium), we conducted in vivo experiments in ob/ob mice, which demonstrated a highly selective MCT1 silencing effect. We have also included MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 rt-qPCR data in the manuscript (Supplement Figure 2A, 2B).</p><p>3. We plan to further optimize and validate the human MCT1-targeting siRNA sequence for use in humanized mouse studies. It's important to note that the MCT1-siRNA used in this study was designed for mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplemental Figure 1 - brain would be one other highly metabolic tissue wherein it would be important to show lack of activity/accumulation.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: Undoubtedly, the brain is one of the most metabolically active tissues, playing a pivotal role in regulating signaling pathways and metabolism in other tissues. However, it poses a significant challenge in terms of targeting due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Overcoming BBB penetration remains one of the foremost challenges in the field of therapeutic siRNA delivery. For many therapeutic oligonucleotides, including Cholesterol-conjugated siRNAs, systemic administration alone is normally insufficient to achieve BBB penetration. Direct local injection or transient disruption of the BBB is normally required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 - The image shown for chol-MCT1-siRNA seems to show variation in lipid droplet size. Is this just this single image? The authors quantify smaller lipid droplets in this group, so the image may not be representative as there are many large droplets. Ultimately, additional mechanisms as to how alterations in lactate metabolism could mediate this phenotype are missing. This hypothesis also rests upon the assumption that MCT1 is modulating lactate, which is not shown experimentally, as discussed above.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: We changed the representative images (Fig 4B). We agree this aspect of the study is not resolved, and we have related text in the manuscript on this point: “neither GNMCT1-siRNA nor Chol-MCT1-siRNA decreased total hepatic TG levels (Figure 4H), although quantitative analysis of H&amp;E images showed a small decrease in mean lipid droplet size and increased number of lipid droplets upon MCT1 silencing (Figure 4F, 4G). These data suggest the possibility that hepatic MCT1 depletion either (1) inhibits formation or fusion of lipid droplets, or (2) enhances lipolysis to diminish lipid droplet size.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5 provides evidence that Chol-MCT1-siRNA expression decreases fibrosis but this is attributed to the effects on stellate cells. While GN-MCT1-siRNA and subsequent MCT1 silencing in hepatocytes has an opposite effect. The cell population that is not discussed, however, is the Kupffer cell. Could MCT1 silencing in this cell population be mediating part of the phenotype observed? How does MCT1 silencing affect Kupffer cell phenotype and activity?</p></disp-quote><p>This extends into Figure 6 where Kupffer cells are not given consideration in targeted experiments.</p><p>RESPONSE: Described above to Reviewer #3</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6 and 7 use a different model to show that stellate cell depletion of MCT1, specifically, decreases collagen 1 protein levels in NASH, which reinforces the authors claims.

It would be nice to show that Kupffer cell depletion of MCT1 does not have any affect or perhaps show that it does.</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: We agree, but Kupffer selective depletion is not possible to do with this siRNA technology. Please see the response above as our most recent attempt to address this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 shows that even with decreased collagen deposition, there is no effect on liver stiffness or chronic liver injury as measure by ALT. This may suggest that the decreased level of fibrosis is either not significant to overall clinical outcome or that there are other fibroinflammatory mechanisms compensating for lack of COL1 deposition. Is there increased reticulin fibrosis when MCT1 is knocked down? This could be assessed with IHC or monitoring type 3 collogen (COL3A1).</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: Reticulin fibrosis results from the excessive deposition of reticular fibers, primarily composed of type 3 collagen. However, based on our observation of trichrome staining in whole liver histology data (Fig 7D-E), which exhibited nearly identical trends to collagen type 1 expression (Fig 7A-C), it seems unlikely that type 3 collagen compensated for the decrease in type 1 collagen protein expression upon hepatic stellate cell MCT1 KO. We plan to perform detailed analysis of a more comprehensive list of ECM proteins including type 3 collagen in our humanized mouse model with engrafted human liver cells in future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional considerations:</p><p>It may be useful to know if inhibition of fibrosis affects survival/progression in these NASH models over a longer timeframe, although this may understandably be beyond the scope of the current work.The timing of MCT1 depletion is prophylactic and given the proposal to translate this research, it would be important to determine whether MCT1 inhibition reversed fibrosis, and if so, by what metabolic mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>RESPONSE: We have observed that extending the duration of the NASH model increases the likelihood of hepatocarcinoma development.
