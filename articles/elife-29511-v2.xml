Here we report that RIOK1 is methylated at K411 by SETD7 methyltransferase and that lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) reverses its methylation. The mutated RIOK1 (K411R) that cannot be methylated exhibits a longer half-life than does the methylated RIOK1. FBXO6 specifically interacts with K411-methylated RIOK1 through its FBA domain to induce RIOK1 ubiquitination. Casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylates RIOK1 at T410, which stabilizes RIOK1 by antagonizing K411 methylation and impeding the recruitment of FBXO6 to RIOK1. Functional experiments demonstrate the RIOK1 methylation reduces the tumor growth and metastasis in mice model. Importantly, the protein levels of CK2 and LSD1 show an inverse correlation with FBXO6 and SETD7 expression in human colorectal cancer tissues. Together, this study highlights the importance of a RIOK1 methylation-phosphorylation switch in determining colorectal and gastric cancer development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RioK1</kwd><kwd>FBXO6</kwd><kwd>methylation</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>SETD7</kwd><kwd>Casein Kinase 2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81602149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>Xuehui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003392</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016J01619</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>Xuehui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Zunyi Medical College Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fujian Provincial Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018D0016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>Xuehui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A Methylation-Phosphorylation Switch Determines RioK1 Stability and Function in CRC and GC Progression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and one of the most common malignancies in the Western world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Labianca et al., 2013</xref>). Over the last decades, treatment strategies have significantly improved. However, CRC remains a high-risk gastrointestinal malignancy. And the occurrence of metastasis after the operation is the leading cause of poor prognosis for CRC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yoshii et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is of paramount importance to decipher the potential mechanisms underlying CRC growth and metastasis, which may contribute to the development of effective therapeutics for treating CRC patients.</p><p>Rio (right open reading frame) kinase is a relatively conserved family of atypical serine/threonine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">LaRonde-LeBlanc and Wlodawer, 2005</xref>). RIOK1 and RIOK2 are two members of the Rio family, named for yeast (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) Rio1p and Rio2p, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">LaRonde-LeBlanc and Wlodawer, 2005</xref>). A third member named RIOK3 has greater similarly to RIOK1, but is only known to exist within multicellular eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>). Although these kinases contain a kinase fold structurally homologous to eukaryotic serine-threonine protein kinase domains, they lack substrate binding loops, an activation loop and their actual in vivo targets are unknown. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mendes et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, the RNA Polymerase subunit Rpa43 in yeast has been identified as the first Rio1 substrate. Furthermore, Rpa43 is phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue, suggesting that RIO1 might be in fact a dual-specific kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iacovella et al., 2015</xref>). RIOK1 knockout is lethal and was identified being an essential gene in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angermayr et al., 2002</xref>). Functionally, the yeast RIOK1 orthologue affects cell cycle progression and ribosomal biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Widmann et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, RIOK1 is essential for the survival and reproduction of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Weinberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mendes et al., 2015</xref>). However, the role of RIOK1 in multicellular organisms remains poorly understood. Recently, several studies have reported that the RIO kinases function in RTK and PI3K signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Read et al., 2013</xref>), and are required for the survival of Ras-dependent cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luo et al., 2009</xref>). One new study reported that RIOK1 was overexpressed in colon cancer cells and promoted cell proliferation in vitro in the context of human CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Weinberg et al., 2017</xref>). However, the exact mechanism remains unknown.</p><p>The posttranslational modification (PTM, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation) of proteins is well-known to dynamically change protein function by fine-tuning protein stability, localization, or interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jensen, 2006</xref>). PTMs of proteins rapidly and reversibly regulate cells in response to different stresses. Therefore, once demonstrated, these PTMs could potentially serve as therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krueger and Srivastava, 2006</xref>). Among various posttranslational modifications, lysine methylation acts as a novel regulatory mechanism to control protein functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oudhoff et al., 2013</xref>). However, most previous studies have predominantly highlighted histone methylation, until recently accumulating evidence indicates the widespread presence of lysine methylation in nonhistone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patel et al., 2011</xref>). Although there are about 50 lysine methyltransferases in mammals, lysine methylation is primarily catalyzed by a family of protein methyltransferases containing a catalytic SET domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dillon et al., 2005</xref>). Su(var)3–9, enhancer-of-zeste, trithorax (SET) domain-containing protein 7 (SET7) which is also known as SETD7, SETD9, or SETD7/9, and acts on histone H3K4, has been shown to monomethylate various non-histone proteins including Gli3, FOXO3a, p53, HIF<italic>-</italic>1α, TAF10, and Suv39h1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Couture et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). This methylation produces varied results. For example, methylation of Gli3 by SET7 stabilizes Gli3, whereas methylation of HIF<italic>-</italic>1α stimulates HIF<italic>-</italic>1α proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Besides, there is increasing evidence that other PTMs may parallel methylation in the regulation of various biological processes, which provide a sophisticated level of crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigeard et al., 2014</xref>). Although RIOK1 can be regulated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angermayr et al., 2007</xref>), the enzymes responsible for other PTMs of RIOK1 remain elusive.</p><p>Given that many kinases are largely regulated by PTMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oliveira and Sauer, 2012</xref>), we speculate that RIOK1 may be regulated by methylation, or phosphorylation, or ubiquitination. The aims of this project were to examine the PTMs and role of RIOK1 in CRC and GC. Our findings definitely will further deepen the understanding of the crosstalk of PTMs signaling, expand the existing knowledge of the RIOK1, and provide a novel mechanism by which RIOK1 regulates tumorigenesis and metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High-level RIOK1 is closely associated with an aggressive CRC and poor overall survival</title><p>To determine the role of RIOK1 in the pathogenesis of CRC, we firstly investigated the levels of RIOK1 in a group of 5 CRC patient tissues and matched normal tissues. As shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, compared with the corresponding non-tumor samples, RIOK1 was strongly upregulated in CRC tissues. The scatter diagram demonstrated the increase of RIOK1 <italic>mRNA</italic> levels in CRC and metastasis lymph node samples versus normal tissues, with an average 4.03-fold and 6.15-fold increase respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To confirm the increased RIOK1 protein expression in a larger sample group, and correlate this to clinical phenotype, we performed immunohistochemical staining (IHC) on the CRC tissue array comprised of 120 patients. IHC demonstrated that CRC tissues showed higher expression of RIOK1 compared to matched normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C1</xref>), and that the percentage of cells expressing RIOK1 were 25%, 52.2%, 67.7%, and 87.8% in cancer stage I, II, III, and IV of CRC, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C2</xref>), revealing that RIOK1 expression correlates with CRC malignancy. Importantly, Kaplan–Meier analysis indicated that high levels of RIOK1 expression are significantly correlated to overall survival (OS; p=0.003) and disease-free survival (DFS; p=0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Besides, we also observed an increased expression of RIOK1 in gastric cancer (GC) tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Collectively, our data show that the RIOK1 expression is frequently upregulated in CRC and GC, and correlated with poor prognosis, suggesting that RIOK1 may function as an oncogene in CRC development.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29511.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RIOK1 is significantly upregulated in CRC and associated with an aggressive and poor survival.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RIOK1 expression in five paired human CRC biopsies and matched normal mucosa analyzed by Western-blot.

Firstly, we examined the endogenous RIOK1 levels in different CRC cell lines and treated these cell lines respectively using lentivirus-mediated RIOK1-specific short hairpin (sh) RNAs knockdown or by overexpression of a RIOK1 cDNA. It was observed that the levels of endogenous RIOK1 were significantly higher in CRC cell lines than in normal intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Then three RIOK1-specific shRNAs (shRIOK1) were transfected to silence the endogenous RIOK1 expression of CRC cells. According to the western blot analysis, the shRIOK1#1 with the highest inhibition rate was selected for further functional experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Both CCK-8 and colony formation assays revealed that down-regulation of RIOK1 significantly inhibited the proliferation rate of HCT116 cells compared to negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, both migration and invasion were also obviously inhibited in RIOK1 knock-down HCT116 cells. To rule out the possibility of off-target effects, we constructed a shRNA-resistant RIOK1 lentiviral vector, RIOK1Δ, via site-directed mutagenesis. In HCT116-shRIOK1#1 cells, the recovery of RIOK1 expression with this shRNA-resistant vector remarkably restored the high proliferation and metastatic ability of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D and E</xref>).

As shown in Figure 10E and F, CRC cells with the expression of RIOK1-K411R and RIOK1-K411R/T410E had enhanced migration ability compared to RIOK1-WT. Similarly, the invasion ability of CRC cells stably expressing RIOK1K411R and RIOK1-K411R/T410E was also substantially increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>). In agreement with these in vitro migration assays, stable expression of RIOK1-K411R and RIOK1-K411R/T410E in CRC cells promoted lung metastasis of CRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H</xref>). Compared to RIOK1-WT, stable expression of RIOK1-T410A in RKO cells caused a significant reduction of migration, invasion, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E,F,G and H</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, all the in vitro and in vivo functional experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> were repeated in HCT116-shRIOK1 cells stably transfected with RIOK1-T410A, RIOK1-K411R/T410E, RIOK1-T410A, and RIOK1-WT, and showed similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B, C, D, E and F</xref>). Together, these data confirm that the methylation and phosphorylation RIOK1 oppositely regulates CRC tumorigenesis and metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Clinical relevance of RIOK1, SETD7, LSD1, FBXO6 and CK2 Expression in patients with CRC</title><p>To determine the clinical relevance of our findings, we firstly checked the expression of phosphorylated-RIOK1 and methylated-RIOK1 in the same tissue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. It was shown that phosphorylated-RIOK1 was positively correlated with RIOK1 expression in CRC cell lines and tissues while methylated-RIOK1 was negatively associated with RIOK1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1G and H</xref>). Then, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of 104 primary CRC samples with validated antibodies recognizing RIOK1, SETD7, LSD1, FBXO6, and CK2 proteins. Consistently, we observed an inverse expression pattern between RIOK1 and SETD7 or FBXO6, whereas a positive expression pattern between RIOK1 and LSD1 or CK2 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Kaplan–Meier analysis shows that high levels of LSD1 and CK2 in CRC samples correlated with poor overall survival in the patients, whereas low levels of SETD7 and FBXO6 in CRC samples correlated with poor overall survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). Therefore, expression levels of these proteins were independent prognostic factors for overall survival and disease-free survival. Together, our data highlight a critical role for RIOK1 phosphorylation and methylation in the clinical aggressiveness of human CRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, RIOK1 appears to be important for CRC and GC progression because blockade of RIOK1 decreases tumor growth and metastasis, whereas RIOK1 overexpression causes the opposite effects. Our data are consistent with a recent report that RIOK1 knockdown impaired the growth of the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116, which strongly indicates the oncogenic role of RIOK1 (Weinberg et al., 2017). Furthermore, to our knowledge, we for the first time reveal that RIOK1 is specifically monomethylated at the K411 site by SETD7 in vitro and in vivo. This SETD7-mediated methylation recruits FBXO6 E3 ligase and significantly contributes to RIOK1 instability. However, LSD1-mediated demethylation of RIOK1 at K411 or CK2-mediated phosphorylation of RIOK1 at T410 reverses RIOK1 degradation by FBXO6. Importantly, functional experiments indicate that the RIOK1 demethylation or phosphorylation signals might be a prerequisite for enhanced CRC and GC growth and metastasis. Clinically, our current data indicate that RIOK1 expression is associated with CRC and GC patient prognosis. However, a further test of the PTM antibodies on CRC and GC tissues is needed in the future work. Together, these results provide a novel mechanism through which the crosstalk of PTMs regulates the function of RIOK1, supporting the notion that RIOK1 may serve as a valuable biomarker to monitor human CRC and GC development.</p><p>The most striking finding is that a methylation-phosphorylation switch dictates RIOK1 stability and function in CRC and GC. Consistent with our data, a previous study reported a similar methylation-phosphorylation switch in regulating the stability of Sox2. In that paper, AKT1 was found to phosphorylate Sox2 at T118, which blocked K119me by Set7 and stabilized Sox2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fang et al., 2014</xref>). Independent studies have validated the importance of RIOK1 in cancer cell survival. A cell-based RNAi screen identified RIOK1 required for Ras-mediated cell survival, although this study did not explore the functionality of RIOK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breitkreutz et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, RIOK1 upregulation has been shown to be positively associated with Akt activity in both glioblastoma specimens and cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Read et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with these notions, in this manuscript, we demonstrate that RIOK1 is upregulated in CRC and GC tumor cells relative to normal control cells, and RIOK1 deficiency decreases tumor cell proliferation, migration, and lung metastasis. Therefore, RIOK1 is a powerful modifier of tumorigenesis. Despite about one decade of study, very little was known about RIOK1 regulation. It has been previously shown that Akt signaling regulates RIO kinase protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Read et al., 2013</xref>), but the exact mechanism by which Akt regulates RIOK1 levels remains undetermined. We now provide a novel perspective on the posttranslational regulation of RIOK1 by showing that SETD7-mediated methylation of RIOK1 decreases RIOK1 protein stability, which can be reversed by LSD1. Moreover, we provide ample evidence that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of RIOK1 at K410 reverses RIOK1 degradation by FBXO6 and SETD7. Our data are the first to establish functional connections between the PTMs of RIOK1 in CRC and GC. These results may have broad relevance to other cancers since RIOK1 is strongly expressed in other tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faraji et al., 2014</xref>). Given that RIOK1 creates a feedforward loop that promotes and maintains Akt activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Read et al., 2013</xref>), we hypothesize that there might be a feedback loop between RIOK1 and SETD7 or CK2, and that disruption of these loops is sufficient to trigger apoptosis or chemosensitivity in CRC and GC. This hypothesis awaits substantiation in future studies, which may lead to important new insights into the RIOK1signaling network in both normal and cancer cells.</p><p>Compared with the plethora of information about histone methylation, our understanding of non-histone protein methylation is very limited. Although RIOK1 has been shown to directly associates with the protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), RIOK1 was not a substrate of PRMT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guderian et al., 2011</xref>). RIOK1 just acts as an adapter protein by recruiting the RNA-binding protein nucleolin to the PRMT5 complex for its symmetrical methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guderian et al., 2011</xref>). In the present study, for the first time, we provide evidence that SETD7 and LSD1 methylates or demethylates RIOK1 respectively. One of the main mechanisms by which lysine methylation regulates protein function is effects on protein–protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Couture et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, we observed that K411 methylation of RIOK1 promotes the recruitment of FBXO6 to RIOK1 and disrupts the association of CK2 and LSD1 with RIOK1, subsequently leading to RIOK1 degradation. Given that the level of RIOK1 is closely related to diverse cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Read et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guderian et al., 2011</xref>), our data highlight the significance of understanding this important enzyme in health and disease.</p><p>Interplay with other PTMs is another main mechanism by which lysine methylation regulates protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Couture et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we also examined the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of RIOK1 by CK2 and FBXO6 respectively, which is the second important discovery in this study. Notably, CK2 was previously identified as an interaction partner of the Rio 1 p, a homologs of the human RIOK1 in yeast by MS analysis, and phosphorylation by CK2 leads to moderate activation of Rio1p in vivo and promotes cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angermayr et al., 2007</xref>), which is consistent with our data in human CRC and GC. Moreover, we now extend these findings by showing that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of the RIOK1 promoted CRC and GC growth and metastasis by disrupting SETD7-mediated methylation of RIOK1and recruitment of FBXO6 E3 ligase to RIOK1. However, In that study, Six C-terminally located clustered serines were identified as the only CK2 sites present in Rio1p in yeast, and phosphorylation by CK2 renders the Rio 1 p susceptible to proteolytic degradation at the G (1)/S transition, whereas the non-phosphorylated version is resistant (Angermayr et al., 2011), which stands in contrast with our current data. Notably, at first, the C-terminal domain of yeast Rio1p is least conserved in evolution and especially lacks consensus SETD7 motif. Secondly, RIOK1 of higher eukaryotes almost does not contain all six serine residues or CK2 motifs in the corresponding aligned sequences, but has highly conserved threonine residue and positively charged lysine residue next to it. This may provide an explanation for the most puzzling aspect of the effect of CK2 on RIOK1 in yeast and higher eukaryotes.</p><p>Recently, it has been demonstrated that LSD1 physically interacts with endogenous CK2 in vivo and is potentially phosphorylated by CK2 on three serine residues (S131, S137, S166) in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peng et al., 2015</xref>). And S137 facilitates RNF168-dependent ubiquitination and recruitment of 53BP1 to the DNA damage sites, which enhances cell survival and proliferation in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peng et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it is possible that there exists a feedback loop between LSD1 and CK2 in CRC and GC. Additionally, it needs to be further clarified whether CK2-mediated phosphorylation of the RIOK1 at Thr410 enhances the association of LSD1 with RIOK1, or LSD1-mediated demethylation of RIOK1 increases the binding of CK2 to RIOK1 and phosphorylation.</p><p>Previous study suggested that the proteasome has a pivotal role in the regulation of RIOK1 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guderian et al., 2011</xref>). However, no specific ubiquitin complex was previously connected to RIOK1 ubiquitination. Although we can not formally rule out the contribution of other E3 ligase –mediated effects on the functions of RIOK1, we were able to show here that FBXO6 links the activated RIOK1 to the degradation machinery and FBXO6 activity affects the cancer-supportive role of RIOK1 in CRC and GC. Importantly, we show that the ubiquitination of RIOK1 is controlled by molecular pathways (CK2 and LSD1and SETD7) frequently deregulated in CRC and GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2016</xref>). In the future, the identification of critical ubiquitination sites will provide new insights into the role and interaction of RIOK1 in cancer.</p><p>Clinically, LSD1 and CK2 activation are associated with poor outcome in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, reduced SETD7 expression or inactivating mutations is significantly correlated with poor patient prognosis in multiple cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, FBXO6 has been shown to affect the DNA damage, a process which promotes cell proliferation and survival in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Our data unify these observations and demonstrate that RIOK1 accumulation due to altered SETD7, LSD1, CK2, and FBXO6 expression provides an advantage in CRC and GC cells during disease progression. Indeed, we show a direct correlation between RIOK1 and LSD1, CK2, FBXO6, or SETD7 protein expression to increased metastatic potential and decreased recurrence-free survival of CRC and GC patients. These data suggest that RIOK1 could be a biomarker and a therapeutic target for these diseases. However, it remains to be seen whether the altered function of these enzymes (SETD7, LSD1, CK2, and FBXO6) in different cancers indeed converges on RIOK1 stability.</p><p>In summary, we show that RIOK1 is up-regulated in CRC and GC, which results in a significantly reduced survival and a more malignant phenotype by enhancing proliferation and migration of CRC and GC cells. Most importantly, we show for the first time that methylation and phosphorylation control the stability of RIOK1 and its role in CRC and GC progression. Therefore, targeting these PTMs of RIOK1 could be a very promising novel treatment option for CRC and GC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>Colorectal cancer cell lines LOVO, RKO, M5, LS174T, HCT116, DLD1, SW480, SW620, HEK293T, MKN45 and SGC-7901, MEFs and a normal human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) were obtained from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).

Antiserum from peptide-injected rabbits was affinity purified using the AminoLink Plus Immobilization Kit (Pierce).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>In vitro protein phosphorylation assays</title><p>In vitro kinase assays were performed as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peng et al., 2015</xref>) except that the CK2 kinase buffer contained 1 mM DTT, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 10 μM cold ATP, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgCl2, and 5 μCi [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP. The GST pulldown after kinase assay was performed by adding 500 μl of NETN buffer into the reaction after the in vitro kinase assay was completed. In all, 25 μg of RIOK1 peptides were used in similar reactions prior to direct spotting onto nitrocellulose for immunoblot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>For immunofluorescent staining, indicated cells plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips in DMEM and 10% FCS were washed once in PBS, then were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and blocked in 1% BSA in PBS. cells were incubated for 1 hr with indicated primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. Following staining with rhodamine-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibodies, cells were analyzed with a 63 × oil immersion lens on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m microscope. Indicated cells transfected with indicated plasmids were directly analyzed after 48 hr without fixation. The fluorescent staining was recorded using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Patients specimens and tissue microarray</title><p>From January 2008 to May 2014, a total of 104 pairs of CRC and 20 pairs of GC and non-tumor samples were collected from patients who had CRC or GC resection performed at Third Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University.The samples were used for subsequent RNA extraction or immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained for RIOK1, FBXO6, CK2, LSD1, SETD7. All human materials were obtained with informed consent and approved by the ethics committee of Hospital of Harbin Medical University(Protocol Number: 20150526). The tissue specimens were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. All tissues were confirmed as adenocarcinoma. CRC tissue microarray (TMA) was purchased form US Biomax (BC051110b) and IHC stained for RIOK1. The slides were scored for the percentage of positive epithelial cells as well as intensity and protein staining was subsequently quantified using the a scoring system based on the Allred score for immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allred et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoekstra et al., 2016</xref>). Based on the RIOK1protein expression as defined by Allred score &lt;6 (low) and &gt;6 (high), patients were stratified into two groups: RIOK1 low and high expression groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>In vivo tumorigenic and metastasis assay</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance with NIH guidelines for the use of experimental animals. Male nonobese/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice between 4 and 6 weeks of age, obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences (SIBS). All animal work was conducted according to Institutional Animal Care Guidelines, and all animal experiments were approved by the ethical committee of the Harbin Medical University (Protocol Number: 20150619). HCT116-pLV-shRIOK1 and HCT116-PLV-shNC and other indicated cells (1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells per mouse) were injected subcutaneously into the left or right flank of NOD/SCID mice (n = 10 per group).. After 8 weeks, the remaining mice were sacrificed, and lungs were isolated for examination of the number of metastatic tumors. Tumor volume (V) was estimated from the length, width (w), and height (h) of the tumor. We analyzed primary tumor growth by the formula (length × width<sup>2</sup>)/2. For the metastasis model, 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were injected into the tail vein of NOD/SCID mice (n = 10 per group); eight weeks later, the mice were sacrificed, and their lungs were removed and formalin fixed for haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Clonogenic assay</title><p>Clonogenic cell survival assay was performed to evaluate CRC and GC cells proliferation potential. In a 10 cm dish, a single cell suspension (250 cells) was added to each dish. Two weeks after plating, single colonies were fixed and stained by haematoxylin. Then colonies were counted and measured using the Nikon Nis Elements for windows software. Each assay was performed three times in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 16.0 statistical software package (Abbott Laboratories, USA). Quantitative values of all experiments are expressed as the mean ±SD. The significance of correlation between the expression of indicated proteins and histopathological factors was determined using Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> test. Survival curves were plotted by Kaplan–Meier method and compared by log-rank test. In vitro cell growth assay was tested using factorial design ANOVA. Comparisons between groups were performed with a 2-tailed paired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test. The correlation between the expression levels of two proteins was determined using Spearman's correlation analysis. In all samples, p&lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical significance was concluded at *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001; # represents no statistical significance.</p><p>Please see the supplementary materials and methods for additional experimental procedures.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s6" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Writing—original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Funding acquisition, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Software, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Supervision, Validation, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: All human materials were obtained with informed consent and approved by the ethics committee of Hospital of Harbin Medical University (Protocol Number: 20150526).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: All animal experiments were performed in accordance with NIH guidelines for the use of experimental animals.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Targeting posttranslational modifications of RioK1 inhibits the progression of colorectal and gastric cancers&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Tilman Brummer (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Here, the authors have explored the function of the RIOK1/2 atypical protein kinases in colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastric carcinoma (GC), showing that high levels of RIOK1 correlated with poor outcome, and by knockdown and overexpression that RIOK1 promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of CRC cells, in a manner dependent on PI3K/AKT pathway signaling, which reportedly acts upstream and/or downstream of RIOK1. Analysis of RIOK1-associated proteins identified the SETD7 Lys methylase, and SETD7 was shown to methylate Lys 411 in RIOK1 leading to decreased RIOK1 stability. This was shown to be a result of specific recognition of K411 methylated RIOK1 by the SCF/FBX06 E3 ligase leading to its ubiquitylation and degradation. Conversely, demethylation of K411me by the LSD1 demethylase increased RIOK1 stability. The effect of K411 methylation was counteracted by CK2-mediated phosphorylation of T410 lying next to the methylation site, possibly as a result of its blocking K411 methylation. By expressing K411R, T410A, and K411R/T410E mutant RIOK1 in RKO CRC cells, SETD7 methylation of K411 was shown to negatively regulate proliferation and tumor growth, in manner reversed by phosphorylation of T410.</p><p>Rather little is known about RIOK1/2, although RIOK1/2 overexpression has been implicated in cancer, and its direct targets if any remain largely unknown. In this regard, the present insights into how RIOK1 activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications in the context of CRC are of relevance.</p><p>The two reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted the following letter to aid you in submitting a revised version. The reviewers found your observations on the regulation of RIOK1 levels by the pT410/K411me modifications and the correlation between RIOK1 protein levels and colon carcinoma to be of interest, but they each raised issues that need to be addressed in a revised version.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Are levels of RIOK1 regulated in CRC and GC cells by the pT410/K411me switch?</p><p>Most of the experiments on SETD7/LSD1/FBXO6 mediated RIOK1 modifications and binding were done in 293T cells, typically with overexpression of epitope-tagged constructs, or in MEFs, and only in one or two cases was analysis of the endogenous SETD7/LSD1/FBXO6 proteins in RIOK1-overexpressing CRC or GC cells or tumor tissues carried out. In order to validate the physiological relevance of the phosphorylation/acetyl switch and establish that these modifications are important in the context of cancer, the authors need to use the anti-pT410 and K411me antibodies to test if pThr410 and Lys411me modifications of RIOK1 are also observed in additional CRC and GC cell lines, and assess how their levels correlate with RIOK1 protein expression levels. For instance, the authors could reproduce their findings by manipulating SETD7/LSD1/FBXO6 levels in HCT116 CRC cells, as it is known from various independent studies that they express detectable levels of endogenous RIOK1 and that its depletion has clear biological effects. Likewise, most of the interaction studies were carried out in overexpressing 293T cells, but it is not clear whether the levels of RIOK1 overexpression in transfected 293T cells are equivalent to the levels observed in CRC or GC cells, and additional data showing that these interactions occur between endogenous proteins in CRC cells need to be added to the manuscript (N.B. because so many cell types are used in various cases, the cell types tested need to be indicated by figure labels, particularly when the figures are composed of panels from multiple different cell types).</p><p>2) Better validation of the relevance of the pT410/K411me switch to human cancer is needed.</p><p>Does RIOK1 expression or SETD7, LSD1, FBX06, and/or CK2 expression or status in CRC or GC cells correlate with any other tumor relevant features or mutations, such as RAS, AKT or tyrosine kinase mutation or activation status? To further support their conclusions, the authors should use their anti-pT410 and anti-K411me antibodies on blots of CRC and GC tissues and/or for IHC on CRC and GC tissues to correlate with RIOK1 protein levels. In this regard, since only a narrow region of the immunoblot was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, it is unclear from how specific these antibodies are for whole cell lysates, and how clean these antibodies are would dictate whether they could be used for IHC. Ideally, IHC data for these modifications should be added to the correlative data on SETD7 and CK2 expression in CRC and GC tissues shown in Figure S5.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, the functional relevance of K411-methylation and T410-phosphorylation was assessed using an overexpression assay in RKO rectal carcinoma cells in which RIOK1 overexpression is sufficient to enhance tumorigenicity of these RIOK1-low CRC cells. This analysis would be strengthened if the authors used mutant variants of the RIOK1-Δ RNAi resistant construct to functionally replace endogenous RIOK1 in HCT116 cells (or another RIOK1-high CRC cell line), which would indicate whether the modifications are necessary for RIOK1 function and/or regulation in CRC. Ideally, the authors would make these mutations in the endogenous RIOK1 gene using CRISPR/Cas9, but this is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>3) The authors should discuss whether the only function of T410/K411 modification is to regulate the stability of RIOK1, or whether either of these modifications, which lie outside the kinase domain, have an independent effect on RIOK1 activity. In this regard, although elucidating the mechanistic connection between RIOK1 and AKT would be beyond the scope of the paper, it would be worth testing whether AKT inhibition leads to changes in the T410/K411 modifications or binding to any of the regulatory partners, e.g. using their antibodies to probe lysates from CRC/GC samples in the context of AKT inhibition.</p><p>4) The authors carried out validation of the specificity of the anti-pT410 and anti-K411me antibodies using unmodified and singly and doubly modified synthetic peptides (Figures 3F1 and S4 – in this regard the legends do not indicate exactly how these experiments were carried out, i.e. what was blotted in the different lanes/strips – immobilized peptide?), but some concerns still remain about the specificities of the pT410 and K411me antibodies when used to detect these modifications in full length (endogenous) RIOK1 protein in cells/tissues. It was demonstrated that phosphorylation of T410 did not affect recognition of K411me in a synthetic peptide by the anti-K411me antibodies (Figure S4), but this is rather artificial because of the high concentration of peptide, and it remains possible that a phosphate at T410 affects the affinity of the anti-K411me antibody for K411me-modified RIOK1 protein. In fact, given what we know about the 3D structure of the CDR binding sites of antibodies that recognize linear peptide sequences, it would be surprising if a large negatively charged phosphate right next to the K411me residue does not affect binding affinity; after all pT410 prevented recognition by the SETD7 Lys methylase (in this regard, it is also unclear whether pT410 affects recognition of K411me-modified RIOK1 by the FBXO6 substrate recognition subunit of the SCF-FBXO6 E3 ligase, i.e., the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref> did not test whether FBXO6 can bind to the pT410K411me doubly-modified peptide). Conversely, one might have expected that the methyl group on K411, which neutralizes the positive charge on the Lys, to affect the binding affinity of the anti-pT410 antibodies, and possibly also phosphorylation of T410 by CK2. Further validation of these antibodies on the endogenous protein is really needed. For instance, any effect of T410 phosphorylation on recognition of the RIOK1 protein (rather than the RIOK1-derived peptide) could be tested by the consequences of dephosphorylating RIOK1 protein on the blot prior to antibody detection compared to a control untreated blot – there are examples in the literature of this approach (e.g. Brummer et al., 2003).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29511.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Are levels of RIOK1 regulated in CRC and GC cells by the pT410/K411me switch?</p><p>Most of the experiments on SETD7/LSD1/FBXO6 mediated RIOK1 modifications and binding were done in 293T cells, typically with overexpression of epitope-tagged constructs, or in MEFs, and only in one or two cases was analysis of the endogenous SETD7/LSD1/FBXO6 proteins in RIOK1-overexpressing CRC or GC cells or tumor tissues carried out.

Since we already have a lot data in this manuscript, it’s beyond the scope of current manuscript. However, it would be interesting to see these potential connections in the following manuscripts. As suggested by the reviewers, we probed pT410/K411me in CRC tissue as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1H</xref>. About the IHC staining, we have tried multiple times to optimize the condition, unfortunately, we got a strong background or non-specific staining in CRC or GC tissues using anti-pT410 and anti-K411me antibody. However, these two antibodies are good for WB. Further optimization of these two antibodies are needed for IHC. We agree with the comment by the reviewer “the antibodies for pT410RIOK1 and meK411RIOK1 await testing on clinical samples, which represents an interesting topic for a follow-up manuscript.” Though we could not get a clean IHC data by these two antibodies right now, we still strongly believe that there is a pT410/K411me switch among the cancer tissues based on the WB data. As suggested by the reviewers, we added relevant data of HCT116 cell line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D</xref>, 1E and 1F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should discuss whether the only function of T410/K411 modification is to regulate the stability of RIOK1, or whether either of these modifications, which lie outside the kinase domain, have an independent effect on RIOK1 activity.
