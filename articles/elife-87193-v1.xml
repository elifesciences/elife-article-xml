in performance. However, previous work has been cross-sectional and so it is unclear if under-confidence is a trait-like marker of anxious-depression vulnerability, or if it resolves when anxious-depression improves. Data were collected as part of a large-scale transdiagnostic, four-week observational study of individuals initiating internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) or antidepressant medication. Self-reported clinical questionnaires and perceptual task performance were gathered to assess anxious-depression and metacognitive bias at baseline and 4-week follow-up. Primary analyses were conducted for individuals who received iCBT (n=649), with comparisons between smaller samples that received antidepressant medication (n=82) and a control group receiving no intervention (n=88). Prior to receiving treatment, anxious-depression severity was associated with under-confidence in performance in the iCBT arm, replicating previous work. From baseline to follow-up, levels of anxious-depression were significantly reduced, and this was accompanied by a significant increase in metacognitive confidence in the iCBT arm (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=0.17, SE=0.02, p&lt;0.001). These changes were correlated (r(647)=-0.12, p=0.002); those with the greatest reductions in anxious-depression levels had the largest increase in confidence. While the three-way interaction effect of group and time on confidence was not significant (F(2, 1632)=0.60, p=0.550), confidence increased in the antidepressant group (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=0.31, SE = 0.08, p&lt;0.001), but not among controls (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=0.11, SE = 0.07, p=0.103). Metacognitive biases in anxious-depression are state-dependent; when symptoms improve with treatment, so does confidence in performance. Our results suggest this is not specific to the type of intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metacognition</kwd><kwd>confidence</kwd><kwd>anxious-depression</kwd><kwd>transdiagnostic</kwd><kwd>iCBT</kwd><kwd>antidepressant</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MQ: Transforming Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MQ16IP13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gillan</surname><given-names>Claire M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19/FFP/6418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gillan</surname><given-names>Claire M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-H2020-HABIT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gillan</surname><given-names>Claire M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GOIPG/2020/662</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fox</surname><given-names>Celine Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002081</institution-id><institution>Irish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Enterprise Partnership Scheme IRC/EPSPG/2020/8</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Chi Tak</given-names></name><name><surname>Gillan</surname><given-names>Claire M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Improvement in levels of anxious-depression corresponds with increased confidence in performance among individuals receiving mental health treatment within a large longitudinal dataset.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Metacognition refers to the ability to accurately monitor and appraise one‚Äôs own cognitive experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fleming and Lau, 2014</xref>). Metacognition is crucial for adaptive behaviour: it allows for flexible adjustment of behavioural strategies in order to improve performance, signals when to engage or withdraw from an activity, and guides the engagement in social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fleming and Daw, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fleming et al., 2012</xref>). Metacognitive abilities vary across individuals; one can be under- or over-confident, and these biases can be associated with maladaptive thoughts, feelings and behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Philipp et al., 2020</xref>). There is a growing interest in these confidence abnormalities in psychiatry, with studies implicating alterations of metacognition in depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoven et al., 2019</xref>). While case-control studies have mainly found patterns of reduced confidence across several disorders, newer methods that can separate transdiagnostic dimensions of mental health using large online samples have revealed specific and bi-directional effects of confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wise et al., 2023</xref>). Using these methods, studies have shown that the transdiagnostic dimension ‚Äòanxious-depression‚Äô is linked to under-confidence in one‚Äôs own performance, while a separate dimension ‚Äòcompulsivity and intrusive thought‚Äô is related to elevated confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rouault et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seow and Gillan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoven et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seow et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benwell et al., 2022</xref>). A major gap in this area is that studies to-date only measure metacognition and transdiagnostic psychopathology at a single time point. Therefore, it is unclear if metacognitive biases are stable, fixed traits, or if they might change with treatment response. Preliminary evidence suggests metacognition may indeed be malleable; metacognitive abilities can be improved with metacognitive interventions, such as training, in unselected online samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carpenter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Engeler and Gilbert, 2020</xref>) and in clinical populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jelinek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lysaker et al., 2018</xref>). However, it remains unknown if metacognitive changes generalise beyond its specific training context and are associated with any real-world improvement in psychiatric symptoms. In clinical studies, research has identified confidence abnormalities in at-risk populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eisenacher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gawƒôda et al., 2018</xref>), suggestive of a trait-dependence. In contrast, stimulant use disorders remitters have better metacognition than active users, suggesting state-dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moeller et al., 2016</xref>). Within-subject designs are needed to extend this work and understand if metacognition can improve in parallel to symptom alleviation, or if those with greater metacognitive deficits are simply the most vulnerable to illness onset and persistence. The present study aimed to address this by examining metacognition in a large cohort of individuals before and after internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT). iCBT has emerged as an important intervention for reducing the treatment-gap in mental healthcare provision globally; it is low-cost, scalable, geographically unconstrained and flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mogoa»ôe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Webb et al., 2017</xref>). iCBT offers patients standardised content and records objective metrics of treatment engagement, making it particularly well-suited to treatment-oriented research in psychiatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, iCBT has demonstrated clinical effectiveness in terms of symptom improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eilert et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karyotaki et al., 2021</xref>). While one study found that iCBT modified self-reported metacognitive beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Newby et al., 2014</xref>), it remains unknown if metacognitive confidence in decision-making improves following successful iCBT. In the current study, we used an objective task measure of metacognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fleming et al., 2014</xref>), which allowed us to test if successful treatment is linked to within-person improvements in metacognition. We also tested if any changes in metacognition were iCBT-specific, by comparing data gathered from smaller samples of individuals receiving antidepressant medication and a control group receiving no intervention. Similar to iCBT, antidepressants have established transdiagnostic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cipriani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">G√∏tzsche and Dinnage, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Skapinakis et al., 2016</xref>). However, studies examining the impact of antidepressants on cognition have typically focused on cognitive capacities other than metacognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Prado et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosenblat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salagre et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vernon et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, a secondary aim of this study was to compare metacognitive changes across the different intervention arms, which may shed light on differential therapeutic mechanisms and potentially augment therapeutic decision-making in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cross-sectional findings at baseline: iCBT</title><p>At baseline, age was not significantly associated with mean confidence (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=0.003, SE = 0.003, p=0.401).

Additionally, the effect of time on confidence was not dependent on how much participants engaged in iCBT, as indexed by time spent in the program (<italic>Œ≤</italic>&lt;0.01, SE &lt;0.01, p=0.756) and percentage of the iCBT program viewed (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=0.09, SE = 0.21, p=0.650). Confidence changes did not differ across the different types of iCBT programs, when the Space from Depression and Anxiety program was compared pairwise to Space from Depression (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=‚àí0.09, SE = 0.17, p=0.594), Space from Anxiety (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=‚àí0.15, SE = 0.17, p=0.376), Life Skills (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=‚àí0.15, SE = 0.19, p=0.435) or the ‚Äòother‚Äô category comprising miscellaneous iCBT programs (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=‚àí0.03, SE = 0.18, p=0.881). Change in confidence was not different among those receiving concurrent treatment versus not (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=‚àí0.03, SE = 0.06, p=0.566). To test if changes in confidence from baseline to follow-up scaled with changes in anxious-depression, we ran a repeated measure regression analyses with per-person changes in anxious-depression as an additional independent variable. We found this was the case, evidenced by a significant interaction effect of time and change in anxious-depression on confidence (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=‚àí0.12, SE = 0.04, p=0.002). Those with the largest decrease in anxious-depression had the greatest increase in confidence. This was similarly evident in a simple correlation between change in confidence and change in anxious-depression (r(647)=-0.12, p=0.002) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This effect was specific to anxious-depression; the interaction effect of time and change in compulsivity and intrusive thought on mean confidence was not significant (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=‚àí0.06, SE = 0.05, p=0.221). Similarly, the significant interaction effect of time and anxious-depression on mean confidence held when including change in the other transdiagnostic dimensions (compulsivity and intrusive thought and change in social withdrawal) as covariates in the model (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=‚àí0.07, SE = 0.03, p=0.005). The interaction effect of time and change in anxious-depression on task difficulty was not significant (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=0.14, SE = 0.69, p=0.835). To test the extent to which baseline differences in mean confidence or anxious depression might drive the results, we re-ran these regression analyses with baseline measures instead of change indices. There was no significant interaction effect of time and baseline confidence (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=0.06, SE = 0.04, p=0.144) or an interaction effect of time and baseline anxious-depression (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=‚àí0.03, SE = 0.05, p=0.611) on mean confidence. Exploratory analyses further tested the specificity of these effects to anxious-depression by examining the interaction effect of time and change in each psychiatric score on mean confidence. Changes in trait anxiety (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=‚àí0.08, SE = 0.02, p=0.002), depression (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=‚àí0.06, SE = 0.02 p=0.011) and alcohol misuse (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=‚àí0.05, SE = 0.02, p=0.037) also showed an association with changes in confidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Treatment findings in the iCBT arm.</title><p><italic>Œ≤</italic>=standardised beta coefficient, AD = Anxious-Depression, CIT = Compulsivity and Intrusive Thought, SW = Social Withdrawal, OCD = Obsessive compulsive disorder, <italic>r</italic>=correlation coefficient, <italic>p</italic>=p-value (unadjusted), ***=<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, **=<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, *=<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.

The interaction effect of group and time on mean confidence was not significant (F(2, 1632)=0.60, p=0.550), suggesting that change in confidence did not differ across the three groups.

The interaction effect of time and group on mean dot difference was not significant (F(2, 1632)=1.91, p=0.148), suggesting no differences across the groups in task difficulty changes. In the antidepressant arm, mean dot difference decreased from baseline (M=41.2, SD=13.3) to follow-up (M=35.3, SD=13.1) (<italic>Œ≤</italic>=‚àí5.91, SE = 1.25, p&lt;0.001), indicating increased task difficulty.

While our sample was underpowered to examine individual differences, we conducted an exploratory analysis examining the connection between changes in anxious-depression symptoms and changes in confidence in the antidepressant and controls groups. When examining the effects of time, group and anxious-depression change on mean confidence, there was a significant interaction effect of time and anxious-depression change on mean confidence (F(1, 1626)=4.04, p=0.045), suggesting change in confidence is associated with change in anxious-depression. There was no significant three-way interaction of anxious-depression change, time and group on mean confidence when comparing the three groups (F(2, 1626)=0.08, p=0.928), indicating that the significant association between confidence change and anxious-depression change was not specific to any group. Although not significant, the association between change in confidence and change in anxious-depression was in the expected negative direction in the antidepressant arm (r(80)=-0.10, p=0.381), and among controls (r(86)=-0.17, p=0.111) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Comparing iCBT, antidepressant and control groups.</title><p><italic>Œ≤</italic>=standardised beta coefficient, AD = Anxious-Depression, CIT = Compulsivity and Intrusive Thought, SW = Social Withdrawal, OCD = Obsessive compulsive disorder, <italic>r</italic>=correlation coefficient, <italic>p</italic>=p-value, ***=p &lt; 0.001, **=p &lt; 0.01, *=p &lt; 0.05.

To answer these questions, we administered a previously validated adaptive task of metacognitive ability that controls for objective performance differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fleming et al., 2014</xref>) in a large sample of individuals before and after four weeks of iCBT or antidepressant medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). As expected, a 4-week course of iCBT or antidepressant medication led to transdiagnostic improvements in mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cipriani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">G√∏tzsche and Dinnage, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Skapinakis et al., 2016</xref>). Alongside this, there was a significant increase in metacognitive confidence following four weeks of iCBT or antidepressant medication. Not simply a practice effect, we found that individuals in the iCBT arm with the greatest improvements in anxious-depression had the largest increase in confidence at follow-up. This association with clinical improvements was specific to metacognitive changes, and not changes in task performance, suggesting that changes in confidence do not merely reflect greater task familiarity at follow-up. These findings suggest that metacognitive biases in anxious-depression are state-dependent. This builds on previous findings in small samples that have shown iCBT improves self-reported metacognitive self-beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Newby et al., 2014</xref>) and that metacognition can be altered through adaptive training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carpenter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Engeler and Gilbert, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jelinek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lysaker et al., 2018</xref>). At baseline, we replicated the previously observed bi-directional associations between metacognitive bias and anxious-depression and compulsivity and intrusive thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rouault et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seow and Gillan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoven et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benwell et al., 2022</xref>). While higher levels of anxious-depression is associated with lower confidence, those with higher levels of compulsivity and intrusive thought have elevated confidence. This is a somewhat surprising dissociation, as compulsivity and anxious-depression are themselves positively correlated in the population. One way this can be reconciled is if the mechanisms underlying these opposing confidence biases are distinct. In anxious-depression, there appears to be more pervasive metacognitive biases that affect confidence in many domains and levels of a metacognitive hierarchy (spanning confidence in low level perceptual decisions to ideas of self-worth) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoven et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seow et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, inflated confidence in compulsivity may be based on more specific biases in learning and inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seow and Gillan, 2020</xref>). The present study was observational and therefore did not randomly assign participants to a different treatments. To partially remediate that limitation, we included two smaller groups receiving antidepressant medication and a control group. Levels of transdiagnostic psychiatric dimensions remained stable across time among controls, while they significantly improved in the antidepressant arm. Similarly to iCBT, we found that confidence improved in the antidepressant group, but not among controls. The interaction, however, was not significant, meaning that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that confidence improved to the same degree across the three groups. As increased task difficulty among clinical groups was not significantly greater relative to controls, changes in task difficulty may simply reflect greater task familiarity at follow-up across groups, as opposed to gains in general perceptual performance among clinical arms. Examining the three groups together, the data suggests that confidence changes are unlikely to be treatment specific, rather, confidence fluctuates in tandem with anxious-depression. This was evident in an overall association between change in anxious-depression and change in confidence that was not modified by treatment arm. Additionally, levels of iCBT engagement and concurrent treatments did not bolster changes in confidence. Overall, the results indicated that metacognition fluctuates with anxious-depression state, regardless of treatment type or exposure. Future research with larger samples are required to address this definitively.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>Confidence change and anxious-depression change were significantly but weakly associated. Similarly, the relative change in confidence across treatment arms was small. Therefore, while tests of metacognitive confidence can inform theoretical models, like most cognitive tests, they are likely of limited utility in clinical practice, at least when used in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mogoa»ôe et al., 2017</xref>). Given the complexity of mental health causes and presentations, multivariable models are needed to see practical value from such tests. We did not assess confidence or anxious-depression to treatment cessation and so the causal path and temporal dependence, if they exist, cannot be derived from these data. Future research should consider assessing metacognition and anxious-depression continuously through treatment, in order to elucidate the causal relationship between anxious-depression and metacognition with mediation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Newby et al., 2014</xref>). More intensive, repeating testing in future studies may also reveal the temporal window at which metacognition has the propensity to change, which could be more momentary in nature. While this study examined changes in metacognition with iCBT generally, future research should examine if the strength of the association between confidence change and anxious-depression change is greater following iCBT modules targeting metacognition or following metacognitive intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Philipp et al., 2020</xref>). The iCBT programs in this study primarily targeted depression and anxiety, which may explain why changes in confidence did not scale with improvements in compulsivity. Future research is required to assess if treatments aimed at compulsive disorders decrease the over-confidence commonly observed in those high in compulsivity and intrusive thought. As the antidepressant and control groups were much smaller than the iCBT arm, we were unable to compare changes in confidence across the types of antidepressant medications individuals received and we were underpowered more generally for individual differences analyses and multi-arm comparisons. Exploratory analyses were nonetheless presented and can form the basis for future investigations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings replicated the cross-sectional evidence that higher levels of anxious-depression are associated with under-confidence.

Individuals in the control group received an adapted version of the WSAS, which asks them to rate their level of impairment from ‚Äòtheir problems‚Äô more generally. Each WSAS item was scored from 0 ‚Äònot at all‚Äô to 8 ‚Äòvery severely‚Äô, with overall scores ranging from 0 to 40.

On each trial, participants were shown a fixation cross for 1000 milliseconds (ms), followed by two sunflowers with a varying number of seeds for 300ms. Participants then had unlimited time to make a judgement on which of two sunflower stimuli contained more seeds and then rated their confidence in each judgement, on a scale from ‚Äò1=Guessing‚Äô to ‚Äò6=Certain‚Äô. There was a total of 210 trials, divided equally into five blocks. While participants were given feedback on which sunflower they had chosen for 500ms, there was no trial-level feedback provided on their performance. Split-half reliability was high for baseline mean confidence, as indicated by the correlation between odd and even trials across each participant in the iCBT arm (r(647)=0.98, p&lt;0.001). Mean accuracy was tightly controlled in this task using a ‚Äòtwo-down one-up‚Äô staircase procedure, in which equally sized changes in dot difference occurred after each incorrect response and after two consecutive correct responses. This maintained objective performance across all participants at a desired level of 70% correct, crucial for estimating metacognition without any confound of real performance differences. Changes in dot difference were calculated using log-space, with a start log difference of 4.2 (+70 dots). Differences in step size changed by ¬± 0.4 for the first five trials, ¬± 0.2 for the next five trials and ¬± 0.1 for the remainder of the task. Dot difference on each trial could range from six dots (1.79 in log-space, the most difficult to discriminate) to 81 dots (4.39 in log-space, the easiest to discriminate).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Treatment data</title><p>Every week, participants self-reported if they had adhered to iCBT or their antidepressant medications each week. Participants also reported if they had started any new concurrent medications and/or psychological treatments for mental health each week. Starting new medication and/or psychological treatments and treatment nonadherence during the study were not grounds for exclusion in any group. Objective indicators of treatment engagement were provided by SilverCloud for 640 participants in the iCBT arm, which comprised of percentage of program viewed, time (minutes) spent in the program, and program type.

To examine pre-post changes, we carried out linear mixed-effects models with measures of metacognition or psychopathology as the dependent variable, time (baseline = 0; follow-up=1) as the independent variable and participants as random effects. To determine the association between change in confidence and change in anxious-depression, we used (1) Pearson correlation analysis to correlate change indices for both measures and, (2) regression-based repeated-measures analysis: mean confidence ~time*anxious-depression score change, where mean confidence is entered with two datapoints (one for pre- and one for post-treatment i.e., within-person) and anxious-depression change is a single value per person (between-person change score). Exploratory linear regression analyses tested the specificity of the effects, replacing anxious-depression with each of the measures of psychopathology in turn as follows: Mean confidence ~time*dimension/psychiatric scale score change. We additionally ran regression analyses to test if concurrent treatment or the degree of objective engagement in iCBT interacted with the effect of time on mean confidence. Exploratory ANOVA analyses were also conducted to compare changes in anxious-depression, task difficulty and confidence across the three arms directly. For all tests, statistical significance was defined as p&lt;0.05, with two-tailed p-values used. All regressors were scaled as Z scores to compare the regression coefficients of independent variables within each model. Adjustments for multiple comparisons were not conducted for analyses of replicated effects, or exploratory analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Althouse, 2016</xref>).

This study sought to investigate these results, which have been replicated several times but only in cross-sectional studies. This work applies a perceptual decision-making task with confidence ratings and a transdiagnostic psychometric questionnaire battery to participants before and after an iCBT course. The iCBT course reduced AD scores in participants, and their mean confidence ratings increased without a change in performance. Participants with larger AD changes had larger confidence changes. These results were also shown in a separate smaller group receiving antidepressant medication. A similar sized control group with no intervention did not show changes.</p><p>The major strength of the study is the elegant and well-powered data set. Longitudinal data on this scale is very difficult to collect, especially with patient cohorts, so this approach represents an exciting breakthrough. Analysis is straightforward and clearly presented. However, no multiple comparison correction is applied despite many different tests. While in general I am not convinced of the argument in the citation provided to justify this, I think in this case the key results are not borderline (p&lt;0.001) and many of the key effects are replications, so there are not so many novel/exploratory hypothesis and in my opinion the results are convincing and robust as they are. The supplemental material is a comprehensive description of the data set, which is a useful resource.</p><p>The authors achieved their aims, and the results clearly support the conclusion that the AD and mean confidence in a perceptual task covary longitudinally.</p><p>I think this study provides an important impact to the project of computational psychiatry.Sspecifically, it shows that the relationship between transdiagnostic symptom dimensions and behaviour is meaningful within as well as across individuals.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87193.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The authors of this study investigated the relationship between (under)confidence and the anxious-depressive symptom dimension in a longitudinal intervention design. The aim was to determine whether confidence bias improves in a state-like manner when symptoms improve. The primary focus was on patients receiving internet-based CBT (iCBT; n=649), while secondary aims compared these changes to patients receiving antidepressants (n=82) and a control group (n=88).</p><p>The results support the authors' conclusions, and the authors convincingly demonstrated a weak link between changes in confidence bias and anxious-depressive symptoms (not specific to the intervention arm)</p><p>The major strength and contribution of this study is the use of a longitudinal intervention design, allowing the investigation of how the well-established link between underconfidence and anxious-depressive symptoms changes after treatment. Furthermore, the large sample size of the iCBT group is commendable. The authors employed well-established measures of metacognition and clinical symptoms, used appropriate analyses, and thoroughly examined the specificity of the observed effects.</p><p>However, due to the small effect sizes, the antidepressant and control groups were underpowered, reducing comparability between interventions and the generalizability of the results. The lack of interaction effect with treatment makes it harder to interpret the observed differences in confidence, and practice effects could conceivably account for part of the difference. Finally, it was not completely clear to me why, in the exploratory analyses, the authors looked at the interaction of time and symptom change (and group), since time is already included in the symptom change index.</p><p>This longitudinal study informs the field of metacognition in mental health about the changeability of biases in confidence. It advances our understanding of the link between anxiety-depression and underconfidence consistently found in cross-sectional studies. The small effects, however, call the clinical relevance of the findings into question. I would have found it useful to read more in the discussion about the implications of the findings (e.g., why is it important to know that the confidence bias is state-dependent; given the effect size of the association between changes in confidence and symptoms, is the state-trait dichotomy the right framework for interpreting these results; suggestions for follow-up studies to better understand the association).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87193.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This study reports data collected across time and treatment modalities (internet CBT (iCBT), pharmacological intervention, and control), with a particularly large sample in the iCBT group. This study addresses the question of whether metacognitive confidence is related to mental health symptoms in a trait-like manner, or whether it shows state-dependency. The authors report an increase in metacognitive confidence as anxious-depression symptoms improve with iCBT (and the extent to which confidence increases is related to the magnitude of symptom improvement), a finding that is largely mirrored in those who receive antidepressants (without the correlation between symptom change and confidence change). I think these findings are exciting because they directly relate to one of the big assumptions when relating cognition to mental health - are we measuring something that changes with treatment (is malleable), so might be mechanistically relevant, or even useful as a biomarker?</p><p>This work is also useful in that it replicates a finding of heightened confidence in those with compulsivity, and lowered confidence in those with elevated anxious-depression.</p><p>One caveat to the interest of this work is that it doesn't allow any causal conclusions to be drawn, and only measures two timepoints, so it's hard to tell if changes in confidence might drive treatment effects (but this would be another study). The authors do mention this in the limitations section of the paper.</p><p>Another caveat is the small sample in the antidepressant group.</p><p>Some thoughts I had whilst reading this paper: to what extent should we be confident that the changes are not purely due to practice? I appreciate there is a relationship between improvement in symptoms and confidence in the iCBT group, but this doesn't completely rule out a practice effect (for instance, you can imagine a scenario in which those whose symptoms have improved are more likely to benefit from previously having practiced the task).</p><p>Relatedly, to what extent is there a role for general task engagement in these findings? The paper might be strengthened by some kind of control analysis, perhaps using (as a proxy for engagement) the data collected about those who missed catch questions in the questionnaires.</p><p>I was also unclear what the findings about task difficulty might mean.

Longitudinal data on this scale is very difficult to collect, especially with patient cohorts, so this approach represents an exciting breakthrough. Analysis is straightforward and clearly presented. However, no multiple comparison correction is applied despite many different tests. While in general I am not convinced of the argument in the citation provided to justify this, I think in this case the key results are not borderline (p&lt;0.001) and many of the key effects are replications, so there are not so many novel/exploratory hypothesis and in my opinion the results are convincing and robust as they are. The supplemental material is a comprehensive description of the data set, which is a useful resource.</p><p>The authors achieved their aims, and the results clearly support the conclusion that the AD and mean confidence in a perceptual task covary longitudinally. I think this study provides an important impact to the project of computational psychiatry.Sspecifically, it shows that the relationship between transdiagnostic symptom dimensions and behaviour is meaningful within as well as across individuals.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for their appraisal of our paper and positive feedback on the main manuscript and supplementary information. We agree with the reviewer that the lack of multiple comparison corrections can also justified by key findings being replications and not borderline significance. We have added this additional justification to the manuscript (Methods, Statistical Analyses, page 15, line 568: ‚ÄúAdjustments for multiple comparisons were not conducted for analyses of replicated effects‚Äù)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>[‚Ä¶] The major strength and contribution of this study is the use of a longitudinal intervention design, allowing the investigation of how the well-established link between underconfidence and anxious-depressive symptoms changes after treatment. Furthermore, the large sample size of the iCBT group is commendable. The authors employed well-established measures of metacognition and clinical symptoms, used appropriate analyses, and thoroughly examined the specificity of the observed effects.</p><p>However, due to the small effect sizes, the antidepressant and control groups were underpowered, reducing comparability between interventions and the generalizability of the results. The lack of interaction effect with treatment makes it harder to interpret the observed differences in confidence, and practice effects could conceivably account for part of the difference. Finally, it was not completely clear to me why, in the exploratory analyses, the authors looked at the interaction of time and symptom change (and group), since time is already included in the symptom change index.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for their succinct summary of the main results and strengths of our study. We apologise for the confusion in how we described that analysis. We examine state-dependence., i.e. the relationship between symptom change and metacognition change, in two ways in the paper ‚Äì perhaps somewhat redundantly. (1) By correlating change indices for both measures (e.g. as plotted in Figure 3D) and (2) by doing a very similar regression-based repeated-measures analysis, i.e. mean confidence ~ time*anxious-depression score change. Where mean confidence is entered with two datapoints ‚Äì one for pre- and one for post-treatment (i.e. within-person) and anxious-depression change is a single value per person (between-person change score). This allowed us to test if those with the biggest change in depression had a larger effect of time on confidence. This has been added to the paper for clarification (Methods, Statistical Analysis, page 14, line 553-559: ‚ÄúTo determine the association between change in confidence and change in anxious-depression, we used (1) Pearson correlation analysis to correlate change indices for both measures and, (2) regression-based repeated-measures analysis: mean confidence ~ time*anxious-depression score change, where mean confidence is entered with two datapoints (one for pre- and one for post-treatment i.e., within-person) and anxious-depression change is a single value per person (between-person change score)‚Äù).</p><p>The analyses have also been reported as regression in the Results for consistency (Treatment Findings: iCBT, page 5, line 197-204: ‚ÄòTo test if changes in confidence from baseline to follow-up scaled with changes in anxious-depression, we ran a repeated measure regression analyses with per-person changes in anxious-depression as an additional independent variable<bold>.</bold> We found this was the case, evidenced by a significant interaction effect of time and change in anxious-depression on confidence (b=-0.12, SE=0.04, p=0.002)‚Ä¶ This was similarly evident in a simple correlation between change in confidence and change in anxious-depression (r(647)=-0.12, p=0.002)‚Äù).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This longitudinal study informs the field of metacognition in mental health about the changeability of biases in confidence. It advances our understanding of the link between anxiety-depression and underconfidence consistently found in cross-sectional studies. The small effects, however, call the clinical relevance of the findings into question. I would have found it useful to read more in the discussion about the implications of the findings (e.g., why is it important to know that the confidence bias is state-dependent; given the effect size of the association between changes in confidence and symptoms, is the state-trait dichotomy the right framework for interpreting these results; suggestions for follow-up studies to better understand the association).</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for this comment. We have elaborated on the implications of our findings in the Discussion, including the relevance of the state-trait dichotomy to future research and how more intensive, repeated testing may inform our understanding of the state-like nature of metacognition (Discussion, Limitations and Future Directions, page 10, line 378-380: ‚ÄúMore intensive, repeating testing in future studies may also reveal the temporal window at which metacognition has the propensity to change, which could be more momentary in nature.‚Äù).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>[‚Ä¶] I think these findings are exciting because they directly relate to one of the big assumptions when relating cognition to mental health - are we measuring something that changes with treatment (is malleable), so might be mechanistically relevant, or even useful as a biomarker?</p><p>This work is also useful in that it replicates a finding of heightened confidence in those with compulsivity, and lowered confidence in those with elevated anxious-depression.</p><p>One caveat to the interest of this work is that it doesn't allow any causal conclusions to be drawn, and only measures two timepoints, so it's hard to tell if changes in confidence might drive treatment effects (but this would be another study). The authors do mention this in the limitations section of the paper.</p><p>Another caveat is the small sample in the antidepressant group.</p><p>Some thoughts I had whilst reading this paper: to what extent should we be confident that the changes are not purely due to practice? I appreciate there is a relationship between improvement in symptoms and confidence in the iCBT group, but this doesn't completely rule out a practice effect (for instance, you can imagine a scenario in which those whose symptoms have improved are more likely to benefit from previously having practiced the task).</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for commenting on the implications of our findings and we agree with the caveats listed. We thank the reviewer for raising this point about practice effects. A key thing to note is that this task does not have a learning element with respect to the core perceptual judgement (i.e., accuracy), which is the target of the confidence judgment itself. While there is a possibility of increased familiarity with the task instructions and procedures with repeated testing, the task is designed to adjust the difficulty to account of any improvements, so accuracy is stable. We see that we may not have made this clear in some of our language around accuracy vs. perceptual difficulty and have edited the Results to make this distinction clearer (Treatment Findings: iCBT, pages 4-5, lines 184-189: ‚ÄúAlthough overall accuracy remained stable due to the staircasing procedure, participants‚Äô ability to detect differences between the visual stimuli improved. This was reflected as the overall increase in task difficulty to maintain the accuracy rates from baseline (dot difference: M=41.82, SD=11.61) to follow-up (dot difference: M=39.80, SD=12.62), (b=-2.02, SE=0.44, p&lt;0.001, r2=0.01)‚Äù.)</p><p>However, it is true that there can be a ‚Äòpractice‚Äô effect in the sense that one may feel more confident (despite the same accuracy level) due to familiarity with a task. One reason we do not subscribe to the proposed explanation for the link between anxious-depression change and confidence change is that the other major aspect of behaviour that improved with practice did so in a manner unrelated to clinical change. As noted above in the quoted text, participants‚Äô discrimination improved from baseline to follow-up, reflected in the need for higher difficulty level to maintain accuracy around 70%. Crucially, this was not associated with symptom change. This speaks against a general mechanism where symptom improvement leads to increased practice effects in general. Only changes in confidence specifically are associated with improved symptoms. We have provided more detail on this in the Discussion (page 9, lines 324-326: ‚ÄúThis association with clinical improvements was specific to metacognitive changes, and not changes in task performance, suggesting that changes in confidence do not merely reflect greater task familiarity at follow-up.‚Äù).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Relatedly, to what extent is there a role for general task engagement in these findings? The paper might be strengthened by some kind of control analysis, perhaps using (as a proxy for engagement) the data collected about those who missed catch questions in the questionnaires.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for your comment. We included the details of data quality checks in the Supplement. Given the small number of participants that failed more than one attention checks (1% of the iCBT arm) and that all those participants passed the task exclusion criteria, we made the decision to retain these individuals for analyses. We have since examined if excluding these small number of individuals impacts our findings. Excluding those that failed more than one catch item did not affect the significance of results, which has now been added to the Supplementary Information (Data Quality Checks: Task and Clinical Scales, page 5, lines 181-185: ‚ÄúAdditionally, excluding those that failed more than one catch item in the iCBT arm did not affect the significance of results, including the change in confidence (b=0.16, SE=0.02, p&lt;0.001), change in anxious-depression (b=-0.32, SE=0.03, p&lt;0.001), and the association between change in confidence and change in anxious-depression (r(638)=-0.10, p=0.011)‚Äù).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I was also unclear what the findings about task difficulty might mean. Are confidence changes purely secondary to improvements in task performance generally - so confidence might not actually be 'interesting' as a construct in itself? The authors could have commented more on this issue in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for this comment and sorry it was not clear in the original paper. As we discussed in a prior reply, accuracy ‚Äì i.e. proportion of correct selections (the target of confidence judgements) are different from the difficulty of the dot discrimination task that each person receives on a given trial. We had provided more details on task difficulty in the Supplement. Accuracy was tightly controlled in this task using a ‚Äòtwo-down one-up‚Äô staircase procedure, in which equally sized changes in dot difference occurred after each incorrect response and after two consecutive correct responses. The task is more difficult when the dot difference between stimuli is lower, and less difficult when the dot difference between stimuli is greater. Therefore, task difficulty refers to the average dot difference between stimuli across trials. Crucially, task accuracy did not change from baseline to follow-up, only task difficulty. Moreover, changes in task difficulty were not associated with changes in anxious-depression, while changes in confidence were, indicating confidence is the clinically relevance construct for change in symptoms.</p><p>We appreciate that this may not have been clear from the description in the main manuscript, and have added more detail on task difficulty to the Methods (Metacognition Task, page 14, lines 540-542: ‚ÄúTask difficulty was measured as the mean dot difference across trials, where more difficult trials had a lower dot difference between stimuli.‚Äù) and Results (Treatment Findings: iCBT, pages 4-5, lines 184-186: ‚ÄúAlthough overall accuracy remained stable due to the staircasing procedure, participants‚Äô ability to detect differences between the visual stimuli improved.‚Äù). We have also elaborated more on how improvements in symptoms are associated with change in confidence, not task performance in the Discussion (page 9, lines 324-326: ‚ÄúThis association with clinical improvements was specific to metacognitive changes, and not changes in task performance, suggesting that changes in confidence do not merely reflect greater task familiarity at follow-up‚Äù).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To make code more reproducible, the authors could have produced an R notebook that could be opened in the browser without someone downloading the data, so they could get a sense of the analyses without fully reproducing them.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for your comment. We appreciate that an R notebook would be even better than how we currently share the data and code. While we will consider using Notebooks in future, we checked and converting our existing R script library into R Notebooks would require a considerable amount of reconfiguration that we cannot devote the time to right now. We hope that nonetheless the commitment to open science is clear in the extensive code base, commenting and data access we are making available to readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Rather than reporting full study details in another publication I would have found it useful if all relevant information was included in a supplement (though it seems much of it is).

For this reason, we tried to provide all that was necessary and only refer to the Precision in Psychiatry study methods for fine-grained detail. Upon review, the only thing we think we omitted that is relevant is information on ethical approval in the manuscript, which we have now added (Methods, Participants, page 11, lines 412-417: ‚ÄúFurther details of the PIP study procedures that are not specific to this study can be found in a prior publication (21).
