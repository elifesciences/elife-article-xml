Unlike rigidity, homeostasis necessitates that systems respond flexibly to diverse environments. Understanding the dynamics of biochemical systems when subjected to perturbations is essential for the development of a quantitative theory of homeostasis. In this study, we analyze the response of bacterial metabolism to externally imposed perturbations using kinetic models of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>’s central carbon metabolism in nonlinear regimes. We found that three distinct kinetic models consistently display strong responses to perturbations; in the strong responses, minor initial discrepancies in metabolite concentrations from steady-state values amplify over time, resulting in significant deviations. This pronounced responsiveness is a characteristic feature of metabolic dynamics, especially since such strong responses are seldom seen in toy models of the metabolic network. Subsequent numerical studies show that adenyl cofactors consistently influence the responsiveness of the metabolic systems across models. Additionally, we examine the impact of network structure on metabolic dynamics, demonstrating that as the metabolic network becomes denser, the perturbation response diminishes—a trend observed commonly in the models. To confirm the significance of cofactors and network structure, we constructed a simplified metabolic network model underscoring their importance. By identifying the structural determinants of responsiveness, our findings offer implications for bacterial physiology, the evolution of metabolic networks, and the design principles for robust artificial metabolism in synthetic biology and bioengineering.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>systems modeling</kwd><kwd>network</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>kinetic model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP 21K20626</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Himeoka</surname><given-names>Yusuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP 22K15069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Himeoka</surname><given-names>Yusuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP 22H05403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Himeoka</surname><given-names>Yusuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP 22K21344</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furusawa</surname><given-names>Chikara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.52926/JPMJER1902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furusawa</surname><given-names>Chikara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.52926/JPMJGX23B4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Himeoka</surname><given-names>Yusuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A computational study reveals that the kinetic models of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> metabolism show strong responsiveness to perturbations and that it originates from cofactor dynamics and network sparsity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>For bacterial cells steadily growing under fixed, substrate-rich culture conditions, several quantitative laws pertaining to the physiology of growing bacteria have been identified. These include the linear association between growth rate and the ribosomal fraction in total proteomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schaechter et al., 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scott et al., 2010</xref>), the linear relationship linking substrate uptake to growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pirt, 1965</xref>), and the correlations between transcriptional responses to various sublethal stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaneko et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, the dynamic aspects of bacterial physiology have garnered significant attention. A wealth of intriguing phenomena under such conditions has been gradually revealed. For instance, cells can ‘remember’ the duration of starvation and the nature of environmental changes—such as the rate at which nutrients deplete—and this can dramatically alter the distribution of lag times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaplan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Himeoka and Kaneko, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levin-Reisman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Himeoka et al., 2022a</xref>). Both the proteome and metabolome of starved cells display characteristically slow dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Radzikowski et al., 2016</xref>). The metabolites used for storage play a pivotal role in fluctuating environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sekar et al., 2020</xref>). Further, there is a trade-off between the growth rate under nutrient-rich conditions and other physiological parameters, namely, the lag time upon nutrient shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basan et al., 2020</xref>) and the death rate under starved conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biselli et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To achieve a comprehensive understanding of physiological responses, the development of quantitative theories that elucidate the dynamics of cellular physiology is indispensable. Metabolism, often a primary trigger for physiological transitions, stands at the forefront of efforts to forge a unified perspective on the dynamics of bacterial physiology. To this end, extensive research has been undertaken to understand the dynamic responses of metabolic systems using mathematical frameworks; the metabolic control analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heinrich and Rapoport, 1974</xref>), the biochemical systems theory, especially S-systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Savageau, 1988</xref>), and the linear stability analysis of mass-balance kinetic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chakrabarti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). The exploration of the study on the stability and responsiveness of the metabolic system is limited only to the linear region except S-systems. However, the S-system approach omits the mass-balance. The mass-balance condition, or, in other words, the stoichiometric constraints, is known to have a strong impact on the dynamics of chemical reaction systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feinberg, 2019</xref>). For the development of theoretical foundations of metabolic dynamics, it is essential to explore the dynamic responses of mass-balancing metabolism beyond the linear regime.</p><p>In this article, we examine the mass-balancing kinetic models of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>’s central carbon metabolism and ask how the metabolic state responds to perturbations with which the linear approximation is no longer valid. We study three independently proposed kinetic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chassagnole et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khodayari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boecker et al., 2021</xref>) and explore the features shared among the models. We demonstrate that the three models exhibit strong responses to perturbations on the metabolic states. The effects of these perturbations are magnified, leading to significant deviations in metabolite concentrations from their steady-state values, depending on which and how metabolite concentrations are perturbed. The observed responsiveness is a hallmark of the realistic metabolic network as the toy metabolic models lack such a strong response. Computational analysis revealed that cofactors, such as ATP and ADP, play a crucial role in the strong response to perturbations. We also discovered the importance of the sparse structure of the metabolic network by adding virtual reactions to it. To validate our findings, we developed a simple, minimal model of metabolic reactions, and confirmed that cofactor dynamics and network sparsity are indeed the key ingredients of the strong responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Model</title><p>In the present study, we investigate the dynamic response of metabolic states to perturbations in metabolite concentrations using kinetic models of <italic>E. coli</italic> central carbon metabolism. In kinetic modeling approaches, the temporal evolution of metabolites’ concentrations is modeled using ordinary differential equations to capture behaviors in out-of-steady-state metabolism.</p><p>We employ three kinetic models of <italic>E. coli</italic>’s central carbon metabolism, emphasizing the common features exhibited by the models. A limitation of kinetic models is their specificity; unlike constraint-based modeling, kinetic modeling necessitates extensive biochemical information, such as the function form of the reaction rate equation and the parameter values for each reaction. By examining a single kinetic model, conclusions may apply only to that specific model. Therefore, our focus lies on the shared features of the three models to circumvent the limitations of individual model specificity. We also believe there is potential for the results obtained commonly among the models to apply to real biological systems as well.</p><p>The models under consideration are those proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chassagnole et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khodayari et al., 2014</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boecker et al., 2021</xref>.

If any metabolite concentrations become negative, the response coefficient is incomputable and ‘0’ is assigned to such trajectories (note that the minimum value of the response coefficient is unity). Since the response coefficient is based on the logarithm of the concentrations, as the metabolite concentrations approach zero, the response coefficient becomes larger. The high response coefficient in the Boecker and Chassagnole model will be explained by this artifact. The linearized Khodayari model shows either <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> (one or more metabolite concentrations become negative).This could be due to the number of variables in the model. For the response coefficient to have a larger value, the perturbation should be along the eigenvector that leads to oscillatory dynamics with long relaxation time (i.e., the corresponding eigenvalue has a small real part in terms of absolute value and a nonzero imaginary part). However, since the Khodayari model has about 800 variables, if perturbations are along such directions, there is a high probability that one or more metabolite concentrations will become negative.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-98800-fig1-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>The response coefficient distribution of each model obtained by the perturbation-response simulation with different perturbation strengths (20%, 40%, and 60% relative perturbation).</title><p>Each distribution is obtained by simulating 4096 trajectories.

The Boecker model explicitly models biomass formation, considering several metabolites as biomass precursors that are consumed with a fixed stoichiometry to produce biomass. Conversely, the Khodayari and Chassagnole models do not incorporate the biomass formation reaction. Instead, biomass precursor metabolites are consumed independently, implying that the stoichiometry of biomass formation varies depending on the concentrations. The dilution effect due to the volume growth is modeled in both the Boecker and Chassagnole models. In the Boecker model, the dilution rate corresponds proportionally to the biomass formation reaction rate, while it remains constant in the Chassagnole model. The Khodayari model omits the dilution effect. In addition to the metabolic reaction implemented in each model, the specific forms of the reaction rate equations also differ among the models.</p><p>Within these models, the dynamics of gene regulation mediated by transcription factors are not modeled; that is, the total concentration of each metabolic enzyme is constant while the substrate-level regulations are incorporated into the models (the lists of substrate-level regulations are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a–c</xref>; for a detailed description, see ‘Materials and methods’).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Perturbation-response simulation</title><p>In this section, we present the results of a series of simulations, which we call perturbation-response simulations.

For the Chassagnole model, we numerically determined the steady-state attractor (details provided in ‘Materials and methods’).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>2. Generating the initial points by perturbation</title><p>Once the steady-state attractor has been computed, we establish a set of initial points for subsequent computations by perturbing the metabolite concentrations. This perturbation is a proxy for stochastic fluctuations within cells. We postulate that the perturbation source in the variability in protein concentrations is due to the inherent randomness of transcription and translation processes. Also, the cell division would be another source of perturbations of metabolites’ concentrations while the cell division is not explicitly considered in the study.

In one instance of the RCRN model, the ‘metabolites’ are interconnected through a random network, and every metabolite is considered a catalyst as well as a reactant. We generated 128 instances of the RCRN model, each having the same number of metabolites and the same distribution of the reaction rate constant. For instance, to draw a comparison with the Khodayari model, we generated the model instances with 778 metabolites and 3112 reactions, where the reaction rate constants are randomly chosen from that of the Khodayari model (detailed construction of the RCRN model is provided in ‘Materials and methods’). The top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref> presents the response coefficient distribution for each RCRN model instance, represented by different lines. Additionally, the ‘average’ response coefficient distribution, which is the mean of the distributions plotted in the top panel, is overlaid (green dotted line).

Across the models, metabolites that augment the response coefficient when their concentrations are fixed tend to be allosteric regulators associated with negative regulation. Freezing these metabolites’ concentrations effectively removes the negative feedback loop present in the metabolic systems. Typically, negative feedback stabilizes system behavior. In the present context, it assists the system in returning to its original state after perturbations. Hence, fixing these metabolites’ concentrations allows the system to respond more vigorously to perturbations compared to the original model. We checked the effect of feedback itself on the responsiveness rather than the concentration dynamics by weakening the strength of substrate-level regulation of OAA, FUM, AKG in the Boecker model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). It was shown that weakening the substrate-level regulation of CSICD by AKG and MDH by OAA increases the responsiveness. On the other hand, weakening the strength of substrate-level regulation of neither FRD by OAA nor MDH by FUM alters the responsiveness, and in addition there is no substrate-level regulation by SUC. The increase in responsiveness by fixing the concentrations of OAA and AKG would be explained by substrate-level regulation of the corresponding metabolites. However, substrate-level regulation is not sufficient to describe the effect of fixing the concentration of FUM and SUC. Higher order effects may be required.</p><p>Pyruvate is an exception to the above description, which is not the regulator in the models. The strong influence of pyruvate on the increase in response coefficients is attributed to the phosphotransferase system (PTS). The external glucose is taken up by converting phosphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate through the PTS. This reaction elevates pyruvate concentration, subsequently decelerating glucose uptake. By holding pyruvate concentration constant, this negative feedback effect is negated, enhancing the autocatalytic nature of the reaction system formed by the PTS and glycolysis (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf45"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">G</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">L</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo><mml:mo>⋯</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Role of the sparsity of the networks</title><p>The key role of AXPs in changing the kinetic models’ responsiveness is shown in the previous section. Nevertheless, this does not imply that all kinetic models of chemical reaction systems with cofactors such as AXPs always exhibit a strong response to perturbations. The strong responses demonstrated by the three models (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>) are absent in abstract toy models of metabolism, which consist of random reaction networks incorporating such cofactor chemicals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kondo and Kaneko, 2011</xref>. This discrepancy prompts us to investigate other potential determinants causing metabolic models to display strong responses shown in the three models.</p><p>A noteworthy attribute of metabolic networks is their inherent sparsity. While cofactors are linked to numerous reactions, the backbone networks—networks excluding cofactors—are distinctly sparse. As an example, the glycolytic pathway predominantly mirrors a linear sequence of reactions, resulting in many metabolites within this pathway participating in merely two reactions.</p><p>Does network structure play a role in the dynamics of metabolic systems? For this question, previous research in the opposite direction—reaction dynamics on dense networks—provides useful insights. Several studies use the random networks as an abstract model of metabolic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Furusawa and Kaneko, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaneko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Awazu and Kaneko, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Himeoka et al., 2022a</xref>). In such types of models, the effect of the initial perturbations on metabolite concentrations typically decays monotonically over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Awazu and Kaneko, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Himeoka and Mitarai, 2022b</xref>). This is in stark contrast to the behavior observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>.</p><p>Considering the inherent tendency of random reaction networks to display dynamics characterized by weak responses, we are compelled to investigate the influence of network sparseness on the dynamic behavior of metabolic models. To this end, we increase the reaction density of the metabolic network in the three models and assess the resultant changes in responsiveness.

We then execute a perturbation-response simulation on this extended model to determine the response coefficient, which in turn helps ascertain the distribution and average of these coefficients. This process is schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Change in the responsiveness by network expansion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic figure of the network expansion simulation.

The average response coefficient is then computed for each model, and the distribution of the average response coefficient is presented as the violin plots. In the perturbation-response simulation, the extended models with only a single attractor are subjected to the response coefficient analysis (comprehensive procedural details available in ‘Materials and methods’). Note that in this procedure metabolites are not newly introduced to the model, but only the reactions are. Thus, the reaction density increases.</p><p>As evident from the figures, a consistent trend emerges across the three models: the introduction of random reactions weakens responsiveness. However, the magnitude of this reduction varies among the models. It is important to note that the reactants of the added reactions are selected randomly, thus not based on any specific chemical rationale. Nevertheless, this diminished responsiveness persists even when the additional reactions are confined solely to those cataloged in the metabolic model database, as visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Such attenuation aligns with expectations shaped by prior studies on dense reaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Furusawa and Kaneko, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaneko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Awazu and Kaneko, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Himeoka et al., 2022a</xref>).

Our findings indicate that these models commonly exhibit strong and weak responses to perturbations of the steady-state concentration. In the weak response, the effect of the perturbation dwindles almost monotonically over time. In contrast, during a strong response, initial deviations from the steady state get amplified. Note that the linearized models cannot capture the response dynamics. We introduced the response coefficient, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf121"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, as a metric to quantify the strength of these responses and undertook comprehensive computational analyses. The strong responsiveness was observed not only in the three models studied in the article, but also in a model of glycolytic pathway with multiple sets of parameter choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haiman et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We aim to identify key metabolites whose dynamics play a crucial role in the emergence of strong response. We systematically fixed the concentration of each metabolite to its steady-state value and assessed the influence of individual metabolite dynamics on the overall response strength. For a majority of metabolites, the impact on the response coefficient is bidirectional: halting the dynamic concentration of a metabolite can either amplify or diminish the response, depending upon the base model. Even if their effects consistently amplify or diminish the response, the magnitude of change in the average response coefficients remains relatively modest.</p><p>However, three metabolites—ATP, ADP, and pyruvate—stood out. They consistently and significantly influenced the average response coefficient across models. Pyruvate’s pronounced impact can be attributed to the PTS, whereas the effects of ATP and ADP seem to arise synergistically across multiple reactions.</p><p>One of the authors has recently reported a kinetic model of <italic>E. coli</italic> metabolism to exhibit anomalous relaxations and the role of AXPs in the relaxations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Himeoka and Mitarai, 2022b</xref>). In the paper, they reduced the metabolic network into a coarse-grained minimal network. The minimal network revealed that, depending on the initial conditions, a futile cycle conversing ATP into AMP be overly active. Then, the futile cycle can deplete ATP and ADP, leading to a significant slowdown or even cessation of several ATP/ADP-coupled reactions, pushing the entire metabolic network into a ‘choked’ state. The extensive connectivity of AXPs is a common trait in metabolic models. Hence, it is plausible that the impact of AXPs’ dynamics on the entire metabolic system is a common feature irrespective of specific kinetic models.</p><p>Several experimental studies underscore the pivotal role of AXPs in metabolic homeostasis. For example, Teusink et al. demonstrated that in yeast a sudden increase in glucose levels in the culture medium can activate a positive feedback loop in ATP production in the glycolytic pathway, leading to growth arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Heerden et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Teusink et al., 1998</xref>). This phenomenon of growth arrest, triggered by a nutrient-level surge, has been observed across various bacterial species, including <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Strange and Hunter, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Postgate and Hunter, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calcott and Postgate, 1972</xref>), though its molecular mechanism has been most extensively studied in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Moreover, a rapid decrease in the total adenyl cofactor concentration as a cellular response to external glucose up-shift has been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Theobald et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kresnowati et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rizzi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walther et al., 2010</xref>). Walther et al. found that inhibiting this transient reduction in the adenyl cofactor pool increased the number of cells transitioning to a growth-arrested state upon glucose up-shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walther et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Next, we focused on the structure of the backbone network as suggested by the relatively simple dynamics typically observed in the random network metabolic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Furusawa and Kaneko, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaneko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Awazu and Kaneko, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Himeoka et al., 2022a</xref>). To this end, we increased the density of the backbone network in the three models by randomly selecting metabolites and introducing hypothetical reactions between them. The perturbation-response simulation on the extended models indicated that as more reactions were integrated, the system’s response weakened.</p><p>Finally, we devised a minimal model to evaluate our hypothesis that the dynamics of cofactors and the sparsity of the backbone network are pivotal determinants of responsiveness. This model successfully showed a strong response to perturbations when the fraction of reactions to be coupled with cofactors becomes high and the backbone network is sparse. It is worth noting that the heightened response due to cofactor coupling is not solely a result of the model equation’s increased nonlinearity. Interestingly, the model’s catalytic reaction variant demonstrated attenuated responses to perturbations, even though its nonlinearity mirrored that of the minimal model where all reactions were cofactor-coupled.</p><p>The present study showed that there are similar metabolic responses to perturbations across three distinct kinetic models of <italic>E. coli</italic> metabolism. We like to underscore that these models were proposed by different research groups and within distinct contexts. Furthermore, the specifics of each model diverge considerably: both the Khodayari and Chassagnole models are tailored for aerobic conditions, whereas the Boecker model is for anaerobic conditions. Certain reactions and metabolites present in the Khodayari model are absent in both the Boecker and Chassagnole models. The reaction rate functions and parameter values differ across these models because each model has been developed to recapitulate different experimental results. Yet, in spite of these pronounced disparities, the models exhibit converging characteristics to a certain degree, notably the pivotal role of AXPs and the diminishing responsiveness attributed to the addition of reactions. Such congruence in outcomes might hint at the presence of features that remain resilient against variations in model specifics, potentially being shaped by the foundational network structures inherent to core metabolic processes.</p><p>From a theoretical standpoint, the robustness of metabolic systems, as well as the interplay between network structure and reaction dynamics, has been explored in the chemical reaction network theory and related fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feinberg, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gutenkunst et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Himeoka et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kobayashi et al., 2022</xref>). However, the practical relevance of these theories to metabolic systems remains to be ascertained since the theories are mathematically rigorous and the strong assumptions narrow down the applicable systems. The cross-talk between bacterial physiology and chemical reaction network theory should enhance the developments of each field.</p><p>In the following sections, we discuss the potential implications of strong responsiveness in the context of biological sciences. The unique feature of strong responsiveness, as observed in our realistic metabolic model, naturally prompts the question: what could be its biological function? An initial hypothesis suggests its role in sensing ambient condition changes and fluctuations. Well-known design principles of signal transduction systems emphasize the amplification of external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferrell and Ha, 2014</xref>). Given that certain transcription factors are known to sense concentrations of metabolites in central carbon metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kotte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Okano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kochanowski et al., 2013</xref>), strong responsiveness could serve as an amplifier for external cues.</p><p>Exploring metabolic dynamics also holds promise for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shimizu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schwander et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-Even et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doerr et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claassens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kurisu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Opgenorth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Opgenorth et al., 2017</xref>). The construction of artificial metabolic reaction networks often relies on pathway prediction algorithms, constraint-based models, and machine learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moriya et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Varma and Palsson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Segler et al., 2018</xref>).

However, the steady-state dealt with in the article turned out to be unstable, that is, the maximum eigenvalue of the Jacobi matrix of the linearized system at the steady state was positive. For carrying out the perturbation-response simulation, we need to make the steady-state stable. To make the steady-state stable, we fixed the periplasmic hydrogen concentration to the steady-state value and removed the competitive inhibition of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (those two factors were manually found). Also, we set the concentrations of the metabolites in the culture media (extracellular metabolites) with the assumption that the model cell is growing in a sufficiently large flask. In addition, the small molecules, H<sub>2</sub>O, O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>, and phosphate, are set to be constant, further assuming that the exchange rate of the small chemicals between the extracellular culture is sufficiently fast.</p><p>For the dynamics of ATP and ADP concentrations, in the Chassagnole model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chassagnole et al., 2002</xref>), we used the reactions that coupled with ATP and ADP. Since the kinetic rate equations of those reactions are defined with the dependency of ATP and ADP concentrations in the original model, we utilized the kinetic rate equations as they are. The reactions for the adenine base synthesis are not modeled in the model, and thus, the total concentration of ATP and ADP is the conserved quantity in the model. By assuming that the decreases of the ATP and ADP due to the growth dilution are compensated, the growth dilution term is not introduced to the model equations of ATP and ADP concentrations. Lastly, we introduced the non-growth-associated ATP hydrolysis reaction (ATP→ADP) since the model fails to balance ATP and ADP and relaxes to a steady state where the concentration of some metabolites is almost zero. We utilized a simple Michaelis–Menten rate equation for the hydrolysis reaction <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf122"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msub><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf123"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.1</mml:mn><mml:mtext/><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf124"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.0</mml:mn><mml:mtext/><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula></p><p>The Boecker model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boecker et al., 2021</xref>) is used without modification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Computation of dynamics</title><p>All the ODE simulations in the present study are done using ode15s() function in MATLAB (MathWorks, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Inc, 2022</xref>).

by simulating the dynamics from 128 random initial concentrations. These initial conditions are generated by applying a 40% relative perturbation to the steady-state concentrations of the original model. If all the initial conditions converge to a single attractor, then we generate another set of 128 initial conditions by applying a 40% relative perturbation to the steady-state concentrations of the extended model in order to perform the perturbation-response simulation. For the Boecker model, we require the extended model to have a steady growth rate greater than half of that of the original model. This is because growth dilution is typically the slowest process in the model, and thus, a significant slowdown of growth dilution can lead to an artificial overestimation of the model’s responsiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Elementary reaction decomposition</title><p>Here, a brief description of the ERD is provided.

To quantify the response, systematic perturbation was performed in simulation and the maximal destabilization away from steady state (compared with initial perturbation distance) was characterized. The author analyzed the perturbation response and found that sparse network and networks with more cofactors are more &quot;stable&quot;, in the sense that the perturbed trajectories have smaller deviation along the path back to the steady state.</p><p>Strengths and major contributions:</p><p>The author compared three metabolic models and performed systematic perturbation analysis in simulation. This is the first work characterized how perturbed trajectories deviate from equilibrium in large biochemical systems and illustrated interesting findings about the difference between sparse biological systems and randomly simulated reaction networks.</p><p>Discussion and impact for the field:</p><p>Metabolic perturbation is an important topic in cell biology and has important clinical implication in pharmacodynamics. The computational analysis in this study provides an initiative for future quantitative analysis on metabolism and homeostasis.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>In the latest version of this work, the author included NADH, NADPH into the analysis, and perform some comparison about sensitivity analysis.

It would be helpful for the modeling community to understand better the differences and similarities in the obtained results. Do both methods identify substrate-level regulators? Is freezing a metabolite's dynamics dramatically changing the metabolic response (and if yes, which ones are so different in the two cases)? Does the scope of the network affect these differences and similarities?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions. We compared the Sobolʼ total sensitivity index with the absolute values of the change in the response coefficient (Figure S6 in the revised manuscript). There is no clear relationship between the two quantities. The Sobolʼ sensitivity analysis quantifies how a perturbation on the concentration of a metabolite X contributes to the overall dynamics. On the other hand, the analysis in which metabolitesʼ concentrations are fixed measures how strongly metabolite X helps propagate the perturbations on the other metabolites throughout the metabolic network. In other words, in the Sobolʼ analysis, we evaluate the outcome when the perturbation is applied directly to metabolite X, whereas in the fixing-metabolites analysis, we consider perturbations applied to other metabolites and assess how X influences those perturbations. We believe this conceptual difference explains why the two quantities do not correlate. We suspect that this lack of correlation is independent of the networkʼs scope, because each method evaluates a different aspect of the system. We would say that both methods identify the effect of the metabolite dynamics on the overall dynamics whatever the form is, i.e. the methods do not distinguish the perturbation on the metabolite affecting the overall dynamics by whether the stoichiometric (reactant) way or, the substrate-level regulations. Thus, identifying the substrate-level regulation by utilizing the methods would be challenging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Regarding the issues the authors encountered when performing the sensitivity analysis, they can be approached in two ways. First, the authors can check the methods for computing conserved moieties nicely explained by Sauro's group (doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bti800) and compute them for large-scale networks (but beware of metabolites that belong to several conserved pools). Otherwise, the conserved pools of metabolites can be considered as variables in the sensitivity analysis-grouping multiple parameters is a common approach in sensitivity analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful suggestion. Following the method described in the reference, we have computed the Sobolʼ sensitivity index of NADH, NADPH, and Q8H2 (with their counterparts algebraically solved and treated as dependent variables). We have updated Figure S5 accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
