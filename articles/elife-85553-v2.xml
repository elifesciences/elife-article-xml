clinic burden in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear, though, how this autoimmune disease progresses to the point of deterioration of the joint. Here, we report that in a mouse model of RA the upregulation of TLR2 expression and its α(2,3) sialylation in RANK<sup>+</sup> myeloid monocytes mediate the transition from autoimmunity to osteoclast fusion and bone resorption, resulting in joint destruction. The expression of α(2,3) sialyltransferases was significantly increased in RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> myeloid monocytes, and their inhibition or treatment with a TLR2 inhibitor blocked osteoclast fusion. Notably, analysis of our single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) libraries generated from RA mice revealed a novel RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>−</sup> a subset that negatively regulated osteoclast fusion. Importantly, the RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> subset was significantly diminished with the treatments, whereas the RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>−</sup> subset was expanded. Moreover, the RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>−</sup> subset could differentiate into a TRAP<sup>+</sup> osteoclast lineage, but the resulting cells did not fuse to form osteoclasts. Our scRNA-seq data showed that <italic>Maf</italic> is highly expressed in the RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>−</sup> subset, and the α(2,3) sialyltransferase inhibitor-induced <italic>Maf</italic> expression in the RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> subset. The identification of a RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>−</sup> subset provides a potential explanation for TRAP<sup>+</sup> mononuclear cells in bone and their anabolic activity. Further, TLR2 expression and its α(2,3) sialylation in the RANK<sup>+</sup> myeloid monocytes could be effective targets to prevent autoimmune-mediated joint destruction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>toll-like receptor 2</kwd><kwd>sialylation</kwd><kwd>osteoclast</kwd><kwd>fusion</kwd><kwd>rheumatoid arthritis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Toll-like Receptor 2</kwd><kwd>Sialylation</kwd><kwd>Osteoclast</kwd><kwd>Fusion; Rheumatoid Arthritis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG076783</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG068997</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 AG066603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The sialylation of RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes contributes to osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RA is one of the most prevalent autoimmune diseases. Knee and finger joint swelling, destruction, and pain are the common clinic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agemura et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smolen et al., 2016</xref>). The autoimmune-mediated chronic inflammation during RA progression stimulates excessive osteoclast formation and resorptive activity, leading to the destruction of the endochondral subchondral bone and cartilage of the joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hasegawa and Ishii, 2022</xref>). Previous research efforts in RA, which have been extensive, have mostly focused on the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in this inflammation-induced joint destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tsukasaki and Takayanagi, 2019</xref>). Even so, the exact mechanisms by which autoimmunity triggers osteoclast formation and thus joint destruction are still not completely understood. In recent years, inhibition of osteoclast formation by biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) has shown promise in the management of RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tanaka and Ohira, 2018</xref>). These drugs directly target inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and receptor activator of nuclear factor-кB ligand (RANKL), and clinic trials with these DMARDs, particularly anti-RANKL (Denosumab), have shown some efficacy in the reduction of osteoclast-mediated joint destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burmester and Pope, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schett and Gravallese, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tanaka and Tanaka, 2021</xref>). But as these cytokines are also important for general immunity, the use of these inhibitors, especially chronically, is not without significant side effects. Therefore, a more detailed understanding of the molecular signaling mechanism that underpins inflammatory-induced osteoclast fusion and resorptive activity could lead to the identification of a more efficacious and safer therapeutic strategy to slow or prevent joint destruction during RA progression.</p><p>Osteoclasts are multinucleated giant cells derived from the fusion of monocytes, and they mediate bone resorption. While macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) promotes monocyte survival and proliferation, RANKL is responsible for inducing the commitment of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP<sup>+</sup>) mononuclear cells to a preosteoclast fate, while also subsequently promoting their cell–cell fusion to form TRAP<sup>+</sup> multinuclear osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baroukh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2003</xref>). Significant progress has been made in the identification of the mechanism by which autoimmunity-derived inflammation increases the expression of RANKL and the subsequent increase in osteoclast formation during RA progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coury et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Okamoto et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, during autoimmunity dendritic cells present autoantigens to T cells, resulting in the generation of different T helper (Th) cells, including Th17 cells. Th17 cells, in turn, stimulate the fibroblast lineage cells to express RANKL, which activates innate immune cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, interleukin (IL)–1, and IL-6, which together promote osteoclast formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tsukasaki and Takayanagi, 2019</xref>). Forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3) is an indispensable transcription factor for Treg cell development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Komatsu and Takayanagi, 2018</xref>). Loss of Foxp3 expression generates a novel Th17 cell subset, termed exFoxp3Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Komatsu et al., 2014</xref>). These cells also induce osteoclast formation, primarily by up-regulating RANKL expression in mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Komatsu and Takayanagi, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In adults, bone is under constant remodeling due to microcracks that occur as a result of the stress of gravity that all terrestrial animals experience. As part of the remodeling process osteoclasts resorbs bone, which in turn results in the release from the bone surface of factors, including transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), that recruit MSCs to the local bone environment. The MSCs, in turn, are induced to differentiate into osteoblasts, which are the cells responsible for bone formation. This ‘coupling’ between osteoclast and osteoblast activities maintains proper bone homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng and Teitelbaum, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crane et al., 2016</xref>). Aberrant osteoclast formation or uncoupled osteoclast activity leads to many major skeletal disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schett and Gravallese, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Firestein, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rana et al., 2018</xref>), including RA-associated bone destruction.</p><p>The downstream signaling molecules involved in osteoclast fusion have been reported to include Dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP), Syncitin-1, OC-stimulatory transmembrane protein (OC-STAMP), CD9, and CD44/Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gambari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2003</xref>). We recently reported that sialylation of TLR2 induces it’s binding to Siglec-15 in TRAP<sup>+</sup> preosteoclasts to initiate cell-cell fusion during osteoclast formation. In particular, we found that RANKL induces the expression of the sialyltransferase ST3GAL1 via c-Fos, leading to the sialylation of TLR2 and thus it’s binding to Siglec-15. We further showed that intrafemoral injection of sialidase, to inhibit the sialylation, resulted in reduced osteoclast fusion and bone resorption in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dou et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, TRAP<sup>+</sup> cell recognition mediated by the binding of sialylated TLR2 to Siglec15 initiates cell fusion and mature osteoclast formation.</p><p>Sialylation-mediated control of osteoclast fusion provides a unique novel therapeutic target to treat joint destruction in RA. In this study, we sought to investigate whether inhibition of sialylation could reduce osteoclast formation and subsequent joint destruction in a mouse model of RA. Further, analysis of our scRNA-seq libraries revealed that RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> and RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>−</sup> myeloid subsets are associated with the regulation of osteoclast fusion. Along these lines, we found that in RA mice the RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> subset was significantly expanded relative to control mice, whereas injection of a sialylation inhibitor significantly decreased osteoclast formation and joint destruction and a decrease in the RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> subset. Thus, targeting this pathway may represent a novel therapeutic avenue in the treatment of RA-associated joint destruction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of RANK and TLR2 peaks in monocytes before they commit to a TRAP<sup>+</sup> macrophage lineage</title><p>To examine how autoimmunity is transformed into osteoclast joint destruction during RA progression, we prepared scRNA-seq libraries from single-cell suspensions from the bone marrow of CIA mice and vehicle-injected control mice. Quality control was performed to exclude potential doublets and low-quality libraries. We performed clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Traag et al., 2019</xref>) to identify the major transcriptional states in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Clusters were annotated based on known marker gene expression and differential gene expression, and SingleCellNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tan and Cahan, 2019a</xref>) was used to classify individual cells based on a well-annotated reference dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Once monocytes and macrophages were successfully identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), myeloid cells expressing marker genes relevant to our study of osteoclastogenesis—namely RANK (<italic>Tnfrsf11a</italic>), TRAP (<italic>Acp5</italic>), ST3GAL4 (<italic>St3gal4</italic>), and/or TLR2 (<italic>Tlr2</italic>)—were isolated and the data analysis was repeated on those cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Slingshot pseudotime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Street et al., 2018</xref>) was computed on this population, selecting macrophages as the terminal cluster. Pseudotime values were used to partition the cells into transcriptionally distinct stages, or ‘epochs,’ and to identify dynamically expressed genes. The expression of <italic>Tlr2</italic> and of two key myeloid/pre-osteoclast marker genes (<italic>Acp5</italic> and <italic>Tnfrsf11a</italic>) were found to significantly change across pseudotime, suggesting that these genes may play a temporal role in the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages in the pre-osteoclast lineage. We visualized the pseudotemporal expression of these genes (<italic>Tnfrsf11a, Acp5,</italic> and <italic>Tlr2</italic>) in pre-osteoclasts and found that <italic>Tlr2</italic> expression peaks in the late monocyte phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This peak in <italic>Tlr2</italic> expression directly precedes a peak in <italic>Tnfrsf11a</italic> expression at the monocyte-to-macrophage transition period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), implicating a key role for TLR2 in monocyte differentiation and osteoclastogenesis. Interestingly, a peak in sialyltransferase (<italic>St3gal4</italic>) expression coincides with that of <italic>Tlr2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We further found that <italic>Acp5</italic> mRNA levels increased following <italic>Tnfrsf11a</italic> expression in the macrophage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), validating the known role of RANKL in triggering the differentiation of myeloid cells into TRAP<sup>+</sup> mononuclear preosteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koga et al., 2004</xref>). To validate these characteristics of gene expression, we isolated the primary bone marrow monocytes and cultured them with an osteoclast induction medium (M-CSF 30 ng/ml, RANKL 200 ng/ml). We performed TRAP staining and immunofluorescence staining of RANK and TLR2 at 0, 1, 3, and 5 days of culturing, and we found that the percentage of TRAP<sup>+</sup> cells significantly increased following the different time points and come to a peak on day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). We further found that the number of multinuclear osteoclasts significantly increased from the third day onward, which occurred later than the peak expression of RANK protein and TLR2 protein, which both peaked on day 1 but then subsequently declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–G</xref>). This time course of RANK and TLR2 protein expression is consistent with the gene expression profile of the scRNA-seq data. These results show that increased expression of RANK and TRL2 is associated with the commitment of monocytes to a TRAP<sup>+</sup> lineage to promote osteoclast formation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of RANK (<italic>Tnfrsf11a</italic>), TLR2 (<italic>Tlr2</italic>), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) (<italic>Acp5</italic>) is elevated during the commitment of monocytes to a tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP<sup>+</sup>) lineage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dimensional reduction projection of monocyte and macrophage cells expressing RANK, TRAP, and/or TLR2 from all sample groups onto two dimensions using principal components, depicting values of Slingshot pseudotime followed by gene expression levels of <italic>St3gal4, Tlr2, Tnfrsf11a,</italic> and <italic>Acp5</italic>.

Taken together, our results show that pharmacological inhibition of α(2,3) sialylation in CIA mice results in less osteoclast fusion and differentiation of the RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> subset and thus less joint destruction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The current conceptual model in the field is that under the induction of RANKL signaling RANK<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells commit to a TRAP<sup>+</sup> lineage and subsequently undergo cell-cell fusion during osteoclast formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2003</xref>). And previously we found that sialylation of TLR2 allows it to be a receptor for Siglec15, thus promoting RANKL-induced osteoclast formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dou et al., 2022</xref>). But importantly we found here that even though both RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> or RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>−</sup> myeloid monocytes can commit to a TRAP<sup>+</sup> lineage downstream of RANKL signaling, only the RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> subset is competent to undergo cell-cell fusion during osteoclast formation. However, when α(2,3) sialylation is pharmacologically inhibited in vitro or in vivo, the RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> subset can differentiate into a TRAP<sup>+</sup> lineage and will not fuse.</p><p>These findings provide possible answers for some longstanding questions in bone biology while providing a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of joint destruction in RA. Notably, TRAP<sup>+</sup> cells at the periosteal surface have been observed to maintain their mononuclear cell type during the regulation of periosteal bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings suggest that these periosteal TRAP<sup>+</sup> mononuclear cells could be derived either from a RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>−</sup> myeloid subset or from a RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> subset that lacks α(2,3) sialylation. Also, as sufficient estrogen levels are essential to maintain the lifespan balance between preosteoclasts and mature osteoclasts, during menopause preosteoclasts rapidly fuse and osteoclast formation is markedly increased. As the incidence of RA markedly increases in post-menopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carlsten, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sapir-Koren and Livshits, 2017</xref>), an increase of the RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> subset and of α(2,3) sialylation could explain this increased incidence, while also contributing to both joint destruction in RA and osteoporosis in such women. Future studies are needed to explore the potential role of estrogen signaling in the regulation of the size of the RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> subset and of α(2,3) sialylation.</p><p>In this current study, we found that the size of the RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> subset was greater in the CIA mouse model of RA and that prophylactic treatment with the α(2,3) sialylation inhibitor soyasaponin Bb resulted in significantly less osteoclast formation and joint destruction compared to vehicle-treated CIA mice. Interestingly, while the treatment with soyasaponin Bb resulted in a smaller size of the RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> subset, suggesting that inhibition of α(2,3) sialylation also regulates the size of the RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> subsets. These findings complement those that have been previously reported that showed that treatment with agonists for TLR2 increases osteoclast formation with significant bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Souza and Lerner, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elshabrawy et al., 2017</xref>), and that TRAP<sup>+</sup> preosteoclasts derived from TLR2 knockout mice do not differentiate into mature osteoclasts upon RANKL stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nishimura et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, together these results show that TLR2 is essential for the fusion of RANK<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells during osteoclast formation, and that sialylation of TLR2 initiates the cell-cell recognition that occurs in osteoclast fusion. Importantly, inhibition of α(2,3) sialylation could be a potential target for RA-associated joint destruction, though further studies are needed to explore if the therapeutic use of such inhibitors can slow or even reverse the progression of such joint damage.</p><p>RANK<sup>+</sup> myeloid monocytes, regardless of their TLR2 expression, can differentiate into TRAP<sup>+</sup> osteoclastic lineage cells. Therefore, there are actually three different subtypes of TRAP<sup>+</sup> cells - RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>−</sup>, RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+un</sup>(unsialylated), and RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+sa</sup>(sialylated) - and they possess different roles in bone homeostasis. Characterization of the specific function of each subtype and their relationship with osteoblast differentiation, sensory innervation and angiogenesis will provide fundamental insights into bone biology. Notably, RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>−</sup> myeloid monocytes are a novel subset identified in this study. Analysis of our scRNA-seq libraries showed that <italic>Maf</italic> is highly expressed in these cells, and some of the important osteoclast fusion and differentiation genes are not expressed, which partly explains their non-fusion nature and their potential function. Importantly, these cells express bone anabolism-related genes, suggesting that although this novel subset can be committed to a TRAP<sup>+</sup> lineage they are not preosteoclasts and that they may function in the communication with osteoblastic cells for their osteogenesis during bone coupling. The TRAP<sup>+</sup> mononuclear cells from either the RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+un</sup> subset or the RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+sa</sup> subset are preosteoclasts. The α(2,3) sialylation controls the balance between preosteoclasts and osteoclasts in coupling osteoclastic bone resorption with type H vessel formation and osteogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xie et al., 2014</xref>). There are two α(2,3) sialyltransferases, <italic>St3gal1</italic> and <italic>St3gal4</italic>, expressed in RANK<sup>+</sup> myeloid monocytes during their differentiation to a TRAP<sup>+</sup> lineage. The balance between preosteoclasts and osteoclasts is likely regulated by the expression of these two α(2,3) sialyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hsu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2001</xref>) or sialidase, though cell-type specific knockout experiments are required to validate that notion. Even so, the regulation of the sizes of different RANK<sup>+</sup> subsets maintains the balance between osteoclast bone resorption and osteoblast bone formation, which is particularly important for joints. Leveraging this insight may allow for safer and more effective therapeutics to prevent or slow down joint destruction during RA progression, while potentially expanding such therapies to other forms of bone loss, such as age-related osteoporosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and in vivo treatment</title><p>DBA/1 J mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (strain number: 000670).

A single-cell suspension was obtained from the flushed bone marrow mixture of the mice femur (n=3 mice from each sample group (CIA vehicle-treated, CIA soyasaponin Bb treated, and DBA vehicle control)) and subjected to Ficoll gradient centrifugation to enrich for mononuclear cells. Samples were profiled based on viability and amount and a range of 81–85% viability was achieved. A total of 10,000 cells were recorded for each run, followed by GEM-RT and cDNA amplification. Single-cell library preparation was performed by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine for Genomics and Bioinformatics (Core facility) and the quality of cDNA samples was examined by an Agilent 2100 Expert High Sensitivity DNA Assay. Single-cell libraries were constructed by attaching P5 and P7 primer sites and sample indices to the cDNA. ScRNA-seq was performed on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S2 Flow Cell according to the manufacturer’s protocol to a depth ranging from 315 to 377 million reads per sample. The data is available in GEO under accession code GSE221704.</p><p>Quality control, filtering, and downstream analysis of scRNA-seq data: CellRanger (version 5.0.1) was used to perform the initial processing of sequencing reads and alignment to the mm10 reference genome. Quality control was performed in Seurat (version 4.0.3) for each individual sample prior to concatenation and batch correction. Quality control was performed to remove doublets, broken cells/fragments, and dead or dying cells. Cells were selected with total counts less than the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of total counts for that sample and less than 15% mitochondrial gene content. Features detected in fewer than five cells were excluded and cells expressing fewer than 200 features were excluded. Ribosomal genes, mitochondrial genes, and MALAT1 were removed from the feature list. Individual samples were log normalized and highly variable genes (HVGs) were computed using the variance stabilizing transformation method in Seurat. HVGs were computed for each individual sample and for all concatenated samples, and HVGs were selected as the union of all HVG lists. Individual samples were merged in Seurat and the resulting merged data were scaled and an estimation of the cell cycle phase was performed. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the merged data and batch correction was performed using Harmony (version 0.1.0) to obtain corrected principal components. UMAP embeddings, K nearest neighbors, and Leiden clusters (resolution 1.0) were computed on Harmonized principal components. The number of Harmonized PCs used to calculate the embeddings (n=35) was determined by inspection of the variance ratio plots to determine which PCs accounted for the majority of variation in the data.</p><p>Cluster annotation and differential gene expression analysis: Clusters were annotated based on marker gene expression, differential expression analysis on annotated clusters, and SingleCellNet classification. Differential gene expression analysis was performed in Seurat using the FindMarkers() function and Poisson method. The threshold for minimum percentage expression of a gene within a given cluster was set to 0.1 and the threshold for log fold change was set to 0.25. p-values were adjusted using p.adjust() function in R and results with FDR-adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 were used for cluster annotation. SingleCellNet version 0.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tan and Cahan, 2019a</xref>) was used to classify single cells in our data by training a top-pair Random Forest classifier on a well-annotated reference dataset of the mouse bone marrow (The Tabula Muris Consortium). The performance of the trained classifier for each cell type was assessed using a precision-recall curve prior to the classification of query data. Classification results were visualized using an attribution plot to depict the composition of each training data cell type within query data categories of interest (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pcahan1.github.io/singleCellNet/">https://pcahan1.github.io/singleCellNet/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tan and Cahan, 2019b</xref>). Following annotation, subpopulations of interest (i.e. RANK<sup>+</sup> monocytes and macrophages) were assigned to subsets from the larger dataset and the analysis steps above were repeated for each subpopulation. Plots of gene expression were made in Seurat using the DotPlot(), ViolinPlot(), and FeaturePlot() functions.</p><p>Slingshot pseudotime and dynamic gene regulatory network reconstruction: Slingshot pseudotime was computed on harmonized principal components for subpopulations of interest (RANK<sup>−</sup>, TRAP<sup>−</sup>, and/or TLR2<sup>−</sup> expressing monocytes/macrophages and RANK<sup>+</sup> monocytes/macrophages, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Street et al., 2018</xref>). Macrophages were selected as the end cluster. Pseudotime values were inputted into Epoch (version 0.0.0.9000) for dynamic gene regulatory network (GRN) reconstruction. Epoch was used to identify genes that were significantly dynamically expressed (p&lt;0.05) and GRN reconstruction was performed using the Pearson method with zThresh = 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Su et al., 2022</xref>). Epochs were defined using pseudotime to identify n=2 epochs, or pseudotemporal periods, per lineage. Differential network analysis was performed to compare dynamic GRNs from RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes/macrophages and RANK<sup>+</sup>TLR2<sup>−</sup> monocytes/macrophages with thresholds of 4.0 for differentially active edges and 7.0 for consideration of an edge in a given network. Plots of dynamic GRNs, top regulators and their targets, and differential networks were made in Epoch (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/pcahan1/epoch">https://github.com/pcahan1/epoch</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cahan Lab, 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>CHIP assay</title><p>Primary BMMs were isolated for CHIP assay according to the instruction from the Pierce Agarose CHIP Kit (Cat. 26156, Thermo Fisher) using a CHIP-grade antibody to c-Fos (mAb2250, Cell Signaling). In brief, we crosslinked the cell pellet using Glycine Solution after fixation in 1% formaldehyde. The cells were lysed in membrane extraction lysis buffer and nuclear extraction lysis buffer, along with MNase digestion (DTT, MNase Digestion Buffer). Of the sample, 10% was removed as an input control. CHIP was performed according to the protocol provided by manufacturers using an antibody to c-Fos. Anti-RNA polymerase II and control IgG were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The purified DNA was then analyzed by PCR and electrophoresis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Behavioral tests</title><p>Von Frey tests were performed to evaluate the response to a mechanical stimulus. The mice were placed on a metal wire plate with a clear plastic cage and were acclimatized for 1 hr before the test. The von Frey filament (0.4 g force, BIOSEB) was applied to the plantar surface of each hind paw continuously for three seconds or till paw withdrawal. The frequency of paw withdrawal was recorded during a total of ten applications, which included 2 s intervals between each repeat. The test was repeated at least three times for each mouse and the average frequency was processed for further analysis.</p><p><italic>Hargreaves tests</italic> were used on mice to examine the analgesia level. Groups of mice were utilized for the analgesia test, and they were allowed to acclimatize for 1 hr before the experiment. When animals were ready, the radiant heat produced by a strong light beam (IITC Life Science Inc) was applied to the plantar surface of each hind paw until they flicked the paw. The time was recorded as the latency time response to heat-producing light beam stimulation. The test was repeated at least three times for each mouse and the average latency was processed for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>We used SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) to perform the statistical analysis for all data. And we presented the results as mean ± standard deviations. The one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was used to analyze data among multiple groups. And an unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test was used to compare data between the two groups. For the scRNA-seq data, the Poisson test using the FindMarkers() function in Seurat for dot plot data, with FDR adjustment using p.adjust() in R for violin plot data for statistical analysis. For all experiments, p&lt;0.05 was considered to be significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>She made an important contribution to manuscript revising</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animals were kept in the Animal Facility of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
