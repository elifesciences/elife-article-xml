to better cope. The ISR has also been implicated in cancers, but redundancies in the stress-sensing kinases that trigger the ISR have posed hurdles to dissecting physiological relevance. To overcome this challenge, we targeted the regulatory node of these kinases, namely, the S51 phosphorylation site of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2α and genetically replaced eIF2α with eIF2α-S51A in mouse squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) stem cells of skin. While inconsequential under normal growth conditions, the vulnerability of this ISR-null state was unveiled when SCC stem cells experienced proteotoxic stress. Seeking mechanistic insights into the protective roles of the ISR, we combined ribosome profiling and functional approaches to identify and probe the functional importance of translational differences between ISR-competent and ISR-null SCC stem cells when exposed to proteotoxic stress. In doing so, we learned that the ISR redirects translation to centrosomal proteins that orchestrate the microtubule dynamics needed to efficiently concentrate unfolded proteins at the microtubule-organizing center so that they can be cleared by the perinuclear degradation machinery. Thus, rather than merely maintaining survival during proteotoxic stress, the ISR also functions in promoting cellular recovery once the stress has subsided. Remarkably, this molecular program is unique to transformed skin stem cells, hence exposing a vulnerability in cancer that could be exploited therapeutically.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>squamous cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>integrated stress response</kwd><kwd>translational control</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>cell biology</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuchs</surname><given-names>Elaine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ruth Kirschstein NIH Predoctoral Fellow</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30CA236239</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hurwitz</surname><given-names>Brian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Weill Cornell/Rockefeller/Sloan Kettering Tri-Institutional Medical Scientist Training Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hurwitz</surname><given-names>Brian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Jane Coffin Childs Associate</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guzzi</surname><given-names>Nicola</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Mah Jongg League Fellowship (DRG 2409-20)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gola</surname><given-names>Anita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AR27883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuchs</surname><given-names>Elaine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013961</institution-id><institution>Robertson Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hurwitz</surname><given-names>Brian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In response to proteotoxic stress, squamous cell carcinoma cells hijack the integrated stress response to promote recovery by bolstering protection of microtubule dynamics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic cells rely on highly conserved pathways to dynamically control translational machinery in response to various stimuli. One such pathway, the integrated stress response (ISR), is triggered when one of four stress-sensing kinases becomes active: (1) heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI) is activated by oxidative stress, such as arsenite; (2) protein kinase R (PKR) is activated by viral infections; (3) PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) is induced when unfolded proteins accumulate (proteotoxic stress) and when the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) becomes stressed; and (4) general control non-depressible 2 (GCN2) is induced in poor nutrient conditions, particularly amino acid deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">El-Naggar and Sorensen, 2018</xref>). Activation of any of these four kinases results in phosphorylation of serine 51 of eIF2α, a core component of the canonical translational initiation complex. Since phosphorated eIF2α blocks the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B from stimulating the eIF2-GTP-methionyl-initiator tRNA ternary complex, the translation of housekeeping mRNAs is decelerated, and initiation of new protein synthesis is dampened. Concomitantly, non-canonical translational mechanisms emerge to synthesize key stress response proteins that help restore physiological balance to the cell and aid in survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The integrated stress response (ISR) induces a pro-survival program in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells upon exposure to proteotoxic stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the integrated stress response pathway showing activating kinases, inhibitory phosphatases, and downstream effects.

This selective repurposing of the translational machinery forms the foundation of a cellular stress response aimed at restoring homeostasis.</p><p>The best-studied translational target of the ISR is <italic>Atf4</italic>, encoding activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), whose translation is repressed in homeostatic conditions by the presence of inhibitory uORFs in its 5′ UTR. Upon stress, <italic>Atf4</italic> translation is unleashed, and the newly synthesized protein mediates transcriptional upregulation of stress response genes, thus acting as a crucial regulator in the balance of cell death and survival. In fact, known ATF4 targets include both cytoprotective and apoptotic factors. That a single ISR target can have such diverging and context-specific roles highlights the complexity of the cellular stress response and indicates the possibility that the ISR might translationally regulate additional cellular programs to coordinate survival, adaptation, and recovery from stress.</p><p>At the interfaces of cellular proliferation, apoptosis, survival, and protein synthesis, the ISR has naturally emerged as an area of interest in cancer research. Although studies on the role of the ISR in cancer have been conflicting, the notion that the ISR is protective for cancer cells has gained traction in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghaddar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koromilas, 2015</xref>). This is in line with the observation that cancer cells experience hostile microenvironments characterized by nutrient deprivation and low oxygen availability. Additionally, the proliferative stress and elevated metabolic demands of cancer cells create an increased reliance on the cellular mechanisms that maintain proteostasis, a central function of the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cubillos-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, proteasome inhibition as an anticancer therapy is aimed at exploiting this vulnerability. That said, although proteasome inhibitors have become the standard of care for multiple myeloma and mantle-cell lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manasanch and Orlowski, 2017</xref>), this strategy has been less effective in solid tumors, suggesting that these tumors may utilize mechanisms that enable them to cope, survive, and recover in the face of proteotoxic stress, thereby evading therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tian et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we focus on the most common and life-threatening solid tumors, squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), which affect stratified squamous epithelia of the skin, esophagus, lung, and head and neck. To investigate the roles of the ISR in this cancer, we took advantage of our ability to culture the tumor-initiating stem cells from mouse skin SCCs and generated primary, clonal cell lines in which the endogenous eIF2α alleles were replaced by myc-epitope tagged but otherwise fully functional versions of either wild-type eIF2α or eIF2α-S51A (ISR-null). Although unable to mount an ISR in the face of stress, ISR-null SCC stem cells formed tumors that were similar in morphology and proliferation characteristics to controls. However, both in vivo and in vitro, when challenged with proteotoxic stress, ISR-null SCC cells fared considerably more poorly than their ISR-competent counterparts.</p><p>While the HRI and PERK kinases have emerged as major players in sensing misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel-Nour et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harding et al., 1999</xref>), a detailed understanding of how the ISR promotes proteostasis is lacking. To probe into the mechanisms that link the ISR to proteostasis, we coupled genetics, cell biology, pharmacological inhibitors, ribosomal profiling, and finally functional analyses. We traced the connection to a group of centrosomal proteins that become selectively translated in response to proteotoxic stress. We show that these proteins act by strengthening the organizing center for microtubule dynamics that are needed to efficiently amass unfolded proteins at the pericentrosomal locale, where they can be efficiently targeted for destruction and clearance. At the crux of this response is ATF5, a core component of the centrosome, which we found to be translationally upregulated selectively upon proteotoxic stress. Here, we unravel a cancer-specific mechanism in which ATF5 protects the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) to promote cellular recovery and resistance to proteotoxic stress. Our findings add a new dimension, microtubule dynamics, to the role of the ISR not only in stress, but also in the recovery of cells to stress. In so doing, our findings also expose a hitherto unappreciated vulnerability of cancer cells that is unleashed when they are unable to mount an ISR in the face of proteotoxic stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activation of the ISR upon proteotoxic stress promotes survival in SCC cells</title><p>In order to directly test the role of the ISR in SCC cells, we generated eIF2α-S51A or ‘ISR-null’ cancer cells using a knockout and reconstitution strategy.

In all cases, our S51 cells showed a marked increase in phosphorylation following stress induction, albeit at different levels in response to distinct stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As eIF2α phosphorylation decommissions this canonical translational regulator and dampens protein synthesis rates, we also examined translational rates in response to the three stressors. Using puromycin incorporation as a gauge to measure nascent protein synthesis, we observed that indeed all three stressors dampened protein synthesis rates in our eIF2α S51 SCC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As expected, no ISR-dependent differences in protein synthesis were observed in unstressed cells. However, stressed S51A SCC cells failed to limit protein synthesis at the same rate as S51 SCC cells following exposure to oxidative stress or tunicamycin (which induces ER-stress through eIF2α-S51 phosphorylation by PERK kinase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, the proteosome inhibitor bortezomib (a boronic acid dipeptide derivative) seemed refractory to ISR-dependent changes in protein synthesis rates. This was surprising as bortezomib acts by accumulating misfolded proteins, which in turn induce ER-stress and eIF2α-S51 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang and Wek, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suraweera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yerlikaya and Okur, 2020</xref>). Suspecting alternative mechanisms, we first showed that bortezomib inhibited the mTORC1 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that mTORC1 is primarily responsible for the global reduction in protein synthesis rates during proteotoxic stress response.</p><p>We next asked whether the ISR might be dispensable in our SCC cells exposed to proteotoxic stress. Under the serum-rich culture conditions used here, S51 and S51A SCC cells proliferated at comparable rates and showed no differences in viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Analogously, the morphologies of these cells were indistinguishable under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, upon exposure to proteotoxic stress, nearly 3× more eIF2α-S51A cells were positive for the apoptotic marker Annexin-V over counterparts with an intact ISR. This sensitivity was even greater for bortezomib than for other stressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These findings unequivocally established the importance of the ISR in SCC cells faced with proteotoxic stress. However, its role in the process was not in dampening global protein synthesis, but rather in inducing a pro-survival program.</p><p>Was this feature unique to transformed cells? To this end, we compared sensitivity to bortezomib in skin keratinocytes isolated from littermates: either wild-type control (<italic>Tgfbr2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>), pre-oncogenic (<italic>Hras<sup>G12V</sup>; Tgfbr2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>), or fully transformed (<italic>Hras<sup>G12V</sup>; Tgfbr2<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic>). Interestingly in the presence of bortezomib, pre-oncogenic and fully transformed stem cells were significantly more resistant to cell death compared to wild-type stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Taken together, our collective data indicate that when faced with proteotoxic stress, SCC cells gain a fitness advantage as long as they can activate an ISR. Our data further implied that in proteotoxic stress the ISR’s role in cancer cells seems to be to shift to a translational landscape that is more favorable for survival.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The ISR promotes efficient clearance of protein aggregates</title><p>When epidermal stem cells acquire a single oncogenic mutation and will eventually progress to SCC, they activate alternative translational pathways suggestive of an ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sendoel et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, however, when we injected our SCC cells into the skins of immunocompromised, athymic (<italic>Nude</italic>) mice, S51A and S51 SCC cells both formed tumors that grew similarly and showed similar morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This was not attributable to ‘escapers’ that had somehow circumvented the S51A mutation in vivo as FACS-sorted SCC stem cells from S51A tumors still displayed insensitivity to sodium arsenite-induced eIF2α phosphorylation in contrast to their S51 counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, and consistent with our in vitro findings, when we treated our mice with bortezomib, the in vivo S51A SCC tumors exhibited significantly greater sensitivity to proteotoxic stress and apoptosis than their counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These findings were particularly relevant given that despite intense interest in proteasome inhibitors as a potential new line of cancer therapeutics, solid tumors have shown resistance to these drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fournier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manasanch and Orlowski, 2017</xref>). Taken together, our results raised the tantalizing possibility that, if the ISR is crippled in solid tumors, their tumor-propagating stem cells may acquire increasing sensitivity to added stress.</p><p>While the ISR was known to be activated by unfolded proteins that accumulate upon proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>), it remained unclear how the ISR was protecting cancer cells against proteotoxic stress. To dissect the underlying mechanisms, we asked whether the ISR might participate in the cell recovery phase. To test this possibility, we established a two-step in vitro model of first triggering SCC cells to accumulate an excess of unfolded proteins and then allowing them to recover from the stress. To this end, we treated cultured control or ISR-null SCC cells in vitro with a saturating dose of bortezomib for 6 hr, at which point we washed the cells and switched to fresh media to allow cells to recover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Following this bortezomib ‘pulse,’ control SCC cells with a competent ISR recovered and began to proliferate within 24–48 hr. In striking contrast, ISR-null SCC cells took a full 24 hr longer than their counterparts before they began to proliferate again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Intriguingly, this could not be imputed to differences in viability on a short timescale since following this treatment regime, ISR-null and ISR-competent SCC stem cells displayed no difference in Annexin-V positivity either at 6 hr of bortezomib treatment or at 24 hr after recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>).</p><p>The first step in targeting unfolded proteins for degradation is their ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore examined the clearance of ubiquitinated proteins in SCC cells recovering from proteotoxic stress. Following treatment with bortezomib, cells were lysed in radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer, and soluble and insoluble proteins were then fractionated by centrifugation. Each fraction was normalized based on the protein concentration of the soluble fraction and then subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by anti-ubiquitin immunoblots.</p><p>ISR-null and control SCC cells responded similarly to bortezomib, displaying a rapid jump in ubiquitinated proteins within 6 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). After withdrawing bortezomib, however, the rate at which ubiquitinated proteins were cleared from the insoluble fraction was remarkably reduced in the ISR-null cells compared to control SCC cell lysates. As lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin is the specific mark of proteins targeted for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thrower et al., 2000</xref>), we performed anti-K48-polyubiquitin immunoblot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These data confirmed that SCC cells that are unable to mount an ISR are not defective in their E3-ubiquitin-ligase system per se, but rather are impaired in their ability to efficiently clear proteins that are marked for proteosomal clearance.</p><p>We also used this assay to interrogate the source of the insoluble protein aggregates induced by bortezomib. To do so, we treated cells concurrently with cycloheximide, to block new protein synthesis and with bortezomib, to inhibit proteosome-mediated aggregated protein clearance. Inhibiting translation elongation with cyclohexamide or translation initiation with harringtonine almost entirely blocked the buildup of protein aggregates following 6 hr of bortezomib treatment. These data demonstrate that the aggregates in SCC cells treated with bortezomib originate from the accumulation of newly synthesized, unfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Additionally, we found that the ability of a cell to resolve the ISR was required to promote clearance of protein aggregates. Thus, when ISR-competent cells were treated with salubrinal, a selective inhibitor of eIF2α dephosphorylation, aberrant ubiquitinated aggregates accumulated following 24 hr of recovery from the bortezomib pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>We next addressed the extent to which the proteosome versus autophagy is responsible for the clearance of these ubiquitin-marked protein aggregates during the recovery phase following bortezomib treatment. To do so, we treated with bortezomib for 6 hr, and then after washing out the drug, we either allowed both pathways to participate in clearance or added bafilomycin A1 to block the autophagy pathway. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>, BafA1 delayed recovery partially but not fully. Taken together, these data indicated that both autophagy and the proteasome cooperate in clearing these ubiquitin-marked protein aggregates during the recovery phase following proteotoxic stress.</p><p>Intriguingly, PERK kinase was hyperactivated in our S51A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Given that PERK has other targets besides eIF2α S51, we asked whether and how PERK signaling might be involved in clearing these protein aggregates. Indeed, inhibition of PERK signaling by GSK2606414 resulted in increased aggregate accumulation, but this appeared to be irrespective of the status of eIF2α. PERK participated in protein aggregate clearance independently of the ISR, suggesting that other PERK targets, possibly NRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pajares et al., 2017</xref>), may be involved. That said, it was notable that even when PERK was inhibited, ISR-null cells retained a higher accumulation of ubiquitin-positive aggregates when compared to ISR-competent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). These data suggest that the phenotype observed is driven by an ISR-dependent mechanism that does not require PERK.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The ISR responds to proteotoxic stress by upregulating translation of centrosomal proteins</title><p>We next turned to explore how the ISR might be involved in the process of cellular recovery from proteotoxic stress. The delayed rate in protein aggregate clearance seen in ISR-null cells was not attributable to a higher rate of global protein synthesis as this was comparable to the ISR-competent control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We therefore asked whether the ISR might be required to drive translation of select mRNAs upon proteotoxic stress, and if so, whether the proteins produced under such circumstances might give us clues into how the ISR functions in recovery. To this end, we performed ribosome profiling to landscape the ISR-mediated impact on translation during proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The integrated stress response (ISR) induces synthesis of centrosomal proteins in response to proteotoxic stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of ribosome profiling experiment.

Quadruplicate samples of each condition were then lysed in the presence of cycloheximide in order to preserve the ribosome location along transcripts. Total mRNAs were saved, and the remaining lysates were treated with RNase-I to digest away all mRNAs that were not protected by ribosomes. Total mRNAs and the ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) were then prepared for deep sequencing, and the translational efficiency (TE) was analyzed by assessing the ratio of RPFs to total mRNA reads, genome-wide.</p><p>Reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome, and quality control was performed to confirm that we had successfully purified and sequenced RNA fragments that were protected by actively translating ribosomes. Technical replicates were found to co-vary within samples by subjecting them to principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As a second quality control, metagene analysis was performed, which demonstrated that the majority of RPFs were found within coding segments, with relative peaks at the translation start and stop sites, as would be expected from a high-quality ribosome profiling dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The read lengths peaked between 29 and 32 nucleotides, corresponding to the correct length of mRNA protected by ribosomes from RNase-I digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Having verified the efficacy of our data, we next focused on the translational response to proteotoxic stress in eIF2α-S51 control SCC cells bearing an intact ISR. To this end, we sought to identify mRNAs that displayed increased ribosome occupancy (RPF FC &gt; 1.5 and padj(RPF) &lt; 0.05) in bortezomib compared to vehicle-treated cells. To eliminate possible translational variances arising from transcriptional differences, we also normalized the RPF reads of each transcript according to total mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017</xref>). This allowed us to identify genes with TEs (RPF/mRNA) that are sensitive to bortezomib, and whose translational changes are at the heart of ISR-mediated differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, in our S51-SCC cells with an intact ISR, proteotoxic stress provoked the translational upregulation of 199 mRNAs (RPF FC &gt; 1.5, padj (RPF) &lt; 0.05, and TE FC &gt; 1.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we performed the same analysis to compare ISR-competent and ISR-null cells upon proteotoxic stress. This revealed 167 mRNAs whose translational upregulation was dependent on the presence of an intact ISR (S51-bort vs. S51A-bort RPF FC &gt; 1.5, padj (RPF) &lt; 0.05, and TE FC &gt; 1.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These findings clearly showed that when SCC cells are refractory to proteotoxic stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α, their translational program is selectively perturbed.</p><p>To curate a list of specific ISR-targeted mRNAs, we identified genes for which the translation changed in response to bortezomib and only in cells with an intact ISR. To this end, we generated a Venn diagram, comparing (1) the 199 mRNAs translationally upregulated in control cells following bortezomib treatment, and (2) the 167 mRNAs that failed to be translationally upregulated by bortezomib when the ISR was crippled. By this criterion, 24 mRNAs surfaced as candidates for bona fide ISR translational targets and showed strong enrichment across all four sets of translational replicates of proteotoxic stress-induced SCC cells harboring an intact ISR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>We used Gene Ontology enrichment analysis (GO-term) to ask if common biological processes or cellular components were translationally targeted by the ISR. As quality control, we first focused on the downregulated genes, resulting from the overlap of mRNA translationally downregulated upon bortezomib treatment in ISR-competent cells and that failed to be translationally downregulated in ISR-null cells. These 120 genes were clearly enriched in components of translational machinery, which is consistent with the known role of the ISR pathway in downregulating translation and housekeeping gene synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we performed GO-term analysis of the 24 upregulated ISR-targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Regulation of stress-induced transcription featured prominently in the top GO-terms for biological processes and was exemplified by the presence of ATF4, a well-established stress-induced transcriptional regulator that is activated in premalignant SCC cells by non-canonical translation when eIF2α is phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sendoel et al., 2017</xref>). Most intriguing, however, were the top three GO-terms for cellular components: centrosomal proteins, MTOC proteins, and microtubule cytoskeletal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and genes highlighted in green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>The centrosome is the major cytoplasmic MTOC within interphase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caviston and Holzbaur, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanchez and Feldman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woodruff et al., 2017</xref>). In SCC cells, like most other mammalian cells, the MTOC is located near the nucleus, where it is surrounded by pericentriolar proteins important for plus-ended microtubule growth towards the cell periphery. The polarity of microtubules establishes polarized transport, which, depending upon the motor protein involved, can occur either towards the minus ends at the MTOC or along the plus ends of the microtubules towards the focal adhesions.</p><p>Although the ISR had not been previously found to regulate the microtubule cytoskeleton, we were intrigued by the possibility that the ISR was influencing microtubule dynamics in response to proteotoxic stress, which in turn might affect how efficiently proteins are cleared during the recovery phase. This possibility was all the more compelling because protein aggregate formation and clearance is known to depend on microtubule-dependent intracellular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kopito, 2000</xref>). Of further intrigue was the mRNA for ATF5, which, like that for ATF4, displayed dramatic increases in translation in the absence of transcriptional upregulation and specifically in ISR-competent SCC cells exposed to proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

We therefore set out to evaluate how the centrosome and microtubule dynamics were changing in response to stress in SCC cells with or without an intact ISR.</p><p>To evaluate the status of the centrosome during stress, we performed immunofluorescence for centrosomal markers pericentrin (PCNT) and γ-tubulin (TUBG1).

Additionally, enlargement of the MTOC was dependent on eIF2α dephosphorylation, suggesting that while ISR-dependent synthesis of cytoskeletal proteins occurs early on during stress response, cellular recovery requires resolution of the ISR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The integrated stress response (ISR) protects centrosomal microtubule dynamics during recovery from protein aggregate stress.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Representative immunofluorescence images of S51 and S51A cells vehicle-treated or treated with a bortezomib pulse (100 nM, 6 hr) and let to recover for 4 hr.

Moreover, although the highly transformed, long-passaged HeLa cell line lacks physiological relevance, it was notable that proteosome inhibition in these cells resulted in the accumulation of pericentriolar material, including pericentrin and γ-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Didier et al., 2008</xref>). In light of these data, we became intrigued by the possibility that the ISR may be at the crux of reinforcing microtubule dynamics following proteotoxic stress to promote cellular recovery.</p><p>If our premise was valid, microtubule-dependent processes should be vulnerable when cells cannot trigger an ISR in the face of stressful situations. To evaluate microtubule dynamics during the recovery phase of our cells following proteotoxic stress exposure, we briefly interrupted existing microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics with nocodazole and then examined nascent microtubule nucleation initiated from the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of stress, the ISR-null state was not associated with differences in MTOC-initiated microtubule dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In striking contrast, the vulnerability of microtubule dynamics in the ISR-null state became clear when we exposed our cells to proteotoxic stress and monitored the recovery process. Even after 4 hr of bortezomib recovery, microtubule growth from the MTOC was still markedly impaired in the ISR-null compared to control SCC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>To better track microtubule dynamics, we treated S51 and S51A cells with SiR-tubulin, a cell-permeable, fluorescent dye based on the microtubule binding drug docetaxel. Live imaging of S51 and S51A cells showed no overt differences in the microtubule cytoskeleton of unstressed cells. However, when combined with nocodazole recovery, SiR-tubulin imaging revealed a significant delay in new microtubules nucleating from the centrosomes in S51A cells specifically during recovery from proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>). This is in agreement with our data showing that, while ISR-null SCC cells fare considerably worse than ISR-competent SCC cells in response to proteotoxic stress, they eventually recover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Intriguingly, we also noticed that while the microtubules in ISR-competent SCC cells were mostly nucleating from the centrosomes, a majority of ISR-null SCC cells showed prominent non-centrosomal microtubule growth (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>) suggestive of a compensation mechanism to allow for cellular recovery. Overall, since microtubule dynamics were independent of the ISR in the unstressed state, these results suggested that the ISR is required to reinforce the microtubule dynamics involved in cellular recovery following proteotoxic stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The ISR is required for aggresome formation</title><p>Our evidence that the ISR functions in protecting microtubule dynamics during proteotoxic stress was all the more compelling because of known role of microtubules in assembling ubiquitinated protein aggregates into larger membraneless structures called aggresomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnston et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wigley et al., 1999</xref>).

The rise in cytoplasmic p62 immunofluorescence during the proteosomal block indicated that small protein aggregates had formed in the S51A cells exposed to proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, bottom panels). However, even at 8 hr after bortezomib withdrawal, only a few S51A cells displayed the bright perinuclear spot reflective of the aggresome. Moreover, while S51 SCC cells had cleared their protein aggregates by 24 hr after culturing in normal media, S51A SCC cells still exhibited anti-p62 coalescence, indicative of a marked delay in clearance of unfolded proteins. In agreement with our previous data that PERK signaling contributed to clearance of ubiquitinated proteins independently of the ISR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>), PERK inhibition resulted in a significant reduction in the percentage of cells forming aggresomes in both ISR-competent and ISR-null SCC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Further signs of cellular defects during the recovery process were evident at the ultrastructural level. After 8 hr of recovery, electron-dense protein aggregates pushing into the nucleus were observed in the perinuclear regions of S51 but not S51A SCC cells. These structures were absent in unstressed SCC cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Consistent with the notion that the aggresomes are trafficked via the microtubules, further analysis of our electron microscopy images revealed accumulation of membrane-less structure (i.e., aggresomes) at the centrosomes in S51 SCC cells during recovery from proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). Co-immunolabeling for p62 and γ-tubulin confirmed that the perinuclear structures present in S51 cells were indeed aggresomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Moreover, S51 cells displayed signs of nuclear deformation, often observed during the aggresome clearance phase. By contrast, when detected in S51A cells, aggresomes tended to be small and less distinct. Moreover, S51A cells often displayed widespread vacuole-like structures, which have been reported to occur when the ER becomes overwhelmed with misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mimnaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>The surprising dependence upon an intact ISR for SCC cells to form aggresomes during proteotoxic stress recovery led us to hypothesize that the ISR might function critically in sustaining the necessary microtubule dynamics that enables efficient transport of misfolded proteins to the MTOC, where they can then form aggresomes and be targeted for perinuclear proteosomal and autophagosomal clearance. To further challenge this relationship between microtubule dynamics and aggresome formation, we used the drug, paclitaxel, a chemotherapy that stabilizes microtubules while at the same time disrupts their dynamics. In line with our hypothesis, microtubule stabilization with paclitaxel potently blocked aggresome formation, phenocopying the ISR-null cells during this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Blocking microtubules polymerization by treating cells with nocodazole had a similar effect and resulted in a significant reduction in aggresome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The ISR is required for migration and focal adhesion homeostasis following protein aggregate stress</title><p>During the course of our previous experiments, we made several observations regarding the cellular morphology, which supported the conclusion that the ISR was required to maintain proper microtubule dynamics in the face of protein aggregate stress. First, we noticed that control, but not ISR-null, cells went through a dramatic change in cell shape while recovering from aggregate stress. Specifically, control cells ‘unspread,’ becoming more compact and tall between 4 and 8 hr after washing out bortezomib, the timepoints correlating with peak aggresome formation. ISR-null cells, on the other hand, did not similarly round, and instead they maintained a flattened shape with some cells also forming elongated processes. Examples of these differences are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>The long cellular extensions were reminiscent of that seen when keratinocytes displayed defects in the turnover of focal adhesions, a process that we had previously shown depends not only upon focal adhesion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schober et al., 2007</xref>), but also on the ability of microtubules to deliver turnover cargo to the focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). Specifically, microtubule-mediated cargo transport is essential for focal adhesion disassembly and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ezratty et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yue et al., 2014</xref>). While the transport of protein aggregates to the centrosome involves minus end-directed molecular motors, transport to the focal adhesions requires plus end-directed motors. Reasoning that a defect in MTOC-mediated microtubule dynamics might affect both processes, we examined the focal adhesions in control and ISR-null cells following proteotoxic stress. As judged by immunofluorescence for vinculin, upon proteotoxic stress the ISR promoted a remodeling in cell morphology evident by diminished focal adhesion and F-actin staining. By contrast, ISR-null cells retained large focal adhesions suggestive of impaired cytoskeletal dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geiger et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). This ISR-mediated difference was specific to stress and was not seen when control and ISR-null cells were cultured in normal media under unstressed conditions. By looking back at our ribosome profiling dataset, we found a significant enrichment of focal adhesion genes within mRNAs with reduced ribosome occupancy upon ISR induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). While further analysis will be needed to evaluate protein levels of focal adhesion components in the absence of an ISR, these data suggest that ISR-mediated translational control stands at the crux of these dramatic morphological changes by selectively upregulating microtubule dynamics and, at the same time, downregulating focal adhesion components.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The integrated stress response (ISR) is required for focal adhesion remodeling and cell migration upon proteotoxic stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Impaired focal adhesion dynamics in ISR-null cells.

Additionally, our analysis of ISR-dependent translational changes revealed a selective upregulation of centrosomal proteins upon proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In particular, we were intrigued by ATF5, which has been described as an integral component of the MTOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Madarampalli et al., 2015</xref>).

Remarkably, expression of ATF5 significantly improved the ability of ISR-null cells to clear ubiquitinated proteins, as assessed by immunoblot of ubiquitinated proteins in the insoluble fraction of cells after 24 hr recovery from bortezomib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). Strikingly, this corresponded with a significant increase in aggresome formation, indicating that ISR-mediated ATF5 upregulation is needed to promote the retrograde transport of misfolded proteins and the subsequent accumulation of protein aggregates at the MTOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This effect was mediated via protection of microtubule dynamics as evidenced by increased pericentrin mean fluorescence intensity at the centrosome in ISR-null cells expressing ATF5 after recovery from bortezomib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Strengthening this mechanistic link, short-hairpin-RNA-mediated ATF5 knockdown in ISR-competent cells resulted in higher accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and reduced aggresome formation during recovery from proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B-E</xref>).</p><p>Building on our previous findings that normal keratinocytes were more sensitive to bortezomib compared to their transformed counterpart and failed to protect MTOC dynamics during the recovery phase from proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), we asked whether ATF5 induction occurred only in the transformed state.

This occurred in the absence of changes in viability in tumors at steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Altogether, these data implicate ATF5 as a critical ISR target in SCC stem cells, which orchestrates microtubule dynamics to facilitate the clearance of protein aggregates and promote cell recovery upon proteotoxic stress.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although a handful of reports have linked the actin cytoskeleton to eIF2α dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), cytoskeletal regulation has not been viewed as a primary function of the ISR. In this study, we unearthed a novel and essential role for the ISR in regulating the cytoskeleton, specifically through preserving microtubule dynamics in stressful situations. This mechanism appears to be unique to proteotoxic stress and is required for cells to accomplish the necessary intracellular trafficking to efficiently clear misfolded proteins and prevent them from accumulating and overtaxing the ER.</p><p>Our findings led us to the remarkable conclusion that the ISR is not only required to mount a stress response, but also to instruct cell function during recovery from stress. Although the existence of negative feedback loops that downregulate the ISR upon termination of stress has long been appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>), our data more clearly elucidate a specific role of the ISR during cellular recovery.</p><p>By temporally profiling the translational differences that arise when proteotoxically stressed SCC cells are unable to mount an ISR, we gained insights into the mechanisms underlying the ISR’s importance. Specifically, we learned that when ISR-competent cells are exposed to proteotoxic stress, they redirect their translational machinery to a cohort of mRNAs encoding centrosomal proteins. We show that these proteins function in bolstering the MTOC and reinforcing its microtubule dynamics. This then facilitates efficient microtubule-mediated transport of misfolded proteins to the perinuclear space, where they can be assembled into aggresomes and targeted for ubiquitin-mediated degradation during the stress recovery phase. Indeed, as we showed, when eIF2α cannot be phosphorylated and the ISR core is thereby crippled in proteotoxically stressed cells, the centrosomal proteins are not translated, and microtubule dynamics emanating from the MTOC are disrupted. As judged by deficiencies in the aggresome assembly and in focal adhesion turnover, both retrograde and anterior grade transport of microtubule cargo are slow to recover following stress, thereby impairing cell fitness. Compellingly, the ISR not only upregulates a subset of centrosomal proteins, but also downregulates focal adhesion components, surfacing a network of ISR-regulated cytoskeletal dynamics that directs morphological changes critical for cell recovery.</p><p>Microtubule trafficking is required for misfolded proteins to accumulate at the perinuclear space, and our results provided compelling evidence that the ISR functions in this process. However, our findings also pointed to a hitherto unappreciated role of the ISR in aggresome assembly specifically. Our studies revealed that this function is in part mediated by ATF5, a translational target of the ISR in proteotoxically stressed SCC cells and a previously documented structural component of the centrosomal MTOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Madarampalli et al., 2015</xref>). We showed that during recovery from protein aggregate stress the MTOC size increases concomitantly with aggresome formation, and both of these events depend upon an intact ISR. Our data support a model in which ISR-mediated translational upregulation of centrosomal proteins, including ATF5, is required to remodel the MTOC and concentrate protein aggregates in the perinuclear space so that they can be degraded and cleared by proteosomes and autophagosomes.</p><p>Our findings that <italic>Atf5</italic> translational upregulation is limited to proteotoxic stress and unique to transformed skin stem cells is particularly intriguing. <italic>Atf5</italic> possesses uORFs in its 5′UTR that are known to regulate its translation, but it remains unclear which factors modulate their translation and promote synthesis of ATF5 protein. In this regard, it is curious that while bortezomib induced the lowest phosphorylation of eIF2α, it uniquely induced <italic>Atf5</italic> translation. Together, these findings point to a view of the ISR as a dynamic program that can be finely tuned in the face of distinct stresses and cellular states. Finally, these data highlight a cancer-specific mechanism of recovery from proteotoxic stress, supporting the idea that the ISR contributes to therapy resistance in SCC.</p><p>Several studies have provided tantalizing evidence that some cells may be able to asymmetrically partition their centrosomal aggregates when division resumes following proteotoxic stress, such that one daughter (e.g., a stem cell) remains healthy, while the other daughter inherits the aggregates and becomes slated to differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morrow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rujano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Singhvi and Garriga, 2009</xref>). We did not see evidence for this in our SCC cells. Rather, there was a lag in cell cycle reentry such that proliferation began after aggregates were cleared, and this coupling was maintained in ISR-null cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>). This coupling was especially striking in comparing the behaviors of ISR-null vs. ISR-competent cells. Thus, during the recovery phase, ISR-null cells were delayed by &gt;24 hr in both aggregate clearance and cell cycle re-entry. That said, when the ISR was crippled either in vivo or in vitro, SCC cells were jeopardized in their overall ability to survive proteotoxic stress. In this scenario, as a major regulator of cell survival in response to proteotoxic stress, our findings suggest that by coupling pharmacological inhibition of the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>) with proteosomal inhibitors such as bortezomib, such a regimen may find an Achilles heel for this family of difficult-to-treat cancers.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ideas and speculation</title><p>Our findings are also likely to have relevance for other diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, which are driven by or associated with protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Soto and Pritzkow, 2018</xref>). To date, the function of the ISR in neurodegenerative diseases has been attributed largely to the emergence of alternative translation pathways and to ATF4 transcriptional activity that drives expression of cytoplasmic chaperones and balances cell survival and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bond et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020</xref>). In SCC cells, although it is possible that chaperones may be upregulated indirectly through ISR-driven transcription factors, these proteins did not emerge as major translational targets of the ISR in our ribosome profiling analysis. Moreover, since cells have parallel pathways, most notably the heat shock response, that can upregulate chaperones when needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">San Gil et al., 2017</xref>), it seems unlikely that chaperone induction would be ISR’s sole function in maintaining proteostasis.</p><p>The necessity of an ISR-driven pathway for preserving centrosome dynamics during proteotoxic stress raises an important question regarding centrosome function in neurodegenerative disorders. If ISR-driven translation of centrosomal proteins is required to protect microtubule dynamics during stress, it follows that the accumulation of unfolded proteins should negatively impact the MTOC and/or its microtubule-associated dynamics. In Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies, the microtubule-associated protein Tau is the main driver of the aggregates of neurofibrillary tangles that ensue, and this alone is likely to negatively impact microtubule-mediated trafficking in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballatore et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, misfolded protein aggregates often inadvertently sequester properly folded cellular proteins, such as p62 and the disaggregase p97/VCP, which can exacerbate their toxic effects on cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donaldson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olzscha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang and Hu, 2016</xref>). It seems plausible that misfolded protein aggregates might either sequester low-complexity centrosomal or pericentrosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woodruff et al., 2017</xref>), or structurally interfere with MTOC function. In fact, one study found that proteotoxic stress does indeed inhibit centrosome function in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Didier et al., 2008</xref>), raising the question as to whether the ISR might also be involved in maintaining the MTOC of long-lived, nondividing neurons, which face a need for uniquely long-distance microtubule-mediated trafficking.</p><p>In summary, our work supports a model in which cancer cells rely upon the ISR to restore proteostasis following protein aggregate stress. By redirecting the translational machinery towards synthesizing proteins involved in enlarging the MTOC and bolstering microtubule dynamics, the ISR aids in the intracellular microtubule-mediated trafficking necessary to assemble aggresomes at the MTOC, where they can be efficiently targeted to the perinuclear protein degradation machinery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

replacement construct, pLKO-PGK-eIF2α-mycTag-P2A-NeoR, were prepared by transfecting the lentiviral plasmid along with packaging plasmids into HEK293T cells, and viral supernatant was collected 48 hr post transfection. This construct was integrated into the genome of a clonal, parental primary SCC mouse line by incubating 100 μL with 0.1 mg/mL polybrene for 8 hr. 48 hr later, cells with the integrated construct were selected with 0.5 mg/mL neomycin selection for 2 days. Following selection, the endogenous allele was targeted for deletion using CRISPR-Cas9 RNP particles. The replacement allele had a synonymous mutation in the PAM site, rendering it resistant to this CRIPSR construct. CRISPR-Cas9 RNP particles targeting the endogenous allele were prepared as follows: eIF2α gRNA (target sequence: <named-content content-type="sequence">ATATTCCAACAAGCTGACAT</named-content>) was designed using GuideScan software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perez et al., 2017</xref>) and complexed with ATTO550-tracrRNA and Cas9. All reagents were acquired from IDTdna’s ‘AltR system.’ Duplexed gRNA:tracrRNA was prepared by mixing 1 μM of each component in IDTdna duplex buffer, heated to 95°C in a thermocycler and annealed by gradually lowering the temperature to 25°C at a rate of 0.1°C/s. Duplexed gRNA:tracrRNA was complexed with Cas9 by mixing 1 μM of the duplex with 1 μM Cas9 in OptiMEM (Thermo Fisher) and incubating at room temperature for 5 min.</p><p>RNP complexes then were transfected into 60% confluent 12-well plates using RNAiMAX as follows: 30 μL of 1 μM RNP complexes were mixed with 4.8 μL RNAiMAX in 335 μL of optiMEM and RNP-lipid complexes were allowed to form for 15 min at room temperature. At the end of the incubation, 400 μL of complexes were added dropwise to cells, and media were changed 16 hr later. 48 hr after transfection, single cells were isolated using FACS as follows: cells were dissociated with trypsin (Gibco) and resuspended in 500 μL of FACS buffer (PBS supplemented with 5% FBS and 5 μM EDTA), and single, ATTO-550-positive cells were sorted using BD FACSAria cell sorter into wells of 96-well plates containing 100 μL of 50-50 mixture of fresh media and conditioned media. Clones that grew to confluency were transferred to 12-well plates, and following growth to confluency in 12-well plates, cells were dissociated with trypsin and frozen in freezing media supplemented with 10% FBS and 10% DMSO. At this stage, a small aliquot of cells (75% of the plate) was lysed in 200 μL of QuickExtract DNA Extraction solution (Lucigen) and gDNA was prepared by heating to 65°C for 10 minu followed by heat inactivation at 95° C for 2 min. These gDNA samples were used for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>NGS analysis of CRISPR outcomes</title><p>Knockout of the endogenous allele was evaluated using primers targeting a 300 basepair region of genomic DNA with the targeted locus in the middle of the amplicon. Primers had 5′ overhangs with sequences compatible with the Illumina Nextera XT index primers (R: overhang: <named-content content-type="sequence">GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG</named-content>; L overhang: <named-content content-type="sequence">TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG</named-content>). Amplicons were generated with 1 μL of input gDNA and the NEB Phusion kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and amplicons were isolated using Agencout Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). A second barcoding PCR was performed using Nextera XT index primers as follows: 2 μL of cleaned amplicons were used as input, primers were added so that each isolated clone had a unique combination of left and right barcodes, and barcodes were added using an eight-cycle PCR reaction with 55°C annealing temp, again with the NEB Phusion kit, and the barcoded amplicons were cleaned and primer dimers were removed using Ampure XP beads. Amplicons were normalized to the same concentration, pooled, and sequenced using a single Illumina MiSeq Nano lane using the 250 basepair, paired end kit. Demultiplexed reads were analyzed and screened for indels using the RGEN Cas Analyzer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rgenome.net">http://www.rgenome.net</ext-link>).

Primary keratinocytes used in this study have been previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Cells routinely tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. ATF5-GFP-overexpressing cells were generated by infecting ISR-null cells with ATF5-GFP lentivirus in the presence of 5 μg/mL polybrene. Infected cells were selected using 2 μg/mL puromycin for 5 days. Induction of ATF5 was induced using 1 μg/mL doxycycline at the time of plating for each experiment.

For tumor growth experiments, sample sizes of N = 8 were calculated to yield an 80% power to detect a significant (p&lt;0.05) effect size of 50% assuming a standard deviation of 25%, conservative estimates based on past lab experience suggesting targeting ISR-related genes in SCC that yielded larger effect sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sendoel et al., 2017</xref>). The experiment was performed twice ISR-competent and ISR-null using two different clones for each, with each experiment powered independently to 80%, yielding total sample size of N = 16 when pooling data.

For 3D reconstructions and volumetric analyses of MTOCs, Imaris was used to generate 3D images, and volumes were generated to create 3D volumes encompassing the discrete puncta of pericentrin staining. Volume as well as summed pericentrin and γ-tubulin fluorescence intensity were measured within these volumes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Cells were fixed in a solution containing 4% PFA, 2% glutaraldehyde, and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> in 0.1 M sodium cacadylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 1 hr at room temperature, and then placed at 4°C. Cells were next postfixed in 1% osium tetroxide and processed for Epon embedding; ultrathin sections (60–65 nm) were then counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and images were acquired using a Tacnai G2-12 transmission electron microscope equipped with an AMT BioSprint29 digital camera.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cell fractionation</title><p>Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (cOmplete Mini, Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP), and lysed for 10 min at room temperature.

The protein concentration of the RIPA-soluble fraction was measured with a BCA (Pierce). RIPA-soluble fractions were mixed into 1× LDS-βME and protein concentration was normalized. The insoluble fractions were normalized by adding 1× LDS-βMe so that the same volume corresponds to the same volume of insoluble-fraction lysate (e.g., insoluble fraction from 100 μg of cell lysate).

Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and protein concentration of supernatants was evaluated using BCA (Pierce). Protein lysates were normalized, mixed with LDS (Thermo Fisher) and β-mercaptoethanol (Thermo Fisher), and denatured at 95°C for 5 min. Protein was separated by gel electrophoresis using 4–12% or 12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gradient gels (Life Technologies) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare, 0.45 μm). Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in TBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, and primary antibodies were stained overnight in blocking buffer at 4°C or 1 hr at room temperature, and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were stained for 1 hr at room temperature.

In short, cells were lysed in polysome buffer supplemented with 0.1 mg/mL cyclohexamide. Lysates were treated with 500 U of RNAse I (Epicentre) per 25 μg of RNA (quantified by Qubit Fluorimetry, Thermo Fisher), and RPFs were isolated using sephacryl S400 columns (GE Healthcare) in TE buffer. Ribosomes and RPFs were dissociated in Trizol (Invitrogen) and RNA was collected with protected fragments purified using Zymo Research DirectZol MiniPrep columns. RPFs were purified by running total RNA on a 15% TBE-Urea gel (Thermo Fisher) and cutting the region corresponding to 17–34 nucleotides. RNA was purified and precipitated, dephosphorylated with PNK (NEB), and ligated to preadenylated barcoded linker oligonucleotides, and then unligated linker was digested away with 25 U yeast 5′-deadenylase (NEB) and 5 U RecJ exonuclease (Epicentre). Up to eight libraries were pooled, and rRNA was depleted using the Lexogen Ribocop V2 kit, and reverse transcription of RPF-linker fragments was performed in presence of 20 U Superase-IN (Invitrogen) and 200 U ProtoScript II (NEB). cDNAs were circularized using 100 U CircLigase I ssDNA ligase (Epicentre), and cDNA concentration was quantified by QPCR of cDNA compared to a standard curve of a reference sample. Libraries were amplified with Illumina-compatible barcoded primers and a 10-cycle PCR. DNA of the correct size (~160 bp) was isolated on TBE-PAGE gel, precipitated, and resuspended in TE buffer. Total mRNA samples were prepared in parallel, and mRNA was selected by rRNA depletion, and libraries were prepared using Illumina Ribozero kit.</p><p>Ribosome profiling and total RNA libraries were pooled and sequenced on a NovaSeq using the S1, 1 × 100 bp kit. Reads were demultiplexed, trimmed using FastX trimmer, and aligned to the mm10 reference genome using bowtie2. Sequences were counted in bins of 5′ UTR, CDS, and 3′ UTR as defined using plastid (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://plastid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://plastid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</ext-link>). Count data were analyzed using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Love et al., 2014</xref>), an R package designed for statistical analysis of gene counts generated from Illumina-based sequencing. For expression analysis of ribosome profiling data, only reads in the CDS were included and reads coming from the first 15 codons (45 bp) and last 5 codons (15 bp) were excluded. Additionally, only reads of size between 20–23 bp or 26–32 bp were counted. Gene lists were generated as described in the main text, first by filtering genes with significant differences in RPF read counts, and then genes that changed specifically at the translation level were identified as the subset of filtered genes with TE (TE = normalized RPF/normalized total RNA) fold changes greater than 1.5.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Data availability</title><p>The total mRNA and RPFs datasets generated during the ribosome profiling experiments performed in this study have been deposited to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository with accession code GSE193945.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: All animal procedures used in this study are described in our #20066H protocol named Development and Differentiation in the Skin, which had been previously reviewed and approved by the Rockefeller University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-77780-transrepform1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Sequencing data have been deposited in GEO under accession codes GSE193945.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hurwitz</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Guzzi</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Gola</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Fiore</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Sendoel</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Nikolova</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Barrows</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Carrol</surname><given-names>TS</given-names></name><name><surname>Pasolli</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name><name><surname>Fuchs</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2022">2022</year><data-title>The integrated stress response remodels the microtubule organizing center to clear unfolded proteins following proteotoxic stress</data-title><source>NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE193945">GSE193945</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Rockefeller University’s Flow Cytometry Resource Center (Svetlana Mazel, director), the Genomics Resource Center (Connie Zhao, director), and the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited comparative biology center (R Tolwani, director) for their services.

recovery upon proteotoxic stress, which is especially interesting in cancer cells resistant to proteasome inhibitors. The authors conclude that translation initiation of mRNAs encoding microtubule cytoskeleton, centrosome, and ATF5 proteins is necessary to recover from proteotoxic stress.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviews are overall positive about the work's suitability for <italic>eLife</italic>, but there is a need to address the reviewers' criticisms that will require extensive revisions. Due to the relevance of all the points in strengthening the work, all the reviewers' comments should be addressed. We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript,</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) What happens to PERK activity in the context of S51A+bortezomib? It is very likely that PERK is activated which raises the question if the phenotypes the authors observe are mediated by an ISR-independent, but PERK-dependent mechanism. This could be answered by generating PERK KO cells in the S51A background.</p><p>2) Lines 301-303 – What are the mRNA levels of the 199 translationally upregulated mRNAs?

It is very likely that PERK is activated which raises the question if the phenotypes the authors observe are mediated by an ISR-independent, but PERK-dependent mechanism. This could be answered by generating PERK KO cells in the S51A background.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the suggestion of this Reviewer, we monitored PERK activation in S51 and S51A cells. Indeed, S51A show hyperactivation of PERK signaling compared to S51 cells, as shown by increased PERK phosphorylation at Thr980. We included this information in the manuscript in Figure 2—figure supplement 3D. To further investigate the role of PERK signaling in aggregate clearance, we used the PERK inhibitor GSK2606414. By inhibiting PERK signaling in both S51 and S51A cells, we showed that PERK signaling contributes to aggregate clearance, at least in part, independently from the ISR since both cell lines show higher aggregate accumulation after 24 hrs recovery from bortezomib when PERK signaling is inhibited (Figure 2—figure supplement 3D). To further validate these data, we analyzed the number of aggresomes formed by S51 and S51A cells in presence/absence of PERK inhibition. In agreement with our data, inhibiting PERK resulted in a decrease in number of cells with an aggresome in both cell lines as judged by coalescence of p62 signal by immunofluorescence. These data are now presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>That said, when PERK is inhibited, ISR-null cells still retain higher accumulation of ubiquitin positive aggregates in the insoluble fraction when compared to ISR-competent cells. These data rule out the notion that the observed phenotype in ISR-null cells results simply from hyperactivation of PERK signaling. Rather, they imply the existence of both ISR dependent and independent mechanisms underlying the recovery phase. Although our study here focuses on the ISR-dependent mechanisms, we mention that the ISRindependent mechanism may involve PERK-mediated phosphorylation of one of its other targets, NRF2, as previously described (Pajares et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Lines 301-303 – What are the mRNA levels of the 199 translationally upregulated mRNAs?

Atf5’s 5’UTR contains at least 2 upstream open reading frames (uORF), which direct its translation. Additionally, alternative splicing is responsible for expression of two isoform of Atf5, which differ in their 5’UTR. Our finding that ATF5 is uniquely induced by proteotoxic stress in SCC stem cells is intriguing, although unraveling the nature of this translational control is out of the scope of the current manuscript. Nevertheless, our results support the notion that the ISR is not merely a on-off pathway, but a finely tuned event that regulates distinct proteins in response to distinct stresses. We speculate that this regulation could be achieved either by differential phosphorylation levels of eIF2a (Figure 1D), by differences in cellular location of the sensing kinase upstream of eIF2a phosphorylation or by activation of different alternative translation factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The findings from Hurwitz et al. expose a novel mechanism underlying the ISR in cancer cells that will be of interest to people in different fields.

To provide further evidence of decreased microtubule dynamics in ISR-null cells during recovery from proteotoxic stress, we now performed live imaging experiments using a fluorescently labeled microtubule interacting drug, SiR-Tubulin. Measuring microtubule growth rate at steady state proved to be complicated due to the intricate and dense network of microtubule in these cells. However, we successfully measured centrosomal microtubule growth upon recovery from nocodazole treatment. Our new data are presented in Figure 4F, Figure 4-video supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 4B. From these new results, it is evident that upon recovery from proteotoxic stress ISR-null cells have delayed microtubule growth and significant non-centrosomal contribution to microtubule growth. Notably, these effects are only apparent during recovery from stress, since untreated S51 and S51A cells show similar centrosomal microtubule growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

This is highlighted in figure 5. In fact, by imaging hundreds of cells we consistently observed p62 signal accumulation at a singular cellular location, which co-localizes with pericentrin and the centrosome. These data indicate that protein aggregates are mostly accumulated at the centrosomal MTOC. Interestingly however, results from our live imaging experiments illustrate that, while S51A cells are largely impaired in centrosomal dynamics, non-centrosomal microtubule growth occurs to allow cellular recovery. Taken together these data suggest that while the ISR is needed to protect the centrosomes, ISR-null cells can compensate by upregulating non-centrosomal microtubule dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Are there any ultrastructural changes in the centrioles upon the induction of the IRS?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fascinating question, but not one easily addressed. Hundreds of serial ultrathin sections across cells would need to be taken to address this question, and even then, if the angle of centrioles are not quite within the section plane, this information will be lost. Having done such studies in the past, they are a major undertaking and often the luck of the draw even when the lab has access to an expert in the field. Still, we obtained new electron microscopy images of centrosomes in S51 SCC cells untreated and following 8 hrs of recovery from proteotoxic stress. These new data shows accumulation of aggresomes at the centrosomal locale only after bortezomib treatment (Figure 5—figure supplement 3A-B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>How the cells recovered from proteotoxic stress seems to be dependent on the canonical translation of ATF5, which when overexpressed in mutant S51A cells rescues the in vivo apoptotic and centrosome phenotype to wt cells at comparable levels.

The question is whether other ISR inducting drugs can induce a similar mechanism or is only proteasome-dependent?</p></disp-quote><p>To further dissect the role of the MTOC upon different stresses, we monitored MTOC size and ATF5 levels upon different stresses (i.e. oxidative stress and ER stress). Remarkably, ATF5 induction and MTOC enlargement were specific to proteotoxic stress response, indicating that the ISR can distinctly fine-tune gene expression in response to different stresses (Figure 4C, Figure 4—figure supplement 2A and Figure 7A). These data suggest that protecting centrosomal dynamics is particularly important in response to proteotoxic stress as a mechanism to maintain microtubule dynamics while concentrating aggregates at a unique cellular localization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show in the study that proteotoxic stress induced by inhibition of the proteasome using bortezomib activates a distinct translation program necessary for cell recovery which includes microtubule cytoskeleton, centrosome and ATF5 proteins and claim to be a global mechanism to recover from ISR.

In line with the level of protein synthesis rate inhibition (Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), bortezomib induces mild but significant activation of the ISR. To further evaluate whether sodium arsenite and tunicamycin would activate a similar translation program, we assessed ATF5 levels and MTOC size upon different stresses. Our new data suggest that the identified translation program is unique to bortezomib, since both sodium arsenite and tunicamycin failed to upregulate ATF5 and to affect MTOC size (Figure 4C, Figure 4—figure supplement 2A and Figure 7A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One question that remains unanswered is how cells re-activate canonical translation upon stress that allows them to recover? Is this phosphatase dependent? Can the cells recover from proteotoxic stress by inhibiting this mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the requirement of eIF2a dephosphorylation for recovery from proteotoxic stress, we inhibited eIF2a phosphatases by using the well-established drug salubrinal. In agreement with a requirement for eIF2a dephosphorylation during the recovery from stress, salubrinal-treated S51 cells failed to clear protein aggregates, as shown by accumulation of Ubiquitin staining in the insoluble fraction after 24 hrs of recovery from proteotoxic stress (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B). Additionally, salubrinal treatment also prevented the increase in MTOC size (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B), suggesting that the response to proteotoxic stress is dynamically regulated and requires both an initial translational upregulation of microtubule components via the ISR and a subsequent recovery of cellular function mediated via inhibition of the ISR.</p></body></sub-article></article>
