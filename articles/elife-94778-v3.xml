The most broadly accepted etiology is that uterine endometrial cells retrogradely enter the peritoneum during menses, and implant and form invasive lesions in a process analogous to cancer metastasis. However, over 90% of women suffer retrograde menstruation, but only 10% develop endometriosis, and debate continues as to whether the underlying defect is endometrial or peritoneal. Processes implicated in invasion include: enhanced motility; adhesion to, and formation of gap junctions with, the target tissue. Endometrial stromal (ESCs) from 22 endometriosis patients at different disease stages show much greater invasiveness across mesothelial (or endothelial) monolayers than ESCs from 22 control subjects, which is further enhanced by the presence of EECs. This is due to the enhanced responsiveness of endometriosis ESCs to the mesothelium, which induces migration and gap junction coupling. ESC-PMC gap junction coupling is shown to be required for invasion, while coupling between PMCs enhances mesothelial barrier breakdown.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gap junctions</kwd><kwd>invasion</kwd><kwd>endometriosis</kwd><kwd>motility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD109027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nicholson</surname><given-names>Bruce J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP160844</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nicholson</surname><given-names>Bruce J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1 TR 002645</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nicholson</surname><given-names>Bruce J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP150600.</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kirma</surname><given-names>Nameer B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A unique functional comparison of the major endometrial cell types from 44 control and endometriosis patients demonstrates not only a uterine origin of the disease, but also that endometrial to mesothelial cell gap junctions are required for invasive lesion formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting ~10% of reproductive-age women, or 190 million worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shafrir et al., 2018</xref>), characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue in extrauterine lesions on the pelvic peritoneum, ovary and bowel surface. In the US, endometriosis is diagnosed in 35–50% of women with pelvic pain, and up to 50% of women with unexplained infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogers et al., 2009</xref>). Reliable diagnosis requires invasive abdominal surgery, resulting in an average delay of 6.7 y from symptom onset to diagnosis, with 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of patients being misdiagnosed at some point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bontempo and Mikesell, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mettler et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the disease imposes a significant socioeconomic burden of ~$80 billion per year for the US alone between prolonged healthcare costs, and loss of productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Soliman et al., 2016</xref>). Treatment of the disease is also limited to excision of lesions, which usually return, or hormonal management of pain, which only further compromises fertility.</p><p>The most widely accepted model for the pathogenesis of endometriosis is retrograde menstruation, in which sloughed endometrial tissue during menses traverses the fallopian tubes (or perhaps in rare cases enters the lymphatic or blood circulation) and when deposited in the peritoneal cavity, forms invasive lesions that remain sensitive to hormonal cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sampson, 1927</xref>). Other origins of ectopic endometrial lesions, including Mullerian remnants, metaplasia of coelomic stem cells, or endometrial stem cells have also been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lauchlan, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Missmer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sasson and Taylor, 2008</xref>), which can explain endometriosis in the absence of menstruation, clonal similarities in ectopic lesions and rare male endometriosis. However, the preponderance of evidence indicates that lesions are of endometrial origin (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burney and Giudice, 2012</xref>). A major outstanding question is why retrograde menstruation, which is estimated to occur in up to 90% of women, would only result in endometriosis in 10% of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burney and Giudice, 2012</xref>). One explanation is that there are specific factors that predispose patients to disease development, but it remains unresolved as to whether these lie in the uterus (the ‘seed’) or the peritoneum (the ‘soil’). Several studies have reported molecular differences in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burney et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ulukus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2022</xref>), including enhanced survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones et al., 1998</xref>) and invasive potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lucidi et al., 2005</xref>) that could promote lesion formation in the pelvic cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hastings and Fazleabas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tamaresis et al., 2014</xref>). But changes in peritoneal factors can also contribute, including hormonal environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parente Barbosa et al., 2011</xref>), oxidative stress, inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augoulea et al., 2012</xref>), and decreased immune clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oosterlynck et al., 1991</xref>). The problem remains to distinguish which of these changes are consequences as opposed to causes of the disease, an issue that requires a greater understanding of invasive mechanisms.</p><p>While much work has been done on the consequences of endometriosis in terms of inflammation, hormone responsiveness, and impact on fertility, little has focused on the initial causes of lesion formation. We know from other invasive processes like metastasis, that such behavior requires enhanced migratory behavior, typically after an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, followed by contact-mediated intercellular interactions between the invading and target tissues. These involve initial adhesion and subsequent gap junction formation that has been proposed to trigger disruption of the barrier functions of the target tissue, although understanding of specific mechanisms are still limited. Gap junctions, composed of connexin (Cx) proteins encoded by a family of 21 GJ(A-D) genes, mediate direct contact and communication between most cells of the body via the exchange of ions as well as metabolites and signaling molecules &lt;1 kD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldberg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hernandez et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Gap Junctions have been implicated in other invasive processes, like metastasis. In a global screen of cervical squamous carcinoma, Cx43 emerged as one of three genes (along with PDGFRA2 and CAV-1) central to cancer invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, expression of functional gap junctions is suppressed in most primary tumors, as they suppress growth, But significant induction of Cx43 and/or Cx26 gap junctions, either by increased expression or trafficking to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kanczuga-Koda et al., 2006</xref>), has also been associated with metastatic breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Naoi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stoletov et al., 2013</xref>), prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lamiche et al., 2012</xref>), and melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito et al., 2000</xref>). GJs appear to exert their effects both during intravasation and extravasation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">el-Sabban and Pauli, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">el-Sabban and Pauli, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Naoi et al., 2007</xref>), as well as forming hetero-cellular GJIC with the target tissue that pass miRNAs or cGAMP to promote target receptivity and an inflammatory environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lamiche et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>Gap junctions have also been associated with multiple aspects of the other major pathology of endometriosis, infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nair et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Winterhager and Kidder, 2015</xref>), and GJs have also been shown to be involved from the earliest phases of oocyte meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Richard and Baltz, 2014</xref>) to endometrial decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaushik et al., 2020</xref>), blastocyst implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grümmer et al., 1996</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diao et al., 2013</xref>), and vascularization of the endometrium during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laws et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Despite these links between GJs and the two major pathologies of endometriosis, studies have been limited to tracking connexin expression. Immunocytochemistry showed a shift in Cx expression of endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) from primarily Cx26 (<italic>GJB2</italic>) with some Cx32 (<italic>GJB1</italic>) in the uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jahn et al., 1995</xref>), to Cx43 (<italic>GJA1</italic>) in peritoneal (ectopic) endometriotic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Regidor et al., 1997</xref>). A similar switch in EEC Cx expression profile was reported ectopically in the uteri of baboons with endometriosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Winterhager et al., 2009</xref>), but this was not seen in human patient samples where Cx expression of EECs remained unaltered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, ESCs have been reported to retain Cx43 expression in both eutopic and ectopic locations, although at significantly reduced levels in endometriosis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nair et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). The reduced Cx43 expression in the uterus has been suggested to contribute to infertility associated with endometriosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2014</xref>), but to date, no studies have explored the role of GJs in lesion formation. Of particular relevance to this is the consistent observations, mentioned above, that connexin expression is repressed in primary tumors, yet is induced in metastatic tumor cells to promote invasion. We investigate this same connection here with regard to endometriosis using primary endometrial stromal and epithelial cells isolated from 22 control and 22 endometriosis patients from stages I-II and III-IV of the disease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Patient data.</title></caption><table

adhesion to the target, we tested the two major endometrial cell types for adhesiveness to mesothelial cells, as this would indicate which cell type we should focus on as the primary instigator of invasion. Peritoneal Mesothelial Cells (PMCs, specifically the LP9 cell line) or primary EECs or ESCs isolated from patients as described in Methods (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) were attached to the cantilever of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) and brought into contact with LP9 mesothelial cells in a monolayer, and after 30 s, the force needed to separate the cells was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> - <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sancho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roca-Cusachs et al., 2017</xref>).

These measurements were conducted with cells from control patients.

Endometrial cells labeled with a lipophilic fluorescent dye (Di-O) are dropped onto a hormone depleted Matrigel-coated Boyden chamber on which is grown a confluent monolayer of the LP9 PMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Neither ESCs nor EECs invaded through the membrane alone, confirming a dependence on a PMC monolayer for invasion. PMCs alone showed limited invasiveness, but this was excluded as only Di-O labeled cells were counted. Comparisons of ESC and EEC invasiveness from all patients showed ESCs to be twofold more invasive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), consistent with their higher level of adhesiveness to PMCs observed above. This led us to focus our invasion comparisons between control (8) and endometriosis (11) patients primarily on ESCs. ESCs from endometriosis patients were 4–6 fold more invasive than from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) mostly due to patients from more advanced disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> <bold>-</bold> support data 1). This difference was less (~2.5 fold) when invasion was measured in the absence of a serum gradient, or at higher gradients (data not shown), indicating that endometriosis ESCs are more responsive to low-level chemo-attractant gradients. We also observed a similar difference of ~ fourfold when we compared invasiveness across PMCs derived from either control or endometriosis patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>In the retrograde model of endometriosis, fragments of the endometrium, containing both ESCs and EECs, invade the mesothelium, explaining why both cell types are found in endometriotic lesions. So while EECs alone were less invasive, we did test the effect of mixed ESC/EEC cultures in invasion across PMCs, but in the absence of an attractive serum gradient to more closely mimic in vivo conditions. When EECs were mixed in equal numbers with ESCs they enhanced invasion by 1.5-fold in control samples (n=9), and 2.1-fold in endometriosis samples (n=8), but this was only significant (p&lt;0.01) in endometriosis samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Differential labeling the two cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) confirmed that ESCs were the primary invading cells, with EECs making up 20% and 40% of the invading cells in controls and endometriosis, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>While most endometriosis lesions are restricted to the peritoneal cavity, some (&lt;5%) can be found outside, even as far as the lungs and brain. Such lesions clearly cannot arise form retrograde menstruation, but as we have shown that ESCs from patients are highly invasive through PMCs, we tested whether they may also be able to intravasate into the circulation, allowing further spread. A comparison of eight patients with different invasive tendencies demonstrated that invasiveness across a PMC monolayer was highly correlated with invasiveness across an endothelial cell monolayer of HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), suggesting that spread on endometrial cells through the circulation may also be enhanced in endometriosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ESCs from endometriosis patients show greater inherent motility, and this is further enhanced by PMCs</title><p>To assess another major contributor to invasiveness, we compared the motility of ESCs from control and endometriosis patients using a wound healing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

In a subset of these patient samples (eight controls and four endometriosis patients) we also tested the effects of co-culture of ESCs with LP9 PMCs. The motility of co-cultures compared to ESCs grown alone was not significantly changed in control samples but increased by 1.5-fold in endometriosis samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We could not assess the effect of EECs on ESC motility due to low adhesiveness of EECs, leading to selective loss of these cells and disruption of the cell monolayer needed for motility measurements. While these data show a net threefold difference in motility between control and endometriosis ESCs in the presence of PMCs, this does not fully account for the sixfold difference in invasiveness, indicating that additional factors play a role.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparisons of motility of patient endometrial stromal cells (ESCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Motility was measured by rates of wound clousre in in an incucyte system (images at 0, 24 and 48 hr after scraping).

ESC cultures alone show most of the Cx43 staining is intracellular, particularly evident in non-confocal images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>). Some punctate staining at cell-cell interfaces indicative of gap junction plaques (arrowheads) is evident, particularly in confocal images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>).

Punctate staining at cell-cell interfaces is now more frequently observed between ESCs and PMCs (solid yellow arrowheads), as well as between ESCs (green-filled yellow arrowheads) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and J</xref>).

While these did achieve 60–70% KD of GJIC, and a significant (~40%) block of invasion, results were highly variable due to compromised cell health following transfection. This affected both the effective formation of a mesothelial barrier by as PMCs, and the motility and invasiveness of ESCs. Thus, to avoid these complicating effects of transient transfection, we moved to stable Lentiviral infection to generate PMCs and ESCs that express inducible shRNAs targeted to Cx43 (or scrambled shRNAs as control). An RFP reporter allowed us to track which cells expressed the shRNA, which averaged 61 ± 8% (n=8) of the cell population in the presence of doxycycline. Suppression of Cx43 protein levels in the total cell population was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and GJIC was inhibited by 95 ± 4% (n=7) in infected ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

This DN construct forms structurally normal gap junctional plaques but prevents channel opening when co-expressed wtCx43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beahm et al., 2006</xref>).

ESCs from control subjects or endometriosis patients were first labeled with the membrane dye DiO, and dropped onto a PMC monolayer at a ratio of ~1:20 (ESC:PMC).

First, we observed that the ‘barrier function’ of a PMC monolayer in the absence of ESCs was dependent on Cx43 expression, as the degree of penetrance was reduced when Cx43 was overexpressed and increased when Cx43 was inhibited by shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This is consistent with GJs being part of the intercellular nexus, including tight and adhesions junctions, that connect cells. However, this effect was strikingly inverted when we introduced ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Cx43 overexpression in PMCs significantly enhanced penetrance in response to ESCs, while Cx43 inhibition by shRNA eliminated the effect of ESCs, so that penetrance was indistinguishable from control PMC monolayers. The only difference between the studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref> is the presence of ESCs in the latter, implicating the formation of GJs between ESCs and PMCs as the factor that must trigger the breakdown of the PMC barrier. This directly demonstrated that this was dependent on Cx43 channels, as expression of a DN Cx43 in PMCs, which suppresses coupling but maintains the gap junction structures, and all their adhesive and structural properties, also prevented barrier breakdown similarly to Cx43 shRNA.</p><p>This raised the question that if GJs pass signals from ESCs to PMCs that promote the breakdown of the mesothelial barrier, do gap junctions between PMCs also play a role in propagating such a signal distribution through the mesothelium. To test this, we dropped ESCs at a lower density (1:50 ratio with PMCs) and measured the degree of penetrance between PMCs at increasing distances from a single contacting ESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). ESCs from stage I-II patients, which showed only modest induction of ESC-PMC coupling, were compared with ESCs from stage III-IV patients, which showed much greater levels of ESC-PMC coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). When penetrance was plotted against distance from a dropped ESC, the influence of the ESCs decayed to background levels at much greater rates in the case of poorly coupled ESCs (Endom. stage I-II) than well-coupled ones (Endom. stage III-IV), propagating over distances of 200 µm to &gt;700 µm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). As expected, knock-down of Cx43 by shRNA in the LP9 cells eliminated all effects of the ESCs. However, overexpression of Cx43 in LP9 PMCs caused a dramatic extension of the propagation range to beyond the limits of our recording at 800 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), corresponding to over 40 cells from the dropped ESC.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Disruption of the mesothelial barrier by endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) is propagated through mesothelial gap junctions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Using a constant force of 1 nN, the AFM tip was moved over the peritoneal mesothelial cell (PMC) monolayer progressively further away from a dropped DiI labeled ESC.

Retrograde menstruation of endometrium into the peritoneal cavity is the most widely accepted theory to explain most endometriosis cases. However, why is endometriosis seen in only 10% of women, when ~90% display retrograde menstruation? Are there specific changes in the uterine endometrium (the ‘seed’) or the peritoneal lining (the ‘soil’) that predispose patients to develop the disease? Most studies have focused on expression changes in endometrial cells in utero, from established lesions, or on the inflammatory sequalae of the disease. Few studies have examined the initial stages of lesion formation that could provide mechanistic insights into disease pathophysiology and most directly address the issue of a ‘seed’ or ‘soil’ origin. We have taken a reductionist approach to the problem by isolating and characterizing each major cell type involved in initial lesion formation from control (19) and endometriosis (22) patients: endometrial epithelial (glandular) and stromal (supporting) cells (EECs and ESCs, respectively) from control and endometriosis uterine biopsies, and PMCs, both established LP9 cells and isolated from control and endometriosis patients (characterized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta Go et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Of the endometrial cells, the major focus was on ESCs, as they proved more adhesive to PMCs, more motile, and ultimately twice as invasive as EECs from the same patients. ESCs from endometriosis compared to control patients were also more adhesive to PMCs, more motile (~ twofold), and much more invasive across PMCs (2–6 fold depending on disease stage). EECs were mixed with ESCs to mimic in vivo conditions, invasiveness was further enhanced, but this was only significant in endometriosis samples, which also showed a higher fraction of EECs in the invading cell population than controls (40% compared to 15%). Our experiments were conducted on primary cells cultured from pipelle endometrial biopsies, which leaves open the possibility that stem cells present in the endometrium could be included in our sample, although they may differentiate into one of the main cell types in the culture.</p><p>Our observations that endometriosis-derived ESCs show increased responsiveness to other cell types, including enhanced motility and adhesion to, gap junction communication with, and invasion across PMCs, combined with prior findings that endometriosis endometrial cells show enhanced repression of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>), and immune avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Björk et al., 2024</xref>), strongly implicate changes in the endometrium as causative of the disease. The most direct deduction from these results is that the 10% of patients who develop endometriosis are distinguished from the 80% that have retrograde menstruation without endometriosis by pre-existing changes in the endometrial lining that predispose the cells to an invasive phenotype.</p><p>One important question is the extent to which endometrial cell behaviors are affected by the menstrual phase, birth control, or other variables between patients. We compared invasiveness, motility, and induction of GJIC by PMCs between control and endometriosis ESC in patients from the proliferative or secretory phases of the menstrual cycle or those on oral contraceptives. While the limited numbers precluded applying robust statistics, under all menstrual conditions the endometriosis cells showed enhanced activity of each phenotype. Among endometriosis patients, where we had 3–6 patients in each group, we also compared each ESC phenotype from patients in different menstrual conditions (cycle stage or oral contraceptives). No statistically significant differences were observed, suggesting modest hormonal influences on the aspects of ESC behavior associated with invasion. Any minor differences are outweighed by the disease phenotype.</p><p>Since we could not assess endometrial samples patients prior to disease manifestation, it is certainly possible that some of the changes we observe may be a consequence of the disease through feedback from lesions in the peritoneum that can globally affect hormonal levels and inflammatory responses. Indeed, such effects could explain the observations in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nirgianakis et al., 2020</xref> that a significant number of patients (48%) presenting initially with superficial lesions can show more deep infiltrating lesions on recurrence. Delineating the degree to which endometrial changes pre-exist disease onset will remain a challenge based on both practical and ethical considerations governing human trials. The only thing that is clear from the studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta Go et al., 2023</xref> is that the invasive behavior of ESCs is not influenced by PMC origin (from control or endometriosis patients), only by ESC origin.</p><p>While others have compared other aspects of endometrial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Björk et al., 2024</xref>), we have focused on their invasive behavior and interactions at the mesothelial lining. The enhanced invasiveness of eutopic ESCs from Endometriosis patients across PMCs seems in large part to be due to their enhanced responsiveness to PMC signals that increase GJIC and motility. This result is consistent with our prior CyTOF single-cell Mass Spectroscopy comparisons of ESCs alone and in co-culture with PMCs that showed much larger shifts in expression of markers of EMT plasticity (ZEB1, SNAIL1, TWIST) in endometriosis than control-derived ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2020</xref>). That ESCs also increase invasiveness when co-cultured with their cognate EECs, suggests that the hypersensitivity of endometriosis ESCs is not restricted to PMCs.</p><p>Many of these changes parallel those observed in metastatic cancer, including the enhanced motility, target-induced changes in EMT plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lambert et al., 2017</xref>), and the ability to breakdown tissue barriers during intra- and extravasation and metastatic invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reymond et al., 2013</xref>). In the latter processes, one of the earliest steps is the formation of gap junctions between the tumor cell and endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">el-Sabban and Pauli, 1991</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">el-Sabban and Pauli, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Naoi et al., 2007</xref>) or target tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stoletov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016b</xref>). In fact, GJ are typically suppressed in primary tumors, but need to reactivate in order to metastasize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu and Wang, 2019</xref>), which is often associated with more efficient transport of connexins to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kanczuga-Koda et al., 2006</xref>). We demonstrate here a very analogous process in endometriosis. GJ expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2021</xref>) and cell coupling are suppressed ectopically but then GJ coupling is strongly induced ectopically when ESCs encounter PMCs through the trafficking of intracellular Cx43 stores to cell-cell interfaces. By further analogy with metastasis, the invasiveness of ESCs across the mesothelium is shown here to be highly correlated with their invasiveness across an endothelium. This is important in terms of disease, as the low incidence of endometriosis outside of the peritoneum has been used to argue that lesions may arise from non-endometrial cells such as stem cells or Mullerian remnants. However, it seems that the same features that make ESCs more invasive in the peritoneum In endometriosis, also increase their chances of entering the bloodstream.</p><p>GJ coupling has been associated with enhanced motility in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Polusani et al., 2016</xref>) and may play a role in PMC induction of ESC motility seen here, although this was not directly tested. However, we do clearly demonstrate that this induced GJ coupling between ESCs and PMCs is required for disruption of the mesothelial barrier and invasion, something that has not been definitively established in metastasis. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, we propose that contact between ESCs and PMCs induces the trafficking of Cx43 to the surface and formation of ESC-PMC gap junctions that mediate the transfer of yet-to-be-identified intercellular signals that initiate the disruption of the intercellular junctional nexus that prevents trans-mesothelial migration. The adhesive roles of gap junctions do not appear to play a major role, as the DN Cx43T154A, which preserves junctional structures, but prevents channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beahm et al., 2006</xref>), also inhibits invasion. Release of signals through Cx43 hemichannels also seems unlikely, since invasion can be similarly prevented by KD of Cx43 in either ESCs or PMCs.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of gap junction intercellular coupling (GJIC) induction of trans-mesothelial invasion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In healthy patients, when endometrial cells (light brown) encounter a mesothelium (brick red) following arrival in the peritoneum via retrograde menstruation, there is limited GJIC between endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) and peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs). ESCs also likely undergo apoptosis. (<bold>B</bold>) In endometriosis, interactions with mesothelial cells trigger Cx43 trafficking to the cell surface and a significant enhancement of GJIC. The increased GJIC mediates the transfer of signals to PMCs (green triangles), which propagate through the mesothelium, inducing disruption of the adhesive and tight junctions between PMCs, facilitating the invasion of the ESCs. There would also be a passage of signals from PMCs to ESCs (purple dots) that induce further changes in ESCs that could promote invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2022</xref>).

But apparently, this proves to be an Achilles heel when ESCs arrive in the peritoneum, as now the GJs between PMCs mediate further propagation of intercellular signals leading to a breakdown of mesothelial intercellular contacts at significant distances from the site of ESC contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref><bold>, lower panel</bold>).</p><p>Together, these studies demonstrate that eutopic ESCs (i.e. from the uterine endometrium) are very distinct in endometriosis and control patients, the former being characterized by enhanced responsiveness to interactions with EECs and PMCs that promote invasive behavior. Gap junctions between ESCs and PMCs, and within the mesothelium, are shown to be critical in initiating lesion formation through mutually induced changes in the phenotypes of both cells. Together these results demonstrate that changes within the uterine endometrium prime ESCs to be invasive once they reach the peritoneal cavity. There seem to be many parallels with the development of metastatic potential in cancer cells, which is likely determined before they leave the primary tumor, and also involves an induction of gap junction formation that facilitates invasive behavior. Our data also supports a ‘seed’ (endometrium) rather than ‘soil’ (mesothelium), origin for endometriosis, which is more definitively established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta Go et al., 2023</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Primary endometrial epithelial cell isolation from endometrial biopsies</title><p>Primary ESCs and EECs were isolated from endometrial biopsies obtained from women with and without endometriosis under IRB protocol # 20070728 HR (8-31-23).

The individual capillary gels within each cassette allow for band fixation, antibody labeling, and visualization (using a fluorescent master mix) within the gel. A biotinylated marker set of proteins was run in one lane. Antibodies used were anti-Laminin A/C (#2032 Cell Signaling Technology Danvers, MA) and anti-Cx43 (#3512 Cell Signaling Technology), both at 1/50 dilution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>ESCs or EECs are plated at ~50 K cells per well onto eight chamber slides (Nunc LabTech II, ….) pre-coated with 100 ug/ml poly-D- Lysine for 30 min at 37 °C and grown to 50–90% confluence. In co-culture experiments of ESCs with LP9 PMCs, LP9 cells were plated first and grown overnight to 70–90% confluence before dropping ~20 K ESCs pre-labeled with 1/1000 dilution of CellTracker Green (#C2925, Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher) in serum-free media for 30 min at 37 °C. After 4 hr to allow ESCs to attach, cells were either fixed, or in some cases pre-treated and stained with Membrite Fix dye (#30,092 T, Biotium, Freemont, CA) at 1/1000 dilution per the manufacturer’s instructions to visualize membranes. All cells were washed with PBS with 1 mM Ca<sup>++</sup>/Mg<sup>++</sup> (CaPBS) prior to fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 15 min at RT. Further CaPBS washed preceded permeabilization with 0.25% triton X-100 and 1% glycine in PBS (15 min at RT) and subsequent blocking of non-specific binding with1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 0.5% Tween-20 (1 hr at 37 °C or 4 °C overnight). Primary antibody staining was for 3 hr at RT or overnight at 4 °C in 0.1%BSA, 0.2% Tween-20 in PBS. Primary antibodies used were: anti-Cx43 (#3512 Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:100 dilution; anti-Cytokeratin 7 for EECs (#902-Abcam) at 1/1000, and anti-Vimentin (#1–92687, NovusBio) at 1/5000. After CaPBS washes, secondary antibodies to the appropriate species conjugated to Alexa 488 or Alexa 594 (#s 10680 and 11037-Invitrogen) were used at 1:1000 concentration for 1 hr. at room temperature in the dark. After final washes in CaPBS, the chamber grid is removed and a coverslip mounted with slow-fade Diamond mountant with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (#S36964, Invitrogen) to visualize the nuclei. Cells were imaged on a Nikon 2000 inverted epi-fluorescent microscope. In some cases, superimposed phase images were used to trace the membrane contacts between cells for clarity in visualizing Cx43 localization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Motility assays</title><p>Motility was assessed by a wound healing assay illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>. Cultures are grown to confluence in a 96-well plate format before being mechanically wounded and washed. Wound closure is measured every 3 hr in the Incucyte automated cell monitoring system (Essen Biosciences/Sartorius, MI) over ~3 d. Mixed cultures were plated with 2/3<sup>rd</sup> primary ESCs with 1/3<sup>rd</sup> LP9-PMCs. As we found that dye labeling of the cells can affect motility, only bulk migration of the whole culture was measured. % wound closure was platted against time and the linear portion fitted by regression analysis to provide the rates shown. All assays were performed in quadruplicate wells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Homo-cellular and hetero-cellular GJIC assays</title><p>GJIC was measured using a novel automated parachute assay. Recipient cells are grown to confluence in a 96 cell flat bottomed plate, and the media changed to (Phenol Red-free DMEM, sodium pyruvate, and 5%FBS – Assay Media) immediately before the assay. Donor cells in separate wells are incubated for 20 min with 10 uM calcein AM (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher), a membrane-permeable dye that on cleavage by intracellular esterases becomes membrane impermeable, but permeable to gap junctions. After washing, trypsinization, and addition of assay media, ~2500 calcein-labeled donor cells per well are dropped (‘parachuted’) onto the recipient cell layer, and calcein transfer between donor and recipient cells is observed by fluorescent microscopic imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For homo-cellular interactions, ESCs, EECs or LP9 donor cells were parachuted onto recipient cells of the same type. For hetero-cellular GJIC assays, ESCs or EECs were parachuted onto LP9 recipient cells. Fluorescent, bright field, and digital phase contrast images of 10–15 fields per well were captured on an Operetta automated microscope (Perkin Elmer) at 30- min intervals for approximately 2 hr. A program (developed in consultation with Perkin Elmer) allowed the identification of all cells on the plate, (from phase contrast image), original donors (5–15 per field), and dye-filled recipients (based on calcein intensity). Data are expressed as # of fluorescent recipient cells/# of donor cells for each condition (A/D ratio), plotted over time, and a linear regression line drawn through the data, with the slope used as a measure of coupling and regression coefficient (typically &gt;0.8) used as a measure of assay reliability.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>AFM measurements of cell-cell adhesion and mesothelial integrity</title><p>We applied a Nanoscope Catalyst atomic force microscope (AFM, Bruker) interfaced with an epi-fluorescent inverted microscope Eclipse Ti (Nikon, Melville, NY). AFM images were acquired with the Peak Force Quantitative Nanomechanical Mapping (QNM) mode with cells immersed in appropriate culture media. ScanAsyst probes (Bruker, Billerica, MA) with the nominal spring constant 0.4 N/m were used for imaging. The exact spring constant for each probe was determined with the thermal noise method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butt and Jaschke, 1995</xref>). For each cell culture dish at least five fields 100 by 100 μm were collected with the Peak Force set point of 2nN, and electronic resolution of 256 by 256 pixels. Nanomechanical data were processed with Nanoscope Analysis software v.1.7 (Bruker) using retrace images.</p><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Cell-to-cell adhesion</title><p>We attached a tester cell to a cantilever of a tipless probe MLCT-O10 (Bruker, cantilever A, spring constant 0.07 N/m) using polyethyleneimine (PEI) as a glue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedrichs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Briefly, the probes were immersed in 0.01% PEI in water for 30 min. Tester cell’s attachment to a culture dish was weakened by replacement of the culture medium with a non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution (Millipore) for 15–30 min in a cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5%CO). Next, a single tester cell loosely attached to a culture dish was attached to a PEI-covered cantilever by pressing it at 1nN for 5–10 min. After visual inspection of successful cell attachment, the tester cell was lifted and transferred to a dish containing single tested cells. Then the tester cell was positioned over a tested cell and the cantilever slowly lowered till cell-cell interactions were detected with a force plot. The cells were left interacting for 30–180 sec at forces 0.5–5 nN and then the tester cell was lifted. During this step, a force plot was recorded, and the collected data was applied to calculate cell – cell adhesion parameters. The force plots were baseline corrected and a maximum of adhesion between cells during their detachment was calculated (units of force, Newton) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taubenberger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dufrêne et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Integrity of LP9 mesothelial monolayer</title><p>LP9 cells were grown to confluence in a 60 mm culture dish. ESC cells grown in separate wells were stained with DiO, suspended, and dropped on to the LP9 monolayer at either a 1:50 or 1:20 ratio to the LP9 cells. In cases where cell mixes were used, ESCs and EECs were labeled with different dyes (DiI and DiO, respectively) prior to mixing in equal numbers and dropping onto PMCs. Three hours later the cells were imaged by AFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). To calculate a tip penetration depth, cell boundaries were identified using images collected by the peak force error (PFE) channel. To exclude gap areas between cells or areas of cells growing in multilayers, PFE images were overlaid with height channel images after processing them with the flatten function of first order. Tip penetration was calculated based on a height histogram of all data points using a difference between the prevalent maximum of cell monolayer height and the prevalent maximum depth between cells accessible for the tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>co-founder and shareholder of Hear Biotech Inc, developing a diagnostic for endometriosis in part based on these findings</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Performed the experiments shown in Figure 1G, which were added to address an issue raised by the Reviewing Editor</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Software, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Explicit patient consent was obtained for all endometrial samples used in this study.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Sang Jun Han as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that your work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The Cx43-mediated GJIC on HESCs would provide critical clues to understand the molecular etiology of endometriosis progression. However, all three reviewers pointed that the sample size of control and stage-specific endometriotic samples is too small for statistical analysis. Therefore, the results may be an artifact of individual differences in the patient samples that are not well controlled rather than due to endometriosis. Also, reviewers asked many questions regarding this manuscript because most of the results did not clearly support the authors' hypothesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The adhesion and invasion of shedding endometrial fragments made by retrograde menstruation to the target site are critical cellular processes to initiate endometriosis progression. However, the molecular etiology regarding the invasion process in endometriosis is not elucidated yet. This manuscript proposed that Cx43-mediated GJIC in HESCs is crucial to enhance adhesion and invasion processes of endometriosis.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>1. The activation of Cx43-mediated GJIC on HESCs would provide critical clues to understand the molecular etiology of endometriosis progression.</p><p>2. New sing cell-based gene expression profile with ESCs and ESCs between normal and endometriosis patients would provide the new information to define the molecular etiology of invasion and adhesion of endometriosis.</p><p>3. For the functional validation of the role of Cx43 in ESCs for the adhesion process in endometriosis, the author generates new Cx43 knockdown and overexpression of DN C43 mutant ESCs and employs a unique approach, such as heterotypic coupling assay and AFM assays.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>1. The authors used only two human endometrial stromal cells from control, only one human endometrial stromal cells from stage I-II, and 5 endometrial stromal cells from stage III-IV endometriosis patients. The sample size of control and stage I-II is too small for statistical analysis compared to stage III-IV of endometriosis.</p><p>2. The authors' hypothesis may be opposite from their data. The authors claim that Cx43 mediated GJIP axis has an essential role in adhesion and invasion of ESCs from endometriosis patients compared to normal ESCs. However, the single-cell gene expression profile showed that ESCs from endometriosis patients have much less Cx43 levels than normal ESCs (Figure 1A and 1B). Also, Cx43 knockdown ESCs were generated from ESCs from endometriosis patients even though ESCs from endometriosis patients have low Cx43 levels. This discrepancy makes the reader confused.</p><p>3. In contrast with ESCs, EECs from endometriosis patients have higher levels of Cx43 than normal EECs. However, EECs from endometriosis patients did not have adhesion and invasion activity compared to control EECs. Therefore, it is not clearly described the cell-type-specific function of Cx43 in endometriosis progression.</p><p>There are main questions about the results need to be 'adequately addressed' to substantiate their conclusions.</p><p>1. The authors used only two human endometrial stromal cells from control, only one human endometrial stromal cells from stage I-II, and 5 endometrial stromal cells from stage III-IV endometriosis patients. The sample size of control and stage I-II is too small for statistical analysis compared to stage III-IV of endometriosis. Therefore, the authors should increase the number of human endometrial cells for the control and stage I-II.</p><p>2. In contrast with Figure 1A, the number of human endometrial epithelial cells from stage III-IV is only one in Figure 1B. Therefore, there is a problem in statistical analysis with only one sample for human endometrial epithelial cells from stage I-II and III-IV to determine the differential gene expression profile between different disease stages.</p><p>3. Most of the data in Figure 1E and 1F have no significant difference between control and endometriosis samples due to limited sample size. Therefore, it is hard to make a conclusion to support the author's hypothesis with these results. Also, 003 data set in Figure 1F is not shown in Figure 1B. Whys single-cell RNA analysis of human epithelial cells (003, NC) is not shown in Figure 1B.</p><p>4. In Figure 2, the percentage of SC-5 and EC-4 is inversely corrected with the percentage of SC-6 and EC-5 in an endometriosis stage-dependent manner. What is SC-5 and EC-4? Do these cell types have any molecular properties to enhance the endometriosis progression?</p><p>5. In Figure 3, the authors claimed that CX43 has an essential role in the GJIC of endometriotic ESCs compared to control ESCs. However, the authors showed that endometriotic ESCs have low levels of CX43 compared to control (Figure 1A). In Figure 3C, the authors showed that endometriotic ESCs have higher GJIC than normal ESCs even though endometriotic ESCs have lower Cx43 levels than control ESC. Previous studies revealed the promoting role of Cx43-GJIC in cell-cell adhesion and metastasis in prostate cancer, gastric cancer, and glioma cells.</p><p>Therefore, endometriotic ESCs (low Cx43) have higher GJIC than control ESC (high Cx43), which is the opposite of other studies. Thus, the authors should show Cx43 protein levels between control and endometriotic ESC by Western blotting. The authors should also determine loss- and gain-of Cx43 gene function in normal and endometriotic ESC and EECs to validate the role of CX43 in GJIC.</p><p>6. Figure 4, the authors claimed that endometriotic ESCs are the major invasive front into mesothelium cells. However, it is not clear whether control ESCs also attach to PMCs compared to the endometriotic ESCs. To validate Cx43 in cell-to-cell attachment, the loss- or gain-of Cx45 gene function in control and endometriotic ESC and EEC should be analyzed by AFM.</p><p>7. Cytokine, such as TNF α, induce invasion of refluxed endometrial tissues to enhance endometriosis progression. However, in Figure 5, there is no cytokine exposure to enhance invasion of endometrial cells from normal versus endometriosis patients. Therefore, there is no difference in invasion activity of ESC and EEC from normal versus endometriosis patients. Thus, the authors should conduct the cytokine-mediated invasion assay.</p><p>8. In Figure 5, the authors showed that invasion activity difference between normal versus endometriosis is detected when ESC was cocultured with EEC. In Figure 6, however, the authors used only ESCs to define the Cx45 knockdown effect on GJ changing and invasion activity in between normal versus endometriosis. Therefore, there is no significant difference in CX43 knockdown effect on GJ changing and invasion activity between control and endometriotic ESC. Therefore, these observations do not support the role of Cx43 in endometriosis progression. Therefore, the authors should employ the mixture of ESC and EEC to examine the difference between control versus endometriosis. In Figure 1, the authors showed that Cx levels are significantly redubbed in ESC from endometriosis than those in ESC from control. However, the authors did not show the differential levels of Cx43 in ESC between control versus endometriosis patients by Western blotting in this figure. If CX43 levels in endometriotic ESC are too low to be detected as compared with normal ESC, there is no meaning to define the Cx43 knockdown effect in endometriotic ESC. The gain-of Cx43 gene function study should be conducted in endometriotic ESC rather than Cx43 knockdown.</p><p>9. In Figure 7D, there is no significant difference in penetration value between control and endometriotic ESCs even though both ESCs elevated penetration value compared to no ESC control. This data implies that both control and endometriotic ESCs could disrupt a mesothelial cells' barrier function to initiate the endometriosis progression. Therefore, this result does not explain why about 10% of reproductive-aged women who have experienced retrograde menstruation have endometriosis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors were trying to show how gap junction proteins are overexpressed, move to the cell membrane, and function to propel endometrial cells to invade into mesothelial cells.</p><p>The major strengths are the innovation of the techniques used. A weakness is the justification of the sample size and appropriate statistical analysis for each experiment.</p><p>The study achieved its aims as presented. However, there is some concern for rigor and reproducibility bases on sample size and statistical analyses.</p><p>This work, if reproducible, would have great impact on the field as endometriosis pathogenesis via retrograde menstruation remains largely unknown on a molecular and cellular level.</p><p>Phenotyping of endometriosis patients is critical. While ASRM staging criteria is a thing, more frequently indications for surgery such as pelvic pain or infertility are useful. Additionally, type of endometriosis (i.e., superficial peritoneal, ovarian endometrioma, rectovaginal nodules, iatrogenic, deep invasive endometriosis, or mixture) would be useful.</p><p>The methods mentions that one patient was on combined oral contraceptives but that is not mentioned in Table 1. Additionally, race and ethnicity should be shown and the method to determine both (i.e., patient described) should be described. Pregnancy status (current) or infertility or parity/gravidity should be provided for context.</p><p>The menstrual cycle phase has been shown to change in normal cycling women and to have unique features in women with endometriosis. It is unclear whether the menstrual cycle stage listed was consistent with last menstrual period, surgical pathology, or just based on steroid hormone levels.</p><p>Finally, the history of the control patients is critical. Please confirm that those women had no history of pelvic pain, endometriosis, or infertility. Please confirm that biopsies were done during surgery to prove that endometriosis was not present. 7% of women with pelvic pain have endometriosis on random biopsy without surgeon visualized lesion.</p><p>Ep-CAM as epithelial marker seems reasonable for normal eutopic epithelium. However, 12Z cells, an epithelial-like cell line derived from peritoneal lesions are E-cad negative yet N-cad positive. Please provide the appropriate rationale for using the Ep-CAM marker to discern epithelial cells. How different was the enrichment of EECs with Ep-CAM affinity column compared to differential attachment?</p><p>Please provide rationale for Actin as housekeeping gene when the assay contained other potential housekeeping genes. What is UBB?</p><p>The statistical analysis does not include a justification of sample size or power analysis.</p><p>Figure 1: the authors conclude that the gene expression patterns are different between normal and endometriosis via a heat map. In particular the statement that the transition to more aggressive disease is evident is not clearly visualized. In particular, this dataset needs to be objectively assessed using statistical means to support the conclusions.</p><p>It is interesting that the single cell analysis was then combined into violin plots.</p><p>The details of the figures are vague. There are blue arrows on figure 2 but I cannot tell from the figure legend what that means.</p><p>Figure 3 B – additional images showing similar results are needed. It is unclear why the parachute test was not performed with epithelium and stroma. I understand that the goal is to look at the invasion through mesothelium but as a control for proof of principal epithelial stromal communication should be shown. Or at least discussed why you believe this is a different mechanism.</p><p>Please justify the sample size for Figure 4.</p><p>Figure 6: do you have images of the DN Cx43 showing the localization of the protein that fails to function in cells?</p><p>Figure 7 is my favorite figure. I think you could provide a more descriptive cartoon of this. And highlight it on Figure 8.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The introduction could be substantially shortened.</p><p>The discussion includes what should be in the Results section.</p><p>It would be of interest to examine the endometriosis itself rather than the endometrial cells of women with the disease.</p><p>The data are well done however the use of a very small number of endometrial cells and not endometriosis precludes generalization. The results may be an artifact of individual differences in the patient samples that are not well controlled rather than due to endometriosis.</p><p><bold>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</bold></p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Hypersensitive intercellular responses of endometrial stromal cells drive invasion in Endometriosis&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Diane Harper (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors are attempting to show how gap junction proteins are over-expressed in the endometrium of women with endometriosis, and is one mechanism by which endometriosis/the endometrium of women with endometriosis has invasive/migratory potential/ability. The strengths include their various methods utilized/described. They use their results to postulate that the invasiveness/migratory capabilities of ectopic endometrium from women with endometriosis is mediated by gap junctions, and that it provides further support for the role of the endometrium in allowing endometriosis to be an invasive disorder.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>It would have been helpful to have more information on the comparison/rationale for looking at gap junctions from background from cancer literature. Also, would recommend mentioning the role of stem cells as another potential etiology of endometriosis</p><p>Methods:</p><p>While the methods performed are robust, why wasn't histology used as a first line assessment of invasion performed as a first line?</p><p>The statistical analysis does not include a justification of sample size or power analysis-- was this performed?</p><p>Also, what is the rationale for some of the analyses performed as one sided t tests?</p><p>Results: an overall concern is the at times small sample size-- while the authors note in their responses an increased sample size, this is not consistently seen across all experiments.</p><p>If the gap junctions are over all low, how can we justify the great importance placed on CX43. Furthermore, prior studies have consistently commented on low Cx43, so I believe there is still some confusion for why Cx43 knockdown was performed if it is already low (Yu J., Boicea A., Barrett K.L., James C.O., Bagchi I.C., Bagchi M.K., Nezhat C., Sidell N., Taylor R.N.

The authors claim that Cx43 mediated GJIP axis has an essential role in adhesion and invasion of ESCs from endometriosis patients compared to normal ESCs. However, the single-cell gene expression profile showed that ESCs from endometriosis patients have much less Cx43 levels than normal ESCs (Figure 1A and 1B). Also, Cx43 knockdown ESCs were generated from ESCs from endometriosis patients even though ESCs from endometriosis patients have low Cx43 levels. This discrepancy makes the reader confused.</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, the single cell gene expression from our expanded patient base has now been submitted for publication separately to an Ob/Gyn specialty journal, allowing us to focus on cell mechanism and physiology here.</p><p>Secondly, the confusion of the reviewer is understandable, as most of the connexin genes we analyzed show decreased expression in endometriosis derived ESCs. However, the expression levels of Cx43, the major connexin (10x higher than other Cxs), does not change significantly with disease, consistent with the coupling levels we see. The major difference is the induction of coupling seen with endometriosis stromal cells when encountering the mesothelium due to trafficking rather than increased expression. We believe it is the change in expression level, from low to high on encountering the mesothelium, that triggers phenotypic changes in both cell lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In contrast with ESCs, EECs from endometriosis patients have higher levels of Cx43 than normal EECs. However, EECs from endometriosis patients did not have adhesion and invasion activity compared to control EECs. Therefore, it is not clearly described the cell-type-specific function of Cx43 in endometriosis progression.</p></disp-quote><p>We now better understand the role of EECs in endometriosis, in that they do not form the predominant invasive species but do seem to enhance invasiveness. As is the case for ESCs, while many minor Cx species increase expression levels with endometriosis, Cx43, which is most abundant and contributes most functional coupling, does not change greatly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are main questions about the results need to be 'adequately addressed' to substantiate their conclusions.</p><p>1.

In contrast with Figure 1A, the number of human endometrial epithelial cells from stage III-IV is only one in Figure 1B.

In Figure 2, the percentage of SC-5 and EC-4 is inversely corrected with the percentage of SC-6 and EC-5 in an endometriosis stage-dependent manner. What is SC-5 and EC-4?

In Figure 3, the authors claimed that CX43 has an essential role in the GJIC of endometriotic ESCs compared to control ESCs. However, the authors showed that endometriotic ESCs have low levels of CX43 compared to control (Figure 1A). In Figure 3C, the authors showed that endometriotic ESCs have higher GJIC than normal ESCs even though endometriotic ESCs have lower Cx43 levels than control ESC. Previous studies revealed the promoting role of Cx43-GJIC in cell-cell adhesion and metastasis in prostate cancer, gastric cancer, and glioma cells.</p><p>Therefore, endometriotic ESCs (low Cx43) have higher GJIC than control ESC (high Cx43), which is the opposite of other studies. Thus, the authors should show Cx43 protein levels between control and endometriotic ESC by Western blotting. The authors should also determine loss- and gain-of Cx43 gene function in normal and endometriotic ESC and EECs to validate the role of CX43 in GJIC.</p></disp-quote><p>While many Cx genes do show decreased expression in endometriosis, the major one, Cx43, which contributes most or all of the functional coupling, is not greatly changed in level with disease, with protein levels approximately consistent with the observed coupling of ESCs to one another.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 4, the authors claimed that endometriotic ESCs are the major invasive front into mesothelium cells. However, it is not clear whether control ESCs also attach to PMCs compared to the endometriotic ESCs. To validate Cx43 in cell-to-cell attachment, the loss- or gain-of Cx45 gene function in control and endometriotic ESC and EEC should be analyzed by AFM.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point, and we have been trying to conduct these studies, but there have been technical challenges with the use of AFM for these measurements.</p><p>We do have preliminary data indicating the endometriosis ESCs adhere much more quickly, and much more strongly, to mesothelial cells, but as this is based on a minimal n. We do not feel it can be published at this point. We do not want to further delay publication of our extensive data sets pending this (the measurements will require a new instrument that will not arrive for another 5 months), as there are many other aspects that explain higher invasiveness in endometriosis (enhanced ESC motility, ESC-PMC coupling and responsiveness to EECs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Cytokine, such as TNF α, induce invasion of refluxed endometrial tissues to enhance endometriosis progression. However, in Figure 5, there is no cytokine exposure to enhance invasion of endometrial cells from normal versus endometriosis patients. Therefore, there is no difference in invasion activity of ESC and EEC from normal versus endometriosis patients. Thus, the authors should conduct the cytokine-mediated invasion assay.</p></disp-quote><p>The suggestion of TNF α was insightful, and indeed it has now been reported that it specifically stimulates endometriosis stromal cells to produce the CXCL<sup>-</sup>16 cytokine, which in turn stimulates motility and invasion. We have tested this cytokine as a chemoattractant, but it does not show a difference between control and endometriosis derived ESCs. Instead, we have modified our invasion assays to provide a general chemoattractant gradient (0 to 1% serum). This does now show a dramatic difference in invasiveness of ESCs between control and endometriosis patients. This is now in the manuscript, and we want to extend our appreciation to the reviewer for their insight.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In Figure 5, the authors showed that invasion activity difference between normal versus endometriosis is detected when ESC was cocultured with EEC. In Figure 6, however, the authors used only ESCs to define the Cx45 knockdown effect on GJ changing and invasion activity in between normal versus endometriosis. Therefore, there is no significant difference in CX43 knockdown effect on GJ changing and invasion activity between control and endometriotic ESC. Therefore, these observations do not support the role of Cx43 in endometriosis progression. Therefore, the authors should employ the mixture of ESC and EEC to examine the difference between control versus endometriosis. In Figure 1, the authors showed that Cx levels are significantly redubbed in ESC from endometriosis than those in ESC from control. However, the authors did not show the differential levels of Cx43 in ESC between control versus endometriosis patients by Western blotting in this figure. If CX43 levels in endometriotic ESC are too low to be detected as compared with normal ESC, there is no meaning to define the Cx43 knockdown effect in endometriotic ESC. The gain-of Cx43 gene function study should be conducted in endometriotic ESC rather than Cx43 knockdown.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe there was a misunderstanding of the interpretation of these results. Firstly, as noted above, there are not large differences in expression of Cx43 itself between control and endometriosis derived ESCs. The KD studies were to demonstrate that invasion itself is dependent on Cx expression, not that this is the primary difference between control and endometriosis cells, although we do show that the induction of gap junction coupling between ESCs and PMCs is much higher in endometriosis. Other aspects of endometriosis derived ESCs, such as ability to suppress apoptosis and survive in the peritoneum, are major contributors to disease, and not tested here (this has been documented previously, and our design by-passes these effects in order to focus on invasion itself). The point here is to document that GJs are required for invasion, and thus represent a potential target for disease therapy in the future. This dependence on gap junctions has never been documented previously in endometriosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. In Figure 7D, there is no significant difference in penetration value between control and endometriotic ESCs even though both ESCs elevated penetration value compared to no ESC control. This data implies that both control and endometriotic ESCs could disrupt a mesothelial cells' barrier function to initiate the endometriosis progression. Therefore, this result does not explain why about 10% of reproductive-aged women who have experienced retrograde menstruation have endometriosis.</p></disp-quote><p>In our expanded data set, and statistical analysis, there is a significant difference between penetration induced by Endometriosis ESCs compared to control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors were trying to show how gap junction proteins are overexpressed, move to the cell membrane, and function to propel endometrial cells to invade into mesothelial cells.</p><p>The major strengths are the innovation of the techniques used.

Indeed, we do see a drop in Cx43 at the RNA level (presented in another manuscript under review) and functional level (Figure 3B), although not to the extent reported in Bagchi et al. above (note that Regidor looked at ectopic lesion expression that we do not address here). Most cells make more connexins than are required to achieve adequate GJ coupling of cells, so its distribution in the cell is critical. The point in this case is that much of the Cx43 that is expressed in endometrial cells is left in internal pools. In endometriosis patient ESCs, it is induced to go to the surface when they contact a mesothelial cell, enhancing functional GJ coupling more than seen in control cells (Figure 3C). Like many biological systems. It is not the absolute levels, but the change in level that is sensed by cells, which we propose occurs here. We would love to have a tool that specifically impacts only the GJ induction, but failing that the best way to test if this induction of GJ coupling between ESCs and PMCs is critical for invasion is overall Cx43 KD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific questions based on figures/descriptions:</p><p>If force could not accurately be measured, then how did they get accurate measurements</p></disp-quote><p>We show the accurate measurements for all control samples.

But when PMCs are present, ESCs from endo patients, particularly stage III-IV, are much more invasive (Figure 1D left set of plats). We now add additional data and n from studies of primary PMCs that also support more invasion of Endo ESCs than controls, independent of the origin of the PMCs (i.e. control or endo patients). This provides an indication that disease is driven by the endometrium, rather than the peritoneum, but this is expanded on in a paper in press in Fert and Sterility Science,</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Figure 1E, small sample size of control (only 2).

Secondly, we have now inserted a new Figure 1D to directly document the lower invasion rate of EECs compared to ESCs, as we expected from their lower adhesion. This strengthens the rationale to mostly focus on ESCs, However, since BOTH ESCs and EECs are present in vivo in lesions, we felt ignoring them would open us up to the valid criticism of not using physiologically relevant conditions. Figure 1F is important as it shows that EECs can further promote ESC invasiveness, but only to a significant level in endometriosis patients. We mention in the text that ESCs always remain the dominant invasive species, with EECs constituting 20 and 40% in controls and endo samples. This observation reinforces the major tenant of the MS title, that endometriosis ESCs are hypersensitive to the influence of other cells.</p><p>NOTE: In order to maintain clarity of which plots reflect ONLY ESCs, and which co-cultures, we have used color coding, with black and grey for control and endo ESCs, green for EECs and Red for PMCs, so graphs reflecting co-cultures show bi-colors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2</p><p>The argument appears to be that motility is higher in endometriosis cells, but it is not clear if the peritoneum is needed/necessary or not?

It appears that there the holes opened in the PMC monolayer by ESCs are very quickly “plugged” by the ESCs invading through them (reminiscent of the Dutch boy and the Dyke) so that significant dye leak is prevented Most prior studies using dye leak did not include invading cells. So we have eliminated this panel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5F and Figure 5G</p><p>Results seem contradictory, with respect to hypothesis of Cx43</p></disp-quote><p>It is understandable how this result causes confusion, as we had not expected it either!!

Some of this may be via channels, but it is likely a lot of it is the formation of a larger junctional complex with other junctions (e.g. tight and adhesions junctions). The results here are consistent with this in the mesothelium.</p><p>Figure 5F: When ESCs contact PMCs, they form heterocellular GJs, and these apparently pass signals (yet to be defined) to promote breakdown of the barrier function. Even worse, as we show in Figure 6, these disruptive signals are then propagated through the PMC monolayer by the same GJs that were previously helping to stabilize the barrier function. So when ESCs are around, the effects of KD or overexpression REVERSE from what they were with PMCs alone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6</p><p>What were the sample sizes?</p></disp-quote><p>In this figure, we are showing two individual experiments to prove a principle, not establish the significance of an effect. Each experimental condition is complex, as is each data point collected. Also, the dynamics of the culture system are such that experiments would not readily superimpose, and “average”. But each experiment in panels C and D illustrates the principle that signals that disrupt the mesothelial barrier are transmitted within the mesothelium by gap junctions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion</p><p>Third to last paragraph seems contradictory to what is being described up until this point</p><p>Last paragraph: seems a bit of a jump to say that the changes start/ are primed in the endometrium and comparing the endometrium to a primary tumor.</p><p>Overall, the discussion appears to simply repeat the results, rather than providing additional insights based on the results</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Chen et al. on &quot;Hypersensitive intercellular responses of endometrial stromal cells drive invasion in Endometriosis&quot; is interesting.

The differences between patents is a significant concern. Are they similar between cases and controls? The menstrual cycle stage, use of OCs and post-partum state are major influences on endometrial cell behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We now address this in the Discussion, p. 9, paragraph 3. While it is inevitable that the numbers of patients in each group at various stages of the menstrual cycle or on OCPs varied, we went back and analyzed the data segregating patients into those collected in the Secretory or Proliferative stages of the menstrual cycle or those on OCPs. While numbers in each group were somewhat limited, in every group invasion, migration and induction of GJIC were higher in Endometriosis derived samples. In addition, there were enough samples from Endometriosis patients to compare absolute levels of invasiveness, migration and induction of GJIC among the different groups. This revealed no statistically significant differences between groups. There was a trend for higher levels of invasion in patients on OCP, but this was more likely due to all of these patients being in the Endo III-IV group. So while we agree that hormone levels are likely to affect many aspects of endometrial behavior, this seems minimal with regard to the invasive characteristics, and is certainly overshadowed by differences between control and disease patients. We have not added these analyses as data to the paper, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94778-sa2-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The author should also consider the possibility that the changes seen in endometrial cells in women with endometriosis are not the cause of the endometriosis, but instead caused in response to endometriosis. In animal models many of the features of endometriosis are induced in eutopic endometrium by placing normal endometrial cells in the peritoneal cavity. Please discuss this alternative explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We now address this issue directly in Paragraph 4 on p. 9 in the Discussion, even adding a new reference that does suggest endometriosis can progress to more severe forms on regression. As we cannot collect tissue from patients who do not have endometriosis but develop it later, it is not possible here to directly test this possibility. However, all the changes we report here in endometriosis patients imbue endometrial cells with a more invasive phenotype, a required step for lesion formation. As this phenotype is NOT influenced differently by mesothelial cells from controls or patients (see Go et al., 2024), Occam’s razor would lead one to conclude that the endometrium is playing the key role in the origin of the disease because of these changes, even if it these could change further in disease progression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please also discuss endometriosis outside of the peritoneal cavity and the stem cell model. Similar to peritoneal endometriosis, all women have circulating stem cells, yet few get endometriosis. Do those stem cells similarly have the characteristics as described here?</p></disp-quote><p>The potential role of Stem cells in the endometrium is now mentioned at the end of para. 1 on p. 9 in the Discussion. It seems likely that any stem cells might differentiate in culture, but in any event they would make up a small enough fraction of the cells that they would not significantly influence our results. Assessing the properties of circulating stem cells is clearly beyond the scope of what is an already very extensive study of the endometrium. However, we had also been intrigued as to how the relatively rare occurrence of endometriosis lesions outside the peritoneum occurs. So we tested the invasion of ESCs across HUVECs as an indication of whether they might directly enter the bloodstream. In a comparison of 8 patients with significantly different invasive capability across PMCs, we found this to correlate very closely with invasion across HUVECs (R<sup>2</sup> of 0.97). This data has now been included ad Figure 1G. As explained in para 1 of p.10 in the Discussion, this supports the idea that rather than invoking circulating stem cells as the origin of extra-peritoneal lesions, which certainly remains possible, it is likely that ESCs enter the circulation and given their suppressed apoptosis, as shown by others, could well lead to extra-peritoneal lesions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
