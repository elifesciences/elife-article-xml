The retinoblastoma (RB)-family of proteins, RB1, RBL1/p107, and RBL2/p130, coordinately represses cell cycle gene expression, inhibiting proliferation, and suppressing tumorigenesis. Phosphorylation of RB-family proteins by cyclin-dependent kinases is firmly established. Like phosphorylation, ubiquitination is essential to cell cycle control, and numerous proliferative regulators, tumor suppressors, and oncoproteins are ubiquitinated. However, little is known about the role of ubiquitin signaling in controlling RB-family proteins. A systems genetics analysis of CRISPR/Cas9 screens suggested the potential regulation of the RB-network by cyclin F, a substrate recognition receptor for the SCF family of E3 ligases. We demonstrate that RBL2/p130 is a direct substrate of SCF<sup>cyclin F</sup>. We map a cyclin F regulatory site to a flexible linker in the p130 pocket domain, and show that this site mediates binding, stability, and ubiquitination. Expression of a mutant version of p130, which cannot be ubiquitinated, severely impaired proliferative capacity and cell cycle progression. Consistently, we observed reduced expression of cell cycle gene transcripts, as well a reduced abundance of cell cycle proteins, analyzed by quantitative, iterative immunofluorescent imaging. These data suggest a key role for SCF<sup>cyclin F</sup> in the CDK-RB network and raise the possibility that aberrant p130 degradation could dysregulate the cell cycle in human cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>retinoblastoma</kwd><kwd>SCF</kwd><kwd>cyclin

id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The eukaryotic cell cycle consists of a sequential progression of events that govern cell growth and division. During cell cycle progression, many hundred genes oscillate in expression, contributing to myriad processes, including DNA replication, chromosome segregation, cytoskeletal organization, and so on. The expression of cell cycle genes is repressed during quiescence, a reversible state of growth arrest, and in early G1-phase, presenting a critical barrier to proliferation. The retinoblastoma protein (RB) is a vital regulator of cell cycle gene repression. During quiescence and in early G1-phase, RB binds and inhibits E2F transcription factors, repressing transcription of many cell cycle genes. RB is phosphorylated by Cyclin-Dependent Kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), as well as CDK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Narasimha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rubin et al., 2020</xref>). This phosphorylation causes RB to dissociate from E2F, promoting the E2F-dependent expression of cell cycle genes that catalyze S-phase entry and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rubin et al., 2020</xref>). Due to its critical role in restricting proliferation, RB is a prototypical tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dyson, 2016</xref>).</p><p>RB has two closely related family members, RBL1/p107 and RBL2/p130 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dyson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadasivam and DeCaprio, 2013</xref>). Both p107 and p130 are also tumor suppressors that prevent cell cycle gene expression by binding the repressor E2F proteins E2F4/5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Claudio et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhu et al., 1993</xref>), and both are also regulated by CDK-dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canhoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Farkas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hansen et al., 2001</xref>). Additionally, p130 functions as part of the mammalian DREAM complex (<underline>D</underline>P, <underline>R</underline>B-like, <underline>E</underline>2F4/5, <underline>a</underline>nd <underline>M</underline>uvB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Litovchick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smith et al., 1996</xref>). DREAM assembles during quiescence and inhibits cell cycle progression by restricting the transcription of numerous cell cycle genes regulated by E2F, B-MYB, and FoxM1 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">MÃ¼ller et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, perturbations to p130 or the DREAM complex allow expression of its cell cycle target genes, shifting the balance from quiescence toward proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Forristal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Iness et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Patel et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>RB and p130 collaborate to suppress proliferation. In mice, <italic>Rb<sup>â/â</sup>p130<sup>â/</sup></italic><sup>â</sup> mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) grow more rapidly in culture than MEFs deficient in either <italic>Rb</italic> or <italic>p130</italic> alone, and <italic>Rb<sup>â/â</sup>p130<sup>â/</sup></italic><sup>â</sup> mice spontaneously form many more tumors than their respective single-gene knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dannenberg et al., 2004</xref>). In mouse models of small cell lung cancer, <italic>p130</italic> knockout increases tumor size and overall tumor burden, even in the background of <italic>Rb</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schaffer et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor, <italic>p130</italic> cooperates with RB to repress G2-M genes in response to genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schade et al., 2019</xref>). And, <italic>p130</italic> loss in primary human fibroblasts leads to increased expression of cell cycle genes compared to loss of <italic>Rb</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schade et al., 2020</xref>). These observations highlight the importance of p130 in cell cycle control, as well as its role in tumor suppression. These results also illustrate the importance of the broader CDK-RB network in normal proliferation, and the consequence of its dysregulation in the aberrant cell cycles observed in cancer. RB mutations, overexpression of cyclin D and cyclin E, loss of p130 protein, and dysregulation of the mammalian DREAM complex have all been implicated in increased cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Forristal et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, p130 mutations are infrequent compared to other tumor suppressors like <italic>RB, CDKN2A</italic>, and <italic>p53</italic>, suggesting the possibility that post-translational mechanisms could account for its inactivation.</p><p>Cyclin F is a non-canonical cyclinâit neither binds nor activates CDKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">DâAngiolella et al., 2013</xref>). Instead, cyclin F is one of ~70 F-box proteins, a family of substrate recognition receptors that recruit substrates to the Skp1-Cul1-Fbox protein (SCF) E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardozo and Pagano, 2004</xref>). SCF ligases play an evolutionarily conserved role in promoting cell cycle progression by triggering the destruction of cell cycle inhibitors. For example, yeast SCF<sup>Cdc4</sup> and human SCF<sup>Skp2</sup> trigger the destruction of CDK inhibitors Sic1 and p27, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carrano et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Feldman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwob et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Skowyra et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Cyclin F mRNA and protein levels oscillate during the cell cycle, giving cyclin F cell cycle-dependent activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 1994</xref>). Cyclin F begins to accumulate at the G1/S transition, peaks in G2, and its protein levels are subsequently downregulated via proteasomal degradation in mitosis and G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choudhury et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mavrommati et al., 2018</xref>) where cyclin F is ubiquitinated by SCF<sup>Î²TRCP</sup> following cyclin F phosphorylation by casein kinase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mavrommati et al., 2018</xref>). Cyclin F is also ubiquitinated by the cell cycle E3 Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choudhury et al., 2016</xref>). Further, cyclin F has been implicated in the ubiquitination and degradation of several cell cycle proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Emanuele et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, its dynamic regulation and substrate repertoire highlight the importance of cyclin F in cell cycle control.</p><p>We demonstrate here that cyclin F binds, ubiquitinates, and regulates the RB-family tumor suppressor p130. We identify the regions in both cyclin F and p130 that are required for their interaction. Interfering with cyclin F-p130 regulation, by expressing a mutant version of p130 which cannot be ubiquitinated, causes a severe defect in proliferation. Taken together, these data implicate cyclin F as a new, key player in CDK-RB network regulation, highlighting a critical ubiquitin-based mechanism that controls cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cyclin F/CCNF fitness correlates with the CDK-RB network</title><p>The Project Achilles Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) has performed near genome-wide, CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function screens in hundreds of cancer cell lines. Fitness scores, corresponding to each gene in each cell line, reflect the relative impact of individual gene knockout on proliferation and survival. Despite differences in protocols and reagents, DepMap scoring is highly concordant with Project Score, another large, pan-cancer, CRISPR/Cas9 screening platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dempster et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, systems genetics analyses of these data can be used to identify physically or genetically linked genes/proteins, since their loss often similarly impact overall fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Munoz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doench et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kory et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McDonald et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). The Pearsonâs correlation coefficient was computed for DepMap fitness gene scores across cell lines (17,634 genes in 789 cell lines at the time of analysis). This analysis effectively detects pathways involved in proliferation.

We observed a specific downregulation of endogenous p130 in both cell lines, whereas all other proteins remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similarly, p130 levels decrease in a time-dependent manner following doxycycline treatment, and this can be prevented by inhibiting the proteasome with MG132, or cullin RING E3 ligases, using the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ohh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Soucy et al., 2009</xref>).

In each of cell lines tested (BJ, IMR-90, and NHF-1), cyclin F protein levels significantly decrease in quiescence, whereas p130 protein levels increase, establishing an inverse expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Next, NHF-1 cells were synchronized in quiescence by serum deprivation and then released into the cell cycle.

Meanwhile, p130 was degraded as cells exited quiescence. The accumulation kinetics of cyclin F is similar to another F-box protein, Skp2, which ubiquitinates p27, marking it for degradation. Skp2 has also been implicated in p130 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhattacharya et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tedesco et al., 2002</xref>).

In cells treated with MLN4924, neither p130 nor p27 is degraded, cyclin E accumulates but does not get degraded, and there is a significant delay in cyclin A accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3D</xref>).</p><p>To determine p130 levels in the absence of cyclin F, we first utilized <italic>CCNF</italic> knockout HeLa cells generated using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choudhury et al., 2016</xref>).

Conversely, FLAG-cyclin F, purified from HEK29T cells precipitated GST-p130(WT) but not GST-p130(AA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right panel). Consistent with its inability to trigger p130 degradation, cyclin F(M309A L313A) could not bind to GST-p130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, the p130 Cy motif at R680-L682 and the cyclin F hydrophobic patch (M309-L313) are required for the p130-cyclin F interaction and for p130 degradation.</p><p>To assess the direct binding and affinity of p130 for cyclin F, we developed a fluorescence polarization anisotropy assay using a peptide containing the relevant Cy motif in p130. We used a version of cyclin F, produced in Sf9 cells, which lacks the first ~25 amino acids and its C-terminal PEST domain to improve solubility (cyclin F<sup>25â546</sup>). We titrated recombinant, purified cyclin F<sup>25â546</sup>-Skp1 dimer into a solution of synthetic, TAMRA-labeled, p130 peptide (residues 674â692) and observed a K<sub>d</sub> of 0.21Â±0.01 Î¼M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, left panel). Binding was efficiently competed away using purified GST-p130(WT) protein but not using GST-p130(AA), which had &gt;50-fold higher K<sub>i</sub> in the competition assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, right panel). We found that an unlabeled E2F1 peptide containing the relevant Cy motif (residues 84â99), which was previously shown to mediate cyclin F-E2F1 association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clijsters et al., 2019</xref>), also competed with the p130 probe. We performed a similar competition assay using a TAMRA labeled E2F1<sup>84â99</sup> peptide as a probe, and we found that we could efficiently compete the E2F1 peptide with GST-p130(WT) but not GST-p130(AA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). We conclude that p130 directly binds cyclin F-Skp1 at a site that overlaps with the E2F1 binding site and that the association is dependent on critical interactions made by R680 and L682 in p130.</p><p>To analyze p130 ubiquitination, we reconstituted the SCF<sup>cyclin F</sup> ubiquitination reaction in vitro using purified components. Cyclin F<sup>25â546</sup> was combined with neddylated Cul1-Roc1(Rbx1), Skp1, substrate, and ubiquitin. The human homolog of ariadne (ARIH1) is a RING-Between-RING (RBR) E3 ligase that has been shown to work with the E2 UBCH7 and other cullin ring E3 ligases, including the SCF, to ubiquitinate substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Horn-Ghetko et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Scott et al., 2016</xref>).

To determine p130 half-life, we expressed full-length HA-p130(WT) or HA-p130(AA) with or without FLAG-cyclin F in HEK293T or U2OS cells for 24 hr. Cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) and then analyzed for HA-p130 half-life. While p130(WT) half-life was significantly reduced by ectopic expression of cyclin F, p130(AA) remained stable for the length of the experiment in the presence or absence of cyclin F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâC</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that protein levels of p130(AA) are resistant to cyclin F-mediated degradation.</p><p>We asked whether p130(AA) accumulates more than p130(WT) during a specific cell cycle phase. To evaluate p130 levels at different points during the cell cycle, we first engineered NHF-1 cells to express HA-tagged p130(WT) or p130(AA) in response to doxycycline treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). NHF-1 cells expressing p130 were synchronized with vehicle control, aphidicolin (S-phase synchronization), or nocodazole (Mitosis synchronization) for 16 hr. Interestingly, p130(WT) levels are decreased in nocodazole-synchronized cells compared to p130(AA) levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Consistently, nocodazole synchronization significantly decreased endogenous p130 protein levels in NHF-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Taken Together, these data indicate that p130(WT) levels decrease in nocodazole synchronized NHF-1 cells, whereas levels of p130(AA) remain stable.</p><p>The Cy motif that we mapped at amino acids 680â682 was previously implicated in binding cyclins A and E in SF9 cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lacy and Whyte, 1997</xref>). To evaluate binding in human cells, we utilized the NHF-1 cells engineered to express p130(WT) or p130(AA). We immunoprecipitated (IP) HA and found that similar amounts of cyclin A and E co-purify with HA-p130(WT) and HA-p130(AA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Reciprocally, following IP of endogenous cyclin A, both HA-p130(WT) and HA-p130(AA) co-immunoprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Further, we assessed whether mutation of the p130 Cy motif would impair p130 phosphorylation. HA-tagged p130(WT) and p130(AA) immunoprecipitated from NHF-1 cells are similarly phosphorylated on the CDK site at S672 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Additionally, HA-p130(WT) and HA-p130(AA) migrate similarly in SDS-PAGE, their migration was similarly increased by post-lysis phosphatase treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP), and this could be prevented by the addition of phosphatase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). These findings are consistent with previous reports mapping additional cyclin E and A binding sites to sequences in the p130 amino-terminus, and cyclin D binding to a carboxy-terminal helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">CastaÃ±o et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hansen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Topacio et al., 2019</xref>).

We therefore examined the apoptotic markers cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3. As a positive control, cell lines were treated with 100 nM staurosporine to induce apoptosis. We observe cleaved PARP in the p130(AA)-expressing population at days 7, 10, and 14, and cleaved caspase 3 at days 7 and 10, indicating that cells in these populations are undergoing apoptosis. We did not observe cleaved PARP or cleaved caspase in any of the populations for p130(WT)-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Additionally, we performed flow cytometry for Annexin V and propidium iodide incorporation in unfixed cells to assess apoptosis/necrosis. We observed a higher percentage of apoptotic/necrotic cells in the p130(AA)-expressing population compared to the p130(WT)-expressing population at day 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Since DNA damage can cause apoptosis, and because high p21 levels can be an indicator of DNA damage, we used 4i to determine the expression of proteins in the DNA damage response pathway, including 53BP1, phospho-Chk1, and phospho-H2A.X. We found that in the p130(AA)-expressing cells at days 5, 7, and 10, that levels of 53BP1, phospho-Chk1, and phospho-H2A.X were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2C-E</xref>). A decrease in DNA damage markers is consistent with fewer cells being in S-phase and suggests that DNA damage is not the cause of apoptosis. We also examined senescence but saw no apparent increase in beta-galactosidase staining in p130(AA)-expressing cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We demonstrate that the RB-like protein p130 is a substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF<sup>Cyclin F</sup>. Cyclin F loss allows p130 to accumulate, whereas its overexpression promotes p130 degradation. Cyclin F and p130 bind directly, and SCF<sup>cyclin F</sup> can ubiquitinate p130 in a fully reconstituted in vitro system. We mapped a critical cyclin F binding motif in p130, and when that sequence is mutated, it prevents p130 ubiquitination and degradation. This mutant version of p130 accumulates in normal human fibroblast cells, causing slowed proliferation, an accumulation in G0/G1-phase, and apoptosis.</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest that cyclin F contributes to inactivation of p130 and is therefore a regulator of the CDK-RB network.

For Ribociclib, <italic>CCND1</italic> is the most highly correlated, <italic>CDK4</italic> is ranked 5th, and <italic>CCNF</italic> was 125th, falling within the top 1% of most highly correlated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

Cyclin-CDK complexes phosphorylate RB, p107, and p130, which prevents their binding to activator E2Fs, allowing for the transcription of cell cycle target genes. In addition, RB-like proteins are also controlled at the level of their abundance. As cells exit quiescence, p130 protein is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Then, when cells transition from proliferation to quiescence, p130 protein levels significantly increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smith et al., 1996</xref>). The role of phosphorylation in controlling RB and the RB-like proteins has been well-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canhoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Farkas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hansen et al., 2001</xref>); however, much less is known about how changes in the levels of RB-like proteins might contribute to changes in pathway activity or their ability to restrain E2F transcription factors. Notably, as cells grow bigger, RB and its yeast ortholog Whi5, are diluted, contributing to cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmoller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zatulovskiy et al., 2020</xref>). Our studies suggest that the targeted degradation of p130 by cyclin F, which rapidly reduces its concentration, also plays a significant role in promoting cell cycle progression.</p><p>Despite a concrete understanding of the role of phosphorylation in regulating RB-like proteins, less is known about the role of ubiquitin ligases. The phosphatase subunit NRBE3 was previously linked to RB ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). A nucleolar protein, U3 protein 14a (hUTP14a), was also suggested to be a novel type of E3 ubiquitin ligase, capable of promoting both RB and p53 degradation and cancer cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). However, neither NRBE3 nor hUTP14a are ubiquitin ligases. Finally, RB degradation by an unknown, Cul2-based E3 was shown in cells expressing HPV E7 oncoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">White et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies have reported that SCF<sup>Skp2</sup> recognizes p130 and promotes its ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhattacharya et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tedesco et al., 2002</xref>). However, p130 still cycles in Skp2 knockout cells, suggesting additional E3 ligase(s) may be involved in p130 regulation. Surprisingly, for unknown reasons, Skp2 overexpression had no effect on p130 levels in our experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cyclin F as a regulator of the cell cycle gene transcription</title><p>Cyclin F has previously been linked to cell cycle gene transcription via its regulation of several proteins, including B-MYB, SLBP, E2F1, E2F2, E2F3a, E2F7, and E2F8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Emanuele et al., 2020</xref>). In response to DNA damage, cyclin F is able to bind to B-MYB, and rather than ubiquitinate it, inhibits the ability of B-MYB to promote the expression of mitotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Klein et al., 2015</xref>). In G2, cyclin F ubiquitinates the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), which is required during S-phase to mediate histone biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dankert et al., 2016</xref>). Also, during G2, cyclin F catalyzes the ubiquitination of the activator E2Fs: E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burdova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clijsters et al., 2019</xref>). The ubiquitination of activator E2Fs allows for their degradation, and expression of mutant E2Fs that can no longer bind to cyclin F results in increased expression of E2F target genes. Further, during G2-phase, cyclin F was shown to regulate the atypical repressor E2Fs, E2F7, and E2F8, promoting their degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wasserman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>). Each of these substrates implicates cyclin F in indirectly controlling cell cycle gene expression, and our study uncovers a new mechanism by which cyclin F regulates transcriptional control at the start of the cell cycle, by ubiquitinating p130.</p><p>Adding to the complexity of the role of cyclin F in cell cycle transcription, not only does cyclin F regulate p130 degradation, but p130 regulates the expression of cyclin F. Thus, cyclin F and p130 appear to exist in a double negative feedback loop, where each can downregulate the other. Interestingly, in response to DNA damage, cyclin F is downregulated by degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">DâAngiolella et al., 2012</xref>), and p130 has been suggested to become activated to repress cell cycle gene expression. Thus, the degradation of cyclin F in response to genotoxic stress could preserve cell cycle arrest by allowing for the accumulation of p130, while also contributing to increased nucleotide pools through the accumulation of another cyclin F substrate, RRM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">DâAngiolella et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Effect of P130 overexpression on proliferation</title><p>We have shown that expressing the mutant p130(AA), but not p130(WT), causes growth arrest and apoptosis. These results are consistent with clinical observations of outcomes of p130 expression levels in cancerous tissues. In lung cancers, p130 expression negatively correlates with histological grading and metastasis ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldi and Esposito, 1997</xref>). For endometrial cancer patients who receive surgery, low p130 levels are significantly associated with increased recurrence and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Susini et al., 1998</xref>). In vulvar carcinomas, loss of p130 and p27 has been shown to contribute to carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zamparelli et al., 2001</xref>). In oral squamous cell carcinoma, p130-negative cases have worse prognoses than p130-positive cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanaka et al., 2001</xref>). And, finally, in thyroid neoplasms, reduced p130 expression has been linked to the aggressive characteristics of anaplastic carcinoma, while high p130 expression in micropapillary carcinoma has been linked to the smaller size of those tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ito et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, cancers with low p130 expression or p130 loss, seem to grow more quickly and aggressively, whereas cancers with high p130 expression are correlated with better prognoses. Our findings fit within the context of these studies; as p130(AA) accumulates, the cells are less proliferative and some die by apoptosis. Since p130 mRNA levels are not regulated during the cell cycle, it is interesting to speculate that enhancing p130 degradation in some malignancies could contribute to defects in the regulation of cell cycle gene expression and hyper-proliferation. Likewise, blocking p130 degradation could phenocopy CDK4/6 inactivation and could potentially be therapeutically advantageous, and would be consistent with our analysis showing that loss-of-function in cyclin D, CDK4, and cyclin F are highly correlated across nearly 800 cancer cell lines.</p><p>Cyclin F is a strongly cell cycle-regulated gene. Cyclin F mRNA levels peak in G2/M, and no studies have identified <italic>CCNF</italic> as an E2F target at G1/S. It is therefore unclear how its protein levels increase early in the cell cycle, in lockstep with Skp2, a bona fide E2F target gene. We previously showed that AKT can phosphorylate and stabilize cyclin F, and that this could contribute to its accumulation near G1/S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choudhury et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the activation of cyclin F by AKT could potentially lead to the degradation of p130. Given the recurrent activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway in many cancers, it will be interesting in the future to determine if cyclin F phosphorylation promotes p130 degradation. If true, this would suggest that hyper-activated PI3K, either through mutation of PIK3CA or loss of PTEN, functions through cyclin F to render p130 inactive via the ubiquitin pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Acquisition and analysis of DEPMAP data</title><p>Gene co-dependencies were determined from the Achilles data set from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org/">depmap.org</ext-link> (Achilles_gene_effect.csv, downloaded 7/19/19).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Maureen Murphy as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michele Pagano (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) The authors provided evidence that an R680xL682/AxA mutant is unable to interact with cyclin F and that this mutant blocks cell cycle gene expression, cell cycle progression and proliferation. The authors do not acknowledge or account for prior reports that this conserved RxL motif has been implicated in cyclin A and cyclin E binding in both p130 and p107 (Lacy and Whyte, 1997) as well as cyclin D binding in p107 (Leng et al., 2002). Thus, the p130 interaction data and functional data for the AxA mutant are likely to be true and unrelated as the functional data for the AxA likely results from a deficiency in CDK phosphorylation rather than increased stability. The authors need to show that the p130 AxA mutant can still interact with cyclins D, A, and E and be phosphorylated at CDK sites such as S672 for the alternative deficiency in CDK phosphorylation hypothesis to be ruled out for the AxA mutant.</p><p>2) If the p130 AxA mutant is competent for CDK phosphorylation, this raises questions regarding the disassembly of the DREAM complex. Previously, CDK4/6 phosphorylation of p130 has implicated in DREAM disassembly but, if the repression of cell cycle gene expression observed in the AxA mutant is due to increased protein stability rather than CDK phosphorylation, this would indicate that p130 degradation is the rate limiting step of DREAM disassembly or that p130 has a transcriptional repression function independent of the DREAM complex. The authors should address p130 degradation within DREAM complex function to resolve this conflict as to reduced p130 degradation leads to increase repression of cell cycle gene expression.</p><p>3) Many of the cellular experiments establishing that p130 is cyclin F substrate (Figure 2E, 3, 4B, 5B, S3A) were conducted in 293T cells that express Adenovirus 5 E1A and SV40 Large T antigen which bind and inactivate Rb family members and disrupt the RB-CDK network. Furthermore, SV40 large T promotes dephosphorylation of p130 (Lin and DeCaprio, 2003) explaining why SKP2 overexpression did not alter p130 levels as the SKP2 interacts with phosphorylated p130. SV40 LT also binds directly to FBXW7. Thus, the generalizability of these experiments is limited. Ideally, all the experiments in 293T cells would be repeated in cells where the RB-CDK network was intact but the strong in vitro data for the mapping the cyclin F-p130 interaction on p130 indicates that this may be unnecessary for Figure 2E, 4B, and S3A. At a minimum, the experiments in Figure 3, especially 3B, and 5B should be repeated in cells where the RB-CDK network is intact.</p><p>4) The transition from Figure 1 to Figure 2 is a difficult to follow in the text as Figure 2A and 2B are correlative observations. Figure 2A and 2B feel more like a follow up to 1D than addressing the question of whether and SCF cyclin F complex regulates p130 levels. Consequently, please move Figures 2A and 2B to figure 1 and Figure S2 should be brought into the main figure.</p><p>5) Figures 6 and 7 are poorly organized and the narrative is a bit difficult to follow and appreciate as the authors bounce between cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptotic readouts. It may strengthen and focus the story to focus on cell cycle gene expression and cell cycle progression in Figure 6 and cellular proliferation and apoptosis in Figure 7. This would also help the reader appreciate the CDK4/6i inhibitor data more as CDK4/6i inhibition is generally considered cytostatic rather than cytotoxic.</p><p>6) Since CDT1 protein species are degraded by multiple complexes, please include RT-qPCR data for CDT1 so the reader may appreciate that the decrease in CDT1 levels results from reduced transcription.</p><p>7) On lines 293-295, the authors compare p130 levels in S4A and 6A to point out the induced p130 AxA accumulates to higher levels at later time points compared to p130 WT. It is difficult to appreciate this comparison as these are different blots in different figures. Consequently, to make this point, the authors should include an IB as in S4A to show p130 WT and AxA levels over the 14 day time course. Ideally, time points would be collected.</p><p>8) The authors should include representative images for key time points and comparison for the multiple figures of quantitative immunofluorescence experiments, particularly for the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. Also the authors should more fully explain their analysis workflow as data can be processed through the &quot;standard modules&quot; cell profiler to differing results. If a previously established workflow was used that has been previously described in the literature, please provide a citation for the workflow.</p><p>9) Inactivation of p130 by CDK phosphorylation is likely to dominate p130 degradation in functional assay under normal growth conditions. The authors should consider examining the p130 degradation after DNA damage, in presence of reduced serum levels, or during quiescence (by expression a cyclin F KEN box mutant) to discern the functional impact of altered p130 degradation by p130.</p><p>10) It would help the reader if the results of the iterative immunofluorescence staining were supplemented by additional data such as representative cell images and/or immunoblots. It is difficult to appreciate the extent and the significance of the observed effects in the format shown in Figures 6F-H, 7B-C and S5C-E.</p><p>11) Standard methods such as immunoblotting or protein expression in bacteria, are described in excessive detail, whereas the 4i image analysis that could be helpful to a reader unfamiliar with this technique, is described rather briefly. It took a while and reading some additional papers for this reviewer to understand what in fact was shown in the graphs obtained by this technique.</p><p>12) Figure 1. From the description, it appears that results of the DepMap correlation analysis form the premise for this work by showing that depletion of cyclin F has similar impact on the cancer cell fitness as depletion of several components of the Rb-CDK pathway, including p130. The authors then hypothesize that cyclin F may regulate the expression of these factors, which leads to identification of p130 as a cyclin F substrate. Significance of this analysis should be better explained. Indeed, the authors first make the introduction that closely correlated genes in DepMap are often involved in the same protein complex or a functional pathway, and then go on to show that cyclin F and p130 not only have the opposite patterns if expression, but also negatively regulate each other, which would be contradictory to a direct correlation found in DepMap analysis. It would help the reader if the authors explained this apparent contradiction, and ideally validated the conclusions of the DepMap analysis by comparing the effects of cyclin F and p130 knockdown in a panel of select cancer cell lines.</p><p>13) Figure 2C: In HeLa cells, all Rb family members are targeted to degradation through the interaction with HPV E7 oncoprotein. Although loss of CCNF appears to increase the levels of p130 in HeLa cells, this result does not strongly support the direct role of CCNF in p130 degradation without ruling out an indirect effect on E7 function. Additionally, loss of CCNF could influence the cell cycle synchronization therefore the cell cycle analysis data should be included with this experiment. In general, since cyclin F is involved in regulation of many cell-cycle related factors, the cell cycle data should be included in the experiments where the levels of CCNF are manipulated such as Figure 2D.</p><p>14) Figure 2E: Again, the choice of 293T cell line to demonstrate the binding between the endogenous p130 and cyclin F is surprising. The levels of p130 in these cells are very low because of the presence of SV40 Large T antigen that targets Rb family members for degradation. Furthermore, SV40 LT binds to Rb family members and can indirectly recruit other factors into the complexes with these proteins. Therefore, the endogenous interaction between p130 and cyclin F should be confirmed in another cell line. Figure 3: Same concerns â the presence of SV40 LT could complicate the interpretation of these results. The authors need to confirm these effects in another cell line, in the absence of SV40 LT.</p><p>15) Figure 4: Panel B: It would be interesting to know whether R680A/L682A p130 mutant can still bind SV40 Large T or HPV E7 proteins. Panel E: The rationale for using E2F1 displacement for measuring the binding affinity between cyclin F-Skp1 complex and p130 fragments is unclear. Is it possible to show a direct binding between these factors?</p><p>16) Figure 5B: It is apparent that p130-AA is still being degraded during the CHX chase, but is unaffected by cyclin F overexpression. Could the proteasome or neddylation inhibitors block this degradation? Is it possible that both Skp2 and cyclin F can degrade p130 through different mechanisms? Panel C: Significance of the differences is not shown.</p><p>17) Figure 6: It would be very interesting to see how the p130-AA levels are regulated during the G0/G1 arrest and progression through the cell cycle. This could be a key experiment to demonstrate the role of the 680-RRL site for cell cycle dependent degradation of p130. Panel E: Description of this figure indicates that cells were pulse-labeled with EdU to detect S-phase, but the figure only shows G0/G1 fraction. Changes in S-phase and G2/M fractions could be informative and should be shown. Also, this experiment needs to be better explained. Were the cells allowed to grow to confluency over 14 days? Was the growth media changed or supplemented throughout this experiment? Panels F-H: The legend needs to be revised to explain what is shown in the graphs. Was the statistical significance calculated, and how? Which data points are significantly different?</p><p>18) Figure 7A. This is an interesting result because it is hard to explain such robust effect on the DREAM target gene expression by a pretty small difference in the p130 expression levels. This difference is not even apparent in the panel D in this Figure. What is the possible explanation of this result? Also, the endogenous p130 immunoblot should be included in this figure to appreciate the extent of the overexpression (also in figure S4A). Panel D: It appears that only a small fraction of the p130-AA cells undergoes apoptosis. Additional evidence is needed to support the conclusion that this mutant promotes apoptosis.</p><p>19) Using DepMap, the authors find that CCNF KO is associated with Palbociclib inactivation of the CDK-RB network, but they fail to show experimentally a correlation between the cyclin F-mediated degradation of p130 and sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors. This should be addressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70691.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) The authors provided evidence that an R680xL682/AxA mutant is unable to interact with cyclin F and that this mutant blocks cell cycle gene expression, cell cycle progression and proliferation. The authors do not acknowledge or account for prior reports that this conserved RxL motif has been implicated in cyclin A and cyclin E binding in both p130 and p107 (Lacy and Whyte, 1997) as well as cyclin D binding in p107 (Leng et al., 2002). Thus, the p130 interaction data and functional data for the AxA mutant are likely to be true and unrelated as the functional data for the AxA likely results from a deficiency in CDK phosphorylation rather than increased stability. The authors need to show that the p130 AxA mutant can still interact with cyclins D, A, and E and be phosphorylated at CDK sites such as S672 for the alternative deficiency in CDK phosphorylation hypothesis to be ruled out for the AxA mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point. As you point out, an important paper from Lacy and Whyte previously showed that the same sequence motif in p130, which we mapped as being critical for cyclin F binding, stability, ubiquitination, and degradation (amino acids 680-682), could also potentially mediate cyclin E/A binding.</p><p>We have addressed this important point with a series of new experiments. First, we showed that the p130(R680A, L682A) mutant (hereafter, p130(AA)) is phosphorylated in vivo at an established CDK site. We performed pulldown experiments with HA-tagged p130(WT) and p130(AA) and blotted them using the published, commercially available, p130 phospho-S672 antibody (new Figure 5 Supplement 2C). This reagent has been well validated by experts in this field (e.g., DeCaprio lab, Litovchick lab, etc.). Both p130(WT) and p130(AA) were similarly phosphorylated on S672. Next, since that antibody only detects p130 phosphorylation at a single site, we also examined in-gel migration of p130. Phosphorylated p130 migrates more slowly in SDS-PAGE. Consistently, HA-tagged versions of p130(WT) and p130(AA) showed similar migration patterns and were similarly impacted by phosphatase treatment post-lysis (new Figure 5 Supplement 2D). Together, these data strongly suggest that p130(AA) is phosphorylated in vivo. Finally, we examined p130 binding to cyclin E and cyclin A by immunoprecipitation (IP). We show that IPs of HA-tagged p130(WT) and p130(AA) copurify cyclin A and cyclin E similarly (See new Figure 5 Supplement 2A). Likewise, IP of endogenous cyclin A co-precipitated indistinguishable levels of HA-tagged p130(WT) and p130(AA) (new Figure 5 Supplement 2B). Altogether, these experiments argue that the impact of the p130(AA) mutant is not the result of a defect in phosphorylation or cyclin E/A binding.</p><p>We revisited Lacy and Whyteâs paper, which we should have cited and discussed more clearly. It is notable that they did not analyze phosphorylation of full length p130 in human cells. Rather, they demonstrated that deleting amino acids 680-682 from a fragment of GST-p130 (amino acids 595-675) impaired binding to cyclins in SF9 cell extracts derived from cells overexpressing cyclin A/CDK2 or cyclin E/CDK2 complexes. They showed that this deletion reduced phosphorylation of the GST-p130 fragment, also using insect cell extracts overexpressing cyclin/CDK complexes. They did not test binding of this mutant to cyclins, or its phosphorylation, in cultured human cells.</p><p>Also notable are two additional studies, from the Dynlacht and Lukas labs, reporting that cyclin E/A binding to p130 instead relied on a different site in the p130 N-terminus (PMIDs 9710622 and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11157749">11157749</ext-link>). And a more recent report showing that p130 phosphorylation by cyclin D-CDK4 depends on a c-terminal helical domain (PMID 30982746). These studies and the Lacy and Whyte paper, have all been cited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) If the p130 AxA mutant is competent for CDK phosphorylation, this raises questions regarding the disassembly of the DREAM complex. Previously, CDK4/6 phosphorylation of p130 has implicated in DREAM disassembly but, if the repression of cell cycle gene expression observed in the AxA mutant is due to increased protein stability rather than CDK phosphorylation, this would indicate that p130 degradation is the rate limiting step of DREAM disassembly or that p130 has a transcriptional repression function independent of the DREAM complex. The authors should address p130 degradation within DREAM complex function to resolve this conflict as to reduced p130 degradation leads to increase repression of cell cycle gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question with respect to whether p130 degradation is limiting, particularly with respect to phosphorylation. Importantly, we found that forced expression of low levels of p130(WT) is sufficient to slow proliferation in NHF cells (Figure 6 Supplement 1C and Figure 6C), consistent with overexpression results from other groups (including the Lacy and Whyte study). Thus, as is the case with RB1, simply increasing the levels of p130 is sufficient to repress proliferation, and this is presumably through its established function in cell cycle gene repression through DREAM.</p><p>In our assays, this proliferation defect is profoundly exacerbated by mutation of the cyclin F binding site in p130 (Figure 6), which allows p130 protein to accumulate due to it not being degraded. Our data are consistent with the prior observations where increasing p130 levels in cells is sufficient to slow proliferation. Since the p130(AA) mutant can bind other cyclins and is phosphorylated (see point 1 above), this suggests that degradation is pivotal for p130 inactivation. Further, we determined p130(AA) binding to DREAM, and now show that p130(AA) can assemble into the DREAM complex akin to p130(WT), based on its ability to co-immuno-precipitate with LIN54 (new Figure 5 Supplement 2C). Altogether, this suggests that increasing the level of a phosphorylation proficient p130, by interfering with its destruction, represses cell cycle gene expression and proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Many of the cellular experiments establishing that p130 is cyclin F substrate (Figure 2E, 3, 4B, 5B, S3A) were conducted in 293T cells that express Adenovirus 5 E1A and SV40 Large T antigen which bind and inactivate Rb family members and disrupt the RB-CDK network. Furthermore, SV40 large T promotes dephosphorylation of p130 (Lin and DeCaprio, 2003) explaining why SKP2 overexpression did not alter p130 levels as the SKP2 interacts with phosphorylated p130. SV40 LT also binds directly to FBXW7. Thus, the generalizability of these experiments is limited. Ideally, all the experiments in 293T cells would be repeated in cells where the RB-CDK network was intact but the strong in vitro data for the mapping the cyclin F-p130 interaction on p130 indicates that this may be unnecessary for Figure 2E, 4B, and S3A. At a minimum, the experiments in Figure 3, especially 3B, and 5B should be repeated in cells where the RB-CDK network is intact.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this potential concern, we now show that ectopic expression of cyclin F, but not SKP2, bTRCP or Fbxw7, drives p130 degradation in U2OS cells (new Figure 3 Supplement 1A). Further, we now show that cyclin F also regulates p130 half-life in U2OS cells (new Figure 5 Supplement 1A). We have also shown that cyclin F overexpression reduces endogenous p130 protein levels in MCF7 and T47D cells, luminal breast cancer cell lines that do not express large T antigen or HPV oncoproteins (Figure 1D). And, cyclin F depletion increases p130 protein levels in IMR-90 and NHF-1 cell lines, both of which are negative for large T antigen and HPV oncoproteins (Figure 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The transition from Figure 1 to Figure 2 is a difficult to follow in the text as Figure 2A and 2B are correlative observations. Figure 2A and 2B feel more like a follow up to 1D than addressing the question of whether and SCF cyclin F complex regulates p130 levels. Consequently, please move Figures 2A and 2B to figure 1 and Figure S2 should be brought into the main figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these thoughtful suggestions. To accommodate these recommendations, and improve the flow of the manuscript, we have re-organized Figures 1 and 2. Specifically, part of the previous Figure S2, which showed data in NHF-1 cells released from arrest into MLN4924, was moved to Figure 1F. Similarly, the previous Figure 2A, which showed cyclin F and p130 levels in proliferating and quiescent cells across different lines, was moved Figure 1E. The previous Figure 2B, which is similar to the new Figure 1F, was moved to Figure 1 Supplement 3, which also still includes data from T98G cells released from arrest into MLN4924. We have updated the manuscript text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figures 6 and 7 are poorly organized and the narrative is a bit difficult to follow and appreciate as the authors bounce between cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptotic readouts. It may strengthen and focus the story to focus on cell cycle gene expression and cell cycle progression in Figure 6 and cellular proliferation and apoptosis in Figure 7. This would also help the reader appreciate the CDK4/6i inhibitor data more as CDK4/6i inhibition is generally considered cytostatic rather than cytotoxic.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to best accommodate this by making the following changes. Since the apoptotic results are significant, but less well understood, these have been moved to supplemental figures. The phenotype data in Figure 6 begins with showing the protein dynamics of p130(WT) vs p130(AA) and then begins with the broadest of phenotypes, being proliferation. This is followed by cell cycle and 4i imaging of cell cycle related proteins. Then, in Figure 7, we drill down into effects on cell cycle gene expression. We have updated the writing to hopefully make this clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Since CDT1 protein species are degraded by multiple complexes, please include RT-qPCR data for CDT1 so the reader may appreciate that the decrease in CDT1 levels results from reduced transcription.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included CDT1 RT-qPCR data, demonstrating that the reduction in CDT1 protein levels is due to reduced transcription (see Figures 7A and Figure 7 Supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) On lines 293-295, the authors compare p130 levels in S4A and 6A to point out the induced p130 AxA accumulates to higher levels at later time points compared to p130 WT. It is difficult to appreciate this comparison as these are different blots in different figures. Consequently, to make this point, the authors should include an IB as in S4A to show p130 WT and AxA levels over the 14 day time course. Ideally, time points would be collected.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point. We have now included a time course of p130(WT) and p130(AA) levels from zero to 14 days. Levels of p130(AA) accumulate over time (see new Figure 6A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors should include representative images for key time points and comparison for the multiple figures of quantitative immunofluorescence experiments, particularly for the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. Also the authors should more fully explain their analysis workflow as data can be processed through the &quot;standard modules&quot; cell profiler to differing results. If a previously established workflow was used that has been previously described in the literature, please provide a citation for the workflow.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this suggestion by including representative images for phosphorylated RB, CDT1, and CDC6 (Figures 6 and 7). We further elaborated when describing the 4i image acquisition and data processing to clarify methods used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Inactivation of p130 by CDK phosphorylation is likely to dominate p130 degradation in functional assay under normal growth conditions. The authors should consider examining the p130 degradation after DNA damage, in presence of reduced serum levels, or during quiescence (by expression a cyclin F KEN box mutant) to discern the functional impact of altered p130 degradation by p130.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point. We observed that in several cell lines made quiescent by serum starvation, p130 is upregulated and cyclin F downregulated (Figure 1E). We anticipate that p130 increases in quiescence, at least in part, because of reduced cyclin F. We examined p130 protein levels in response to DNA damage, which has been reported to cause an increase p130 abundance, and during when cyclin F is degraded. While we could recapitulate a p130 increase using MMC at specific doses, as described by others, we see inconsistent results depending on the type of damaging agent applied and with dose of damaging agent. Since these results are inconsistent and inconclusive, we have not included them. We are currently unable to overexpress cyclin F in quiescent cells, precluding that analysis.</p><p>Related to this point, and one below, we also now provide new experimental evidence that in NHF-1 cells, p130 is degraded in mitotic NHF cells arrested by nocodazole. Significantly, the p130(AA) mutant which cannot bind or be ubiquitinated by cyclin F, is resistant to degradation in nocodazole arrested cells (see new Figure 5D and Figure 5 Supplement 5C). Examining this further represents an important area of future work but is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) It would help the reader if the results of the iterative immunofluorescence staining were supplemented by additional data such as representative cell images and/or immunoblots. It is difficult to appreciate the extent and the significance of the observed effects in the format shown in Figures 6F-H, 7B-C and S5C-E.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this suggestion by including representative images for phosphorylated RB, CDT1, and CDC6 (Figures 6 and 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Standard methods such as immunoblotting or protein expression in bacteria, are described in excessive detail, whereas the 4i image analysis that could be helpful to a reader unfamiliar with this technique, is described rather briefly. It took a while and reading some additional papers for this reviewer to understand what in fact was shown in the graphs obtained by this technique.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this very helpful suggestion. We have addressed this by explaining in better detail the 4i technique and providing representative images of cells from these experiments. We have also reduced other explanations in the manuscript that were described with unnecessary detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 1. From the description, it appears that results of the DepMap correlation analysis form the premise for this work by showing that depletion of cyclin F has similar impact on the cancer cell fitness as depletion of several components of the Rb-CDK pathway, including p130. The authors then hypothesize that cyclin F may regulate the expression of these factors, which leads to identification of p130 as a cyclin F substrate. Significance of this analysis should be better explained. Indeed, the authors first make the introduction that closely correlated genes in DepMap are often involved in the same protein complex or a functional pathway, and then go on to show that cyclin F and p130 not only have the opposite patterns if expression, but also negatively regulate each other, which would be contradictory to a direct correlation found in DepMap analysis. It would help the reader if the authors explained this apparent contradiction, and ideally validated the conclusions of the DepMap analysis by comparing the effects of cyclin F and p130 knockdown in a panel of select cancer cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an extremely interesting point and we have given this considerable thought. Cyclin D1, CDK4, RBL1 and RBL2, are all highly, positively correlated with cyclin F. We agree that at first glance this is confusing and appears contradictory. However, the more we survey the DepMap dataset, the more it becomes clear that positive and negative correlations cannot always be interpreted as indicating positive and negative relationships between proteins in a pathway.</p><p>To be clear, positive and negative correlations often do indicate positive and negative relationships, respectively. For example, the E3 ligase AMBRA1 is negatively correlated with the D-type cyclins, which it targets for degradation. Likewise, CDK4 is positively correlated with Cyclin D1.</p><p>However, there are many examples that defy this simple logic. CDK4 is negatively correlated with CDK6, with which it shares a common function. Likewise, D-type cyclins are negatively correlated with each other. These examples are likely explained by the fact that cell lines predominantly use CDK4 or CDK6, or only one D-type cyclin, but not all equally. Nevertheless, these examples demonstrate that caution is needed when interpreting positive and negative DepMap correlations. Furthermore, although Cyclin D1 is indeed positively correlated with CDK4, it is also positively correlated with RBL1 and RBL2, both of which it negatively regulates. Altogether, we think this implies a role for a specific circuitry in a given cell line, while not necessarily implying the direction of the relationship. Simply stated, positive DepMap correlations do not necessarily imply activating or positive enzymatic relationships.</p><p>To address your point, we compared fitness scores from the Project Achilles Cancer Dependency map dataset to fitness scores from the Sanger Project Score dataset in ~185 overlapping cell lines utilized by both programs. These represent the two largest and most comprehensive, large scale, CRISPR/Cas9, cancer screening programs. Notably, they are performed independently at different sites, by different individuals, and using different protocols and reagents. Prior analysis showed that these datasets are remarkably well correlated with each other, supporting the reliability of data in both (PMID: 31862961). We also now show correlations between the two datasets for genes in the CDK-RB network in new Figure 1 Supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Figure 2C: In HeLa cells, all Rb family members are targeted to degradation through the interaction with HPV E7 oncoprotein. Although loss of CCNF appears to increase the levels of p130 in HeLa cells, this result does not strongly support the direct role of CCNF in p130 degradation without ruling out an indirect effect on E7 function. Additionally, loss of CCNF could influence the cell cycle synchronization therefore the cell cycle analysis data should be included with this experiment. In general, since cyclin F is involved in regulation of many cell-cycle related factors, the cell cycle data should be included in the experiments where the levels of CCNF are manipulated such as Figure 2D.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this potential concern in several ways. First, we provide cell cycle flow cytometry data from cells in cyclin F siRNA-mediated depletion experiments (Figure 2 Supplement 1B-C) as well as for asynchronously proliferating cyclin F KO and control HeLa cells (Figure 2 supplement 1D). Consistently, we and others previously showed that the cyclin F KO HeLa cells are well adapted and grow quite normally in culture (similarly to knockout of most canonical cyclins). In addition, the HeLa KO synchronization experiment was blotted for cyclin E, which shows very similar kinetics between control KO and cyclin F KO cell lines (see Figure 2 Supplement 1A). Since cyclin F is the only thing different between cell lines, this strongly argues that even if E7 were involved in this cell line, that this still is a cyclin F dependent effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Figure 2E: Again, the choice of 293T cell line to demonstrate the binding between the endogenous p130 and cyclin F is surprising. The levels of p130 in these cells are very low because of the presence of SV40 Large T antigen that targets Rb family members for degradation. Furthermore, SV40 LT binds to Rb family members and can indirectly recruit other factors into the complexes with these proteins. Therefore, the endogenous interaction between p130 and cyclin F should be confirmed in another cell line. Figure 3: Same concerns â the presence of SV40 LT could complicate the interpretation of these results. The authors need to confirm these effects in another cell line, in the absence of SV40 LT.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this potential concern by performing an endogenous IP for cyclin F in U2OS cells, which showed that these endogenous proteins interact in this cell line as well (see new Figure 2C). In addition, we also now show that cyclin F expression can cause the degradation of p130 in U2OS cells, but that SKP2, bTRCP and Fbxw7 cannot (Figure 3 Supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Figure 4: Panel B: It would be interesting to know whether R680A/L682A p130 mutant can still bind SV40 Large T or HPV E7 proteins.

We see no difference in binding in either of these situations (see new Figure 5 Supplement 2E-F).</p><p>We also re-analyzed cyclin F IP-MS data from 293T cells for the presence of large T antigen and found that we did not enrich for large T antigen in those experiments. These data are not yet published.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Figure 5B: It is apparent that p130-AA is still being degraded during the CHX chase, but is unaffected by cyclin F overexpression.

Panel C: Significance of the differences is not shown.</p></disp-quote><p>It is possible that Skp2 contributes to p130 degradation, and it would be difficult to rule this out completely. The focus of our paper is not to discern the potential role of Skp2 in p130 degradation. We tested Skp2 by overexpression in two cell lines, one of which was used in the original studies reporting a role for Skp2 (HEK293T cells) and obtained two negative results. We are concerned about overinterpretation of the CHX data, as this results in complete inactivation of all translation, and causes significant cellular stress. If MLN4924 completely blocked degradation in that assay, it still would not imply a role for Skp2 versus the hundreds of other cullin E3s.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Figure 6: It would be very interesting to see how the p130-AA levels are regulated during the G0/G1 arrest and progression through the cell cycle.

While we observed little or no difference in most conditions, to our surprise, we found that p130(WT) is degraded in nocodazole arrested NHF cells (see new Figure 5D). Likewise, endogenous p130 protein is degraded in nocodazole arrested NHF cells (see new Figure 5 Supplement 1C). Significantly, we did not observe p130(AA) degradation in nocodazole-synchronized cells (Figure 6E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) Figure 7A. This is an interesting result because it is hard to explain such robust effect on the DREAM target gene expression by a pretty small difference in the p130 expression levels. This difference is not even apparent in the panel D in this Figure. What is the possible explanation of this result? Also, the endogenous p130 immunoblot should be included in this figure to appreciate the extent of the overexpression (also in figure S4A). Panel D: It appears that only a small fraction of the p130-AA cells undergoes apoptosis. Additional evidence is needed to support the conclusion that this mutant promotes apoptosis.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the point regarding apoptosis we have now carried out annexin V staining and flow cytometry, and we observe the same effect. The increase in apoptosis is clear, reproducible, and statistically significant. We had originally analyzed apoptosis after seeing the dramatic impact on cell growth/fitness, and to rule out a role for apoptosis. Defying our hypothesis, our data indicated that a small amount of apoptosis is indeed occurring. These new flow cytometry data are included in Figure 7 Supplement 2B.</p><p>Since p130(AA) can assemble into the DREAM complex, and the protein can still be phosphorylated, the data in Figure 7A argues strongly that even a small increase in p130 expression is sufficient to impair cell cycle progression.

This should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>The DepMap consortium utilized barcoding strategies in hundreds of cells lines to determine sensitivities to myriad drugs, in an effort at drug repurposing. Our results show that cyclin F regulates p130. The DepMap analysis is consistent with our results, in that cyclin F has an impact on cells that is highly similar to CDK4, cyclin D, and also Palbociclib, all of which are negative regulators of the RB-family of proteins, and whose inactivation can enhance resistance to Palbociclib. Determining chemical-genetic interactions between CDK4/6 inhibitors and cyclin F is an important area of future study, but at this time, beyond the scope of this current study. We have therefore moved this observation to the Discussion, following consultation with the editor, and discussed it there appropriately.</p></body></sub-article></article>
