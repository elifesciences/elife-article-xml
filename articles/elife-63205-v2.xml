The long-held view is that Slits push growth cones forward and prevent them from turning back once they became sensitized to these cues after midline crossing. We analyzed with fluorescent reporters Slits distribution and FP glia morphology. We observed clusters of Slit-N and Slit-C fragments decorating a complex architecture of glial basal process ramifications. We found that PC2 proprotein convertase activity contributes to this pattern of ligands. Next, we studied Slit-C acting via PlexinA1 receptor shared with another FP repellent, the Semaphorin3B, through generation of a mouse model baring PlexinA1<sub>Y1815F</sub> mutation abrogating SlitC but not Sema3B responsiveness, manipulations in the chicken embryo, and ex vivo live imaging. This revealed a guidance mechanism by which SlitC constantly limits growth cone exploration, imposing ordered and forward-directed progression through aligned corridors formed by FP basal ramifications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axon guidance</kwd><kwd>commissural axons</kwd><kwd>midline crossing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-IDEX-0007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castellani</surname><given-names>Valerie</given-names></name><name><surname>Thoumine</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Label team</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castellani</surname><given-names>Valerie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007492</institution-id><institution>Fondation Bettencourt Schueller</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castellani</surname><given-names>Valerie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004923</institution-id><institution>AFM-Téléthon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castellani</surname><given-names>Valerie</given-names></name><name><surname>Ducuing</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of in vivo models and imaging techniques reveals the distribution of guidance cues and their mechanisms of action during commissural axon navigation of intermediate target.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During neural circuit formation, axons are thought to navigate series of intermediate targets or choice points until they reach their final destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Comer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raper and Mason, 2010</xref>). This concept emerged from seminal studies of limb bud innervation in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bate, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bentley and Keshishian, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ho and Goodman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Palka et al., 1992</xref>) and has been generalized to all contexts of long-distance axon projections. First, intermediate targets attract the axons, and second, set their response to the ‘next-step’ guidance cues that will specify their upcoming trajectory at the exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avilés and Stoeckli, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zuñiga and Stoeckli, 2017</xref>). They also provide a variety of extracellular cues to guide the axons along the navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nawabi and Castellani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neuhaus-Follini and Bashaw, 2015</xref>). This makes the navigation of intermediate targets a critical and complex process where the activity of the different cues guiding the axons at each step must be coordinated. This is of particular importance for the trajectory changes elicited by the ‘next-step’ cues that must occur only after completion of the crossing. It has been proposed that this matching is achieved through spatio-temporal regulation of the sensitivity of axon terminals, the growth cones, that gain responsiveness to the ‘next-step’ guidance cues at the exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avilés and Stoeckli, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zuñiga and Stoeckli, 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, in various in vivo manipulations of guidance signaling, axons are observed to skip or incompletely achieve the intermediate target crossing, prematurely re-orienting their trajectory, which compromises the formation of neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Long et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Philipp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delloye-Bourgeois et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagri et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friocourt and Chédotal, 2017</xref>). This suggests that the axons can perceive the ‘next-step’ cues during or even prior to the intermediate target navigation. Thus possibly, some mechanisms exist that counteract the action of the ‘next-step’ cues until completion of intermediate target navigation.</p><p>The formation of spinal cord commissural circuits provides a very suitable model to address the mechanisms of intermediate target navigation. Commissural axons cross the midline in a key intermediate target located at the ventral side of the neural tube, the floor plate (FP). Glial cells, composing the FP, have a typical progenitor-like bipolar morphology, with a dorsal apical anchor at the lumen of the central canal and a basal process laying ventrally on the basal lamina, even though some studies suggested these cells have complex morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell and Peterson, 1993</xref>). Commissural axons path between the glia soma and the basal lamina. Despite seminal electronic microscopy observations that reported close axon–glia contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yaginuma et al., 1991</xref>), little is known about the exact morphology of FP basal processes. Slit1-3 and Semaphorin3B (Sema3B) cues produced by the FP glia were proposed to help the FP navigation. PlexinA1 (PlxnA1) is a commissural axon receptor shared by Slit and Semaphorin ligands. When associated with Neuropilin2 (Nrp2), it mediates the response to Semaphorin3B (Sema3B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nawabi et al., 2010</xref>), and while unbound to Nrp2, it can act as a receptor for the C-terminal fragment of Slit1-3 (SlitC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delloye-Bourgeois et al., 2015</xref>). SlitC is generated from the processing of integral Slit1-3 proteins together with Slit1-3-N terminal fragment, whose functions are mediated by Roundabout (Robo) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evans and Bashaw, 2010</xref>). Both the spatial distribution and mode of action of Slits and Sema3B proteins remain unclear but these cues are thought to push the axons toward the contralateral side and also to prevent any turning back (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ducuing et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, commissural phenotypes resulting from genetic deletions of ligands or their receptors suggested that SlitC, SlitN, and Sema3B might bring specific contributions to commissural axon navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ducuing et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chédotal, 2019</xref>). Lastly, at the FP exit, commissural axons accomplish a drastic longitudinal turn directed by two synergizing rostro-caudal gradients of Wnt and Sonic Hedgehog, to navigate rostrally toward the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avilés and Stoeckli, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zuñiga and Stoeckli, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lyuksyutova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourikas et al., 2005</xref>). Various regulations activated during the FP navigation were reported to occur in commissural axons that switch on their sensitivity to the ‘next-step’ cues after completion of the crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Onishi and Zou, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avilés et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To gain novel insights into the process of FP navigation, we focused in the present study on the SlitC-PlxnA1 signaling. Through combinations of in vivo analysis, live imaging, and super resolution microscopy, we show that SlitC does not act by pushing commissural axons after crossing. Instead, it is deposited onto remarkably complex ramifications of FP glia basal process that mark out the entire FP navigation path. Reiterated contacts with ligand-coated glial surfaces produce continuous constrains that protect the growth cones from the risk of aberrant deviations that could result from active exploration and response to other guidance cues of their local environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F</sub> mutation in mice recapitulates PlxnA1<sub>-/-</sub> recrossing but not stalling phenotype</title><p>We identified in previous work a tyrosine residue of PlxnA1 cytoplasmic tail, whose phosphorylation was specifically triggered upon SlitC exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delloye-Bourgeois et al., 2015</xref>).

Re-crossing phenotype in embryos lacking PlxnA1 or all Slit1-3 but not Robo1/2 or Sema3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delloye-Bourgeois et al., 2015</xref>) suggested that PlxnA1-SlitC signaling prevents back crossing.

We analyzed two different aberrant behaviors: axons strongly deviating from their normal straight trajectory (&gt;30°), and axons that accomplished premature turning within the FP or turning back. Interestingly, the proportion of straight trajectory decreased from 86% in the WT condition to 54% in the PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F</sub> one. Conversely, we observed significant increase of deviations (from 9% to 20%) and premature turns (from 5% to 27%) for pHluo-PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F+</sub> axons compared to pHluo-PlxnA1<sub>WT+</sub> ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). We also counted the number of deviations of individual axons that succeeded navigating the FP, from 0 (straight or slightly curved at a low angle) up to more than two deviation angles. Interestingly, pHluo-PlxnA1<sub>WT+</sub> growth cones exhibited 73% of straight trajectories while PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F</sub> ones only 36%. The latter displayed much more irregular curly aspects, with trajectories having significantly increased number of curvatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).

Thus, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>, we developed an alternative strategy based on fluorescent reporters, whose distribution should approximate that of endogenous fragments, since their physico-chemical properties might be highly similar. We constructed a plasmid encoding full-length Slit2 (Slit2-FL), fused to two distinct fluorescent proteins: Cerulean at its N-terminal part and Venus at its C-terminal part. Slit2-FL is visualized with both fluorophores overlapping (white signal). Upon cleavage, Slit2N is reported by Cerulean fluorescence (here in purple) and Slit2C by Venus (here in green) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This construct was electroporated in the FP of E2 chick embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Two days later, thick transverse sections were prepared and the FP observed by confocal microscopy. The FP domain was subdivided into three compartments along the dorso-ventral axis: (i) the ‘apical’ one, delimited by the central canal and the bottom of glial cells nuclei, (ii) the ‘basal a’ encompassing the dorsal half of the axons path, and (iii) the ‘basal b’, containing the ventral half of the axons path until the basal lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We observed that glial cells display a massive white staining in their apical part, reflecting the presence of the uncleaved Slit2-FL and/or overlapping Slit2N and Slit2C fragments. Conversely, the basal compartments, in particular the most ventral one in which commissural axons preferentially path, showed higher degree of separation of the Slit2 fragments, as quantified by a Pearson coefficient evaluation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Analysis of Cerulean (Slit2N) and Venus (Slit2C) fluorescence showed that both Slit2 fragments had a graded pattern, with higher levels in the basal a versus basal b compartment. Yet, Slit2C was significantly enriched in the basal b compartment, when compared to Slit2N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Thus, although Slit2C and Slit2N patterns within the FP are close, they present some specificities that could result from distinct structural properties and/or from mechanisms regulating Slit2 prior to processing. To address this question, we examined whether Slit2C and Slit2N distribute similarly when issued from endogenous processing and when expressed individually. We constructed two plasmids encoding one fragment each in secreted fusion with a GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) and analyzed their pattern as performed previously. Interestingly, whereas Slit2N displayed similar distributions, Slit2C diffused massively in the axon path when issued from Slit2 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–J</xref>). Furthermore, Slit2C-GFP isolated fragment was more prone to deposition along the FP basal membrane than Slit2C processing product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Thus, Slit2C and Slit2N distributions likely result from mechanisms regionalizing full-length Slit2 protein and its processing within the FP glial cell compartments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Proteolytic processing by PC2 convertase is required for proper patterns of Slit2N and Slit2C</title><p>Next, we investigated the potential contribution of Slit2-FL processing to the regionalization of Slit2 fragments in the native context. We constructed a plasmid encoding a dual-tagged Slit2-FL, fused to Cerulean in its N-terminal part and to Venus in its C-terminal part, having a deletion of the Slit cleavage site (amino acids 110–118-SPPMVLPRT-) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguyen Ba-Charvet et al., 2001</xref>). We verified by western blot that the expression of this Slit2-FL D in neuronal N2a cells was not compromised. As expected, the Cerulean-Slit2N and Slit2C-Venus fragments were detected in the Slit2-FL condition but not in the Slit2-FL D condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Dual-tagged Slit2-FL and Slit2-FL D were then electroporated in chicken embryos and transversal sections were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Notably, preventing Slit2 cleavage resulted in strong depletion of Slit2 fluorescent signal in the basal compartment in which commissural axons navigate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>). This suggested that Slit2-FL is not addressed to the basal processes, rather distributed in the apical compartment of FP glia cells, where it is locally processed, generating fragments that are subsequently deposited on the basal processes. This confirmed that the cleavage is determinant for proper localization of Slit2 fragments to the axon navigation path. While the protease responsible for Slit2 cleavage is still unknown in vertebrates, the pheromone convertase Amontillado has been shown to cleave Slit during muscles and tendons development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ordan and Volk, 2016</xref>). Amontillado homolog in vertebrates is PC2, a proprotein convertase involved in the activation of endocrine peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smeekens et al., 1991</xref>). We treated N2a cells transfected with dual-tagged Slit2-FL with chloromethylketone (CMK), a PC2 inhibitor, and found that it resulted in a loss of the Slit2C-Venus fragment and an accumulation of the FL form, as observed with Slit2-FL Δ. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>). Thus, PC2 might either directly or indirectly be involved in Slit2 cleavage.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Slit2-FL cleavage plays a role in the proper diffusion of the protein and is dependent on PC2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot detection of Cerulean and Venus in N2a cells transfected with either dual-tagged Slit2-FL or the uncleavable dual-tagged Slit2-FL Δ. An anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody was used, which recognizes Cerulean and Venus, two GFP derived fluorescent proteins.

Next, we investigated whether CMK injection to chicken embryos electroporated with dual-tagged Slit2-FL could alter Slit2 fragments distribution. Two injections of CMK (5 mM) and control vehicle (DMSO) were done, first following the electroporation and second 24 hr later. By quantifying the distribution of Slit2N and Sit2C, we found in both cases that the basal/apical signal was significantly reduced in the CMK condition compared with the control, indicating decrease of fragments deposition in the axon navigation path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). Thus overall, PC2 is expressed at an appropriate timing and location to mediate the cleavage of Slits and participate in the setting of their distribution patterns in the FP navigation path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Y1815F mutation releases SlitC-mediated constrains imposed by the basal processes, resulting in abnormally plastic and exploratory growth cones during FP navigation</title><p>To get further insights into PlxnA1-SlitC mode of action, we compared PlxnA1<sub>WT+</sub> and PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F+</sub> growth cones morphologies in the FP.

Our previous work showed that at basal condition mimicking the pre-crossing context, cultured commissural growth cones express low levels of PlxnA1 at their surface and are insensitive to SlitC and Sema3B. Treatment with GDNF, a cue expressed by FP cells, to mimic the FP crossing context, results in increased cell surface PlxnA1 and gain of sensitivity to subsequent SlitC and Sema3B bath application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delloye-Bourgeois et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charoy et al., 2012</xref>). As expected from our previous overexpression experiments, the capacity of SlitC to collapse PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F/Y1815F</sub> commissural growth cones was significantly reduced, compared to that of Sema3B. Interestingly, in the SlitC/GDNF condition, we noted growth cones with atypical shapes: long filopodia, or contracted with numerous reminiscent filopodia, or visibly spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that SlitC/PlxnA1 signaling might negatively regulate the complexity of growth cone morphologies.</p><p>To address the link between complex growth cones morphologies and aberrant trajectories, we recorded high-frequency time-lapses (one image every 8 min) of chick open-books electroporated with pHluo-PlxnA1<sub>WT</sub> or pHluo-PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F</sub>. Individual growth cones navigating the FP were traced over time and scored according to two types of behavior: straight (maintained forward trajectory) and exploratory (deviations from the straight axis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Strikingly, we observed much more exploratory behaviors in the PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F+</sub> population (59%) than in the pHluo-PlxnA1<sub>WT+</sub> one (15%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video13">Videos 13</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video16">16</xref>).

We did not observe collateral elongating from split growth cones, which suggests that splitting is transient and followed by single growth cone reformation. Moreover, exploratory behaviors were not appearing after midline crossing or after FP exit, but were present from the onset of the FP navigation. To refine our analysis, we measured the width of individual growth cones over time, as a read-out of morphological plasticity and exploratory behavior. We found that PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F+</sub> growth cones were significantly larger than PlxnA1<sub>WT+</sub> ones.

PlxnA1 mutation altering perception of SlitC alleviates these constrains, which results in abnormally dynamic growth cones that actively explore the FP space. Such aberrant behavior compromises efficient and straight navigation across the FP leading to premature rostro-caudal deviation and turning back (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Thus, rather than pushing the growth cones and preventing them from turning back, SlitC constrains axon growth through aligned FP glia corridors, imposing them continuous forward direction.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Specific subcellular architecture of the FP glia conforms the presentation of FP ligands to the navigating commissural axons</title><p>Characterization of guidance cues spatial distribution is only beginning. Recent work revealed that spinal cord progenitors that synthesize Netrin1, a major attractant for spinal cord commissural axons, take advantage of their basal process to redistribute Netrin at a more lateral position close to the basal lamina, where it promotes commissural axon navigation toward the FP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Varadarajan and Butler, 2017</xref>). Hence, despite extensive studies of midline crossing, very little is known on the FP tridimensional organization and guidance cues patterns. Early electronic microscopy images revealed close contacts between FP glia surfaces and axons, and suggested complex shapes of basal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yaginuma et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okabe et al., 2004</xref>). Observations of FP cells in a β-galactosidase transgenic mouse line also pointed out the complexity of basal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell and Peterson, 1993</xref>). Our study extends these observations, revealing in more detail the 3D architecture of the commissural navigation path formed by the FP glia. A particularly striking observation was the asymmetric apico-basal polarity of the FP cell, with a single apical anchor and an enlarged basal process subdivided into several pillars. Notably, these pillars are oblong, flattened along the left–right axis. Moreover, in the dorso-ventral axis, their ramifications provide to the axons a net-shaped roof. Thus overall, the FP basal process ramifications form parallel narrow corridors shaping the axon navigation path. Interestingly these observations echo early and more recent studies reporting roles of glia specializations in axon navigation. In the developing brain, glia cells at the optic chiasm midline form a specific compartment, arranging a palisade that crossing retinal axons traverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marcus et al., 1995</xref>). The path of callosal axons across the midline is also paved by radial glia processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Norris and Kalil, 1991</xref>). More recently, a radial glia scaffold lying at the frontier between the striatum and the globus pallidum was discovered to guide corticospinal axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our study reveals that glia cells elaborate complex morphological specializations that distribute the guidance cues in the FP. Notably, we found that Slit2C, Slit2N, and Sema3B are prominently deposited in columnar patches covering the ramified basal processes of FP glia cells, with Slit2C and Slit2N forming distinct clusters. Unexpectedly, these observations reveal that the distribution pattern of Slit ligands is intimately controlled by the particular morphology of the FP glia cells. Our analysis also revealed that Slit2-FL protein concentrates in the soma and its cleavage is a prerequisite for Slits deposition in the commissural axon path. Thus, unlike in <italic>Drosophila</italic> midline guidance for which Slit processing was reported to be dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coleman et al., 2010</xref>), FL-Slits likely play limited guidance role for commissural axons. This is also consistent with previous studies of the process of muscle anchorage to tendons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that reported the importance of Slit processing for subsequent distribution of the fragments and proper functional outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ordan and Volk, 2016</xref>). Our data suggest that the pro-protein convertase PC2, the vertebrate homolog of Amontillado, that we found able to cleave Slit2-FL and expressed in the FP, contributes to the generation of Slit2C and SlitN fragments distribution. Consistently, its in vivo pharmacological inhibition resulted in decreased fragment deposition in the axon navigation path. Whether in ovo administration of PC2 inhibitor resulted in alteration of commissural axon navigation remains to be demonstrated. Addressing this question would require temporally accurate abrogation of Slit cleavage to achieve Slit fragment depletion at the time the axons navigate the FP, which is technically difficult to achieve.</p><p>SlitN and SlitC fragments were reported to have different cell association properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brose et al., 1999</xref>). The molecular scaffold that localizes the ligands in the FP is still to be explored. Extracellular matrix components and their interactors are well acknowledged for their critical role in setting molecular patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walker et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, in the <italic>zebrafish</italic> developing brain, apical end feet of radial glial cells extend at the surface of the tectum, organizing through collagen IV the lamination of the neuropil by exposing Slits and heparan sulfate proteoglycans to axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>). Morphogenesis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart tube lumen was found to rely on polarized localization of the collagen XV/XVIII orthologue Multi-Plexin forming a macro-complex with Slit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harpaz et al., 2013</xref>). In the context of midline crossing, loss of the heparan sulfate carrier (heparan sulfate proteoglycan) Syndecan results in modification of Slit distribution and activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>). In the vertebrate spinal cord, dystroglycan was identified as a Slit binding partner, localizing the proteins in the basal lamina through non-cell autonomous action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wright et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lindenmaier et al., 2019</xref>). Consistently, we detected the presence of SlitC, whose sequence contains dystroglycan binding motif, in the basement membrane, as well as that of SlitN, possibly sequestrated by additional components of the FP basal lamina. For example, proteolysis of the extracellular matrix protein F-spondin, reported to contribute to commissural axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burstyn-Cohen et al., 1999</xref>), was found to generate two fragments, among which one is deposited at the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zisman et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Commissural axon navigation is driven by restriction of growth cone exploration resulting from reiterated contacts with ligands deposited on the FP basal processes</title><p>The mode of action by which FP cues exert their effect is puzzling. Proper FP crossing is thought to rely on a balance of positive and negative forces that support growth cone attachment, motility, and direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stoeckli et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fitzli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gore et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Ramon Francàs et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, studies of midline crossing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> inspired the general view that commissural axons acquire sensitivity to local repellents after midline crossing and are pushed toward the contralateral side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evans and Bashaw, 2010</xref>). Consistently, differential pre- and post-crossing sensitivities were reported in numerous experimental paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delloye-Bourgeois et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nawabi et al., 2010</xref>) but such pushing action of the cues has not been clearly established.</p><p>Our findings argue for a very different mode of action. With our analysis of PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F</sub> model and live imaging paradigms, we show that SlitC acts by restricting the exploratory capacity of commissural growth cones, which sort PlxnA1 when they enter the FP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pignata et al., 2019</xref>). This function is served by the particular morphology of the FP glia cells that might impose repeated contacts of the growth cones with spots of ligands spanning the navigation path. Our functional analyses are all consistent with SlitC mode of action restricting the formation or the stabilization of peripheral growth cone protrusions to constrain them in a non-exploratory state, thus favoring forward growth direction. Such effect is also reflected in the shape of WT crossing growth cones, which we observed are rostro-caudally thin and dorso-ventrally elongated. Notably, PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F+</sub> growth cones have a much more complex morphology than WT growth cones, and they also sense the environmental content much more actively. In drastic cases, some were even seen to turn back on themselves, although they were more frequently directed toward the contralateral side. In recent work, axon growth was modeled using microcontact printing culture devices developed to examine individual growth cone responses to dots of guidance molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ryu et al., 2019</xref>). Axons were challenged to grow on micropatterned surfaces consisting in uniform Sema3F substrate interrupted by permissive dots. They were found able to efficiently extend in such surfaces, having, in addition, a straight trajectory resulting from jumping from one permissive dot to the next one. Interestingly, perturbing the distance between dots or their size modified the shape of the axons by disorganizing their cytoskeleton and their trajectory, inducing curved growth patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ryu et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, a ‘salt and pepper’ context as in the FP with repulsive ligands localized in spots and intercalated with permissive regions might build an appropriate topographic environment for limiting the possibilities of growth deviations.</p><p>Such constrain of growth cone exploration might also be required for counteracting other local coincident guidance forces that would disturb axon trajectories during FP crossing. In our recent work, we found in live imaging that the exploration is increased when growth cones start navigating the second FP half, although we observed they still keep a clear straight growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pignata et al., 2019</xref>). This exploratory behavior could reflect an increasing sensitivity to FP-derived Shh and Wnt rostro-caudal gradients that were found to drive the longitudinal turning after the crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zuñiga and Stoeckli, 2017</xref>). The exact timing at which the axons become sensitive to these gradients is unclear. In Robo3 knockout embryos, commissural axons totally fail to cross the FP but turn longitudinally in the ipsilateral side. This argues that non-crossing commissural axons can get sensitized to longitudinal gradients, which also reflects the need for guidance constrains to counteract premature turning during the FP navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friocourt and Chédotal, 2017</xref>). One function of PlxnA1/SlitC signaling would thus be to prevent premature longitudinal turning until FP exit. This is fully consistent with our observation both in chick and mouse open-books that a significantly higher proportion of axons undergo early rostro-caudal turn during the FP navigation, when deficient for SlitC responsiveness.</p><p>Our model supports that despite their early sensitivity to Slit fragments, commissural axons are still able to enter the FP. This might result from the distribution of the cues concentrating them in discrete spots deposited on the glial surfaces forming the corridors, rather than in diffuse distribution in the environment. Moreover, signaling locally promoting the entry of the axons could be concomitantly provided by FP cells, for example involving cell adhesion molecules, as reported in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stoeckli et al., 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Tyrosine 1815 mutation alters the membrane mobility of PlxnA1 receptor</title><p>The present study shows that mutating the Y1815 residue strongly impacts on the distribution of PlxnA1 at the cell membrane. First, we observed in mouse commissural axons navigating the FP in PlxnA1<sub>-/-</sub> open-books that the PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F</sub> cell surface pool expanded to the adjacent axon shaft, whereas it was much more restricted to the growth cone compartment in the WT context. Second, when expressed in chicken open-books, using STED imaging, PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F</sub> was observed to distribute at the membrane of the entire growth cone, not accumulating at the front as normally observed for PlxnA1<sub>WT</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pignata et al., 2019</xref>). Third, FRAP experiments revealed an increased membrane mobility of the PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F</sub> receptor pool, compared with the WT one, with a pattern of fluorescence recovery suggesting that exocytosis-mediated sorting is in contrast unaffected by the mutation. Overall, this raises the interesting possibility that PlxnA1 baring Y1815F mutation lacks or abnormally interacts with a protein whose function in stabilizing the receptor at the growth cone membrane is indispensable for SlitC signaling. Structural analysis established the ability of PlxnA1 to engage its extracellular domain in dimeric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janssen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kong et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, Y1815 could be required for allowing the formation of macro-complexes of PlxnAs at the growth cone membrane. Alternatively, interactions of PlxnA1 cytoplasmic residues with signaling partners could result in abnormal PlxnA1 receptor dynamics. Our previous and present analyses indicate that PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F/+</sub> embryos have a recrossing phenotype while PlxnA1<sup>+/-</sup> ones do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delloye-Bourgeois et al., 2015</xref>). This could reflect that in heterozygous context the mutated receptor alters the activity of the WT one, thus aggravating the deficiency. Although we have no evidence from our competition assay supporting this model, further investigations are needed to clarify this issue, for example by addressing whether PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F</sub> and PlxnA1<sub>WT</sub> receptors could form heterodimers that would trap the functional receptor and limit its availability for SlitC signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Is PlxnA1-SlitC signaling the only player of the guidance program ensuring straight trajectory across the FP?</title><p>Interestingly, <italic>astray</italic> mutation in the zebrafish affecting the Robo2 gene was found to result in altered behaviors of navigating retinal axons, resembling those we report here for spinal commissural axons defective for PlxnA1-SlitC signaling. In astray mutants, retinal growth cones coursing toward the midline and away after crossing are larger and less streamlined than WT ones, also abnormally deviating their trajectory and not correcting their errors as WT ones do. Analysis of Slit patterns indicated that these ligands flank the path, suggesting they act by channeling the growth of retinal axons in the ventral telencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hutson and Chien, 2002</xref>). In the mouse spinal cord, recrossing phenotypes have been observed when PlxnA1 and Slit1-3, but not Robo1/2 or Sema3B, are inactivated and we show here that it is manifested when PlxnA1 fails to properly mediate SlitC activity. This does not exclude that the Slit/Robo signaling also contributes to keep forward axon navigation. The lack of recrossing in context of Robo1/2 loss could be due to the specific temporal and spatial pattern of Robo1 receptor at the growth cone surface. According to our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pignata et al., 2019</xref>), growth cones navigating the first FP half express PlxnA1 but not yet Robo1, while in the second FP half, they express both. Robo2 was found to be sorted only during the post-crossing longitudinal navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pignata et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, PlxnA1 and Robo loss cannot have the same outcome, whether or not both receptors have redundant functions. PlxnA1 deletion results in a situation where growth cones lack both Robo1 and PlxnA1 when they enter the FP and navigate the first FP half, whereas Robo deletion will be manifested later when growth cones navigate the second FP half and express PlxnA1. Moreover, recrossing is likely to only be the more drastic aberrant behavior. Interestingly in Robo1/2<sup>-/-</sup> embryos, cases of commissural axons aberrantly oriented within the FP were reported that could reflect alleviation of straight growth constrains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Long et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our study raises a guidance model of midline crossing that might represent a general mechanism for the navigation at choice points. Continuously limiting growth cone exploration through short-range signaling that maintains their trajectory straight can efficiently counteract coincident guidance cues destined for the next step, preventing them to induce premature directional changes until intermediate target navigation is completed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of the PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F</sub> mouse line and genotyping</title><p>The PlxnA1<sub>Y1815F</sub> mouse line was generated by the Mouse Clinical Institute (Strasbourg, France).

Thus, taking into account PlxnA1 endogenous expression, we used electroporation concentration that enabled the growth cones to enter the FP, those expressing too high levels being prevented from entry.

Using electrodes (CUY611P7-4, Sonidel) three pulses (25V, 500 ms interpulse) were delivered by CUY-21 generator (Sonidell). Electroporated embryos were incubated at 38.5°C. In ovo electroporation of FP cells was done on HH17/18 chick embryos as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilson and Stoeckli, 2012</xref>. Briefly, electrodes (CUY611P7-4, Sonidel) were placed at the thoracic level dorsally (cathode, negative electrode) and ventrally (anode, positive electrode), and three pulses (18V, 500 ms interpulse) were delivered by CUY21 electroporator (Sonidell). Embryos at HH25/HH26 were harvested in cold HBSS (14170–088, Gibco) and the spinal cords were dissected out. They were mounted in 0.5% agarose diluted in F12 medium on glass bottom dishes (P35G-1.5–14 C, MatTek). After agarose solidification, spinal cords were overlaid with 3 mL of F12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS (F7524; Sigma-Aldrich), 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 20 mM HEPES buffer (15630–049, ThermoFischer Scientific). For section imaging, embryos were then fixed for 2 hr at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS. For open-book imaging, spinal cords were dissected and then fixed 45 min in 4% paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS. For vibratome sectioning, embryos were embedded in 3% low gelling agarose (A9414, Sigma) diluted in PBS. The embryos were then sectioned in 80 μm slices using Leica VT1000S vibratome.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Mouse spinal cord electroporation and open-book mounting</title><p>E12 mice embryos were collected and fixed on a SYLGARD (Dow Corning) culture plate in HBSS medium (ThermoFisher) supplemented with Glucose 1M (Sigma-Aldrich).

Image was acquired with a 20× objective by EMCCD camera (iXon3 DU-885, Andor technology). Fifteen to thirty planes spaced of 0.5–3 μm were imaged for each open-book at 30 min interval for 10 hr approximately. To reduce exposure time and laser intensity, acquisitions were done using binning 2 × 2. Images were acquired using IQ3 software using multi-position and Z stack protocols. Z stack projections of the movies were analyzed in ImageJ software. The analysis of pHluo-flashes was performed from time-lapse acquisitions. In some experiments, the time interval was reduced for faster image acquisition. Time intervals of 3, 5, 8, and 12 min were tested. At 3 and 5 min, the tissues were rapidly damaged. We thus selected time interval of 8 min as the better compromise between time resolution and phototoxicity. Confocal imaging was performed with either an Olympus FV1000 with a 40× objective and zoom or a Leica TCS SP5 with a 63× objective. Deconvolution was done using the Huygens software. 3D surface reconstructions were done using the Imaris software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Atto647N staining and STED microscopy</title><p>Spinal cords were incubated at 38°C for 20 min with F12 medium supplemented with 5% FCS (F7524; Sigma-Aldrich), 20 mM HEPES buffer (15630–049, ThermoFischer Scientific), and 1/100 GFP-nanobodies Atto647N. They were then rinsed four times with the same medium free of GFP-nanobodies and fixed at room temperature for 2 hr with PBS supplemented with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 1% BSA (A7638 Sigma-Aldrich). Open-books were observed with a STED microscope (TCS SP8, Leica). STED illumination of ATTO 647N was performed using a 633 nm pulsed laser providing excitation, and a pulsed bi-photon laser (Mai Tai; Spectra-Physics) turned to 765 nm and going through a 100 m optical fiber to enlarge pulse width (100ps) used for depletion. A doughnut-shaped laser beam was achieved through two lambda plates. Fluorescence light between 650 and 740 nm was collected using a photomultiplier, using a HCX PL-APO CS 100/1.40 NA oil objective and a pinhole open to one time the Airy disk (60 mm). Images were acquired using Leica microsystem software and a Z stack protocol. Usually 10–20 planes spaced of 0.5 μm where imaged for each growth cone. The growth cones were delineated and the intensity signal was calculated using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching</title><p>FRAP experiments were conducted on spinal cord open-books electroporated with either pHluo-receptor and mbTomato, using a Leica DMI6000 (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a confocal Scanner Unit CSU-X1 (Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and a scanner FRAP system, ILAS (Roper Scientific, Evry, France). Images were acquired in both green and red channels using a 63× objective and an Evolve EMCCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, USA). Growth cones located in the FP were first monitored for 12 s each 3 s and then bleached using a 488 nm diode laser at full power. This resulted in an 85–95% loss of the signal (mean of 89%) at t = 0. Fluorescence recovery was then monitored for 730 s with acquisitions every 3 s for 30 s, then every 10 s for 100 s, and finally every 30 s for 600 s. The images were corrected for background noise, residual fluorescence right after the bleach was set to zero, and recovery curves were normalized to the fluorescence lost after the bleach. No other corrections were applied since unbleached growth cone fluorescence showed no significant decay during the acquisition period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Western blot</title><p>To observe Slit cleavage, N2a cells were seeded into 6-well plates (2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well). 24 hr later, cells were transfected using jetprime transfection reagent (114, Polyplus transfection).

most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The results from this study provide a novel view on how spinal cord commissural axons -a commonly used paradigm to study mechanism of axon guidance- grow across the floor plate, a glial-like structure positioned at the ventral spinal cord midline. The study shows that a well-known axon guidance cue, SlitC, deposited on very elaborated basal end-feet of floor plate cells, constantly limits the exploration of the commissural growth cones expressing its PlexinA1 receptor. Thus, this receptor/ligand pair imposes order to axons as they cross to the contralateral side of the spinal cord. This observation rectifies the current view whereby Slits were thought to provide a repulsive signal that prevented axons to turn back after crossing.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;SlitC-PlexinA1 mediates iterative inhibition for orderly passage of spinal commissural axons through the floor plate&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

In agreement with previous studies, the authors show that commissural axons make close contacts with floor plate cells as they navigate through it. More importantly they provide an elaborate analysis of floor plate basal processes, their changes and their differential distribution of cleaved Slit fragments, showing how these prevent commissural growth cones from exploring the environment and direct axonal trajectories forward until they exit the floor plate. The authors further show that phosphorylation of PlexinA1 at Y1815 is essential for restricting exploratory growth cone behaviors.</p><p>Overall, the study is solid and provides innovative ideas on growth cone navigation and receptor/ligand interactions during axon guidance with a well performed analysis. Nevertheless, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study heavy relies on the expression of a mutant form of Plexin (Plexin<sup>Y1815F</sup>). However, the functioning of the mutation is insufficiently described and its effects confusing. The authors need to clarify why and how &quot;the Y1815 mutation alters PlxnA1 cell surface pattern&quot;. Does the mutant form when overexpressed act dominantly, altering the distribution of endogenous protein? Do the PlexinA1-Y1815F/ PlexinA1-wt mice have a phenotype? Have the authors tested a PlexinA1-Y1815 Alanin mutation as a counterpart to PlexinA1-Y1815F? The effect of the Plexin mutant form is particularly important in the electroporation experiments in chick embryos where two copies of endogenous PlexinA1 are present. How do the authors explain that these electroporated chick commissural neurons show a phenotype similar to the mutant mice that only express the PlexinA1<sup>Y1815F/Y1815F</sup> form? It would be also helpful if the authors discuss potential problems in relying in their interpretations mostly on this paradigm as the mutant form could disrupt the dynamic/temporal control of receptor trafficking or signaling in general.</p><p>2) A phenotype similar to that described here was reported by Hutson and Chien, 2002, analyzing the zebrafish astray mutants. In that study, the authors proposed a role for Slit-Robo signaling in preventing and correcting pathfinding errors. These data need to be mentioned and discussed. Is the &quot;straight growth&quot; and dampening of exploration proposed here, similar to the restriction of error and error correction model proposed by Hutson and Chien?. Could PlxnA1-SliC signaling be playing a similar role at the floorplate to Robo-Slit signaling in the visual system? Furthermore, Slit signaling has been proposed to play a barrier function that is important for channeling axons along their correct path. How might this relate to the model being proposed here? How &quot;radically different&quot; is the mode of guidance being proposed here from that described already in other parts of the CNS?</p><p>3) Throughout the manuscript, the authors refer to an &quot;unexpectedly&quot; complex mesh of ramified complex FP glial basal processes&quot;. However, there have been several previous studies of glia at the floor plate and other regions of the CNS midline using immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. These studies have demonstrated that midline glia from a dense palisade and are highly branched and that complex interactions occur between the glial cells and axons traversing the midline (e.g. Marcus et al., 1995; Campbell and Peterson, 1993). The finding reported here that the glial cell basal processes from a complex mesh of ramified processes is therefore not unexpected. While the 3D reconstructions are beautiful and add some detail to our understanding of the interactions between axons and glial cells at the CNS midline, it needs to be made clearer, particularly in the Results sections, that these analyses largely confirm previous work and what the specific advances made here are. In this respect, the complex end feet processes of midline glia might have important implications regarding ligand presentation. It would seem interesting to test conditions where end feet morphologies of the glia cells are lost. In a number of different studies people have used expression of dominant RhoA or cdc42 mutant proteins to prevent such cellular process formation. Do the authors consider it feasible to use here?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63205.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study heavy relies on the expression of a mutant form of Plexin (Plexin<sup>Y1815F</sup>).

Their respective concentration might be in favor of the mutated receptor, due to the over-expression condition. We focused our analysis to the growth cones that had sorted PlxnA1<sup>Y1815F</sup> receptor at their cell surface, even though the endogenous receptor might also be present. Several mechanisms can be considered:</p><p>– First, growth cones preferentially engaging PlxnA1<sup>Y1815F</sup> interactions with SlitC for various reasons (availability, stability, affinity, etc.) behave abnormally.</p><p>– Second, competition for cell surface sorting due to increased PlexinA1 receptor expression could lead to depletion of WT receptor in some growth cones.</p><p>– Third, PlxnA1<sup>Y1815F</sup> could titrate PlxnA1<sup>WT</sup> receptor in contexts where both are expressed, by forming dysfunctional complexes.</p><p>We can discuss these hypotheses in light of the phenotypes observed in our mouse model. We do see recrossing phenotypes in the PlxnA1<sup>Y1815F/+</sup> heterozygous embryos (Figure 1C). They look similar to those observed in the PlexinA1<sup>Y1815F/Y1815F</sup> embryos. This indicates that the mutated PlxnA1 receptor can alter SlitC signaling in presence of the WT one. In contrast, PlxnA1<sup>+/-</sup> embryos do not exhibit recrossing phenotypes (Delloye-Bourgeois et al., 2015), which thus suggests that one copy of PlxnA1 might be sufficient to ensure SlitC-PlxnA1 signaling. This weakens the relevance of the model of depletion by competition for sorting; leaving more plausible hypotheses 1 and 3. Addressing these models is difficult because we have no ways of distinguishing PlxnA1<sup>WT</sup> and PlexinA1<sup>Y1815F</sup> receptors in the mouse model as they are both recognized by anti-PlexinA1 antibodies, in western blot and in immunohistochemistry. In the chicken, PlxnA1 antibodies that we tested recognized both chick and mouse PlxnA1, and we thus cannot specifically assess the expression of the endogenous receptor. Nevertheless, we attempted to get some more information using the chicken embryo model. We made an in vivo competition assay by diluting the dose of electroporated pHLuo-PlxnA1<sup>WT</sup> with either PlxnA1<sup>WT</sup> or PlxnA1<sup>Y1815F</sup> (using non-fluorescent receptors forms) and we compared the cell surface distribution of pHluo-PlxnA1<sup>WT</sup> in commissural axons navigating the FP. We observed a similar enrichment of the pHluo-PlxnA1<sup>WT</sup> in the growth cone compartment, compared to the adjacent axon segments. This indicates that co-expression with PlxnA1<sup>Y1815F</sup> does not affect the compartmentalization of pHluo-PlxnA1<sup>WT</sup>. Nevertheless, it did not exclude the possibility that PlxnA1<sup>Y1815F</sup> titrates PlxnA1<sup>WT</sup> if both receptors dimerize, which would result in depleting the growth cones of the PlxnA1 receptors that are normally able to transduce SlitC signal. We thus quantified the pHluo signal in the growth cones and found no significant differences in the presence or absence of the mutated receptor. Thus, these experiments support a model whereby PlxnA1<sup>Y1815</sup> has a direct contribution to the altered growth cone behaviors, even in the presence of the PlxnA1<sup>WT</sup> receptor. These data are presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, subsection “The temporal and spatial pattern of PlxnA1 membrane insertion during commissural axon navigation is impacted by the Y1815 mutation” and discussed in the subsection “Tyrosine mutation alters the membrane mobility of PlxnA1 receptor”.</p><p>We did not engineer a PlxnA1 with Y1815 Alanin mutation. We thought that the fact that the Y1815F mutation only altered SlitC but not Sema3B responses was a good internal control of the substitution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A phenotype similar to that described here was reported by Hutson and Chien, 2002, analyzing the zebrafish astray mutants.

After reading, we fully agree that our findings must be discussed in light of this study, which reported in the context of retinal axon navigation observations than echo ours. Astray retinal growth cones are observed to be more complex and less streamlined than WT ones, deviating their trajectory from the normal path, already prior to reaching the midline, which correlates with Slit expression patterns framing the navigation path. Robo2-Slit might thus maintain retinal growth cones straight on their way towards and after midline crossing, as we propose PlxnA1-SlitC does so in the context of the floor plate navigation.</p><p>We have now included a paragraph discussing this work in the subsection “Is PlxnA1-SlitC signaling the only player of the guidance program ensuring straight trajectory across the FP?”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Throughout the manuscript, the authors refer to an &quot;unexpectedly&quot; complex mesh of ramified complex FP glial basal processes&quot;.

Our claim of “unexpectedly complex mesh of ramified process” was in fact referring to the multiple ramifications of the basal process, the particular asymmetric morphologies these cells have, and how they are arranged in 3D in the tissue, which were not reported so far. We modified the manuscript according to the suggestions, adding sentences to make it clearer what our observations bring to the known background, Results section and Discussion. We also extended the literature in this paragraph, citing previous studies reporting glia cell specializations and their contribution to axon guidance. We toned down the novelty of the findings in the manuscript and Abstract, removing “novel” at several places.</p><p>We fully agree that manipulating the morphology of the FP cells would be very interesting to examine whether it modifies the ligands distribution and alters commissural axon navigation. The consequences of Rho ablation in the developing spinal cord have been examined using a conditional line with specific ablation of RhoA in neural progenitors. The study showed that it essentially altered the apical polarity of the progenitors, disrupting adherens junctions. In contrast, the basal polarity was reported to be unaffected (Herzog et al., J. Neurosci 2011). In another study, a dominant negative RhoA was electroporated in the chick neuroepithelium. The major reported consequence was an alteration of the division angle of neural progenitors at the apical side (Roszko et al., Dev Biol, 2006). It seems difficult from this literature to predict that altering RhoA would result in a disruption of FP glia basal processes, and we feel that addressing this point in the context of revisions would take a long time because of the technical challenges it represents.</p><p>Beyond the experimental difficulty to reach the objective, the observations would be difficult to interpret because altering the basal process would not only impact the distribution of the ligands but would also change the physical properties of the navigation path that may also account for proper navigation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
