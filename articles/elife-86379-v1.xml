But some cancer survivors can develop a second cancer called a second primary cancer. Second primary cancers may occur months or years after successful treatment of the primary cancer. They are not caused by the spread of the original tumor like a cancer metastasis. Instead, they appear to occur independently in another location or tissue.</p><p>Scientists are trying to understand what causes second primary cancers. Genetics, lifestyle, the environment, treatments used for the initial tumor, or other factors may all contribute to individuals developing a second cancer. Learning more about who is at risk of developing a second cancer and why, may lead to new prevention, treatment or screening strategies.</p><p>Ruan, Huang et al. found that people with some primary cancers have an increased risk of secondary primary cancers in specific tissues. The researchers first looked at the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database that tracks US cancer patients to see if different types of cancers were more likely to lead to a second primary cancer. Then, the team conducted a comprehensive analysis for a causal relationship in a second extensive health database, the UK Biobank, to determine if the primary cancers may have caused the second primary cancer. The study showed that patients diagnosed with mouth or throat cancers were at increased risk of later developing a lymph node cancer called non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer were at increased risk of later developing cancer in one of the body's soft tissues. Kidney cancer is likely the cause of later lung cancers and a type of blood cancer called myeloma.</p><p>Understanding the relationships between an initial and later cancer diagnosis is essential to improve cancer survivors' care. It is especially important for patients diagnosed early in life. More studies are needed to confirm the links Ruan, Huang et al. identified and to understand the mechanism. If more studies confirm the associations, physicians may want to screen survivors for specific cancers. Scientists may also be able to use the information to develop new strategies to help prevent or treat secondary primary cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>First primary cancer</kwd><kwd>second primary cancer</kwd><kwd>Mendelian randomization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81972645</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Na</surname><given-names>Rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innovative Research Team of High-level Local University in Shanghai</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Na</surname><given-names>Rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Youth Talent Support Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Na</surname><given-names>Rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003803</institution-id><institution>University of Hong Kong</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Na</surname><given-names>Rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Sailing Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22YF1440500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Da</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A certain type of primary cancer may cause another second primary cancer which would be of clinical importance to make a personalized screening plan for certain primary cancer patients.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer incidence is rapidly growing worldwide in the past decades. The reasons are complex including the aging of the population, the application of screening, environmental risk factors and genetic risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sung et al., 2021</xref>). In 2020, there were an estimated 19.3 million new cases and 10.0 million deaths of different types of cancers globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sung et al., 2021</xref>). In the US, there would be about 1.9 million new cases of cancers in 2023,and the most common type of cancers in the male and the female were prostate cancer (29%) and breast cancer (31%), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Siegel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Siegel et al., 2023</xref>). Despite the rapidly increased incidence of cancers, the survival of (most types of) cancers in the US has vastly improved since the mid-1990s with medical advances and technical developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Siegel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Siegel et al., 2023</xref>). For example, the 5-year relative survival rates of prostate cancer, melanoma, and female breast cancer, during 2011–2017 in the US were 98%, 93%, and 90%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Siegel et al., 2022</xref>). Such disparity may lead to an increase in the prevalence and the tumor burden in US society. More importantly, prolonged survival makes it possible for individuals to be diagnosed with a second primary cancer (SPC) after the first primary cancer (FPC) during the follow-up.</p><p>According to the Italian (1976–2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AIRTUM Working Group, 2013</xref>), the Swiss (1981–2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feller et al., 2020</xref>), and the Swedish (1990–2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>) cancer registration data, increased risks of SPCs were observed in many types of cancer as the FPCs. Patients with oral cavity &amp; pharynx, larynx, and esophagus as FPC were found to have a significantly elevated risk of any SPCs in both Italy and Switzerland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AIRTUM Working Group, 2013</xref>). In Sweden, liver cancers, as well as nasal and oral cancers, were found to be associated with SPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, several studies focused on certain cancer also suggested a potential relationship between FPC and SPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chattopadhyay et al., 2018</xref>). For example, increased FPC risk of colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, and melanoma were observed following the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Despite the strong association observed in these studies, whether there is any underlying causal relationship is unknown, or the association observed is due to the potential confounders such as aging.</p><p>In the present study, our objectives are to perform a pan-cancer association study in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and to interpret the underlying causal relationship via Mendelian Randomization approaches using genetic variants in a large population cohort (UK Biobank, UKB). The study may help us understand critical questions in clinical practice about who should be more careful of the second primaries. In addition, precision screenings against certain cancers should also be considered among those patients with increased risk of second primaries in addition to the regular follow-up evaluations. In addition, many cancers are known to have a multifactorial etiology and some cancer treatments are known to be carcinogenic. It is essential to illustrate the potential relationship between FPCs and SPCs which mary optimize the treatment for patients’ prognosis and survivorship.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study populations</title><p>SEER Program 18 Registry database was obtained which covered 27.8% of the total population in the United States (&quot;Number of Persons by Race and Hispanic Ethnicity for SEER Participants - SEER Registries.,&quot;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">National Cancer Institute, 2020</xref>). The SEER program is the largest cancer incidence dataset in the United States based on population cancer registration. Based on the ICD-10 code, we identified adult patients (age ≥20 years) diagnosed with an FPC between 2000 and 2016, including 22 types of solid-tumor sites (oral cavity and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon and rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, larynx, lung and bronchus, bones and joints, soft tissue including heart, melanoma of the skin, female breast, male breast, cervix uteri, ovary, prostate, bladder, kidney, renal pelvis and ureter, brain, thyroid) and 4 types of hematological malignancies (Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, leukemia). Patients with diagnosis by autopsy or mentioned in the death certificate only were excluded.</p><p>The UKB project is a prospective cohort study collecting phenotypic and genotypic data from ~500,000 individuals from across the United Kingdom (median follow-up time was ~14 years).

In the present study, a total of 459,156 participants with European Ancestry from UKB (release V3) with GWAS genotyping array data and imputation information were obtained and included in the MR analysis. Disease phenotypes in UKB were also defined using the ICD-10 code. Non-Caucasian patients were not included in the present study in SEER or UKB due to the small number of subjects in UKB, which made it hard to make the causal inference.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants from SEER or UKB according to the established standard of the studies.

These two arrays share 95% of the markers. Individuals were excluded if: (a) ancestry testing using principal component analysis (PCA) to evaluate the potential conflicts between self-reported ethnicity/race and the genetic ethnicity/race; (b) Poor call rate at the genotyping stage (n=968, 0.2%); (c) Mismatched results between self-reported gender and genetic gender (n=652, 0.13%).

Second primary thyroid cancer, small bowel cancer, or cancers of endocrine system were strongly and significantly associated with most of the FPCs. Cancers of the digestive system, cervix uteri, as well as lung cancer were clustered together. They are closely correlated with an increased risk of several types of cancers such as bladder cancer, kidney cancer, etc. Our subgroup analysis suggested that patients with prostate cancer who received radiation therapy were at an increased risk of being diagnosed with another type of primary cancer during the follow-up including small intestine, soft tissue, and leukemia, compared with those without such therapy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1m</xref>).

Genetic factors or shared environmental factors are probably the major causes. In the previous association studies, individuals with a certain type of primary malignancy would have an increased risk of another malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AIRTUM Working Group, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). However, whether there are any causal effects within the associations is unclear. In the present study, via the association study based on the SEER database and the MR approach using the UKB genetic dataset, we were able to perform this comprehensive investigation across 26 different types of cancers. 13 out of 26 types of cancers with adequate GWAS data were able to be further investigated using MR analysis. We found that numbers of primary malignancies were associated with an increased risk of a second primary malignancy, however, only a small part of the associations would have a causal relationship (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Many significant findings were observed in the SEER SIR analysis. SEER is one of the largest cancer registration-based datasets making itself the most proper data source to answer the study objectives; however, several advantages of this database and limitations of the results should be noted. First, the results from the SEER SIR analysis were associations rather than causal inferences. Many factors may influence the results of the associations. For example, the confounder of screening effects may exist. Patients diagnosed with primary cancer might have more frequent healthcare visits compared to those who did not have any cancers. Therefore, some indolent cancers such as thyroid cancer and low-risk prostate cancer could have been over-diagnosed due to the screening effects. Second, it is a cancer registration-based cohort rather than a population cohort, the standardized incidences calculated from the SEER database may not represent the situation in the general population. Third, treatment preferences and follow-up strategies may vary in different locations or institutions, which would also affect the occurrence/detection of the second primary cancer. For example, radiation therapy may increase the risk of cancer in nearby organs<sup>6</sup>. However, treatment and follow-up information are not completed in the SEER database due to the natural design of the cohort<sup>31</sup>. More importantly, lifestyles, comorbidities, and environmental factors were not included in the SEER database. These are important confounders of the associations between the first primary cancers and the second primary cancers.</p><p>The MR approaches in the current study revealed some interesting findings, but several non-concordant results between MR analyses and SEER SIR were also observed (Table S20). It does not indicate that the causal relationship does not exist. Some factors, such as the period of follow-up, may conceal and cause false negatives in the association study (SEER SIR). For example, pancreatic cancer might cause an increased risk of cancers in esophagus, colon and rectum, etc. based on the MR analysis in our study; however, no association was observed in SEER SIR analysis. The short and poor survival of pancreatic cancer could be the most critical reason for the failure of finding a positive association in the population data --- simply did not have enough time of follow-up to observe the outcomes. Therefore, the interpretation of these results should be more careful at this stage.</p><p>The lack of GWAS findings would be a major limitation of the MR approach for some diseases as in the present study. The MR approach may only represent part of the biological effects in the causal pathway between the exposure and the outcome. A final causal inference should always be established based on biological mechanisms. From the angle of organ location, some cancers (ovary cancer and soft tissue sarcoma) might share the same tumor-related or tumor-developing environment. Besides the outside therapeutic settings (radio- and chemotherapy, immuno-suppressive agents) and individual factors (smoking, hormone level, certain occupational settings, HIV or HPV infections, and family histories), FPC might also influence the iatrogenic immune by suppressing antitumor defense mechanisms via inflammation or other meditating effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Shalapour and Karin, 2019</xref>). For instance, the increased risk of renal cell cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were observed in immunosuppressed patients in Denmark and Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hortlund et al., 2017</xref>). The immune factor might be the inner relation between FPC and SPC. In our assumption, the question of mechanism should be answered via cross-trait GWAS meta-analyses, searching for shared genetic architecture under high heritability or potential meditation factors with comprehensive database and analyses, functional experiments (tissue- or cell-specific findings) and final validation in a cohort of comorbidity patients. In terms of clinical implications, lifestyle, environment, treatment, host factors and other influences may contribute to multiple primary cancer. It required clinicians and researchers to explore a specific link between FPCs and SPCs. It would be of clinical importance to make a personalized screening plan for certain primary cancer patients (eg. oral pharyngeal cancer, ovary cancer and kidney cancer), especially for those young onsets. For example, patients with kidney cancer would have an increased risk of lung cancer and myeloma. Thus, a screening for lung cancer and myeloma should be recommended among those patients.</p><p>Finally, besides the limitations mentioned, the relatively small number of cases of some diseases in UKB may lower our statistical power. As UKB is a population-based prospective cohort, the relatively short follow-up period may not allow us to observe enough events (multiple cancers) at this stage. And it is expected to be independently replicated in another dataset. Regardless, these findings progress our understanding of the relationship underlying both FPCs and SPCs, and potentially provide points of exploration and intervention that may reduce second primary cancers.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients who were diagnosed with a certain type of primary cancer may cause another type of primary cancer, especially pharynx cancer on non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovary cancer on soft tissue cancer, kidney cancer on lung and myeloma.

We performed subgroup analyses in SEER Research Plus Data 18 Reg, Nov 2020 Sub (2000-2018), with additional 2-year follow-up data. We stratified the total patients with first primary ovarian cancers to four groups based on the pathological subtypes: serous (~69.5%), endometrioid, mucinous, and clear cell carcinomas. The high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), as the most common type of ovarian cancer, was also evaluated. The SIR analyses were repeated in the above subgroups. The additional result was listed in Supplementary file 1l. However, only some subtypes (e.g. serous, high-grade serous and endometrioid ovary cancer) conformed to the results in the relation between overall primary ovary cancer and several secondary primary cancers (lung and bronchus and non-Hodgkin lymphoma).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please consider providing a better rationale for why studying second primary cancers is crucial.</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve added it on lines 90-97. The study may help us understand critical questions in clinical practice about who should be more carefully monitored for the second primaries. In addition, precision screenings against certain cancers should also be considered among those patients with increased risk of second primaries in addition to the regular follow-up evaluations. As known, many cancers are known to have a multifactorial etiology and some cancer treatments are known to be carcinogenic. It is essential to illustrate the potential relationship between FPCs and SPCs which may optimize the treatment for patients’ prognosis and survivorship.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please provide a discussion on the potential clinical implications of the observed associations between first and second primary cancers.</p></disp-quote><p>In terms of clinical implications, lifestyle, environment, treatment, host factors and other influences may contribute to multiple primary cancer. It required clinicians and researchers to explore a specific link between FPCs and SPCs. It would be of clinical importance to make a personalized screening plan for certain primary cancer patients (eg. oral pharyngeal cancer, ovary cancer and kidney cancer), especially for those young onsets. For example, patients with kidney cancer would have an increased risk of lung cancer and myeloma. Thus, a screening for lung cancer and myeloma should be recommended among those patients.

For instance, first primary ovary cancers can be classified into different subtypes to further analyze the relationship between subtypes and causal secondary primary cancers, so that secondary primary cancer prevention would be more specific and targeted.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We performed subgroup analyses in SEER Research Plus Data 18 Reg, Nov 2020 Sub (2000-2018), with additional 2-year follow-up data. We stratified the total patients with first primary ovarian cancers to four groups based on the pathological subtypes: serous (~69.5%), endometrioid, mucinous, and clear cell carcinomas. The high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), as the most common type of ovarian cancer, was also evaluated. The SIR analyses were repeated in the above subgroups. The additional result was listed in supplementary file 1l. However, the number of patients with specific pathological type was too few to obtain a stable association result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The limited SNPs included in some cancer types mentioned in the research might lead to missed opportunities to discover other significant associations. Enlargement of the data source could have benefits.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agreed with you. Data sharing is critical to find significant associations. In particular, a complete genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics that underpin the selection and weighting of genetic variants for a particular trait. Comprehensive databases of GWAS summary statistics, such as the pioneering NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog, are widely utilized by the community but still only a minority of published GWAS share their full summary statistics. The current study, however, provides the most up-to-date evidence in this topic. We also believe that it should be regularly updated with additional GWAS results in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. SEER database used in stage 1 and UK Biobank database used in stage 2 are based on completely different populations, and this may cause confounding factors due to genetic heterogeneity, which should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We mainly focus on the white people in SEER database (non-Hispanic whites) and UK Biobank (British, Irish and any other white background). As a matter of fact, since this study was mainly focus on the European Ancestry (aka, white or non-Hispanic or non-Nordic Caucasian), the genetic heterogeneity between these two populations was very low.

The combination of a pan-cancer analysis and the use of Mendelian randomization adds novelty and value to the study. However, as the author state, the objective of the study is to investigate the causal relationship between FPCs and SPCs. This can be done based on the UKB data. it is not clear why use SEER data which only provides the association.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for being so concerned. The SEER database is the most significant incidence dataset in the United States based on population cancer registration. It is very critical to find significant associations between FPCs and SPCs based on such a great number of cancer patients. While the UKB data is composed of ~500,000 people aged 40-69 yrs, the incidence of FPCs and SPCs is limited, which might considerably impede the statistical power. On the other hand, in order to interpret the MR results under a more stringent standard, we would like to perform the analyses in independent study populations given the low genetic heterogeneity between these two populations. We think it is rigorous to combine these two stage results to draw a relatively solid conclusion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
