These waves are most often measured using macroscopic methods that are unable to assess the local spiking activity underlying wave dynamics. Here, we investigated the possibility that waves may not be traveling at the single neuron scale. We first show that sequentially activating two discrete brain areas can appear as traveling waves in EEG simulations. We next reproduce these results using an analytical model of two sequentially activated regions. Using this model, we were able to generate wave-like activity with variable directions, velocities, and spatial patterns, and to map the discriminability limits between traveling waves and modular sequential activations. Finally, we investigated the link between field potentials and single neuron excitability using large-scale measurements from turtle cortex ex vivo. We found that while field potentials exhibit wave-like dynamics, the underlying spiking activity was better described by consecutively activated spatially adjacent groups of neurons. Taken together, this study suggests caution when interpreting phase delay measurements as continuously propagating wavefronts in two different spatial scales. A careful distinction between modular and wave excitability profiles across scales will be critical for understanding the nature of cortical computations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>traveling waves</kwd><kwd>EEG</kwd><kwd>turtle</kwd><kwd>neuronal dynamics</kwd><kwd>modular topology</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ISF-NSFC Research Fund 3430/20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shein-Idelson</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ISF-NSFC Research Fund 3430/20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shein-Idelson</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multi-electrode recordings and modeling work indicate that sequentially activated discrete modules of spiking neurons may appear as traveling waves in low spatial resolution measurements, suggesting caution when interpreting phase delay measurements as continuously propagating wavefronts.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cortical traveling waves are considered a ubiquitous feature of cortical dynamics and are suggested to play important roles in cortical processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Muller and Destexhe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu, 2008</xref>). These waves are observed across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales and exhibit a wide repertoire of propagation patterns. Traveling waves can propagate to specific directions (plane wave) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Massimini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Senseman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xu et al., 2007</xref>), outward from a center locus (radial waves) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muller et al., 2014</xref>) or rotate around a phase singularity (spiral waves) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Muller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Prechtl et al., 1997</xref>). Waves also range in their spatial extent from mesoscale waves spanning a single cortical area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferezou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jancke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Petersen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Reimer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rubino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xu et al., 2007</xref>), to macroscale waves propagating through multiple brain areas and even across the two hemispheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldman et al., 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Massimini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Muller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Patten et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, cortical waves are characterized by different propagation velocities (from millimeters to meters per second) and frequency bands. For example, α-band oscillations (8–12 Hz) travel from occipital to frontal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hughes, 1995</xref>); γ-band (30–80 Hz) auditory-induced oscillations travel from anterior to posterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ribary et al., 1991</xref>); and slow wave oscillations (0.1–1 Hz), occurring during sleep, travel from anterior to posterior cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Massimini et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>It is unclear how the abundance of traveling waves across large areas of cortex fits its modular structural and functional organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meunier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sporns and Betzel, 2016</xref>). Tangential cortical connectivity is not uniform. It is higher within cortical areas (e.g. V1) or regions (e.g. visual cortex) than between areas (V1 and V2 or visual cortex and auditory cortex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hilgetag et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Markov et al., 2011</xref>). This modularity is observed across multiple scales. Within single cortical areas, neurons are segmented into columns with high intra-column connectivity and sparser inter-column connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mountcastle, 1997</xref>). Such non-uniform connectivity is likely to restrict the spread of activity rather than to support smooth propagation of waves across the cortical sheet during which action potentials are sequentially activated in neurons as the wavefront passes. Indeed, it was suggested that one of the roles of modularity is to segregate circuits and computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shein-Idelson et al., 2016</xref>) and prevent uncontrolled spread of excitability, as is evident in pathological conditions such as epileptic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martinet et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Understanding in which scenarios traveling waves ignore cortical modularity requires defining the spatial granularity with which waves are examined and performing experimental measurements with the corresponding resolution. For example, determining whether a traveling wave entails a spreading excitation at the single neuron level requires single cell resolution measurements. In contrast, traveling waves are commonly measured with low spatial resolution technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hindriks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mak-McCully et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Muller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ribary et al., 1991</xref>). This is especially true for extracranial recording such as EEG in which brain current sources are distant from the measurement electrodes and separated by diffracting elements such as the skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Michel and Murray, 2012</xref>). Even in more local intracranial measurements such as electrocorticography (ECoG), volume conduction through low impedance media, such as the cerebrospinal fluid, may result in substantial contribution of distant areas to local measurements and effective spatial low-pass filtering that blur out possible spatially segregated activations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herreras, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kajikawa and Schroeder, 2011</xref>). Imaging waves with more local reporters of excitability such as voltage sensitive dye (VSD) reduces the limitations imposed by large electrodes. While the spatial resolution of this method is higher, VSD measurements mostly reflect sub-threshold potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chemla and Chavane, 2010a</xref>) with strong contribution from upper layers and long-range inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chemla and Chavane, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Petersen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stepanyants et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, VSDs integrate inputs from both local and distant spiking activities rather than represent local spiking excitability profiles. In addition, VSD signals may be contaminated by contribution from non-neuronal sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pál et al., 2015</xref>). For example, the velocities of some traveling waves correspond to axonal propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Muller and Destexhe, 2012</xref>). However, such axonal propagations do not necessarily activate the neurons in the target tissue and single cell excitability may remain modular. While in specific cases the existence of traveling waves in single cells was measured in high resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Voufo et al., 2023</xref>), this existence cannot be unambiguously generalized to all reported traveling waves, especially given the large diversity of reported wave patterns across different brain areas.</p><p>In addition to the lack of understanding of the nature of excitability underlying waves, previous studies raised the possibility that measured propagating patterns may be biased by the limitations of experimental technique used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhigalov and Jensen, 2023</xref>). For example, when considering a scenario in which the intensity of a stationary source with a spatially decaying profile increases over time. In this scenario, additional regions cross the detection threshold at progressively longer times and may result in a false measurement of a propagating wave. To address this caveat, Muller et al. introduced the phase latency map (PLM) allowing them to discriminate between a stationary bump and a traveling wave and to conclude that propagating waves were measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muller et al., 2014</xref>). While PLM address this specific caveat, measured traveling wave-like patterns (WLPs), that are not underlined by spatially continuous propagation, can be found in additional scenarios. For example, it was recently shown that a mixture of stationary sources can result in WLPs in EEG recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhigalov and Jensen, 2023</xref>). Similarly, current source density reveals WLPs following sequential activation of different cortical lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Orczyk et al., 2021</xref>). These studies raise important concerns about the propagation profiles in some systems. Despite these concerns, the criteria for differentiating WLPs from traveling waves remains unknown. Further, evidence for the existence of WLPs on the single neuron level is missing. Thus, we lack a classification of different identified traveling waves in terms of their underlying microscale excitability patterns.</p><p>Here, we use large-scale spiking measurements and simulations to examine the possibility that sequential activation of adjacent modules can be falsely identified as a traveling wave. Specifically, we first illustrate, using EEG simulations, that sequentially activating two adjacent cortical areas results in phase latency profiles resembling traveling waves. To link single neurons activation profiles with field potentials, we utilize the ex vivo eye-brain preparation of turtle cortex in which traveling waves have been previously reported in response to visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Prechtl et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Senseman and Robbins, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shein-Idelson et al., 2017</xref>). Using dense multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings, we compare local spiking activity with local field potentials (LFP) over several mm<sup>2</sup> of cortex. We show that while low-frequency oscillations in LFP appear to propagate as a smooth traveling wave, the underlying spiking activity is better described by a sequential activation of separate cortical populations. Finally, using an analytical model, we map the conditions for identifying sequential stationary activations as traveling waves and describe the high diversity of resulting WLPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sequential activation of two discrete brain areas appears as traveling waves in simulated EEG PLM</title><p>Traveling waves are commonly reported in EEG recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muller et al., 2018</xref>) but the cortical activation profiles underlying these waves remain unclear.

Interestingly, we observed a continuous range of delays gradually increasing along the anterior-posterior axis. Thus, phase delays did not reflect the modular construction of two spatially restricted sources. Rather, continuous propagation was observed for both large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and small sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). A standard approach for quantifying the existence of traveling waves is computing phase latency distance correlation (PLDC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Muller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Muller and Destexhe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) which is the linear correlation between a defined phase crossing time (e.g. peak time) and the spatial location along the wave’s trajectory. Applying this calculation to the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> along the posterior-anterior axis resulted in a value of 0.98, indicative of wave propagation. We next examined if such WLPs are also detected if the distance between areas or the time delay between activations changes. Repeating the simulations for a range of distances and delays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) revealed high PLDC values in all distances which only slowly decay with time delay. Furthermore, filtering the measured EEG signals with a narrow-band filter (a common practice when analyzing specific oscillatory bands; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu, 2008</xref>) further increased PLDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). These results suggest that detection of WLPs following sequential activation of spatially localized modules is abundant across parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>WLPs in LFP are underlined by sequential activation of spatially discrete neuronal populations in MEA recordings from turtle cortex</title><p>Our next aim was to examine whether WLPs exist in cortical tissue.

The advantage of this preparation is that it allows large-scale two-dimensional (in directions tangential to the cortical surface) sampling of both spiking and LFP activity. Furthermore, previous works with this preparation have shown the existence of waves that travel across cortex following visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Prechtl et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Senseman and Robbins, 2002</xref>). Finally, while the layered organization of turtle cortex is different than that of mammalian cortex, the basic excitability features of both tissues are similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Connors and Kriegstein, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hemberger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kriegstein and Connors, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Larkum et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shein-Idelson et al., 2017</xref>), and substantial differences in the manner by which field potentials and spikes spread through the tissue are not to be expected.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sequential activation of discrete spiking populations underlies local field potential (LFP) waves in turtle cortex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the experimental setup.

Although responses varied in intensity between stimulations, they typically started ~200 ms post-stimulus and lasted for ~2 s. Spectral analysis revealed that responses were characterized by high power at low frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Specifically, applying a 2 Hz low-pass filter captured the strong fluctuations in LFP following visual stimulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> – blue trace). We next set to examine how this low-frequency band propagates across cortex. Averaging over all trials revealed a clear propagation pattern traveling from anterolateral to posteromedial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This pattern was consistent with previous reports of waves traveling from area D2 to area D1 in turtle cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Prechtl et al., 1997</xref>). To illustrate this propagation on the time domain, we plotted the first oscillation cycle of the filtered LFP (2 Hz low-pass, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> – red and blue dotted line) along a linear wave path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The maximum showed a clear propagation pattern with a velocity of 1.8±0.35 mm/s (mean ± sd).</p><p>To quantitatively estimate the propagation trajectories during single oscillations cycles, we used the analytic signal of the Hilbert transform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Le Van Quyen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rubino et al., 2006</xref>) (Methods). We first identified the <italic>π</italic>/2 phase crossing times of all oscillation cycles. We then grouped phase crossings into events belonging to single oscillation cycles based on continuity of phases across space and time (Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The first oscillation cycle showed a clear propagating wavefront, but more importantly, intense spiking activity. We therefore focused our analysis on this cycle and calculated its propagation direction. To do so, we defined the wave center path, as the weighted spatial center of mass of all the channels’ phase crossings for a given time point with weights given by the amplitude of the Hilbert envelope (Methods). Examining phase delays and the wave center path for a single trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) revealed a pattern that resembled the averaged propagation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) but varied between trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We next calculated the PLDC values for the first oscillation cycle in response to visual stimulation across all trials and plotted their distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> – blue). PLDC values were close to 1 suggesting the existence of propagating waves. For comparison, calculating PLDC after shuffling the channels’ phase latencies dramatically reduced PLDC to an average close to zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> – red).</p><p>To examine whether local spike dynamics propagated continuously across space as the LFP, we examined the timing of the first spikes (marking the onset of excitability) during the first oscillation cycle of the filtered LFP. Spikes were generally locked to the LFP oscillation with a peak spiking rate at a phase of 0.53<italic>π</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). To compare the spatiotemporal spiking patterns with the LFP patterns, we reordered the electrodes according to the <italic>π</italic>/2 Hilbert phase. As expected, phase gradually advanced across electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> – empty colored circles). In contrast, spiking activity was not continuous over space but clustered in discrete temporal bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> – black dots). To quantify this clustering in spike times, we assigned the neurons to channels according to their maximal amplitude channel and used the DIP test to quantify temporal statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hartigan and Hartigan, 2007</xref>). The DIP test measures the deviation of a distribution from unimodality and could well capture the differences in spike and LFP onsets. The LFP phase crossings were temporally continuous and therefore did not strongly deviate from a uniform distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> – top, p-value 0.85). In contrast, spike timings were segregated into temporal groups and were not unimodally distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> – bottom, p-value &lt;0.0002). We applied this test on the first oscillation cycles across trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Since not all channels had active spikes in all trials, we ran the DIP test (for both spikes and LFP) only on the subset of channels with spikes within each trial. The results showed a consistently larger DIP for spikes vs. LFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref> – red vs blue areas). This difference was not only significant on the average level but was also evident when comparing the p-value of pairwise differences calculated for each trial separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref> – gray area). Finally, repeating this analysis for recordings in other animals reveals consistent results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>), indicating that while LFP activity along the wave path resembles a continuously propagating wave, the spiking activity – a marker of local excitability – is more consistent with sequentially activated spatially segregated modules.</p><p>The above analysis was limited to the subset of channels with spikes within the first cycle in every trial. To examine propagation wavefronts across a larger fraction of channels, we constructed a more robust estimate of local spiking excitability. Specifically, we calculated the average local spiking activity (ALSA), which is the weighted average of each channel’s spiking rate with its nearest neighbors’ spiking rates (Methods). The spiking onset time for each channel was defined as the time of the first maximum of the ALSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> – red curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> – red dots). Since many neurons did not exhibit spiking activity during the wave onset (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> illustrates how for some channels, the first spikes in a cycle occur long after the activation has reached nearby channels), this measure allows estimating the wavefront propagation across many channels. Correspondingly, the ALSA phase distribution resembled that obtained with single spikes but was more sharply locked to the LFP oscillation phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Comparing ALSA with LFP revealed stronger differences between spikes and LFP. In contrast to the LFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A–C</xref>), the ALSA onset times did not evolve continuously across space but were organized in two separate and sequentially activated spatial groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4D–F</xref>). Comparing the DIP test for LFP and ALSA revealed a consistent difference across trials in both the average DIP values and the difference in single trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>) that replicated over experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>). We note that we focused the above analysis on waves in the low-frequency LFP band (0–2 Hz) because these events recruited enough spikes to analyze their phase relations. However, propagating patterns were also detected in other frequency bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>) and showed complex patterns including plane waves, radial waves, and spiral waves.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A simple analytic model of sequentially activated Gaussians exhibits diverse WLPs</title><p>We wanted to examine whether we can capture the basic activity properties following the sequential activation of two discrete regions, using a simple analytical model.

Thus, the peak can travel either forward or backward following small changes in phase delays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Second, the position of the peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), and therefore the propagation speed (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref>), increases with the oscillation frequency.</p><p>The spatial activation spread (<italic>σ<sub>x</sub></italic>) of a cortical module can result from the measurement techniques (due to passive conductance) but also from the spatial organization of inputs and outputs patterns and their associated synaptic currents. We hypothesized that changing these patterns can produce different PLM. We therefore extended the periodic model in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref> to two dimensions (Appendix 1) and to Gaussians with different shapes (different covariance functions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). When sequentially activated Gaussians had been placed one next to the other (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msqrt><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) their propagation patterns and PLM resembled a plane wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> – top). When Gaussians overlap spatially, with the first Gaussian having a smaller <italic>σ</italic>, their sequential activation resembled a radial wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> –middle). Interestingly, calculating PLDC, which was developed to discriminate between a radial wave and a bump with increasing amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Muller and Destexhe, 2012</xref>), resulted in a value of 0.92, indicative of a traveling wave. Finally, by positioning two Gaussians with one longer axis such that their major axes are perpendicular to one another, a pattern with features of a spiral-like wave was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> – bottom). These examples illustrate that using a combination of only two sequentially activated Gaussians, a wide range of phase latency profiles corresponding to plane, radial, and spiral-like waves could be generated. We note that while we used simple activation profiles, spatial modules in brains (e.g. cortical columns or spatially localized projection patterns) can be more diverse and potentially facilitate a large repertoire of phase latency patterns which, despite being seemingly discrete, might be classified as traveling waves.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work we investigated the link between electrophysiological measurements of traveling waves and their underlying neuronal activations. To do so, we used common approaches for detecting traveling waves in neural data at different scales and contrasted these results with ground truth neural excitability. We showed that LFP measurements indicative of waves propagating across turtle cortex are underlined by discrete and consecutively activated neuronal populations, and not by a continuously propagating wavefront of spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Similarly, activation profiles that resemble continuous traveling waves in EEG simulations can be underlined by consecutive activation of two discrete cortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We replicated these results using an analytical model and demonstrated that a simple scenario of sequentially activated Gaussians can exhibit WLPs with a rich diversity of spatiotemporal profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Our results offer insight into the scenarios and conditions for WLP detection by detecting failure points that should be considered when identifying traveling waves and therefore suggest caution when interpreting continuous PLM as microscopically propagating wave patterns. Such failure points may exist both when examining activity at the scale of brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and smaller neural circuits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that the discrepancy between modular and wave activation should be examined across spatial scales. Specifically, it is not necessarily the case that at the fine-grained (single neuron) scale activation patterns are modular, but, following coarse graining, smooth wave patterns emerge. Rather, modular activation may hierarchically exist across scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaiser and Hilgetag, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meunier et al., 2010</xref>) and may be masked by smeared spatial supra-threshold excitability boundaries. Below, we discuss these limitations across techniques and their implications.</p><p>Our analytical results suggest that the main parameter affecting the detection of WLPs in a sequentially activated modular system is the distance between modules relative to their spatial spread. In contrast to the distance between modules, the spatial spread can be strongly affected by the experimental approach used for measurements. For potential-based measurements, the spread will markedly increase with medium conductance and distance from the source, as predicted from the volume conductance theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki et al., 2012</xref>). Our simulations show that spatial spread will be large in EEG measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) where the distance between the sources and the electrodes is large, and the skull and meninges disperse the electrical field generated by localized cortical currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akalin Acar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kajikawa and Schroeder, 2011</xref>). Dispersion can also be substantial in intracranial measurements such as ECoG due to the high conductivity of the cerebrospinal fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herreras, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, large spread was also observed in our MEA LFP recordings, where no meninges separate between the electrodes and tissue. Further, the small distance between the tissue and the electrodes limits conductance through the artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Despite this, propagation appeared spatially continuous in LFP, suggesting contributions from volume conduction through the tissue and non-local current sources, for example, activated synaptic terminals from axons of distant neurons. This spread is aligned with theoretical studies calculating spatial decay constants of hundreds of micrometers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lindén et al., 2010</xref>) and with experiments reporting contributions from sources millimeters away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kajikawa and Schroeder, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Traveling waves were also measured using VSD imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Senseman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Slovin et al., 2002</xref>), a method that does not suffer from passive electric field spread as it measures transmembrane potentials. However, light scatters in optical signals, especially in wide-field imaging. More importantly, VSD measurements report subthreshold potentials integrating excitability from large areas due to synaptic currents originating from long-distance neurons in addition to local ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chemla and Chavane, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Petersen et al., 2003</xref>). Correspondingly, deflection of a single whisker results in cortical activation that extends beyond the corresponding barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferezou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Petersen et al., 2003</xref>). From measuring VSD alone, it is unclear which component of this extended signal reflects supra-threshold activation. If supra-threshold activity is mostly restricted to the barrel and the extended spread mostly reflects sub-threshold activity, sequentially activating two nearby whiskers will result in WLPs. Similarly, sequential activation of two areas in visual space can appear to elicit a wave in the visual cortex, as observed for anesthetized cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jancke et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Increased spatial spread and WLP may not only result from non-local measurement but also from data analysis. For EEG specifically, amplitudes are relatively small, and consequently, waves are often reported using averaged data. In combination with the inherent variability in neuronal signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox et al., 2006</xref>), averaging may smooth the boundaries between modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mouraux and Iannetti, 2008</xref>), effectively increase the spatial spread, and therefore promote the identification of WLPs. Such a spread may explain the smoother LFP profiles after averaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) relative to single trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G, I</xref>) in turtle cortex.</p><p>In addition to spatial factors, temporal factors and filtering may promote WLPs. Our analytical results suggest that a single maximum will emerge when sequentially activated Gaussians considerably overlap in time (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msqrt><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>). Thus, discriminability between Gaussian activations will decrease with increase in <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>, for example, following filtering. Indeed, filtering into narrow frequency bands is a common practice in EEG research and is liable to smoothen sharp transients. Correspondingly, our EEG simulations indicate that filtering markedly increased PLDC by effectively smoothing the activation boundaries between modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). We note that the detection of WLPs is not restricted to specific frequency bands; our simulation and analytic results are not band dependent. Our turtle data also contained waves in other bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). The low spike rates in our preparation prevented us from performing a significant statistical analysis to compare these waves with underlying spiking patterns. Such examinations will be critical for understanding the propagation patterns of spikes during waves across multiple frequency bands. To do so, spatial characterization of single trials dynamics, rather than calculating average spiking locking across space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ray and Maunsell, 2011</xref>), will be required.</p><p>Analysis techniques can potentially resolve the discrepancy between waves and modular activation for different levels of granularity. PLMs and PLDC analysis are valuable steps toward differentiating between single stationary bumps and traveling waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muller et al., 2014</xref>) and continue to be used to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Muller et al., 2016</xref>). The underlying assumption behind this approach is that a stationary bump is characterized by a flat latency map because every channel reaches its maximum at the same time, rather than the latency increasing in a particular direction, in case of a wave. However, this approach does not consider the possibility of sequentially activated local populations. Indeed, our results show how activity profiles resulting from two sequentially activated Gaussians meet the phase latency conditions for waves. Developing good methods for separating traveling waves from WLPs will require validating these methods using experimental paradigms providing information about spiking activity across space. In addition, more frequent usage of available techniques to decrease the spread of signals and increase localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babiloni et al., 1996</xref>) will increase the separability between waves and modular activation.</p><p>Our results can explain some of the reported variability in traveling propagation directions and velocities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muller et al., 2018</xref>). We showed that the propagation direction of WLPs is determined by the location of sequentially activated modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and the propagation speed of WLPs by the distance between modules and their temporal delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>). In addition, when calculating propagation speeds for narrow-band signals, velocities increase with frequency band and may even reverse direction as a function of the phase lag between oscillatory areas (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>). These results are interesting given that cortical waves in the same tissue can propagate both in forward and backward directions and that higher frequencies propagate faster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bahramisharif et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Halgren et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Variability in propagation speed could also be detected when examining single oscillations in our turtle recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). The above results echo findings in a recent study showing that cortical responses to similar stimuli vary in propagation profile for EEG and MEG recordings and that this discrepancy can be accounted by modeling sequentially activated sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lozano-Soldevilla and VanRullen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhigalov and Jensen, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Variability in responses may also be explained by differences in propagation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ermentrout and Kleinfeld, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu, 2008</xref>). Several reports suggest that waves are underlined by propagation along axonal collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muller et al., 2014</xref>). Both the transmembrane voltage-gated currents excited during action potentials as well as the post-synaptic currents along axonal boutons can potentially contribute to measured signals. However, such waves travel at high propagation speeds and are not compatible with the wide diversity of wave velocities and mechanisms of local neuronal interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ermentrout and Kleinfeld, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feller et al., 1996</xref>). An intriguing possibility is that such axonal waves prime neuronal excitability by sub-threshold inputs that later result in modular supra-threshold activation. The ability to experimentally discriminate between axonal inputs and local spiking excitability (e.g. by reporters with different wavelengths) can potentially resolve such discrepancies.</p><p>Our turtle cortex results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) exemplify how contrasting sub-threshold LFP measurements with supra-threshold spiking measurements can yield different conclusions about the nature of activity spread. Specifically, measuring spiking activity revealed the segregation of turtle cortex into modules. While modularity in turtle cortex connectivity structure was not systematically mapped, the temporal grouping of spike timings across two regions of turtle cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) is spatially aligned with a structural transition between areas D1 and D2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Desan, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Prechtl et al., 1997</xref>). This transition was not evident in the LFPs, possibly due to the longer decay constants of slow potentials and the existing connection between D2 and D1. Such connections elicit sub-threshold synaptic currents following D2 activations which can further contribute to LFP spread. The transition was also not clear when examining spiking responses in some of the trials (as indicated by high DIP scores, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). However, the observation that temporal grouping became more pronounced when using ALSA (a more robust estimate of local excitability) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L and N</xref>) suggests that high DIP values may result from variability in the spike times of single neurons, and not necessarily from the lack of modular activation. Such issues can be resolved by denser sampling of spiking activity in the tissue.</p><p>Similarly, sequentially activating adjacent cortical regions, which are functionally correlated and structurally connected (e.g. as activity travels across visual regions from V1 to V4), may be activated in a modular fashion but identified as traveling in VSD signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2021</xref>) due to mesoscale connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yan et al., 2022</xref>). Such modularity would be harder to detect for fast waves (in contrast to the slow waves in turtle cortex). Monitoring wave dynamics at a single cell resolution across connectivity boundaries (e.g. across two adjacent cortical regions or column) will be instrumental in identifying the granularity of propagating patterns in other cortical regions.</p><p>The above discussion calls for a better classification of dynamical phenomena into supra-threshold wave or modular excitability. In some neural systems, wave activity patterns clearly dominate. A prominent example is developing systems. Measurements from retinas ex vivo were performed across large areas with single cell resolution using both calcium imaging and dense electrode arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Newman and Zahs, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Voufo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>). In such measurements, spatially adjacent neurons were shown to be activated sequentially in two-dimensional spreading patterns. Traveling waves were also detected in developing cortex, thalamus, and other brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanganu et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, in mature circuits, and specifically in cortex, connectivity and possibly excitability profiles are replaced by modules and by segregated excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaiser and Hilgetag, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meunier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mountcastle, 1997</xref>). Functional modular organization may result from control of neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaiser and Hilgetag, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shein-Idelson et al., 2016</xref>) in combination with modular connectivity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meunier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mountcastle, 1997</xref>). Accordingly, traveling waves may dominate in specific conditions of reduced consciousness such as anesthesia or sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Massimini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, waves are also reported under pathological conditions such as epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">van den Berg et al., 2012</xref>). In such states, inhibition in the network is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sloviter, 1987</xref>) which may lead to a replacement of modular segregated activation by large-scale propagation of excitability crossing modular boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shein-Idelson et al., 2016</xref>). The abundance of traveling waves suggests that they are important components of the repertoire of neural network activity patterns. However, clear evidence for waves in some systems, for example during development, does not imply their existence in other systems. Indeed, wave propagation patterns on the single cell level are only scarcely reported during wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>) leaving the microscopic correlates of most traveling wave unknown.</p><p>A promising technique for mapping the dynamics of microscopic local excitability is calcium imaging. The data provided by this method supports both localized sequential activations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nietz et al., 2023</xref>) and traveling motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afrashteh et al., 2017</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, no analysis was performed to discriminate between waves and sequentially activated sources and sinks. In addition, the temporal resolution of calcium imaging is low, making it hard to detect temporal boundaries, especially for fast oscillating waves (e.g. in the γ-range). Further, wide point spread functions, axonal projections, or sparse activation of adjacent populations may mask circuit modularity and promote wave detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ali and Kwan, 2020</xref>). On the other hand, the advancement of fast imaging techniques and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>) in combination with cell-body-targeted calcium indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shemesh et al., 2020</xref>) and high optical sectioning methods chart a promising direction for systematic investigations into the granularity of propagating patterns in the brain. Such measurements together with new analysis approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afrashteh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chemla et al., 2017</xref>) will be required to disambiguate traveling waves from WLPs. Understanding the degree and the scale of functional modular organization in the brain will be important in revealing the true nature of cortical dynamics and its contribution to neural computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pang et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Eye-brain preparation and recording</title><p>Ex vivo experiments were performed as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shein-Idelson et al., 2017</xref>, at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt and Tel Aviv University. Briefly, the brain of adult <italic>Trachemys scripta elegans</italic> turtles was explanted as a whole, while still attached to the eye through the optic nerve. After anterior and posterior transverse incisions, the three-layered medial and dorsal cortices, which overlay the ventricular cavity directly, were flattened and placed on top of a MEA ventricular side down (with L3 facing the MEA). 120- or 252-channel systems (MEA2100, MEA256 by Multichannel Systems, MCS) were used for recording with titanium nitrate electrode grids with 100 μm spacing and 30 μm electrode diameter (120MEA100/30iR-ITO, 256MEA100/30iR-ITO, MCS). During experiments, the tissue was constantly superfused at 10 ml/min with oxygenated turtle ACSF solution (96.5 mM NaCl, 2.6 mM KCl, 4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 31.5 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 mM glucose, pH 7.4) at 18°C which was bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Glutamine (0.5 mM) and HEPES (10 mM, H3375 Sigma) were added for increased retinal viability. Experiments were approved by Tel Aviv University ethical committee (Approval number: 04-18-016). Experiments and analysis were performed until further analysis yielded no new knowledge.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Visual stimulation</title><p>The eye cup was pinned to a polydimethylsiloxane layer inside a MEA well. The visual stimulation was displayed on the screen, its size was reduced using an inverted Galilean telescope, and it was focused onto the retina using a convex lens. The stimulation position and focus on the retina were adjusted using a set of four LEDs positioned at the edges of the screen and visible on the retina. These LEDs were turned off during the experiment. Stimulations were presented using a custom MATLAB code and the psychophysics toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brainard, 1997</xref>). Stimulations consisted of sequentially presented full field flashes, squares flashing on the screen, natural images, or natural movies. In all stimulation, onset elicited a cortical response. Exact visual stimulation times were determined by changing the intensity of a small rectangle at the corner of the screen for every frame change and measuring this change using a photodiode.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Spectral analysis</title><p>Spectral analysis was performed using Welch’s method (<italic>pWelch</italic>, MATLAB).

The signal’s envelope was extracted from the norm of the analytic signal. The instantaneous phase was used to determine the oscillation’s phase crossing events from the time the analytic’s angle crosses a specific phase. To remove noise from phase crossing statistics, we assessed the noise level of the phase crossings. We calculated the distribution of pre-stimulus (500–1000 ms) phase crossings’ amplitude of 100 random trials. Phase crossings with amplitudes lower than mean+4sd of this distribution were ignored.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Wave detection</title><p>Phase crossings during single oscillation cycles were grouped into waves using an algorithm which identified the progression of a given phase crossing across multiple channels. We start by selecting a seed, which is a specific phase crossing event in one channel. We next go through all nearest neighboring channels. If phase crossings within a 100 ms (for 0–2 Hz band or 2 ms for 12–35 Hz band) temporal window are detected, the channel is added to the wave. This process is repeated for the added channels until no more spatiotemporally connected phase crossings are found. Only phase crossing events with Hilbert amplitudes above noise level were considered. ALSA analysis was focused on large waves recruiting many channels (2/3 for 0–2 Hz band and 5/6 for 12–35 Hz band). For first spike analysis, due to data sparseness, waves recruiting &gt;30 channels were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>PLM and correlations</title><p>Maps were calculated similarly to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Muller and Destexhe, 2012</xref>. The phase latency for each channel was defined as the time to reach a specific instantaneous phase for the ex vivo experiment, or to the first maximum for the EEG simulations. When maps were calculated on single detected waves, and a given channel had more than one phase crossing in a single cluster, only the first phase crossing was used for the latency analysis. The PLDCs for the ex vivo preparation were calculated by first calculating the Euclidean distance of all electrodes from the wave starting point (the position of the first electrode having a phase crossing in the given wave) and calculating their Pearson correlation coefficient with the phase latencies. The PLDC for the EEG simulations were taken to be the correlation of the phase latencies with the electrodes’ positions on the caudal-rostral axis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Wave center path</title><p>WCP was calculated from the time-weighted ‘center of mass’ position on the electrode array for every time sample starting and ending in the first and last phase crossing, respectively.

Electrical field and consequent EEG recordings flowing defined activation profiles were simulated based on a human anatomical MRI scan. Activity sources were synchronized groups of dipoles located at the cortex surface and oriented normally to it. These grouped dipoles (red and blue dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) are called scouts in the Brainstorm jargon and were manually marked on the cortical surface using the Brainstorm GUI. Each scout is comprised of 160 adjacent dipoles and has an average area of 27 cm<sup>2</sup> (20 dipoles of area 0.187 cm<sup>2</sup> for small scouts). In each simulation, two scouts were activated with the same temporal Gaussian function (amplitude 1; standard deviation [sd] 0.2 s). This Gaussian was repeated consecutively five times with a period of 8sd, simulating activity for 580 ms (5800 samples; 10 kHz sampling rate). To simulate activation lags between modules (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the temporal mean of one of the scouts was shifted by 0.2sd in every independent simulation, resulting with temporal differences ranging from 0.2sd to 2sd. In the same fashion, we repeated the simulation for varying spatial distance between the scout’s centers (along the posterior-anterior axis) divided by the standard deviation. The distances were the Euclidean distance between the scouts’ centers (mean position of each scouts’ dipoles), and the standard deviation was calculated along the posterior-anterior axis for each scout (the mean of the two scouts was taken as the final value). In Brainstorm we used the default MRI anatomy (ICBM_152), with 15,002 vertices (or 306,716 for small scouts) and the ‘ICBM152’ -&gt; ‘ACA 10-05 343’ EEG headset device (with 343 electrodes). We only analyzed the activity of the top 63 electrodes (35 for small scouts) at the vicinity of the sources. In the small scouts simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), we duplicated the sources such that they are symmetric across the two hemispheres.

It takes a while until the (in my opinion) more intriguing experimental results.</p></disp-quote><p>To emphasize the experimental results, we switched between the analytical results and the experimental results. Correspondingly, figure 2 now illustrates the more intriguing experimental results and figure 3 the analytical results. In addition, we added subtitles to the different sections of the results to ease the navigation through the paper and to enable the readers to access the different sections more easily.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of the key claims is that the spikes are more consistent with two sequentially activated modules rather than a continuous wave (with Fig 3k and 3l key to support this). Whilst this is <italic>more</italic> consistent, it is worth mentioning that there seems to be stochasticity to this and between-trial variability, especially for spikes.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we added the reviewer’s comment about stochasticity, and we discuss its possible origins:</p><p>&quot;The transition was also not clear when examining spiking responses in some of the trials (as indicated by high DIP scores, Figure 2K). However, the observation that temporal grouping became more pronounced when using ALSA (a more robust estimate of local excitability) (Figure 2L,N), suggests that high DIP values may result from variability in the spike times of single neurons, and not necessarily from the lack of modular activation. Such issues can be resolved by denser sampling of spiking activity in the tissue.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p><p>The eye-cortex turtle preparation is not the most common. I would add more context about how specific the results are to this preparation vs how comparable it is to human data.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a sentence explaining the relevance of our preparation: “Finally, while the layered organization of turtle cortex is different than that of mammalian cortex, the basic excitability features of both tissues are similar (Connors and Kriegstein, 1986; Hemberger et al., 2019; Kriegstein and Connors, 1986; Larkum et al., 2008; Shein-Idelson et al., 2017b), and substantial differences in the manner by which field potentials and spikes spread through the tissue are not to be expected.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Philosophical question: when does a 'module' become small enough for it to count as a travelling wave? More on this could be added to the discussion. I think we are in the very early days for a true understanding of travelling waves, and I wonder if these sequentially activated modules will functionally correspond to the known cortical segregation, or if it varies by area/task.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that macroscopic waves could be composed of smaller modules (or single neurons at the smallest scale). Our results suggest that modular patterns can be classified as wave patterns both at large scales (of brain areas) and smaller scales of local neural circuits. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to make this distinction across different scales. We sharpened this point in the first paragraph of the discussion:</p><p>&quot;…We showed that LFP measurements indicative of waves propagating across turtle cortex are underlined by discrete and consecutively activated neuronal populations, and not by a continuously propagating wavefront of spikes (Figure 2). Similarly, activation profiles that resemble continuous travelling waves in EEG simulations can be underlined by consecutive activation of two discrete cortical regions (Figure 1). We replicated these results using an analytical model and demonstrated that a simple scenario of sequentially activated Gaussians can exhibit WLPs with a rich diversity of spatiotemporal profiles (Figure 3). Our results offer insight into the scenarios and conditions for WLP detection by identifying failure points that should be considered when identifying travelling waves and therefore suggest caution when interpreting continuous phase latency maps as microscopically propagating wave patterns. Such failure points may exist both when examining activity at the scale of brain regions (Figure 1) and smaller neural circuits (Figure 2). Therefore, our results suggest that the discrepancy between modular and wave activation should be examined across spatial scales. Specifically, it is not necessarily the case that at the fine grained (single neuron) scale activation patterns are modular, but, following coarse graining, smooth wave patterns emerge. Rather, modular activation may hierarchically exist across scales (Kaiser and Hilgetag, 2010; Meunier et al., 2010) and may be masked by smeared spatial supra-threshold excitability boundaries. Below we discuss these limitations across techniques and their implications.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would advise the authors to focus on the experimental data, perhaps by putting the simulations second, and by putting some of the equation details that are in Methods into the Supplementary Information. Whilst the simulation parameter space is well-explored, the fundamental idea of spreading Gaussians is relatively simple, and the current manuscript organization detracted from the main message for me a little bit.”</p></disp-quote><p>Following the referee’s suggestion, we switched between the section with experimental data and the one with the analytic model (see response to comment 1). In addition, to ease the reading of the methods, we moved the mathematical derivation and related equations to appendix 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Things I thought about that you may also enjoy thinking about:Could we tell something about sequential sources vs travelling waves by the nature of the wave - e.g. shape or dispersion? If some wave properties are conserved whilst travelling, this could be evidence for travelling vs two sources.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a wonderful suggestion. We are currently working on a follow up publication with a new approach to do exactly that! We think that this new body of work is outside the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could synaptic potentials spread like waves, but spikes more in modular bursts? This would also explain the LFP vs spikes difference - maybe travelling waves of EPSPs are there priming the network, 'looking' for suitable modules to activate, which then activate sequentially. The current discussion is quite spike-focused - could some information be in synaptic potentials after all?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting idea with intriguing functional implications. We added this idea to our discussion (see paragraph below). In addition, to emphasize our discussion on synaptic potentials, we reorganized the paragraphs in the discussion to separate between our discussion on sub-threshold excitability (which is mostly synaptic) and supra-threshold excitability which is the focus of the second part of the discussion.</p><p>“Variability in responses may also be explained by differences in propagation mechanisms (Ermentrout and Kleinfeld, 2001; Muller et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2008). Several reports suggest that waves are underlined by propagation along axonal collaterals (Muller et al., 2018, 2014). Both the transmembrane voltage-gated currents excited during action potentials as well as the post-synaptic currents along axonal boutons can potentially contribute to measured signals. However, such waves travel at high propagation speeds and are not compatible with the wide diversity of wave velocities and mechanisms of local neuronal interactions (Ermentrout and Kleinfeld, 2001; Feller et al., 1996). An intriguing possibility is that such axonal waves prime neuronal excitability by sub-threshold inputs that later result in modular supra-threshold activation. The ability to experimentally discriminate between axonal inputs and local spiking excitability (e.g. by reporters with different wavelengths) can potentially resolve such discrepancies.</p><p>Our turtle cortex results (Figure 2) exemplify how contrasting sub-threshold LFP measurements with supra-threshold spiking measurements can yield different conclusions about the nature of activity spread….”</p></body></sub-article></article>
