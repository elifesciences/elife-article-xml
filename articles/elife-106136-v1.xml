The advisory committee conveyed to NIH a mission concept in the Brain 2025: A scientific Vision with seven priority areas: (1) Discovering Diversity, (2). Maps at Multiple Scales, (3) The Brain in Action, (4) Demonstrating Causality, (5) Identifying Fundamental Principles, (6) Advance Human Neuroscience, (7) From the BRAIN Initiative to the Brain. A special Congressional appropriation for the BRAIN Initiative provided funds to execute these priorities and allowed the BRAIN Initiative to focus on progressive and adventurous projects and programs outside of standard NIH Institute/Center (IC) constraints, and across IC missions.</p><p>The core philosophy of the BRAIN Initiative is to understand the brain as a complex system that gives rise to the diversity of functions that allow us to interact with, and adapt to, our physical and social environments. Such an understanding is necessary to promote brain health and to prevent and treat neurobehavioral and neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Miller et al., 2024</xref>). Like any complex system, one must understand how the brain works in order to know how to fix it when it dysfunctions. All brain disorders, including neurological, mental, and behavioral conditions, manifest as system dysfunctions that must be understood as such for effective therapeutic cures and prevention. Thus, the NIH BRAIN Initiative has created a unique synergy with its partner NIH ICs that dramatically advances basic research on brain function, complementing the mission interests of the ICs in preventing and treating specific diseases.</p><p>Under the guidance of the Directors of 10 NIH ‘neuro’ ICs, Scientific Program Directors and Specialists with expertise in various approaches that matched the advisory committee guidance convened to interpret and implement the mission concepts of the BRAIN 2025 report. The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/research/systems-neuroscience/">systems neuroscience program</ext-link>– after splitting from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/research/neural-recording-and-modulation">technology development component</ext-link> in FY2015 – was charged with implementing the investigative, functional neuroscience of the mission directives, spanning all seven priority areas, as noted above. Noninvasive approaches in functional human neuroscience were pursued as a separate track focused on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://braininitiative.nih.gov/research/neuroimaging-technologies-across-scales">neuroimaging technologies across scales</ext-link>.</p><p>The Integrative and Quantitative Approaches Team was convened to design funding programs that would address mechanisms of how the nervous system works as an integrated system. Strategically, this fundamental, systems neuroscience funding component focused on combining in vivo behavior, dynamic neural systems, and computational neuroscience approaches (BRAIN 2025), an operational definition of systems neuroscience that overlaps substantially with a newly proposed concept of ‘heksor’ (<italic>“... a widely distributed network of neurons and synapses that produces an adaptive behavior and changes itself as needed in order to maintain the key features of the behavior, the attributes that make the behavior satisfactory”</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Wolpaw and Kamesar, 2022</xref>). Since most functional systems of the nervous system are mediated by dynamic neural circuits, this component of the BRAIN Initiative is sometimes referred to as the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/research/systems-neuroscience/understanding-circuits-program">‘BRAIN Circuits Program’</ext-link>. However, flexibility was built into the funding programs to encourage understanding of non-neuronal systems' influence on dynamic circuits and to allow studies of in vivo ‘behavior’ of well-defined neural systems within the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The NIH BRAIN Circuit Programs</title><p>From the beginning, this functional neuroscience approach adopted a set of guiding scientific principles that defined the priorities and context for developing the content of the ‘circuit-busting’ funding announcements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">David et al., 2020</xref>). Based on these principles, the BRAIN Circuits Program created an ecosystem of funding mechanisms illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. The general format of this integrated approaches program has been to have 2/3-year exploratory forms of funding, followed by a peer-reviewed opportunity to compete for an expanded 5-year award, in each emphasis area. Note that the exploratory projects are not a requirement of the expanded awards but offer an enabling, or pilot, step where useful. Research topics were prioritized to be investigator-initiated concepts in fundamental systems neuroscience in three major research tracks: (1) targeted, single-lab-sized or limited multi-PI research proposals, (2) team-research approaches that could only be successful as integrated approaches across biological scales, disciplines, and/or species, (3) human-neuroscience research opportunities afforded by direct, intracranial access to recording and manipulating in the human brain. This format emphasizes peer-reviewed, investigator-initiated selection of scientific merit.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ecosystem of funding mechanisms, awards, and expenditures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ecosystem of funding mechanisms.

The spectrum of specific research topics can be mined from the award links provided below. The funding mechanisms, number of awards, and total committed budget through 2023, per funding announcement (Request for Application [RFA]), are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Description of funding mechanisms in this table and discussed in this report can be found on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://grants.nih.gov/funding/activity-codes">NIH Grants &amp; Funding website</ext-link>. This total 10-year expenditure in quantitative systems neuroscience has invested approximately $1B into fundamental neuroscience research. Note that, as directed by the BRAIN 2025 report, the BRAIN Circuits Program balanced funding between small-lab and collective team-research in the Targeted and Team track at $384M vs. $403M, respectively. The human Research Opportunities in Humans (ROH) program composed about 10% of the total budget at $100M.</p><p>As part of the functional neuroscience approach, there was also a strong desire to promote better developed theories into fundamental systems neuroscience. Taking into account that all the BRAIN Circuits Program funding mechanisms were required to include quantitative methods and to not replicate or compete with the highly successful NSF/NIH <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/crcns-collaborative-research-computational-neuroscience">Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience</ext-link>, we crafted a ‘tool building’ program in computational neuroscience with an emphasis to develop and disseminate computational tools in the form of novel Theories, mechanistic Models, or mathematical Methods (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.imagwiki.nibib.nih.gov/working-groups/brain-initiative-theories-models-and-methods">TMM</ext-link>, 3-year award). Parameters built into the program as requirements included (1) end user evaluation of the proposed tools, (2) experimental studies limited to model parameter estimation and/or validity testing of the tools being delivered. In order to focus the applications on mechanistic understanding at the level of dynamic circuits, after the first cycle of applications, an additional condition specified that products of the research must include knowledge at cellular and sub-second temporal resolution. The TMM 10-year award commitment to computational NS was 7% of the total expenditures at $65M.</p><p>The popularity of the top tool products can be quantified by GitHub stars, which indicate that a user likes or finds a software tool useful. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2A</xref> lists the top TMM awards, categorized as either a Theory, Model, or Method, that have the most repositories. Topics with high popularity include calcium imaging methods, multiple encoding/decoding tools, multiple model-building exercises, and sophisticated statistical methods. The popularity of the top repositories from the TMM program can be quantified by GitHub stars and watchers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref>). These two metrics can be reflective of active repository developers and contributors, which include multiple calcium imaging codes and a matrix factorization tool for imaging analysis.</p><p>In the interest of improving measures of high-content, high-temporal resolution of behavior to match that available for neural activity, a novel research track in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/research/systems-neuroscience/brain-behavior-quantification-and-synchronization-program">Basic Behavioral Quantification and Synchronization</ext-link> (BBQS) was initiated in FY2023. There are staged funding tracts specifically for human behavior and for organismal behavior. The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-26-100.html">human clinical tract</ext-link> employs an administrative review for progression from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-26-100.html">early to elaborated stages</ext-link>. Whereas, the organismal tract employs a peer-reviewed progression from a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DA-23-030.html">2 year enabling stage</ext-link> to elaborated 5-year stages for <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DA-24-041.html">non-human</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DA-24-040.html">comparative human/non-human studies</ext-link>. These programs are expected to better develop and engage dynamic behavioral and environmental assays integrated with dynamic measure of the neural systems of study. As a newly launched funding program, it is now premature to assess overall impacts for these programs in this report.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>10-Year impact evaluation</title><p>Now 10 years since conceiving this landmark initiative to better understand how the brain works, this report analyzes the impact of this functional neuroscience ecosystem as funding experiments in the domains of systems and integrative neuroscience, and computational neuroscience, with an eye on comparison with other funding models and best practices for how best to support fundamental, investigative neuroscience.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the annual NIH research investments committed in investigative neuroscience by year for the 10 years before and after the launch of the BRAIN Initiative. Using the NIH RCDC Terms coding (Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization), which is a computerized reporting system that categorizes grants into public spending areas, we found that ‘Neurosciences Research’ best captured the BRAIN Circuits Program circuit-based research approaches with few false negatives. Thus, we curated a timeline of NIH baseline funding of neuroscience research similar to the BRAIN Circuits Program portfolio using the RCDC terms of the NIH RePORTER knowledge base for ‘Neurosciences Research’ [OR] ‘Computational Neuroscience’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/5rxkohS2ZUi-DIb0tzVgoQ/projects?shared=true">Sys&amp;CompNS2004_2009</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/Ouubno-daECmomDDo6wv5w/projects?shared=true">Sys&amp;CompNS2010_2015</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/OKJm0ntE902nVdSyyPmsxA/projects?shared=true">Sys&amp;CompNS2016_2019</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/HlMLyjmOGUCSn-n2t2pltQ/projects?shared=true">Sys&amp;CompNS2020_2023</ext-link>, due to volume limitations of RePORTER the download is offered as four downloads by date ranges), excluding BRAIN Initiative awards. In order to compare this comprehensive list of NIH awards that includes clinical trials and other nonstandard funding mechanisms to the investigative, fundamental systems and computational neuroscience represented in the BRAIN Circuits Program, the download list was curated to match the NIH funding mechanisms of the BRAIN Circuits portfolio (see METHODOLOGY). We note here that this curated list does include cellular/molecular/developmental neuroscience and disease-specific, basic research, whereas the BRAIN Circuits Program is explicitly disease-agnostic, systems neuroscience. This annualized baseline was tabulated from sums of Awarded Total Costs by fiscal year, and the awards were committed using annual appropriations that include new and competing renewal awards and noncompeting renewals. Unawarded commitments to pending out-years of funding are not included.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>NIH expenditures in systems and computational neuroscience for 10 years before and after launch of the BRAIN Initiative.</title><p>Baseline is calculated from NIH RCDC (Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization) search of ‘neurosciences research’ [OR] ‘computational neuroscience’ (Sys &amp; Comp NS), excluding BRAIN Awards. BRAIN Initiative awards are tallied as all Sys &amp; Comp NS within BRAIN and all awards within the BRAIN Circuits funding announcements.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-106136-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Similarly, all BRAIN Initiative awards by year in this categorization, and those issued specifically within the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/kWTdwqntrUCAJTKCI_7lHQ/projects">BRAIN Circuits Program</ext-link>, are plotted separately from selection by funding announcements (see METHODOLOGY). The Total Systems and Computational Neuroscience curve is the sum of the neuroscience baseline plus the BRAIN expenditures by year. To manage annual BRAIN expenditures within annualized budget allocations, many of the BRAIN awards were issued as multi-year funding where years 1–3 are funded in the initial award year (including the 3-year TMM) and years 4–5 are awarded after an administrative review. The BRAIN curves rise for fiscal years 2014–2020, including both standard annual awards plus the multi-year budgets for 3 years, and flatten for fiscal years 2021–2023 due to unawarded, noncompeting continuations.</p><p>While the NIH baseline funding in this definition of neuroscience research grows relatively steadily by an average of 4.2% per year, the investments from the BRAIN Circuits Program climb by an additional average of 12.5% per year. This creates a more than fourfold accumulation of investment. Since the NIH baseline includes both basic and disease-centered research and neuroscience research outside the heksor concept, the BRAIN Circuits Program increment in funding for basic, disease-agnostic discovery in systems and computational neuroscience is substantially higher than 4×.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> reports bibliometric productivity measures for each research track across all awards within each funding mechanism, including the median publications per award, the median citations per award, and the median Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) per publication. For comparison to the BRAIN Circuits Program awards, we include bibliometrics for the 127 non-BRAIN ‘Parent’ R01 or investigator-initiated research project awards from the FY2014–2023 Systems and Computational baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), linked to 2095 research articles. Publications are a traditional measure of research output by peer review, whereas the rates of citations are a measure of influence to knowledge progress by subsequent reference.

The TeamBCP program offers a successful, collective-research approach that complements other collaborative models in neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">David et al., 2020</xref>). We encourage that the TeamBCP approach continues to be an enduring model of bold and effective team-research approaches in fundamental neuroscience discovery at NIH. Useful guidance in how to advance academic implementation of team-research approaches can be found in the EMBO reports white paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">van Helden et al., 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The NIH BRAIN Initiative’s primary goal is to enable neuroscience broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ngai, 2024</xref>). Its impact is recognized across the NIH neuroscience IC priorities (see <italic>BRAIN at 10</italic> messages of the 10 neuroscience Institute Directors in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/news-events/blog?page=0">The BRAIN Blog</ext-link>). We offer that the BRAIN Initiative Circuits Program has substantially advanced and changed the landscape of research funding in fundamental, pre-translational discovery in systems and computational neuroscience. A qualitative testament to this conclusion is reflected in an informal poll of IC-contributing Program Directors that work within the BRAIN Circuits Program Team (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). For objective measure, the raw and normalized citation indices offer impressive measures of scientific impact across all the funding tracts, and particularly high performance by the team-research TeamBCP program (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the BRAIN Initiative has invested approximately $1B into fundamental, quantitative, systems neuroscience over 10 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), reaching more than fourfold increase in the rate of funding in basic experimental neuroscience compared to the 10 years prior to the BRAIN Initiative (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Another important feature of the BRAIN Circuits Program was that a strategy of peer-reviewed, staged funding from exploratory/pilot projects to complex, hypothesis-driven research of high merit was highly effective. By measures of publication and citation rates, the BRAIN Circuits Program has produced fiscally efficient, high-impact discovery in basic neuroscience research across a broad spectrum of research topics in behavioral, systems, and computational neuroscience.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Database of awards</title><p>In order to have a baseline of system neuroscience awards similar to the Systems Neuroscience [OR] Computational Neuroscience portfolio, data downloads were curated to include research mechanisms similar to the BRAIN Initiative mechanisms of award:</p><list list-type="bullet" id="list2"><list-item><p>non-BRAIN R21/U21, R34/35/36/37, R61 to match the BRAIN Circuits Program exploratory projects (R21/U21, R34, 3-yr U01, R61);</p></list-item><list-item><p>non-BRAIN R01, R15, DP1, DP2, DP5, U01, RF1/UF1 to match the BRAIN Circuits Program R01 and RF1;</p></list-item><list-item><p>non-BRAIN U19, P01, P50/56, RM1 to match the multicomponent, research-center scale of the BRAIN Circuits Program U19s.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Budgetary and grant data</title><p>BCP program budget and numbers of applications (FY2014–2023) were pulled from NIH FASTR and publications from iCITE.

For each PI for a project, grants across the NIH that shared similarity in scientific content to the original project (derived from the similarity fingerprint) were identified. Unawarded, non-research-related mechanisms and nonbasic science-related grants were filtered out. A manual review of the title and abstract was used to confirm that the selected project was a continuation of the original grant’s work by the original (Multi-)PI.</p><p>Continuity analyses were constructed for each of our BRAIN Circuits Programs with the general convention of smaller, exploratory awards leading to larger grants: U01→U19, R34→R01/U01, and eROH→full ROH. The ‘downstream’ projects that resulted from the original project included both BRAIN and non-BRAIN grants.</p><p>Comparison groups were determined by examining non-BRAIN NIH initiatives that had similar goals and funding/administrative structures as the BRAIN announcements. The same set of processes/business rules for continuity plotting was applied.</p><p>Success rate calculations within a funding track for the continuity analyses were performed using the following formulas: (Number of similar downstream awards)/(Number of original awards). Note that if multiple original awards led to a similar downstream award, that batch of awards was only counted once in the numerator, and that a given BRAIN award could spin off multiple, successful, downstream awards.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>GitHub data</title><p>Customized scripts using all of BRAIN Circuits Program application IDs were written to extract repositories from annual NIH Research Performance Progress Reports in conjunction with the number of stars, watchers, and forks associated with each repository.

It is of particular value at this moment in history, given the cataclysmic changes in the US government structure and function occurring in early 2025.</p><p>The paper contains a fair bit of documentation so that the curious reader can actually parse what this BRAIN program funded. The authors are able to draw on a wealth of real-life experience reviewing, funding, and administering large team projects, and assessing how well they achieve their goals. In revision, the paper has been improved with respect to clarity and by bringing together two separate papers into one stronger piece.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.106136.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors provide an important summary of ten years of Brain Initiative funding including a description of the historical development of the initiative, the specific funding mechanisms utilized, and examples of grants funded and work produced.

I am not sure if this really makes the case for the success of these projects. The conclusions do not depend on Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree about the utility of the RCR, particularly because it is metric that is normalized by both year and topical area. We have added a more detailed description of how the RCR is calculated on page 6-7. Please note that figure 1 is aimed to highlight the funding opportunities, investments and number of awards associated with small lab (exploratory) versus team (elaborated, mature) research rather than a description of publication metrics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors review the history of the team projects within the Brain initiative and analyze their success in progression to additional rounds of funding and their bibliographic impact.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The history of the team projects and the fact that many had renewed funding and produced impactful papers is well documented.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The core bibliographic and funding impact results have largely been reported in the companion manuscript and so represent &quot;double dipping&quot; I presume the slight disagreement in the number of grants (by one) represents a single grant that was not deemed to address systems/computational neuroscience. The single figure is relatively uninformative. The domains of study are sufficiently large and overlapping that there seems to be little information gained from the graphic and the Sankey plot could be simply summarized by rates of competing success.</p></disp-quote><p>While we sincerely appreciate the feedback, we chose to retain these plots on domains and models to provide a sense of the broad spectrum of research topics contained in our TeamBCP awards. Further details on the awards can be derived from the award links provided in the text. Additionally, we retained the Sankey plots because these are a visual depiction of how awards transition from one mechanism to another, evolve in their funding sources, and advance in their research trajectories. The plot is an example of our continuity analysis which is only reported in the text and not visually shown for the remaining BCP programs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold></p><p>In the discussion, the reviewers agreed that the present manuscript does not make a sufficient independent contribution and so would be more profitably combined with the companion manuscript. Both reviewers noted that there was not much insight that relied on the single figure. Since neither manuscript is long, and they have overlapping authors (including the same first and last authors), this should not be a difficult merger to achieve.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the recommendation to merge. We have combined both manuscripts into one in this version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The jargon of the grant programs could be described as a nightmare. Wellcome is spelled wrong.</p></disp-quote><p>We have attempted to limit the use of jargon and to define acronyms in this version. We have corrected the spelling of Wellcome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I suggest that the two manuscripts be combined into a single paper. Although the other manuscript could stand on its own, this one does not.</p><p>The idea of culture change surrounding teams is useful but really forms more of a policy- focused opinion piece than a quantitative analysis of funding impact.</p><p>If the authors insist on keeping these separate, it is critical to remove the team data from the other manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have combined both manuscripts and decided to retain the description of culture change but have edited and condensed this section and will use the supplemental report for qualitative assessments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
