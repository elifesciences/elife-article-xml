Researchers attempt to mitigate this challenge through replication. Thus, the ability to detect experimental signals is determined by the degree of replication and the amount of environmental variation, noise, within the experimental system. A major source of noise in field studies comes from the natural heterogeneity of soil properties which create microtreatments throughout the field. In addition, the variation within different soil properties is often nonrandomly distributed across a field. We explore this challenge through a sorghum field trial dataset with accompanying plant, microbiome, and soil property data. Diverse sorghum genotypes and two watering regimes were applied in a split-plot design. We describe a process of identifying, estimating, and controlling for the effects of spatially distributed soil properties on plant traits and microbial communities using minimal degrees of freedom. Importantly, this process provides a method with which sources of environmental variation in field data can be identified and adjusted, improving our ability to resolve effects of interest and to quantify subtle phenotypes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sorghum</kwd><kwd>field research</kwd><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>drought</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE_SC0014395</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berry</surname><given-names>Jeffrey C</given-names></name><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Mingsheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Sonawane</surname><given-names>Balasaheb V</given-names></name><name><surname>Sheflin</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name><name><surname>Cousins</surname><given-names>Asaph</given-names></name><name><surname>Prenni</surname><given-names>Jessica</given-names></name><name><surname>Schachtman</surname><given-names>Daniel P</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name><name><surname>Bart</surname><given-names>Rebecca S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A method to reduce the noise present in field experiments by accounting for heterogeneity in field soils.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Environmental variation makes the real world a noisy place to conduct science. In the context of experimental agriculture fields, variation in topography may result in uneven water moisture accumulation. Similarly, soil nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate are often nonuniformly distributed across a field. These unintended and often unknown sources of environmental variation may significantly affect the experimental results. The traditional approach to mitigate this variability is through experimental designs that include replicate blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Piepho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fisher, 1925</xref>). While helpful for controlling for variation that is relatively uniform within the blocks, true biological signal may still be masked by other experimental noise that is heterogeneous within blocks.</p><p>Analytical approaches have been used to parameterize spatial variation within a field using traditional mixed-effect modeling. These methods come in two general flavors: estimating spatial-covariance structures and spatial-smoothing using splines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rodríguez-Álvarez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Piepho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Velazco et al., 2017</xref>). The former is older and canonical but requires advanced statistical knowledge to interpret the results. The latter is newer and easier to use courtesy of advancements in computation. Spatial-smoothing has been shown to effectively account for spatial variations in uniform barley fields and promotes genetic heritability in simulation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rodríguez-Álvarez et al., 2016</xref>). While spatial-smoothing using splines does effectively address spatial variation of a trait in a field, traditional parameterizations using spatial-covariance structures do so as well and further provide intuitive metrics on the type and shape of the structure. Estimating and accounting for spatial structure have proven useful for a variety of biological systems including nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Quist et al., 2019</xref>), microbiomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Franklin and Mills, 2003</xref>), forestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ohashi and Gyokusen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Möttönen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2012</xref>), and ionomics QTL mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pauli et al., 2018</xref>). These previous studies have used spatial-covariance estimation methods to identify and associate spatial effects on various traits of interest. These methods are also the backbone of geospatial statistics where the goal is to interpolate values between sampling points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Olea, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Another challenge facing field studies is to identify which factors of a multivariate dataset influence the traits of interest and then adjust for the effects from all covariates while maintaining sufficient degrees of freedom for statistical inference. This challenge is similar to the challenge associated with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that must handle population structure. In GWAS studies, phylogenetic relatedness is managed by principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Price et al., 2006</xref>). Principal components (PCs) capture axes of most variation and effectively reduce a complex multivariate dataset down to only a few independent vectors of greatest importance. PCs have also previously been used for dimension reduction to investigate how various soil nutrients affect natural selection on plant roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Murren et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we combine approaches from geospatial statistics with dimension reduction to deal with environmental variation in field studies. Specifically, we estimated spatial-covariance structures for each factor and then accounted for these effects using principal component regression. Applying this approach reduced experimental noise due to environmental variation and revealed previously hidden associations in a field study. This field study with 24 varieties of sorghum and 2 watering treatments, well-watered and water stressed, arranged in a split-plot design with 8 replicate blocks, was completed in 2017. Several types of data were collected including, but not limited to, plant harvest traits (height, fresh and dry weight, and panicle size), soil property composition (calcium, magnesium, nitrate, organic matter, pH, phosphate, potassium, salinity, sodium, sulfate, and total cations), three microbiome samplings for each plot (root, rhizosphere, and soil), leaf traits (specific leaf area, C and N content, and stable isotopes of C and N), and root metabolomic profile. In this study, the soil chemical and physical properties were used as the multicovariates that exhibited spatial-covariance structure and subsequently created microtreatment effects throughout the field that are associated with plant traits. We demonstrate that accounting for these effects via residuals of principal component regression is an effective method to improve the detection of effects of treatment factors and reduce the noise caused by spatial variation within a field.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Geospatial statistics interpolates soil property composition throughout the field</title><p>We previously described a field-level experiment in which sorghum and its associated microbiome were evaluated across two different watering treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Qi et al., 2022</xref>). As is typical of field studies, the collected data showed significant variability across all measured parameters. We also measured several different soil properties at multiple points throughout the field including organic matter, pH, phosphate, nitrate, sum of cations, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, sulfate, and salinity compositions. We hypothesized that variation across the field in these soil properties may explain some of the variability in the other measurements. Here, using the field and microbiome datasets from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Qi et al., 2022</xref>, we describe and evaluate a general method for reducing noise and apply this method to additional metabolomics and stable isotope datasets.</p><p>First, because only a limited set of points across the field were sampled for soil properties, there was a need to estimate the missing values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We suspected that sample proximity would introduce correlation within the measured soil properties. To assess this type of spatial correlation, we employed techniques from geospatial statistics to capture the correlation structure of any pair of samples in the field. Of the 12 properties tested, 6 properties exhibited evidence of spatial distributions (p value &lt;0.05): salinity (mmho), nitrate (ppm), sulfate (ppm), calcium (ppm), magnesium (ppm), and phosphate (ppm) (see Methods: Statistical testing for evidence of spatial structure). For these six soil properties we estimated the missing values throughout the field. Interpolation of values between sampling points was performed by leveraging spatial correlation structure to predict unobserved values, a process called kriging (see Methods: Geospatial interpolation methods) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To test the kriging accuracy, we performed a leave-one-out cross-validation for each soil property. Through this analysis we observed that the error of the predictions, when scaled to unit variance of the observations, exhibit distributions that resemble the expected standard <italic>Z</italic>-distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The ratio of the partial sill to the nugget is a proxy for the magnitude of the variance that is attributable to the spatial structure. Comparing this ratio for nitrate and phosphate shows that the phosphate spatial correlation was much stronger than the nitrate spatial correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Calcium also exhibited correlation structure of distances larger than nitrate, but much smaller than phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To visualize the spatial structure for each soil property, the kriged values of each property were centered around the mean and scaled to unit variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This analysis revealed that the soil properties exhibited different topographies across the field. For example, phosphate levels were high in a band across the center of the field while nitrate and calcium levels were more variable with several high and low spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We also considered correlation between the different soil properties and observed several correlation blocks, implying similar spatial structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Graphical depictions of field layout where each cell is a plot in the field.</title><p>Water treatment is specified on right; WS = water stressed, WW = well-watered.

However, it was not clear whether the observed variation was large enough to affect plant-associated phenotypes or the microbiome. To address this, we used constrained analysis of principal coordinates (CAP). With CAP, it is possible to identify specific effects on a multidimensional dataset while acknowledging variation due to other effects. For example, to understand if and how soil property variation affected microbiome composition, we first had to control for the effects of the watering treatments, the different genotypes and their interactions (see Methods: Statistical testing for phenotype–property associations). First, CAP was computed and a permutation analysis of variance (ANOVA), using 999 iterations, was performed on each soil property to identify if there is an interaction with the different compartments on the overall microbiome composition and resulted in all but one soil property, sulfate, showing an interaction effect (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Following the interaction effect permutation ANOVA, post hoc permutation ANOVAs, using 999 permutations, were performed to identify specific soil property influence on the three compartments independently. From this analysis, we observed that the root microbiome was invariant to all soil property variations. In contrast, the rhizosphere and soil microbiomes were influenced by the variation in several soil properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Additionally, there were some soil properties (salinity, sulfate, and calcium) whose variation affected either the rhizosphere or soil microbiomes but not both. This suggests that microbiome compartments are differentially sensitive to different types of soil property variation. CAP and permutation ANOVA were also applied to annotated root metabolomic profiles. In contrast to the large effects seen in the microbiomes, no soil property variances were associated with changes in the metabolomic profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This may reflect the relative stability of the metabolites identified from gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) which mostly represents primary metabolites, or the sensitivity of measurements.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Shown for each soil property that exhibits significant spatial distribution (see Methods: Statistical testing for evidence of spatial structure) (first column) is the interaction effect with the different microbiome tissue compartments on the overall microbiome composition (p value &lt;0.05 indicates significant interaction, PERMANOVA from model: Composition ~ Property:Compartment).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Soil property</th><th align="left" valign="top">p value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Sulfate (ppm)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.24</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Salinity (mmho/cm)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.011</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Phosphate (ppm)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Nitrate (ppm)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Magnesium (ppm)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.003</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Calcium (ppm)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.005</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Association of soil property variations with multiple phenotypes.</title><p>Six soil properties were assessed for effect on root microbiome and plant phenotypes using permutation ANOVA.

Just as the microbiome has the potential to be influenced by the soil property variations, the same could be true for the univariate phenotypic traits. Similarly, the effects due to the experimental design must be acknowledged to more precisely evaluate the association a given property has on the phenotypic trait. Mixed-effect models were created for each soil property–phenotypic trait pair with treatment, genotype, and their interaction as fixed effects and random effect for the split-plot replicates each having multivariate-normal spatial correlation structure (see Methods: Statistical testing for phenotype–property associations; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 4</xref>). The precise effect a given soil property has on a phenotypic trait was evaluated using type III sum of squares to account for the other sources of variance (treatment, genotype, and the interaction) on the phenotypic trait. Traditional <italic>F</italic>-test from the ANOVA revealed that plant height and total fresh weight are influenced by soil phosphate and magnesium variation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar modeling of the leaf traits indicated the soil phosphate variation is significantly associated with ẟ<sup>15</sup>N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Many other phenotypic traits were examined and did not have statistically significant associations with the variation in soil properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Closer examination showed that soil phosphate levels are mildly inversely correlated to plant height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This supports the hypothesis that excess phosphate inhibits plant growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shukla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Song et al., 2016</xref>) and suggests that the levels found in the center of the field were too high for optimum sorghum growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Statistical approach to place field noise into PCs</title><p>We have shown that many of the soil properties exhibit spatial distribution and influence various plant and microbiome traits. Therefore, to understand the effects of treatment and genotype on the phenotypic traits more precisely, we must first account for the effects of the soil properties. The replication in our study was not sufficient to include all the soil properties as covariates to account for their influence – this would require a degree of freedom for every soil property. A generalized approach to overcome limited sample size is reducing the dimensionality of the covariates using principal component analysis and regressing against the first several PCs, known as principal component regression. In this approach, the PCs retain a percentage of the influence from the individual properties and can be used as a proxy to adjust for as much variation as possible.</p><p>To adjust for the spatial effect of soil properties unrelated to genotype and treatment, we used the observed soil properties, not the kriged values, and fit linear models for each soil property with fixed effects being treatment, genotype, and their interaction. The residuals from these linear models were the adjusted soil properties unrelated to genotype and treatment. These residuals were then processed with principal component analysis. To test the success of accounting for our experimental design, we investigated clustering within the first two PCs and observed that indeed the treatment and genotype effects were accounted for (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) as there were no obvious treatment or genotype effects remaining in these PCs. We selected the first three PCs as regressors which represented approximately 66% of the total variance in the soil property data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Next, we visualized the contribution of each soil property within each PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). PC1 is primarily represented by calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and sum of cations. PC2 is primarily represented by sulfate, salinity, and pH. PC3 is primarily represented by phosphate and nitrate. Then, we used kriging (see Methods: Geospatial interpolation methods) to interpolate the missing values for the rest of the field. Since many soil properties exhibited spatial distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we expected that the PCs would also display a spatial distribution. Indeed, the spatial distribution of the kriged first PC resembles the calcium distribution which emphasizes the contribution of that property (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>). In summary, through this approach, we revealed specific sources of field-level noise and successfully captured a significant proportion of the field-level variation into three PCs.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Variation in soil properties can be collapsed into principal components.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) First two principal components of soil property residuals as <italic>x</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-axis, respectively, colored by genotype and shaped by treatment.

Similar to how we removed the experimental design effects, we created mixed-effect models for each of our phenotypes as the dependent variable with multivariate normal spatial structure within each split-plot replicate, and the first three PCs as fixed effect independent variables (see Methods: Principal component regression; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equation 5</xref>). For the univariate phenotypes, we extracted model residuals (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>) to generate soil property invariant phenotypes. In the microbiomes, residuals were not comparable to the original counts, therefore we back transformed the model estimates to create an adjusted count for each operational taxonomic unit (OTU) (see Methods: Principal component regression; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 6</xref>).</p><p>In the microbiome datasets, we expected the variance within each of the compartments to decrease and the difference between compartments to be more obvious. To test this, we combined the original observed counts and the adjusted counts for microbes that were able to be modeled and performed principal component analysis. We observed larger distances between microbiome compartments using the adjusted counts versus the observed counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This indicates the sources of variation from the soil properties were better controlled thereby increasing the differentiation between compartments. Within each compartment, the root microbiome was least affected by soil factors which was demonstrated by the small distance between the observed and adjusted counts, followed by rhizosphere with a larger separation, and soil being the farthest and most affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The adjusted counts produced clusters that were larger than their respective original counts, again indicating sources of variation were addressed so that the within compartment effects were better elucidated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, we examined the experimental design effects within each compartment using variance components (PERMANOVA) and found mirroring results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The experimental design was not differentially resolved in the root microbiome after principal component regression; however, the rhizosphere and soil microbiomes saw an increase in 3% and 2%, respectively. Noting that treatment was the effect of largest change, we sought to visualize treatment effect changes within each of the tissue compartments. Given the strong compartment differentiation, identifying clusters within a compartment required principal component analysis to be performed on each compartment individually. In the rhizosphere, we observed treatment differentiation using both the observed and adjusted counts; however, the distance between the centers of each cluster was larger after adjustment further indicating within-group variation was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Accounting for influence from soil property variance within microbiome data reveals plant phenotypes that correlate with microbe abundance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principal component analysis on the combined raw and residual microbiome tables.

Prior to removing noise from soil properties, plant height and fresh weight both showed drought effects, and after performing principal component regression, these effects were maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Further, by plotting the original values against the change for each value after adjustment, we showed that this correction method is equitable for all plant sizes; in other words, short and tall plants were not overly adjusted either positively or negatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Additionally, the variation attributable to soil properties was as much as ±10% for fresh weight and ±6% for plant height for some individual observations. Additionally, variance components were computed for all harvest traits but both fresh weight and plant height did not demonstrate an increase in experimental design resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Lastly, leaf delta δ<sup>15</sup>N showed an association with phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and variance components for the experimental design effects found that the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> between the unadjusted and adjusted increased by approximately 5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This is similar to the changes in the explained variance in rhizosphere and soil microbiome compositions.</p><p>Microbiome analyses often have less-than-ideal replication and therefore elimination of confounding variations is crucial in identifying effects of interest, such as identifying plant-growth promoting microbes. For instance, change-point models can identify microbial impacts on plant phenotypes once the abundance of the microbe reaches a particular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Qi et al., 2022</xref>). We show that in water-stressed samples before the adjustment on both plant height and microbe abundance of <italic>Microvirga</italic> in the soil microbiome, we do not see any evidence of an association. However, after accounting for the variance from the soil properties, there is a strong positive correlation between plant phenotype and OTU abundance (false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p value &lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F, G</xref>). This further emphasizes that if an experimental factor is expected to have a small effect size, that it would be lost to noise. We observe an order of magnitude more significant OTUs in the change-point associations before principal component regression versus after (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).

Because of environmental variability, these experiments must include high levels of replication and even so, results often fail to repeat in subsequent trials. For agricultural field studies a major source of variation is heterogeneous soil property distributions that create their own microtreatments and are covariates to planned experimental designs. Because these microtreatments are often unknown, and therefore not accounted for, they show up as experimental noise and may lead to false inferences. For instance, nitrogen is known to affect plant growth (size, color, yield, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Veley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chapin, 1987</xref>). If nitrogen is unevenly distributed across a field experiment aimed at characterizing biomass among diverse genotypes, the variability in nitrogen may confound the experiment. In this study, by intentionally measuring multiple soil properties across the field experiment, we were able to account for this known variation through PCs and gain novel biological insight into possible field relevant interactions between plants and microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Qi et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>After accounting for environmental variation, we observe a reduced total number of OTUs that correlate with plant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). While the total number is smaller, we also observe new ‘hits’ that were not observed before accounting for environmental factors. Additional work will be required to fully understand these patterns but here we offer a few theoretical explanations. We note that accounting for the environmental variation reduced our degrees of freedom that may reduce the power of detecting some associations. More importantly, after adjusting for environmental effect, we have focused our analysis on conditional associations instead of marginal associations. <italic>Marginal associations</italic> measure whether two variables change in the same or opposite directions simultaneously, regardless of other factors that may affect those two variables. <italic>Conditional associations</italic>, on the other hand, adjust for the impacts of other variables, and measure the relationship between two variables that cannot be explained by other variables. In a scenario in which the environment affects a microbe abundance and a plant phenotype, this may be observed as marginal associations between the two even though the microbe abundance and plant phenotype are not directly associated with each other. It is possible that many of the ‘hits’ before environmental factor adjustment are results of such marginal associations. By accounting for environmental factors, we focus on conditional associations that measure the rarer direct or possibly causal interactions between OTUs and plants. Nevertheless, future experimental work will be required to refine the list of candidate microbes.</p><p>While the approach described here represents a major advance forward, we acknowledge several opportunities for further improvement. For example, the soil property data were collected at just one time point, approximately 1 month prior to harvest. While we expect some soil properties to remain constant over the course of the experiment, others likely fluctuate (e.g., water content). Future studies might gather soil property composition at multiple time points, including before planting and at the time of phenotyping, to generate paired data. Additionally, advancements have been made in spatiotemporal modeling using Bayesian hierarchical modeling with time as an autoregressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Finley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rushworth et al., 2014</xref>) which may prove powerful if soil property composition were densely sampled over time. We also note that replication remains a crucial aspect of these types of experiments. In this analysis, we used three degrees of freedom by including the first three PCs of the soil property data in a regression to account for their contributions on the phenotypes. We chose to only include PCs that have at least 10% variance explained and only include up to replication number minus three so the experimental design effects could still be estimated. In our case, had a fourth PC shown a significant source of variance, degrees of freedom would have become limiting. On the other hand, had we included additional replication, it may have been possible to correct for covariates such as the soil properties by directly regressing on the properties themselves, rather than using a dimension reduction technique.</p><p>A significant advantage of the method described here, is that the sources of variation (soil properties) are known. This allows the researcher to examine how these fluctuations might influence experimental results and may also lead to additional biological insight. However, we note that it is not possible to measure every potential source of variation. In many cases, it may prove useful to apply an approach that is agnostic to the source of variation, such as the SpATS method described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Velazco et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We note that in these datasets, the stable isotopes and primary metabolite profiles are invariant to the measured soil properties. For the isotopes, this may be indicative of stability relative to the fluctuations in the properties across the field, but it is possible that if the soil property variations were larger, then a relationship might be established. The metabolite profile used in these analyses is only those captured from GC/MS and mostly consist of primary metabolites such as sugars, organic and amino acids, small phenolics, and fatty acids. It may be true that secondary metabolites that were not examined in these analyses may associate with the soil property variations. We observe that a relatively small amount of variation in plant height and weight were attributed to the soil property composition, other types of data, particularly microbiome composition, were much more susceptible. Microbiome quantification has been shifting from using OTUs to amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) which are designed to identify and retain more specific bacterial identification. Some microbes were overtly sparse across the samples and principal component regression could not successfully estimate model parameters. The microbiome table generation pipeline used for this field allows for the identification of very sparse microbes by way of using 99.5% identity clustering which results in 23,617 OTUs detected. After applying principal component regression, approximately 25% of the microbes were successfully modeled and retained. The methods proposed here should also be applicable to those types of tables as well with one caveat: ASV tables are sparser than OTU tables. While the methods here are zero-inflated, it is likely the percent of ASVs not successfully modeled would be larger than if using classical OTU techniques.</p><p>In conclusion, here we demonstrate the impact of spatially distributed soil property variations on several phenotypes of interest and present principal component regression as a method to alleviate the effects analytically. We observed that the microbiome communities were heavily influenced by the soil properties while the plant phenotypes were more resilient but nonetheless affected. Identifying sources of variation and removing their influence enhances the ability to resolve other effects of interest and enables more honest, reliable, and believable quantification of subtle phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>In a related research manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Qi et al., 2022</xref>), we describe analysis of the field dataset and include additional details on experimental design (sorghum varieties, watering regimes, and field layout).

What follows is the VSEARCH (v2.9.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rognes et al., 2016</xref>) workflow for taking the reads for each sample and processing them to curate the OTU table: merge paired ends, merge all samples, fastq filter, sequence dereplication, cluster unique sequences, remove chimeras, and read quantification. Merging paired ends had the following parameters: max diffs = 10, max diff percentage = 90, min merge length = 230, max merge length = 540. Samples were then combined into a single fasta file. Fastq filtering had the following parameters: maxee = 1, strip left = 19, strip right = 20, fastq max n’s=0, fasta width = 0. Dereplication had the following parameters: min unique size = 1, fasta width = 0. OTU clustering had the following parameters: id percentage = 0.995, strand = both. Removing chimeras had the following parameters: fasta width = 0. Read quantification had the following parameters: id percentage = 0.9. These steps were combined all together in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) workflow and executed on a HTCondor high-throughput computation cluster. A total of 171,273 OTUs were detected and of those 114,179 had quantification across all 1280 samples. OTU table quality control was done in two steps: samples were removed if the total number of reads quantified across all OTUs was less than 10,000. In addition, OTUs were removed if the total number of reads quantified across all samples was less than 100 or greater than 200,000. After applying this filter 92,385 OTUs and 1280 samples remained. Of the OTUs removed only 422 had counts larger than 200,000 indicating the majority of the OTUs removed were rare and would not have enough information to perform proper statistical analysis. Once OTUs and samples that did not meet the quality control filters were removed, each OTU count in a sample was scaled proportionally to the same number, max number of reads per sample, so that all samples had the same number of OTU counts quantified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Geospatial interpolation methods</title><p>One major assumption of fitting spatial models is that the distribution is stationary, meaning that the mean and covariance between any two samples are the same throughout the grid. However, this field trial included two treatment factors (watering treatments and sorghum genotypes) which may have directly affected the measured soil properties. Thus, to satisfy the stationary assumption, we needed to account for any influence on the soil properties from the two treatment factors and/or their interaction. To do this, we fitted linear models including treatment factors and their interaction for each soil property as follows:<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Then we calculated residuals for each property to generate stationary soil properties by subtracting the observed values by the predicted values based on model (1), as follows:<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The residuals were used to estimate variances at multiple distances to produce a variogram and then, several spatial models were fitted to the data.

The best fitting model was selected as the one that produced the minimal sum-of-squares errors. Given a spatial model, there are three metrics that describe a spatial fit and help us understand how the sampled points are correlated. The nugget is the estimated variance between two adjacent samples and represents the noise of the data. The range is the distance at which the change in variance with respect to distance first becomes zero and represents how far away sampled points demonstrate the correlation structure. Finally, the partial sill is the variance at the range minus the nugget variance. Since each spatial model is fully parameterized by only these three coefficients, model complexity is not a factor in estimating the model sum of squares to identify the best fitting parameterization.</p><p>With the best spatial model, we estimated spatial weights as a function of the distance between two sampling points and used these weights to predict values at nonsampled positions by kriging, a method to interpolate by using a weighted average of the observed values in the neighborhood of nonsampled position.

The issue is that in field experiments, small variation in one or more soil property variables can obscure true effects of experimental variables on plant phenotypes. The main result is that without their framework they would not have found the association between water treatment, plant growth and Microvirga bacterial abundance, it would have been lost to the noise inherent in these kind of large-scale experiments with relatively modest degrees of freedom. Overall, the PC-based approach to de-noise these kinds of datasets provides an important advance by pulling out subtle phenotypic effects in field trials.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70056.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Whiteman</surname><given-names>Noah K</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01an7q238</institution-id><institution>University of California, Berkeley</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Gloss</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0190ak572</institution-id><institution>New York University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.04.29.441834">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.29.441834v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has now been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Meredith Schuman as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew Gloss (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Each of the reviewers' specific concerns below should be addressed prior to resubmission of a revised manuscript for publication consideration. A major concern was a lack of detail on many aspects of the statistical model, the location of the raw data and ability of others to re-run the code. This should be the focus of the author's should they consider revising and resubmitting this manuscript.</p><p>2) Because the manuscript is, essentially a methods development report, it is of the utmost importance that the authors revise this manuscript in alignment with those goals. It should be straightforward, not difficult, for others to implement the tools developed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would like to see the raw data and methods for all of these experiments uploaded/appended as supplementary information here--it isn't satisfactory that one should turn to a preprint for this information--it should all be in the present manuscript. In that vein, I was also confused by whether microbes were a treatment or a passive variable here in this study (e.g., I had a hard time differentiating between the Qi et al., biorxiv manuscript and this one).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I found the approach exciting, and the paper makes a good case for its use in future experiments! However, some work is needed to make the presentation more complete in a few different ways, as numbered below. When revising, please consider the following sentence-by-sentence and analysis-by-analysis: is the approach fully described in the methods? Are the necessary results provided so a reader could evaluate support for the statement rather than taking the written interpretation at face value? (e.g., L245: readers should be able to view the results, rather than relying on the vague assurance that the results that aren't shown are &quot;similar&quot; to the one that is. This paper could and probably should have more extensive supplementary results to achieve this).</p><p>1. Not all aspects of the method's implementation are described thoroughly in the paper, in both practical and conceptual senses. This includes both the specific formulations of each analysis -- with a careful description of the model inputs, outputs, specification, and software packages -- and very clear explanations of the goal of each step and how the approach achieves it. The incompleteness of these details made it difficult to fully evaluate, and could pose obstacles to its reliable implementation and interpretation by other researchers. In a paper presenting a methodological approach and arguing for its broader use, clearly walking readers through these steps is essential. Addressing this will require revisions to the methods and results alike. While I do appreciate the brevity, other papers implementing spatial models for environmental variation -- such as Pauli et al., 2018 (G3, doi: 10.1534/g3.117.300479) or Velazco et al., 2017 (Theor. Appl. Genet; doi: 10.1007/s00122-017-2894-4) -- walk the reader through their approaches more thoroughly.</p><p>2. Results are presented incompletely. For example, Figure 4E shows how PC regression affected variance partitioning among explanatory variables and unexplained noise, but only for one dependent variable. This really should be conducted for every dependent variable included in the study. When conducting many tests, a seemingly compelling result can arise even by chance, so it's difficult to know how to interpret a single strong result that is hand-picked to be presented. Similarly, the effect of spatial modeling should be presented across <italic>all</italic> OTUs considered in the study, not just one with a particularly strong effect in the desired direction. Otherwise, one is left wondering if this is a chance result (since re-fitting a model on adjusted data will always alter it) that only arose because so many OTUs were tested -- and whether patterns in the opposite direction, where a significant effect emerged only in the unadjusted phenotypes, also were observed. Note that multiple test corrections (likely FDR) should be presented when applicable as well throughout the paper, especially for the large number of OTU tests that must've been conducted but not shown. It seems like the results should pass this scrutiny, but it must be applied nonetheless!</p><p>3. How the approach builds on or is unique from previous studies and approaches, and ensuing strengths and weaknesses to be expected as a result, is not sufficiently described; see Public Review for further details.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>I don't quite follow how separation of cluster centers in the PCA plots (Figures 4A-B) suggests that environmental noise has been reduced and treatment signals have been boosted. In these figures, the centers for each condition do appear further apart, but the spread of points within each condition have also increased. If both spread and centers increase, does this actually reflect better separation of conditions, or just a re-scaling of the overall plot? Does variance partitioning (explained vs. unexplained variance) and the significance of the condition effect in a statistical model actually improve? (Also, I'm confused by L223-224 -- wouldn't weakening a true treatment effect also enlarge clusters, albeit in a different way by drawing points toward the center of the plot?)</p><p>It would be very helpful to walk through the spatial model selection more -- a bit on the different spatial covariance structures that were tested in particular. The test results used for model selection should also be more fully presented, including parameters relevant to the likelihood ratio tests that were conducted (e.g., degrees of freedom for each comparison, log likelihood scores for each model and associated p-value, etc).</p><p>L143-147: Microbiomes of different compartments being affected by different soil elements seems plausible, but this could also just reflect false negatives, a common problem when simply &quot;tallying up&quot; the tests significant at some threshold. As a result of experimental noise (or differences in the amount of unexplained variance within specific compartments), it's possible that an element might have significant effects only in one compartment even if it affects all of them. Evaluating a model of microbiome_composition ~ element * compartment is needed to test this, paying attention the significance of the interaction term.</p><p>Table S1: How is model complexity taken into account? Typically, a more complex model will always have reduced error. Do the model comparisons penalize for increasing model complexity?</p><p>I was unable to access the scripts on Zenodo, but maybe that was user error on my end!</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It might be helpful to describe the details of the statistical model.</p><p>2. To help readers employ the proposed tool in their studies, it is valuable to include the step-by-step procedure of the proposed strategy, such as selection of variables, number of PCs to include in the model etc.</p><p>3. For the proposed tool, will the correlations between the phenotypes affect the results/performance?</p><p>4.

We have also edited the text in many places to clarify the relationship between this methods paper, and the related research paper (Qi, M. et al., 2021). We are also happy to share that the Qi et al., manuscript was recently accepted at ISME J. As soon as we have an updated doi, we will update that in this manuscript, as well.

Since the microbiome counts are brought back to the original count space after doing the soil property adjustment, we feel that there are negligible re-scaling effects. For instance, we would not expect all counts to increase thus forcing the clusters further apart simply due to scale. OTUs are adjusted upwards in some samples and down in others. However, considering this and other comments from the reviewers, we decided to move previous panel 4B to supplemental in exchange for a variance component analysis on the compositions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be very helpful to walk through the spatial model selection more -- a bit on the different spatial covariance structures that were tested in particular. The test results used for model selection should also be more fully presented, including parameters relevant to the likelihood ratio tests that were conducted (e.g., degrees of freedom for each comparison, log likelihood scores for each model and associated p-value, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>We leverage an existing R package, gstat, and all possible types of models (nugget, exponential, spherical, Gaussian, Matern, and Stein) were evaluated. Full parameterizations of these can be found in their manuscripts (Pebesma and Wesseling 1998; Pebesma 2004)(Pebesma 1998, Pebema 2004). These models are fully parameterized by the same three coefficients (nugget, sill, and range) and we have revised the text to clarify their explicit definitions (methods) as well as added in an additional citation. As suggested, we have extensively revised the methods section to more fully walk the reader through the process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L143-147: Microbiomes of different compartments being affected by different soil elements seems plausible, but this could also just reflect false negatives, a common problem when simply &quot;tallying up&quot; the tests significant at some threshold. As a result of experimental noise (or differences in the amount of unexplained variance within specific compartments), it's possible that an element might have significant effects only in one compartment even if it affects all of them. Evaluating a model of microbiome_composition ~ element * compartment is needed to test this, paying attention the significance of the interaction term.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the amount of thought that went into this suggestion and how interpretable the results are from a biological point of view. From a statistical standpoint, a model that includes a compartment interaction term allows different compartments react differently to the changing element values. As suggested, we have completed the analysis including an interaction term and have included an additional table that directly assesses the effect of the interaction term (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We have also updated the text to include this analysis in the results. The statistical test to decide if interaction is significant is limiting in its interpretability. We therefore also performed post-hoc tests to investigate more directly which compartments are affected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Table S1: How is model complexity taken into account? Typically, a more complex model will always have reduced error. Do the model comparisons penalize for increasing model complexity?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an absolutely accurate statement and something geospatial statistics has aimed to alleviate. For all the different types of spatial models considered here, each one of them is fully parameterized by the same three coefficients (nugget, sill, and range) so from a degrees of freedom and error point of view, they are all equally complex. We identify which spatial model is “best” by finding the model that produces the smallest error, and since the complexities are the same, this metric is suitable for this determination. We have added a sentence in the methods of the manuscript to bring more clarity to the errors of each type of model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I was unable to access the scripts on Zenodo, but maybe that was user error on my end!</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the link and verified that others can access the site (the previous link may have been locked!). Hopefully it now works for you, as well. If not, please just let <italic>eLife</italic> staff know and we’ll sort it out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. It might be helpful to describe the details of the statistical model.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have extensively revised the methods sections, including specifying model equations, to give a more systematic look at exactly what was done. We also have included all scripts and raw data in a zenodo repository.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. To help readers employ the proposed tool in their studies, it is valuable to include the step-by-step procedure of the proposed strategy, such as selection of variables, number of PCs to include in the model etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We think the use of the word ‘tool’ was misleading since we are not providing a deployable R package for general use. Therefore, we have changed this word to ‘method’. Regardless, we like this suggestion and so have updated the text in the Discussion section to highlight what we feel is the balancing act between the number of PC’s to use vs the number of degrees of freedom required to adjust. This is an important concept, thank you for the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. For the proposed tool, will the correlations between the phenotypes affect the results/performance?</p></disp-quote><p>Good question. In this manuscript we are only considering phenotypes one at a time to assess for soil property variations and removing those effects. However, in our related paper (Qi et al.,), after de-noising the data, we leveraged correlations between experimental systems and between plant phenotypes to further exclude potential ‘false positives.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.
