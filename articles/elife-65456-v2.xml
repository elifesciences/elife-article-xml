To study how sounds guide anticipatory licking during classical conditioning, we employed high-density electrophysiological recordings from the hippocampal CA1 area and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in mice. CA1 and PFC neurons undergo distinct learning-dependent changes at the single-cell level and maintain representations of cue identity at the population level. In addition, reactivation of task-related neuronal assemblies during hippocampal awake Sharp-Wave Ripples (aSWRs) changed within individual sessions in CA1 and over the course of multiple sessions in PFC. Despite both areas being highly engaged and synchronized during the task, we found no evidence for coordinated single cell or assembly activity during conditioning trials or aSWR. Taken together, our findings support the notion that persistent firing and reactivation of task-related neural activity patterns in CA1 and PFC support learning during classical conditioning.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>conditioning</kwd><kwd>sharp-wave ripples</kwd><kwd>CA1</kwd><kwd>PFC</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004350</institution-id><institution>Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klee</surname><given-names>Jan L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>612.001.853</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Souza</surname><given-names>Bryan C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NWA 'Bio-Art' project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Battaglia</surname><given-names>Francesco P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CA1 and PFC bridge the temporal gap between cue and reward delivery during trace conditioning according to different underlying coding principles and task-related activity is reactivated during awake Sharp-Wave Ripples.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to react to sensory cues with appropriate behavior is crucial for survival. On the level of neuronal circuits, linking cues to actions likely requires the interplay between a large network of cortical and subcortical brain structures, including the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the CA1 area of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Steinmetz et al., 2019</xref>). Both areas have been found to respond to sensory cues and reward in various behavioral paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aronov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Starkweather et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taxidis et al., 2020</xref>) and are involved in action planning and execution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Otis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Terada et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>PFC has been suggested to map contextual and sensory information to appropriate actions according to flexible rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Euston and Gruber, 2012</xref>). Accordingly, PFC has been found to control the development and expression of anticipatory licking during sensory guided reward-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Otis et al., 2017</xref>). PFC also maintains working memory representations of sensory cues over delay periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Funahashi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldman-Rakic, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Similar to PFC, CA1 responds to sensory cues and displays sustained activity during delay periods to support memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hattori et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McEchron et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McEchron and Disterhoft, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, CA1 and PFC interact substantially during awake hippocampal Sharp-Wave Ripples (aSWRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jadhav et al., 2016</xref>). aSWRs have been suggested to support planning of goal-directed actions in the context of spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">ÃlafsdÃ³ttir et al., 2018</xref>) and the disruption of aSWRs leads to impairments in anticipatory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nokia et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, sensory cue representations are reactivated in hippocampal and corticohippocampal circuits during aSWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herzog et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rothschild et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, whether task-related information during classical conditioning is also reactivated in the CA1âPFC circuit during aSWR and how this changes over the course of learning is currently unknown.</p><p>Here, we investigate how neural activity patterns in CA1 and PFC change throughout learning of sensory guided behavior, if information related to sensory cues is maintained while anticipatory actions are performed, and whether task-related information is reactivated in the CA1âPFC circuit during aSWRs. To this end, we employed high-density silicon probe recordings from both areas in head-fixed mice during appetitive auditory trace conditioning (AATC). Our findings reveal that CA1 and PFC exhibit distinct learning-dependent changes in sensory cue evoked activity, trial type-, and sensory-cue-related sustained activity as well as reactivation of task-related neural assemblies during aSWR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Head-fixed mice learn to anticipate reward during AATC</title><p>We trained head-fixed mice to associate one of two sounds (CS+ vs CSâ) with a liquid reward delivered after a 1-s-long, silent trace period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Otis et al., 2017</xref>).

We show that activity in both areas is strongly shaped by learning and that task-specific information is reactivated in a complex pattern across CA1 and PFC during aSWR.</p><p>While CA1 and PFC are highly active during aversive eyeblink trace conditioning, evidence for a similar involvement during appetitive trace conditioning had been missing. In fact, several previous studies have pointed out differences in the mechanisms underlying both types of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pezze et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thibaudeau et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Despite these differences, we found that single cells in CA1 and mPFC during appetitive trace conditioning behave similar to what had previously been reported during aversive trace conditioning. Both areas display long-lasting sustained activity that bridges the temporal gap between CS+ offset and reward delivery. In both areas, these sustained responses are composed of a mix of Trace-Up and Trace-Down cells, that is, cells that display sustained excitation and inhibition, respectively. In CA1, higher numbers and stronger inhibition of Trace-Down cells result in overall suppression of the entire area during the trace period, while in PFC higher numbers and stronger activation of Trace-Up cells resulted in overall excitation.</p><p>Similar to our study, abundant Trace-Down like responses and sparse Trace-Up like responses have been described during aversive trace conditioning in CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hattori et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McEchron and Disterhoft, 1997</xref>). This distinct pattern of mostly inhibition mixed with sparse excitation has been hypothesized to increase the signal-to-noise ratio to more efficiently propagate the signal of Trace-Up cells to downstream areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hattori et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, it is also conceivable that Trace-Down cells participate in an independent form of coding. Inhibition in CA1 might, for example, play an active role in suppressing well expected incoming stimuli, that is, reward delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rummell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stachenfeld et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In PFC, responses during appetitive trace conditioning are also similar to what has previously been found during aversive trace conditioning. Specifically, higher numbers and stronger excitation of Trace-Up cells have also been found in rat PFC and parts of rabbit PFC during aversive trace conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hattori et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008</xref>).

Increased synchronization between both areas during spatial working memory tasks have previously been reported predominantly in the theta frequency (4â12 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battaglia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones and Wilson, 2005</xref>). However, during trace-conditioning mice were mostly stationary and did not display strong hippocampal theta oscillations and high-frequency coherence therefore likely results from a different underlying mechanism.</p><p>Despite both areas being highly engaged in the task and encoding trial-specific information on a trial-by-trial level, we did not find any evidence for task-specific communication on the single-cell level. CA1 and PFC therefore either process conditioning trials in parallel rather than in series or rely on intermediate structures (e.g., entorhinal cortex) for effective communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Insel and Takehara-Nishiuchi, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we found that cell assemblies in CA1 and PFC that are responsive during classical conditioning also strongly reactivate during hippocampal aSWRs.

Our data now provide this missing link.</p><p>Notably, we observed a fast increase in reactivation strength of assemblies derived from conditioning trial activity within CA1 during aSWRs as individual training sessions progressed and a slow increase in reactivation strength in trial and intertrial interval derived assemblies in PFC from prelearning to postlearning sessions. This is well in line with the idea that both areas support learning on different timescales and levels of complexity, with the hippocampus adapting fast to detailed new experiences and the PFC adapting more slowly to behaviorally important variables that remain stable over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Takehara et al., 2003</xref>). Assembly reactivation in CA1 was furthermore task specific during trace conditioning. Assemblies that were suppressed during and after CS+ sounds became most strongly reactivated. CSâ suppressed assemblies were also but less strongly modulated during aSWRs in CA1.</p><p>This preferential reactivation of CS suppressed assemblies during aSWR, provides additional evidence that suppression in CA1 during CS+ trials plays a pivotal role during trace conditioning and might be relevant to actively encode stimulus identity or to predict upcoming task events.</p><p>Surprisingly, we did not observe that assemblies, derived from activity during conditioning trials in CA1 and PFC, significantly coreactivated during aSWR.</p><p>Several studies previously reported single cells in CA1 and PFC with similar spatial firing fields to also be strongly correlated during aSWRs and that synaptic inputs to individual mPFC cells increased if CA1 replay was more coordinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nishimura et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). However, on the population level, CA1 and mPFC reactivation of specific spatial trajectories has been found to occur independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaefer et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, reactivation of spatial sequences in CA1 and other cortical areas, specifically the entorhinal cortex has been shown to occur independently as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">OâNeill et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>One way to reconcile these findings is that the coordination of aSWRs reactivation within the CA1âPFC circuit might depend on task structure. If animals have to follow rules that are based on specific sequences of behavioral events, for example, in spatial alternation tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shin et al., 2019</xref>), replay of sequences of events in CA1 might drive the activation of cells or cell assemblies in PFC that encode the appropriate behavioral response to those sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">BuzsÃ¡ki and Tingley, 2018</xref>). If the task structure instead âonlyâ requires stimulus response mappings, as in our experiment and visually guided spatial navigation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaefer et al., 2020</xref>), PFC might not rely on additional information from CA1 and reactivation remains independent. However, coordinated aSWRs reactivation in CA1 and PFC might happen robustly in nonspatial tasks if the tasks require the animals to learn sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cabral et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rondi-Reig et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Terada et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, it would be intriguing to know how SWRs reactivation of task relevant information during classical conditioning depends on the current state of the animal. A previous study reported significant differences in coordinated CA1âPFC reactivation between wakefulness and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang et al., 2021</xref>). Yet evidence for sleep SWR reactivation of nonspatial information is still lacking. This further highlights the importance to study SWR reactivation with a battery of different behavioral task and across behavioral states that can help to disentangle the exact content and relevance of replay events for learning and behavior in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>For this experiment, we used a total of 17 male C57Bl/6 mice. The animals were obtained at 10â13 months of age from Charles River Laboratory and all experiments were performed within 2 months after delivery. Seven animals were used for silicon probe recordings from dorsal hippocampus area CA1, six animals were used for recordings from PFC, and an additional four animals were used for combined silicon probe recordings from CA1 and PFC during the AATC task. All animals were group housed until the first surgery after which they were individually housed to prevent damage to the implants. Throughout the experiment the animals were maintained on a reversed 12 h light/dark cycle and received food and water ad libitum until we introduced food restriction 2 days after the first surgery. All experiments were performed during the dark period. This study was approved by the Central Commissie Dierproeven (CCD) and conducted in accordance with the Experiments on Animals Act and the European Directive 2010/63/EU on animal research.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Surgical preparation for head-fixed electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Animals were anesthetized using isoflurane (1â2%) and placed in a stereotaxic frame. At the onset of anesthesia, all mice received subcutaneous injections of carprofen (5 mg/kg) as well as a subcutaneous lidocaine injection through the scalp. The animalsâ temperature was maintained for the duration of the surgical procedure using a heating blanket. Anesthesia levels were monitored throughout the surgery and the concentration of isoflurane was adjusted so that a breathing rate was kept constant at around 1.8 Hz. We exposed the skull and inserted a skull screw over the cerebellum to serve as combined reference and ground for electrophysiological recordings. We then placed a custom made, circular head plate for head fixation evenly on the skull and fixated it with dental cement (Super-Bond C&amp;B). For CA1 recordings, a craniotomy was performed over the left hippocampus â2.3 mm posterior and +1.5 mm lateral to Bregma and for PFC recordings a craniotomy was performed over left frontal cortex at +1.78 mm anterior and +0.4 mm lateral to Bregma. The exposed skull was covered with a silicon elastomer (Body Double Fast, Smooth-on) until the first recording.

The motion of the treadmill was recorded using an optical mouse and transformed into movement along a virtual linear track designed with the Blender rendering software. The virtual track was then projected through a mirror into a spherical screen surrounding the head-fixed animal on the treadmill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schmidt-Hieber and HÃ¤usser, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmidt-Hieber, 2020</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/neurodroid/gnoom">https://github.com/neurodroid/gnoom</ext-link>).

Licks were detected with an infrared beam-break sensor that was positioned right in front of the spout.</p><p>All animals were slowly habituated to head fixation by placing them in the setup for at least 2 days of 3 Ã 10 min sessions during which they received about 50 rewards, totaling to about 0.2 ml of soy milk. During the habituation, we started to food restrict the animals to around 90 % of initial body weight to motivate better task performance.</p><p>In all cases, the food restricted animals started to lick off the soy milk reward reliably within the first six habituation sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioral training</title><p>The AATC task required the animals to associate a 2-s-long CS+ sound with a droplet of soy milk reward (~5 Âµl), delivered after 1 s of silence, the so-called âtrace periodâ while ignoring a CSâ control sound. We interleaved the CS presentations randomly every 30â45 s. For the two sounds, we choose a 3000 kHz continues pure tone and a 7000 kHz tone pulsating at 10 Hz. We counter balanced the CS+ and CSâ sounds evenly between animals throughout the experiment.</p><p>As the main behavioral outcome measure, we detected the licks of the animals with an infrared beam-break sensor that was mounted in front of the reward spout. Each training session ended as soon as the animals received 50 rewards.

We then classified recording sessions from the first 2 days of training as prelearning (Pre) and recording sessions from day 6 onwards and with a significant increase in anticipatory licks as postlearning (Post).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Acute electrophysiological recordings during AATC tasks</title><p>At the start of each recording session, we placed the mice in head fixation and removed the silicon elastomer cover to expose the skull. We then used a micromanipulator (Thorlabs) to acutely insert a 128-channel silicon probe into the middle of the previously prepared craniotomy above PFC and/or CA1. For PFC recordings, we then slowly lowered the recording electrode to â2.0 mm ventral to Bregma. For CA1 recordings, we continuously monitored the local field potential (1â600 Hz), ripple frequency signal (150â300 Hz), and spiking activity (600â2000 Hz) during the insertion process and tried to positioned our electrode in a way that the strongest ripple amplitude and spiking activity was 200â250 Âµm from the base of the probe and 470â520 Âµm from the tip. In this way, we were able to cover most of dorsoventral extend of CA1 with our recording electrode.</p><p>Electrophysiological signals were filtered between 1 and 6000 Hz, digitized at 30 kHz using 2 64 channel digitizing heads stages (RHD2164 Amplifier Board, Intan Technologies) and acquired with an open-ephys recording system.

Briefly, for a given session, we first subsample (without replacement) the population of each region in two equally sized sets of source and target neurons, so that all four sets had the same number of neurons. We then used a 10-fold crossvalidation scheme to compute the RRR (i.e., fitting the target population activity using the source population) using multiple rank values. The performance of each model was computed using the relative amount of variance explained by the model (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>). We then selected the first model which had mean performance within 1 standard error of the mean (SEM) of the best model, using its rank as the number of predictive dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This procedure was repeated for 10 different subsamples and the performance and number of predictive dimensions of each session was computed via averaging across subsamples. We also compared the performance of the full regression model (in which all the ranks were used) to control for different dimensionality of the RRRs in the two areas. In this particular case, we added L1 regularization, and chose the best model (highest average performance over crossvalidation) among different ridge parameter values and measured the MSE between estimated and real activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Coherence analysis</title><p>To assess coherence between mPFC and CA1 during the AATC task, we first selected the CA1 recording channel with the strongest aSWR amplitude (see below) as well at the central channel of the mPFC recording electrodes and downsampled the raw voltage singles to 2000 Hz.

We then identified the recording depth with the strongest average ripple power and used the ripple band signal on this channel for further analysis. For each recording session, we visually inspected the ripple band signal and manually set a low-cut threshold for ripple detection (100 ÂµV in most cases) and a high-cut threshold for artifact rejection (500 ÂµV in most cases). We furthermore, excluded threshold crossings within 200 ms of each other as well as within 200 ms of any licking activity.</p><p>To compute task-related cell assemblies in CA1 and PFC, we first binned the spikes of each trial (â1 to 4 s from stimulus onset) into 20-ms bins.

We then projected the neural activity onto each of the assembly patterns (using the same 20-ms bins, with overlap) and computed the mean assembly activity triggered by the stimulus, animal licks, and hippocampal SWR, normalizing it with the <italic>z</italic>-score transformation. Normalization was done using the <italic>z</italic>-score transformation, which in the case of stimulus-triggered assembly activity only used prestimulus period (of both CS+ and CSâ) as baseline (â1000 to 0 s) and in case of ripples-triggered activity only used the period outside the ripple center (50-ms window) as baseline. At last, we defined the assembly reactivation window on SWR as the average <italic>z</italic>-scored assembly activity in the 50-ms window centered on the aSWR. We then divided each session in 10 equally long-trial blocks, and investigated the reactivation strength of positively (reactivation+) and negatively (reactivationâ) modulated assemblies over the course of the session. Statistical comparisons between pre- and post (normalized) mean assembly activity were done using a Wilcoxon rank sum test, while comparisons of reactivation within a session was done comparing the reactivation in the first three and last blocks using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Kaori Takehara-Nishiuch as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The finding of reactivation during aSWRs in inter-trial intervals (ITI) provides the major novel advance provided by the manuscript. The authors conclude that this reactivation plays a role in learning the task. This claim requires further supporting evidence, including the demonstration of the relationship of reactivated cell assemblies with activity patterns described for CS+ and CS- stimuli as well as details about the rate and distribution of aSWRs over learning. For example, can the authors classify the detected cell assemblies into groups, each of which represents a specific task event (CS+, CS-, trace period, reward)? By running all subsequent analyses separately in each of these groups, it is possible to demonstrate how the timing and incidence of reactivation differ among these groups. Alternatively, similar to CA1 neurons, PFC neurons also change firing patterns depending on contextual information (see Hyman et al., 2012). Can the author identify &quot;control&quot; cell assemblies that co-fired irrespectively to task events by running the same assembly analysis with firings during the ITI period (excluding SWR events)? If the task-related information is preferentially reactivated, these control assemblies should be reactivated less frequently than the assemblies representing task events.</p><p>2. A few previous studies have reported prefrontal reactivation during behavior (Maggi et al., 2018; Shin et al., 2019; Kaefer et al. 2020) â only one is cited (Kaefer et al.), and not in the context of reactivation. Their analyses focused on the coordination of PFC and CA1 reactivation during aSWRs, which contrasts with the results in Figure 5 that demonstrate the assembly reactivation separately in each region. The authors need to address whether the reactivation is related or coordinated between the two regions and how this may change during learning. For example, do PFC and CA1 assemblies reactivate during the same aSWRs, which can potentially aid task-related plasticity and learning in the CA1-PFC circuit, or are they reactivated separately?</p><p>3. It is expected that ripples also occurred during the reward consumption period. The ripples here were within an active task phase and should yield more information relevant to the task. Did the authors look at the ripples during the reward consumption period?</p><p>4. The study is the first to simultaneously record from CA1 and PFC in trace conditioning. Despite this strength, the current form applies the same set of analyses to the two regions in parallel, leaving inter-region relationships and coordinations mostly unexplored. For example, is there any relationship or coordination between Trace-up and Trace-down neurons in PFC and CA1 reported in Figure 3, or is there any evidence of oscillatory coordination in the CA1-PFC circuit? At the minimum, cross-correlation analyses can be added to examine temporal relationships between the firing of PFC and CA1 neurons with distinct response sub-types.</p><p>5. In the analyses for examining evoked and trace period responses (Figures 1,2), the authors primarily use a subtractive measure (change in firing rate from baseline) and average across all neurons to infer sustained trace-period suppression in CA1 and enhancement in PFC for CS+ stimuli (Figure 1F-I, K-N). This population presumably consists of neurons with variable baseline rates and levels of responsiveness, as seen in the Z-scored figures (Figures 1E, J). Therefore, the same analysis can be done using the Z-scored measure, which can control variable baseline rates and avoid outlier contributions from neurons with high firing rates. The authors also need to confirm that the differing responses of overall suppression in CA1 and enhancement in PFC persist when using alternative measures.</p><p>6. Firing suppression in CA1 is interesting but expected given &quot;rate-decreasing cells&quot; reported in previous works with trace eyeblink conditioning (McEchron et al., 1999; Hattori et al., 2015). Even in the prelimbic cortex, about half of stimulus-responding cells decrease their firing rates in response to the CS (Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008; Hattori et al., 2014). The authors need to relate their results to these existing findings and discuss a model explaining how, despite both Trace-up and Trace-down neurons, the overall effect is suppression in CA1 and enhancement in PFC. This can presumably occur due to the different strength of contributions of these two kinds of neuronal responses in the two regional populations.</p><p>7. In Figures 3and4, the authors used population vector distance to track the separation between the representations of two different sounds versus time. They all showed a sustained increase from the baseline. First, the distance was expressed as a Z-score. What distribution was the Z-score calculated against? Second, did the distance between the two sounds ever come back to the baseline level, e.g., close to 0, meaning not separable anymore? This could be a way to validate the method or check the stability of the recording.</p><p>8. As the authors wrote, traditionally sustained firing patterns are considered a neural correlate for the association of temporally discontinuous stimuli. However, recent studies using trace eyeblink conditioning (Modi et al., 2014; Pilkiw and Takehara-Nishiuchi, 2018) show that CA1 and the prelimbic region also contain cells transiently increase firing rates during a specific time segment and form a sequential firing pattern that bridges the trace period. These cells will not pass the authors' criterion for &quot;trace-responsive&quot; cells, which is based on the averaged firing rate in the entire 1-second delay period. Given the scarcity of the large-scale neural activity recording during explicitly non-spatial tasks, it is worth investigating whether or not the authors observe similar sequential patterns in either region.</p><p>9. The medial prefrontal cortex consists of several sub-regions, such as rostral anterior cingulate, prelimbic, and infralimbic cortex. In particular, Hattori et al. (2014) reported substantial differences in firing selectivity between the rostral cingulate and prelimbic area in trace eyeblink conditioning. Therefore, the authors need to show histology and report which sub-region was the primary source of recordings.</p><p>10. Another concern is how the authors ensure the stability of their recordings. Acute recording is less table than chronic recording. Is there any analysis or method for the authors to only include the stably recorded cells in the analyses?</p><p>11. In several sections (e.g., Line 121), the authors first used ANOVA and then follow-up with rank-sum tests.

In particular, they have clarified key analyses, and added new analyses examining coordination of CA1-PFC ensembles during the trace conditioning task. The revised manuscript does a better job of addressing of how physiological phenomena contribute to learning of the task. There are still a few areas that remain unaddressed and additional clarification can be added.</p><p>1) The authors add LFP coherence and reduced rank regression (RRR) analyses to examine CA1-PFC interactions during trace conditioning (Figure 4). Here, it will be useful to show examples of raw LFP traces in CA1 and PFC from which the coherence is derived.</p><p>The RRR analyses is informative about directionality of interactions, and similar CA1-PFC interactions are observed across task periods, suggesting generality of interactions unrelated to the task. The question of whether the different cell type responses, Trace-up and Trace-down neurons, across CA1 and PFC regions are correlated or not is not addressed. Since these response types are shown to be task-specific in Figure 2, examining correlations for specific neuronal response types across regions has the potential to reveal an interaction, and is a missed opportunity.</p><p>2) The authors also choose not to examine possibility of transient increases in neuronal activity and sequential patterns, which can also drive the population vector trajectories shown in Figure 3.</p><p>3) The authors have added to the reactivation analyses to examine what kinds of information is reactivated in CA1 and PFC during aSWRs in the inter-trial periods. They report reactivation of CS+ specific information in CA1, and non-specific reactivation of all assemblies in PFC that increases over learning. The authors also report that reactivation across regions remains uncorrelated.</p><p>In the light of these new findings, the authors can provide additional interpretation regarding the possible role of aSWR reactivation in the learning of this task. It seems that aSWR reactivation is only beneficial for within-region changes during learning? Although role of intermediate regions such as entorhinal cortex is speculated, reactivation in these regions can also be independent.</p><p>The finding of uncorrelated reactivation and associated analyses can also use additional explanation. As reported in Figure 6D, the proportion of reactivation in each region was compared against the rate of joint reactivation across CA1-PFC assemblies, with the finding that joint reactivation was no more likely than independent reactivation. Here, it is important to report the probability of significant assembly reactivation (reactivation rate per aSWR) in CA1 and PFC. If these probabilities are low, then it is possible that data limitations constrain the statistical probability of observing joint reactivation across assemblies. Although Figure 5 shows the strength of assembly reactivation, the rate of this reactivation per aSWR is not clear.</p><p>Finally, given that PFC reactivation is detected during hippocampal aSWRs, which drive synchronous reactivation of prefrontal neurons (Nishimura et al., Cell Reports, 2021), it will be useful to hear the authors' interpretation of why prefrontal reactivation may be uncorrelated, the possible function of independent reactivation in task learning, and if perhaps post-task sleep SWRs can have a role in driving synchronous CA1-cortical reactivation for learning.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65456.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The finding of reactivation during aSWRs in inter-trial intervals (ITI) provides the major novel advance provided by the manuscript. The authors conclude that this reactivation plays a role in learning the task. This claim requires further supporting evidence, including the demonstration of the relationship of reactivated cell assemblies with activity patterns described for CS+ and CS- stimuli as well as details about the rate and distribution of aSWRs over learning. For example, can the authors classify the detected cell assemblies into groups, each of which represents a specific task event (CS+, CS-, trace period, reward)? By running all subsequent analyses separately in each of these groups, it is possible to demonstrate how the timing and incidence of reactivation differ among these groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this insightful comment and we agree that reactivation during aSWR is an important, novel result that invites further investigations.</p><p>To find evidence for reactivation of task event specific information during aSWR (see new Figure 6), we first computed the average activity of each assembly for CS+ or CS- stimuli and then computed a trial-type modulation score, defined as the average assembly activation during CS+ trials subtracted by the average activation during CS- trials (stimulus and trace periods; Figure 6A). Then, for each session, we selected the most positively modulated (i.e., CS+ activity higher than CS-), the most negatively modulated (i.e., CS- activity higher than CS+), and the least modulated âcontrolâ assembly. Because we found that most assemblies in CA1 are suppressed during the stimulus (as are the firing rates, Figure 1 F and H), we term assemblies by whether they were more suppressed during CS+ or CS- stimuli.</p><p>We found that, for CA1, CS+ suppressed assemblies in stimulus and trace periods (i.e., assemblies that are more suppressed during CS+ trials than CS- trials), were more reactivated during aSWRs (Figure 6B) compared to CS- suppressed assemblies and control, non-modulated assemblies. This effect was confirmed by a negative correlation between the trial-type modulation score and the average aSWR reactivation of each assembly (Figure 6C). CA1 therefore preferentially reactivates assemblies that encode task specific information. In PFC we did not observe preferential reactivation of CS+ or CS- specific assemblies (Supp. Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, similar to CA1 neurons, PFC neurons also change firing patterns depending on contextual information (see Hyman et al., 2012). Can the author identify &quot;control&quot; cell assemblies that co-fired irrespectively to task events by running the same assembly analysis with firings during the ITI period (excluding SWR events)? If the task-related information is preferentially reactivated, these control assemblies should be reactivated less frequently than the assemblies representing task events.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, we included a new control analysis in which we do as suggested by the reviewer. We detected the assemblies during the inter-trial intervals (excluding aSWRs events) and investigated those assembly reactivations during aSWR (Supp. Figure 5.1).</p><p>We find that reactivation of assemblies defined during the intertrial interval is similar to reactivation of assemblies defined during the trial. However, groups of cells that are coactive during the trial will often also be coactive during the intertrial interval and vice versa which makes a comparison between âtrialâ and âITIâ assembly reactivation hard to interpret.</p><p>In contrast, our findings in new Figure 6 clearly highlight that assemblies that specifically respond to CS+ stimuli with suppression, are more re-activated than assemblies that are not modulated by CS+ stimuli and, in our view, provide solid evidence that in CA1 CS+ specific assemblies are preferentially reactivated.</p><p>On the other hand, neither analysis produced evidence of CS specific reactivation in PFC. We therefore conclude that increased reactivation from pre to post learning session is not CS specific and instead, general task context dependent and reward related (See Figure 5 E) assemblies are reactivated during aSWR in PFC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. A few previous studies have reported prefrontal reactivation during behavior (Maggi et al., 2018; Shin et al., 2019; Kaefer et al. 2020) â only one is cited (Kaefer et al.), and not in the context of reactivation. Their analyses focused on the coordination of PFC and CA1 reactivation during aSWRs, which contrasts with the results in Figure 5 that demonstrate the assembly reactivation separately in each region. The authors need to address whether the reactivation is related or coordinated between the two regions and how this may change during learning. For example, do PFC and CA1 assemblies reactivate during the same aSWRs, which can potentially aid task-related plasticity and learning in the CA1-PFC circuit, or are they reactivated separately?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, reactivation in PFC during aSWR is likely an important phenomenon that underlies learning and memory. The literature cited by the reviewer shows that reactivation in PFC has previously been observed in spatial memory tasks and we now emphasize this in the manuscript. However, whether reactivation is coordinated between CA1 and PFC is still a matter of debate (Shin et al. 2019 find coordination, Kaefer et al. 2020 do not). To check whether CA1 and PFC assembly reactivation is coordinated during aSWR during trace conditioning, we counted how often each simultaneously recorded assembly pair (1 CA1 and 1 PFC assembly) reactivated together above the median in both areas and then compared the percentage of coincident high reactivations (Q1) with the percentage of high and low reactivations in CA1 and PFC respectively (Q2). (Figure 6D). In line with previous results (Kaefer et al. 2020), we did not find evidence for increased co-reactivation of CA1 and PFC assemblies during aSWRs. In combination, with analysis of single cell coordination between both areas during the trials (see below), this suggests that CA1 and PFC process information during trace-conditioning in parallel rather than in series or by means of an intermediate structure (e.g., entorhinal cortex). We now highlight this result and interpretation in a revised version of our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It is expected that ripples also occurred during the reward consumption period. The ripples here were within an active task phase and should yield more information relevant to the task. Did the authors look at the ripples during the reward consumption period?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising an interesting point. Indeed, aSWR are elevated at reward locations in spatial navigation studies (Singer and Frank, 2009). However, differences in aSWR rate at the exact moments of chewing/licking behavior compared to non-chewing/licking at the same reward location are difficult to detect in freely moving animals and, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously reported. Furthermore, aSWR in response to behaviorally relevant sounds have not been extensively described before.</p><p>In our head-fixed trace-conditioning experiments, we were able to precisely detect instances of licking for reward as well as CS+ and CS- sound presentations and align aSWR rate to these events.</p><p>To our surprise, we observed a marked decrease in the rate of aSWR during conditioning trials and almost a complete absence of aSWR while mice were licking for the reward. While conceptually interesting, we were therefore not able to perform the analysis suggested by the reviewer above because of a lack of aSWR during the precise reward consumption period.</p><p>However, the baseline rate of aSWR occurrence during the ITIs in our task was similar to what has previously been reported at familiar reward locations (Singer Frank, Neuron 2009).</p><p>To emphasize these points, we included a Supplementary Figure 5.2 that shows the distribution of aSWR during trials, sessions and learning stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The study is the first to simultaneously record from CA1 and PFC in trace conditioning. Despite this strength, the current form applies the same set of analyses to the two regions in parallel, leaving inter-region relationships and coordinations mostly unexplored. For example, is there any relationship or coordination between Trace-up and Trace-down neurons in PFC and CA1 reported in Figure 3, or is there any evidence of oscillatory coordination in the CA1-PFC circuit? At the minimum, cross-correlation analyses can be added to examine temporal relationships between the firing of PFC and CA1 neurons with distinct response sub-types.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this insightful comment. In fact, we originally set up parallel recordings from CA1 and PFC because we hypothesized that these two areas which have been shown to interact on the level of single cells and field potentials in various other memory tasks would also show coordinated activity during trace conditioning. We are excited that the reviewers share our interest in this topic and decided to include an additional main Figure 4 in the manuscript.</p><p>Heightened oscillatory coherence between CA1 and PFC has previously been described during spatial working memory tasks. We therefore decided to check for oscillatory coherence between CA1 and PFC. We found a significant increase in CA1-PFC coherence during the trace-period after CS+ compared to CS- trials (12-140 Hz) (Figure 4 A).</p><p>CA1 â PFC coherence during spatial working memory tasks was reported predominantly in the Theta range (4-12Hz). In our experiments mice were mostly stationary (see Supp. Figure 3.2). Expectedly, we therefore did not detect strong theta nor a specific peak in theta coherence.</p><p>We next checked whether we could find evidence for single cell coordination during conditioning trials (Figure 4B). To this end we computed a reduced-rank regression (RRR) to assess how well the activity of a sampled population in one of the areas (source area) can be used to explain the activity of another (disjoint) sampled population in the same area or in a separate target area, through a simplified, low-dimensional linear model. We then used cross-validation to estimate the optimal dimensionality (rank) of each RRR and its performance (R<sup>2</sup>) (Semedo et al., 2019). We observed that CA1 ensemble activity at baseline could be used to predict other individual neurons firing rates in CA1 just as well as the firing rates of neurons in PFC. The PFC ensemble on the other hand was much better at predicting the firing rates of other PFC neurons over neurons in CA1 which indicates a directionality of information flow between both areas at baseline.</p><p>However, cross-area predictability of firing rates did not change significantly when we compared baseline levels to any of the different trial stages (Stim, Trace or Reward), indicating that communication between the two areas might depend on more general, context dependent variables instead of specific conditioning trial specific information and that both areas process trial type specific information in parallel rather than in series. We had similar results when comparing the performance of the full-rank model across different periods (Ridge-regression with L1 regularization; Supp. Figure 6) We updated our result section, figures and discussion to present these new findings accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In the analyses for examining evoked and trace period responses (Figures 1,2), the authors primarily use a subtractive measure (change in firing rate from baseline) and average across all neurons to infer sustained trace-period suppression in CA1 and enhancement in PFC for CS+ stimuli (Figure 1F-I, K-N). This population presumably consists of neurons with variable baseline rates and levels of responsiveness, as seen in the Z-scored figures (Figures 1E, J). Therefore, the same analysis can be done using the Z-scored measure, which can control variable baseline rates and avoid outlier contributions from neurons with high firing rates. The authors also need to confirm that the differing responses of overall suppression in CA1 and enhancement in PFC persist when using alternative measures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this insightful comment and we agree that representing changes in firing rates as Z-scores consistently throughout the text improves the interpretability of our data. We therefore updated Figures 1 and 2 as well as the corresponding paragraphs in the text accordingly. Overall, we had very similar results, however, sound evoked firing rates in CA1 post-learning were found to be not significantly different from each other when comparing Z-scored firing rates (Figure 1 G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Firing suppression in CA1 is interesting but expected given &quot;rate-decreasing cells&quot; reported in previous works with trace eyeblink conditioning (McEchron et al., 1999; Hattori et al., 2015). Even in the prelimbic cortex, about half of stimulus-responding cells decrease their firing rates in response to the CS (Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008; Hattori et al., 2014). The authors need to relate their results to these existing findings and discuss a model explaining how, despite both Trace-up and Trace-down neurons, the overall effect is suppression in CA1 and enhancement in PFC. This can presumably occur due to the different strength of contributions of these two kinds of neuronal responses in the two regional populations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point and we have consequently elaborated on the distribution of rate increasing and decreasing cells across both areas as well as on how the numbers that we find in our study relate to previous work by adding an additional supplementary figure (Sup. Figure 2) and by expanding on this point in our discussion.</p><p>We also substantially revised the first half of the Discussion section to properly contrast our results to previous findings in the trace-conditioning field:</p><p>âThis study characterizes changes in neural activity in the CA1-PFC network while mice learn to use predictive sounds to anticipate future rewards. We show that activity in both areas is strongly shaped by learning and that task specific information is reactivated in a complex pattern across CA1 and PFC during aSWR.</p><p>While CA1 and PFC are highly active during aversive eyeblink trace conditioning, evidence for a similar involvement during appetitive trace-conditioning had been missing. In fact, several previous studies have pointed out differences in the mechanisms underlying both types of learning (McEchron et al., 1999; Pezze et al., 2017; Thibaudeau et al., 2007).</p><p>Despite these differences, we found that single cells in CA1 and mPFC during appetitive trace-conditioning behave similarly to what had previously been reported during aversive trace-conditioning. Both areas display long lasting sustained activity that bridges the temporal gap between CS+ offset and reward delivery. In both areas, these sustained responses are composed of a mix of Trace-Up and Trace-down cells, i.e. cells that display sustained excitation and inhibition respectively. In CA1, higher numbers and stronger inhibition of Trace-Down cells result in overall suppression of the entire area during the trace period, while in PFC higher numbers and stronger activation of Trace-Up cells resulted in overall excitation.</p><p>Similar to our study, abundant Trace-Down like responses and spares Trace-Up like responses have been described during aversive trace-conditioning in CA1(Hattori et al., 2015; McEchron and Disterhoft, 1997). This distinct pattern of mostly inhibition mixed with sparse excitation has been hypothesized to increase the signal to noise ratio to more efficiently propagate the signal of Trace-Up cells to downstream areas (Hattori et al., 2015) Yet, it is also conceivable that Trace-down cells participate in an independent form of coding. Inhibition in CA1 might for example play an active role in suppressing well expected incoming stimuli, i.e. reward delivery (Bastos et al., 2012; Rummell et al., 2016; Stachenfeld et al., 2017).</p><p>In PFC, responses during appetitive trace-conditioning are also similar to what has previously been found during aversive trace-conditioning. Specifically, higher numbers and stronger excitation of Trace-Up cells have also been found in rat PFC and parts of rabbit PFC during aversive trace-conditioning (Hattori et al., 2014; Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008). A learning dependent reduction in responses to CS- like pseudo conditioning stimuli have also previously been described in PFC (Hattori et al., 2014; Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008; Weiss and Disterhoft, 2011).</p><p>In combination, this suggests that sparse excitation with strong surrounding inhibition in CA1 and mostly excitation in PFC are two general coding principles employed to bridge the temporal gap between a salient cue and a behaviorally relevant event, independently of the appetitive or aversive nature of the event and the specific anticipatory action that it requires.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

We did take great care to only including stably recorded cells in the analysis and we will shortly describe our approach below. However, we do want to point out that most of the analysis in this manuscript does not describe changes in neural activity over the course of an individual session but rather relies on averaging across randomly interleaved CS+ or CS- trials. We assume that for this analysis, cells fading in or out, could only âwater downâ any effect because these cells would be unresponsive in some trials (however, this should affect randomly interleaved CS+ and CS- trials evenly).</p><p>In general, to identify single unit activity, the raw voltage signal was automatically spike sorted with Kilosort (Pachitariu et al., 2016) (https://github.com/cortex-lab/Kilosort) and then manually inspected and curated with the âphyâ gui (https://github.com/kwikteam/phy).</p><p>During this step we took great care to only include stable units for further analysis.</p><p>To further verify the stability of our recordings, we split each recording session into 3 blocks and compared the average firing rates as well as the change in firing rate of all cells from the first to the last third of each session (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) .</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65456-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We found no significant difference in firing rates between early and late periods in each session (Wilcoxon Ranksum p=.958).

We decided to address them together in a new section of the discussion:</p><p>âSurprisingly, we did not observe that assemblies, derived from activity during conditioning trials in CA1 and PFC, significantly co-reactivated during aSWR.</p><p>Several studies previously reported single cells in CA1 and PFC with similar spatial firing fields to also be strongly correlated during aSWRs and that synaptic inputs to individual mPFC cells increased if CA1 replay was more coordinated (Nishimura et al., 2021; Shin et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2017). However, on the population level, CA1 and mPFC reactivation of specific spatial trajectories has been found to occur independently (Kaefer et al., 2020). Moreover, reactivation of spatial sequences in CA1 and other cortical areas, specifically the entorhinal cortex has been shown to occur independently as well (OâNeill et al., 2017).</p><p>One way to reconcile these findings is that the coordination of aSWRs reactivation within the CA1-PFC circuit might depend on task structure. If animals have to follow rules that are based on specific sequences of behavioral events, e.g., in spatial alternation tasks (Shin et al., 2019), replay of sequences of events in CA1 might drive the activation of cells or cell assemblies in PFC that encode the appropriate behavioral response to those sequences (BuzsÃ¡ki and Tingley, 2018). If the task structure instead âonlyâ requires stimulus response mappings, as in our experiment and visually guided spatial navigation experiments (Kaefer et al., 2020), PFC might not rely on additional information from CA1 and reactivation remains independent. However, coordinated aSWRs reactivation in CA1 and PFC might happen robustly in non-spatial tasks if the tasks require the animals to learn sequences (Cabral et al., 2014; Rondi-Reig et al., 2001; Terada et al., 2017).</p><p>Lastly, it would be intriguing to know how SWRs reactivation of task relevant information during classical conditioning depends on the current state of the animal. A previous study reported significant differences in coordinated CA1-PFC reactivation between wakefulness and sleep (Tang et al., 2021).

This further highlights the importance to study SWR reactivation with a battery of different behavioral task and across behavioral states that can help to disentangle the exact content and relevance of replay events for learning and behavior in the future. &quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, please address editorial suggestions/concerns raised by all reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed the additional comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have addressed several concerns in the revised manuscript. In particular, they have clarified key analyses, and added new analyses examining coordination of CA1-PFC ensembles during the trace conditioning task. The revised manuscript does a better job of addressing of how physiological phenomena contribute to learning of the task. There are still a few areas that remain unaddressed and additional clarification can be added.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 3 for this positive feedback and the helpful suggestions for further improvement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors add LFP coherence and reduced rank regression (RRR) analyses to examine CA1-PFC interactions during trace conditioning (Figure 4). Here, it will be useful to show examples of raw LFP traces in CA1 and PFC from which the coherence is derived.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that examples of raw data are useful for the interpretation of our data. We therefore revised Figure 4 and added a new panel A which shows simultaneously recorded LFP and single unit activity from CA1 and PFC during one CS+ conditioning trial.</p><p>Furthermore, we decided to add example traces of simultaneously recorded LFP and single unit activity during aSWR to Figure 5âfigure supplement 2 A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The RRR analyses is informative about directionality of interactions, and similar CA1-PFC interactions are observed across task periods, suggesting generality of interactions unrelated to the task. The question of whether the different cell type responses, Trace-up and Trace-down neurons, across CA1 and PFC regions are correlated or not is not addressed. Since these response types are shown to be task-specific in Figure 2, examining correlations for specific neuronal response types across regions has the potential to reveal an interaction, and is a missed opportunity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this interesting avenue for further analysis. We completely agree with this reasoning but decided that as a first approach to find coordinated activity between both areas, we wanted to use a measure that is unbiased and does not rely on a previous classification into trace-up and trace-down cells. However, as pointed out below, we are currently working on a second manuscript and are approaching these questions with new analysis methods which we feel like fall beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors also choose not to examine possibility of transient increases in neuronal activity and sequential patterns, which can also drive the population vector trajectories shown in Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insight full comment and we absolutely share the interest in sequential firing patterns during conditioning in CA1 and PFC. In fact, we are now analyzing our data looking for sequential activations and other patterns with advanced statistics developed with our collaborators. We believe that this work falls outside the scope of the present paper, which concentrates more on firing rate modulations, and will be the subject of a dedicated additional manuscript that is currently in preparation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors have added to the reactivation analyses to examine what kinds of information is reactivated in CA1 and PFC during aSWRs in the inter-trial periods. They report reactivation of CS+ specific information in CA1, and non-specific reactivation of all assemblies in PFC that increases over learning. The authors also report that reactivation across regions remains uncorrelated.</p><p>In the light of these new findings, the authors can provide additional interpretation regarding the possible role of aSWR reactivation in the learning of this task. It seems that aSWR reactivation is only beneficial for within-region changes during learning? Although role of intermediate regions such as entorhinal cortex is speculated, reactivation in these regions can also be independent.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these important points. We decided to address them together with the reviewers finally comment on our view on how to reconcile our findings with previous studies that reported coordinated activity in CA1 and PFC during aSWRs. We added this paragraph to our original discussion:</p><p>âSurprisingly, we did not observe that assemblies, derived from activity during conditioning trials in CA1 and PFC, significantly co-reactivated during aSWR.</p><p>Several studies previously reported single cells in CA1 and PFC with similar spatial firing fields to also be strongly correlated during aSWRs and that synaptic inputs to individual mPFC cells increased if CA1 replay was more coordinated (Nishimura et al., 2021; Shin et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2017).

As reported in Figure 6D, the proportion of reactivation in each region was compared against the rate of joint reactivation across CA1-PFC assemblies, with the finding that joint reactivation was no more likely than independent reactivation. Here, it is important to report the probability of significant assembly reactivation (reactivation rate per aSWR) in CA1 and PFC. If these probabilities are low, then it is possible that data limitations constrain the statistical probability of observing joint reactivation across assemblies. Although Figure 5 shows the strength of assembly reactivation, the rate of this reactivation per aSWR is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this issue and we now address the aSWRs joint reactivations in more detail. First. we computed the rate of significant aSWRs reactivation as suggested by the reviewer. To do so, we used a threshold of 2sd above the median (s.d. was estimated using the median absolute deviation to minimize the effects of outliers). We found that ~5% of the reactivations were above this threshold. This is now shown in Figure 6âfigure supplement 1.</p><p>We then recomputed the proportion of joint reactivations (as in Figure 6D), but using the quadrants defined now by the 5% of highest and lowest reactivations. We found that the percentage of joint CA1/PFC reactivations falling in the 5% highest on both areas was not different than the other three quadrants (i.e., 5% lowest in CA1 and 5% lowest in PFC; 5% highest in CA1 and 5% lowest in PFC; and the opposite).</p><p>We show that in the figure above (right), but choose not to include it in the revised manuscript to avoid redundancy with Figure 6 D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, given that PFC reactivation is detected during hippocampal aSWRs, which drive synchronous reactivation of prefrontal neurons (Nishimura et al., Cell Reports, 2021), it will be useful to hear the authors' interpretation of why prefrontal reactivation may be uncorrelated, the possible function of independent reactivation in task learning, and if perhaps post-task sleep SWRs can have a role in driving synchronous CA1-cortical reactivation for learning.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs comment and addressed this in our revised discussion posted above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
