from mature cell populations, enabling the identification of primitive stem-like cells in primary tumors, such as glioblastoma (GBM) where self-renewing cells driving cancer progression and recurrence are prime targets for therapeutic intervention. We show, using single-cell chromatin accessibility, that primary human GBMs harbor a heterogeneous self-renewing population whose diversity is captured in patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). In-depth characterization of chromatin accessibility in GSCs identifies three GSC states: Reactive, Constructive, and Invasive, each governed by uniquely essential transcription factors and present within GBMs in varying proportions. Orthotopic xenografts reveal that GSC states associate with survival, and identify an invasive GSC signature predictive of low patient survival, in line with the higher invasive properties of Invasive state GSCs compared to Reactive and Constructive GSCs as shown by in vitro and in vivo assays. Our chromatin-driven characterization of GSC states improves prognostic precision and identifies dependencies to guide combination therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlsson et al., 2014</xref>). The addition of temozolomide chemotherapy provides only an additional 2.5 months in the small subset of responsive patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stupp et al., 2005</xref>). Despite extensive characterization and stratification of the bulk primary tumors, no targeted therapies have been successfully developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlsson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">von Neubeck et al., 2015</xref>). GBM tumors are rooted in self-renewing tumor-initiating cells commonly referred to as glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Venere et al., 2011</xref>) that drive disease progression in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallo et al., 2015</xref>) and display resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy leading to disease recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2006</xref>). The promise of therapeutically targeting self-renewing tumor-initiating cancer cells depends on our capacity to capture the full range of heterogeneity within this population from individual tumors. Intratumoral heterogeneity within primary GBM has recently been documented through single-cell RNA-seq experiments and revealed a continuum between four cellular states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Neftel et al., 2019</xref>): neural-progenitor-like (NPC), oligodendrocyte-progenitor-like (OPC), astrocyte-like (AC), and mesenchymal-like (MES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Neftel et al., 2019</xref>). A subsequent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) using single-cell gene-centric enrichment analysis placed GBM cells along a single axis of variation from proneural to mesenchymal transcriptional profiles, with cells expressing stem-associated genes lying at the extremes of this axis. Hence, primary GBM consists of distinct states, across which stem-like cells appear to be found. Whether these stem-like cells found across GBM states represent functionally distinct GSC populations with tumor-initiating properties and unique dependencies remains to be established to guide therapeutic progress. To address this issue, we combined single-cell technologies to define GSC composition in primary GBM with functional assays to reveal the unique dependencies across GSCs, reflective of invasive, constructive, and reactive states that relate to patient outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Chromatin accessibility readily discriminates stem from mature cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stergachis et al., 2013</xref>), which can be resolved at the single-cell level through single-cell ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buenrostro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corces et al., 2016</xref>), taking into account non-gene centric features, such as accessibility of noncoding elements and total amount of accessible DNA sequences. Applying single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling (scATAC-seq) across four primary adult GBM tumors (3797 cells), wild type for both <italic>IDH1</italic> and <italic>IDH2</italic>, revealed seven to nine accessibility modules in each tumor based on unsupervised clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We assigned cells to each of the four scRNA-seq-derived cellular states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Neftel et al., 2019</xref>) based on individual cells’ chromatin accessibility enrichment scores for the promoter regions of each state’s signature genes. Across the four tumors, 35–55.2% of the cells were significantly enriched for at least one state’s signature genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The MES state reported from scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Neftel et al., 2019</xref>) dominates the identity of two or more modules reported from chromatin accessibility in every tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, the NPC and OPC states are mixed within the same module defined based on chromatin accessibility, dominating over the other states typically in at least two modules.

Individual cells scoring as putative cancer stem cells were not restricted to a unique module defined by chromatin accessibility but were distributed across a subset of modules, suggesting heterogeneity across cancer stem cells in primary GBM, in agreement with reports relying on single GBM cell labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corces et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Orzan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rheinbay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stergachis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suvà et al., 2014</xref>), assessing the heterogeneity of self-renewing tumor-initiating cells. Putative cancer stem cells identified in primary GBM through scATAC-seq were found in modules ascribed to every one of the four cellular states defined by gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Neftel et al., 2019</xref>), predominantly within NPC and OPC containing modules and a smaller fraction (&lt;10%) in MES-specific modules across all four tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This suggests that the core transcriptional unit of cancer stem cells in primary GBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suvà et al., 2014</xref>) is not restricted to a unique population defined by its global transcriptional or chromatin accessibility profile with the resolution achieved with current single-cell technologies.</p><p>To further probe the heterogeneity in chromatin accessibility within the GBM cancer stem cell pool, we derived GSC populations from 27 adult <italic>IDH</italic> wild-type GBM tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pollard et al., 2009</xref>) and profiled their chromatin accessibility by bulk ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Each patient-derived GSC showed a similar enrichment for accessible chromatin regions in promoters and 5′UTRs, and depletion in introns and distal intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Collectively, we uncovered 92% of the total predicted regions of accessible chromatin (255,891 regions) within GSCs based on a saturation analysis using a self-starting non-linear regression model across the 27 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We next assessed the similarity between these GSCs and the putative cancer stem cells found by scATAC-seq in the four primary GBMs. GSCs were identified within each tumor by calculating the enrichment of accessible chromatin regions shared by a majority of GSCs (&gt;14/27) in each tumor cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). On average, 11.3% of cells in each primary GBM were labeled as GSCs. Comparing the distribution of GSCs across the seven to nine modules defined by scATAC-seq to that of the 19 transcription factor-derived cancer stem cell signature demonstrates concordance between the two signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Moreover, the enrichment z-scores for both cancer stem signatures (i.e. stem transcription factors signature and GSC chromatin accessibility signature) are significantly correlated across cells in all four tumors (p≤1.6×10<sup>−5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The overlap in cells significantly enriched for either stem signatures across the four tumors is also significant (hypergeometric test p-value=8.8×10<sup>−8</sup>) Additionally, an average of 91.2% (85.1–100%) of the cells identified by either signature display the hallmark GBM copy number changes at chromosomes 7 and 10, confirming their neoplastic status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the patient-derived GSC populations reflect the chromatin identity of putative cancer stem cells found in primary brain tumors, highlighting the value of these GSCs as models to deepen our understanding of individual cells within primary GBM with features found in self-renewing tumor-initiating cells. Accordingly, spectral clustering of the 27 patient-derived GSC ATAC profiles identifies three distinct states of self-renewing tumor-initiating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Expression profiling of these 27 GSCs by RNA-seq reveals GSCs significantly enriched for the signatures of each of the three TCGA GBM subtypes (proneural, classical, and mesenchymal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, the assignment of the proneural, classical, and mesenchymal subtypes across GSCs did not match the three clusters identified from ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Conversely, clustering the GSCs by gene expression, independently of their chromatin accessibility, did largely recapitulate the GSC states defined by chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This suggests that the mismatch between the GSC cluster from chromatin accessibility profiles and TCGA expression subtypes is not mainly due to differences between chromatin accessibility and gene expression. Potential alternative causes for this observed mismatch include the absence of a tumor microenvironment in the GSC populations or that given the TCGA subtypes were determined from bulk GBM, they may not fully capture the nature of rarer populations found within a tumor, such as the cancer stem cell populations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>GSCs recapitulate the <underline>g</underline>lioblastoma (GBM) cancer stem cell population.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the GSC derivation process, from patient tumor to GSC-enriched population.

Our ability to discriminate GSC state-specific regions of accessible chromatin is reflective of the comprehensiveness of our cohort to saturate the detection of accessible regions to 93%, 88%, and 71% across the Reactive (n = 13), Constructive (n = 9), and Invasive (n = 5) state GSCs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>Considering that regions of accessible chromatin serve as binding sites for transcription factors engaging in gene expression regulation, we next tested for DNA recognition motif family enrichment across regions exclusively accessible in Reactive, Constructive, or Invasive GSC states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The most enriched DNA recognition motif families in each state were either depleted or showed low-level enrichment in the other states. Specifically, the DNA recognition motifs for the interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) and Cys2-His2 zinc finger (C2H2 ZF) transcription factor families were enriched in the Reactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, top panel). Regulatory factor X (RFX) and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) DNA recognition motifs were enriched in the Constructive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, middle panel), while the Forkhead motif family was enriched in the Invasive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, bottom panel).

Specifically, the SP1 regulatory network is preferentially essential in the Reactive state GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, top panel), <italic>ASCL1</italic>, <italic>OLIG2</italic>, <italic>AHR</italic>, and <italic>NPAS3</italic> are uniquely essential in the Constructive state GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, middle panel) and <italic>FOXD1</italic> is essential only in the Invasive state GSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, bottom panel). Notably, <italic>SP1</italic> itself is exclusively essential in only one Reactive GSC (G564). However, of the 36 transcription factors from the Reactive-enriched families (IRF and C2H2 ZF) that were essential in at least one Reactive GSC and not in any of the Constructive or Invasive GSCs, 13 are directly regulated by SP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), thus suggesting that the SP1 regulatory network as a whole, rather than SP1 on its own, is key in the Reactive GSC state.

When classified by dominant GSC state, TCGA tumors display the same trend as the xenografts with Invasive state-dominated tumors showing the lowest survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, with only two tumors classified as Invasive-dominant, the difference in survival between the three patient groups was not statistically significant (p=0.3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We proceeded to rank the TCGA tumors solely by their concordance to Invasive GSCs and classified the patient tumors into Invasive-low (z-score &lt; 1), Invasive-mid (z-score = 1–1.65), and Invasive-high (z-score ≥ 1.65) groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). With this stratification method, median patient survival per group not only decreased with increasing Invasive GSC score, but we also identified an Invasive-high subset of tumors with significantly lower survival (p=0.019, HR (Hazard Ratio) = 2.8, 95% CI: [1.3–5.81]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This was further validated using an additional cohort of TCGA samples with microarray gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D–E</xref>).

Specifically, the Invasive GSC signature draws from a population with enhanced ability to invade and spread compared to other GSC states. Collectively, our results argue for distinct GSC populations whose composition in tumors impacts survival.</p><p>Our results also highlight dependencies unique to each cancer stem state. Specifically, the Reactive GSC state-associated transcription factor SP1 and its regulatory partners are involved in cellular differentiation and growth, apoptosis, response to DNA damage, chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Connor et al., 2016</xref>), stimulation of <italic>TERT</italic> expression in cancer stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), and increased stemness and invasion in GBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2014</xref>).

The paper was reviewed by three experts, who all agreed that the work will add meaningful knowledge to the field; but that more experimentation would be needed to better support the claims as made. The reviewers agreed that this is the first study to apply single cell sequencing specifically to GSCs with the goal of identifying GSC subtypes using primarily chromatin accessibility signatures. In particular, the use of chromatin accessibility signatures in combination with TF motif prediction to guide identification of transcriptional dependencies is novel in the context of GSC studies. However, it was felt that a number of enhancements would be needed, including greater validation of the cell samples, the inclusion of additional samples, and clarification of some of the methodologies employed. We encourage resubmission once these issues have been addressed.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) The tumor cell and GSC population enrichment should be validated using functional and genomic methods (including evidence for either Chr7 amplification or Chr10 deletion), and additional patient samples should be analyzed, preferably without extended culture times. Indeed, there appeared to be a low correlation between GBM stem TF enrichment and GSC signature enrichment and the degree of concordance between samples was not fully developed. It would be important to have more samples for many reasons, including the idea presented by the authors of differences between tumors in the dominant cell type. GBM has significant variation spatially, as well, so having only 4 tumors seems underpowered.</p><p>2) Details about the tumor collection should be included as should full information about tumor genetics, patient information, and treatment for each sample.</p><p>3) Figure 1 should be revised to clarify cells which fail to classify and to signify whether shared chromatin states exist across patients.</p><p>4) Figure 3 should be revised. Data pertaining to GSCs should be compared to the published GBM scRNAseq data to check the subtypes (Neftel et al., 2019, etc.). In addition, the top and bottom panels could be combined, and the sample assignment of TCGA subtypes, chromatin clusters and expression clusters should be better presented in the sankey diagram. The GSC samples and color bars showing chromatin clusters should be kept consistent between the top and the bottom panels. Figure 3A is missing a legend as there is no indication of what the intensity values represent. For Figure 3B, please clearly indicate an associated P-value testing for the enrichment of TCGA subtypes among the GSC ATAC states. Figure 3C should present cut-offs for what was considered statistically significant (i.e., a dotted line). Importantly, &quot;Figure 3—figure supplement 1&quot; presents the most differentially accessible regions between GSC states. Notably, ChrX is present in all. Chromatin accessibility read-outs might be significantly impacted by the presence of an inactive X chromosome. Hence an imbalance in the sex distribution in the GSC states might pick up sex-specific and not tumor-specific differences. Thus, the authors should show that these regions do not vary with patient sex. Finally, the evidence that &quot;GSC states are not genetically defined (Figure 3D)&quot; is derived from DNA methylation copy number, and a signature of selected genes. Bona fide GBM genes such as PDGFRA, NF1, AKT3, QKI should also be included in this analysis and the possibility that the GSC states cluster by frequent chromosome arm-level events (chr7, chr19, chr20 gains and chr10 loss) should be entertained. If they still do not cluster by GSC state, then it is perhaps more accurate to say that &quot;GSC states are not defined by somatic copy number events&quot; since there is no gene mutation data presented for these samples.</p><p>5) The validation of the states in the TCGA data are not strong. The cut-offs seem arbitrary and most of the samples seem to fall into a single group. Is this due to sampling bias? There is no connection to tumor genetics. Also, the bulk GBM ATACseq tumor profiles were generated in the TCGA datasets that presumably have accompanying RNA, DNA, and methylation data (Corces et al., Science 2018). While this represents a small dataset, it would be advantageous to incorporate analysis of these more complex tissue samples alongside the already presented data to provide confidence in generalizability. The concordance between RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data for the paired datasets should also be presented.</p><p>6) Invasion assays should include all subtypes in order to highlight properties of the invasive subtype.</p><p>7) In order to support the claim that the &quot;Invasive-high&quot; group confers a worse prognosis, a multivariate analysis should be employed if possible.</p><p>8) There are a number of clerical errors that should be addressed:</p><p>– Figure 4—figure supplement 3A is blank</p><p>– Please double check all sample names, in Figure 3B, G613 changes from invasive to reactive and there are several instances where the sample names do not match up.</p><p>– If other samples (outside of the 27 discussed in Figure 3) were used in Figure 4, it should be made clear. G472, G440, and G473 are not in Figure 3</p><p>– A table with all the sample names, GSC subtype identified through ATAC-seq, and validation of GSC should be included</p><p>– Figure 4—figure supplement 1 G is missing labels</p><p>– Please include the GSEA gene set size.</p><p>– Describe how many essentiality genes were included for GSEA genes</p><p>– Figure 4D should be revised to better represent the number of mice were used. A detailed experimental design and the survival curve analysis should also be provided.</p><p>– Figure 2—figure supplement 1 lacks sample annotation in both the image and the figure legend.</p><p>– Figure 4—figure supplement 3 was blacked out in the version provided for review.</p><p>– There appears to be a typographical error at the start of Results paragraph five, &quot;FOXD1 is essential only in the Reactive state […]&quot;. This seems like it should be, &quot;Invasive&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The current manuscript by Guilhamon et al. uses single cell sequencing technologies to identify and then characterize heterogeneities among glioblastoma (GBM) stem cells (GSC), which extend beyond current disease classifications. Single cell technologies have already been applied to GBM in various publications. The identification of an invasive GSC subtype associated with poor survival is not novel, as it largely complements the previously identified mesenchymal GSC subtype. However, as far as I'm aware this is the first study to apply single cell sequencing specifically to glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) with the goal of identifying GSC subtypes using primarily chromatin accessibility signatures. In particular, the use of chromatin accessibility signatures in combination with TF motif prediction to guide identification of transcriptional dependencies is novel in the context of GSC studies. Thus, this manuscript would constitute a meaningful contribution to the field of GBM and epigenetics.</p><p>– Validation of GSC population enrichment should be done and shown. Particularly because despite what is described in the text, Figure 2F show low correlation between GBM stem TF enrichment and GSC signature enrichment. 2 out of 4 primary GBM show very little correlation. Therefore, GSC enrichment should be validated with other methods, such as staining for known neural stem cell markers or clustering/enrichment/scoring based on validated GSC gene sets.</p><p>– Chromatin accessibility scores at promoter regions is used as a surrogate for gene expression for numerous analyses. What is the concordance between RNA-seq and ATAC-seq for the paired datasets? Particularly, what is the concordance for the subtype specific peaks? The concordance of gene expression and chromatin accessibility feels particularly important when exclusive peaks only account for ~5-15% of all peaks.</p><p>– Invasion assays should include all subtypes in order to highlight properties of the invasive subtype. Additionally, the author's conclusions would be strengthened by the combination of FOXD1 knockdown/inhibition with the invasion assays.</p><p>– Figure 4—figure supplement 3A is blank.</p><p>– Please double check all sample names, in Figure 3B, G613 changes from invasive to reactive. There are several instances where the sample names do not match up.</p><p>– If other samples (outside of the 27 discussed in Figure 3) were used in Figure 4, it should be made clear. G472, G440, and G473 are not in Figure 3.</p><p>– Please include table with all the sample names, GSC subtype identified through ATAC-seq, and validation of GSC.</p><p>– Figure 4—figure supplement 1 G is missing labels.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Guilhamon et al. describe a single cell ATACseq study in GBM patient tissues and bulk ATACseq in a panel of patient-derived GBM stem cell cultures. Using this dataset, the authors studied the three states in glioblastoma stem cell cultures, which presents some interesting findings to the biology of GBM. The dataset generated in this study is useful to the field. There are some concerns to be addressed:</p><p>The single cell data would seem to be potentially the most important, but the number of samples is small and the degree of concordance between samples was not fully developed. It would be important to have more samples for many reasons, including the idea presented by the authors of differences between tumors in the dominant cell type. GBM has significant variation spatially, as well, so having only 4 tumors seems underpowered.</p><p>There are missing details about the tumor collection. The three groups are designated to include reactive, which has immune cell signatures, and invasive. Often the tumor does not include areas of necrosis and invasion in most surgical specimens.</p><p>Why were the GSC cultured for 5-12 passages? This would seem to induce potential selection or change the cells. If the laminin conditions are optimal, why weren't the GSC studied immediately? It would be helpful to include support for the LDAs and xenograft studies for each of the lines.</p><p>Please include the full information about tumor genetics, patient information, and treatment for each sample.</p><p>There are many very strong statements made. It would seem premature to call single cells GSC only based on transcription. I am not aware that any profile is validated to claim absolutely to identify GSC. This is but one of the leaps that were made. I would ask the authors to be more careful and simply identify exactly what was measured.</p><p>There is no direct comparison of GBM tissues and GSC cultures. The conclusion that GSCs &quot;reflect the chromatin identity of putative cancer stem cells found in primary brain tumors&quot; should be supported by more evidence. For examples, direct comparison of some important drivers or markers at the chromatin level should be provided.</p><p>The analysis of GBM cancer stem cell signature and 4 cellular states is interesting. Can the authors explain why the putative cancer stem cells were under-represented in MES cell state? Did the authors consider or separate transcription factors or markers for cancer stem cells of different types in GBM? Is there any difference between stem and non-stem cells from the same cellular state?</p><p>Is there overlap between 4 GBM tissues with scATAC data and patients with GSC culture?</p><p>The description of the mismatch between chromatin and TCGA subtype is confusing (Figure 3B). According to the description, GSCs are believed to be a relatively pure population, can the authors compare GSCs to the published GBM scRNAseq data to check the subtypes (Neftel et al., 2019, etc.)? In addition, the top and bottom panels could be combined, and the sample assignment of TCGA subtypes, chromatin clusters and expression clusters should be better presented in the sankey plot. The GSC samples and color bars showing chromatin clusters are not consistent between the top and the bottom panels, making it really difficult to understand.</p><p>It's interesting that many GSCs express immune cell related genes, which should be further explained, as the enrichment significance (FDR) is not very strong.</p><p>The differentially expressed gene analysis between three GSC states should be performed to provide state markers to have a better understanding of cellular states.</p><p>Figure 4D is difficult to understand. What's the meaning of the n? How many mice were used in the experiment? A detailed experimental design and the survival curve analysis should be provided.</p><p>The CRISPR screen would be beneficial to validate, including additional direct studies of specific targets in a larger cohort of the GSC.</p><p>The validation of the states in the TCGA data are not strong. The cutoffs seem arbitrary and most of the samples seem to fall into a single group. Is this due to sampling bias? There is no connection to tumor genetics.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Guilhamon et al. performed single-cell ATACseq in four primary IDH-wildtype glioblastomas to derive chromatin accessibility signatures of heterogeneous glioma stem cell populations. The scATACseq primary tumor analysis suggested the existence of three major modules: Reactive, Constructive, and Invasive that define glioma stem populations and are present to varying degrees within a single tumor. The module/cell state relevance is supported by leveraging new and existing functional assay data in sets of patient-derived GSC populations. The authors then demonstrate that transcription factors nominated by DNA recognition motif enrichment in each GSC state are preferentially essential through analysis of a recently published genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 essentiality screen. Finally, evidence is presented to suggest that these chromatin signatures are associated with survival in a xenograft model and TCGA subjects.</p><p>Overall, this study addresses an important biological question of glioblastoma stem cell heterogeneity and is one of the earliest papers investigating scATAC glioblastoma profiles. However, the conclusions drawn are not fully supported by the results and in some cases the technical details of the experiment/analysis are lacking. The following suggestions are intended to help strengthen this work.</p><p>1) The clarity of the paper would be aided by additional technical descriptions throughout the manuscript. For example:</p><p>a) The four GBM samples profiled using scATACseq were classified using the Neftel signatures, on the basis of accessibility of signature gene promoters. This approach will bin individual cells whether the classification is accurate, or not. How can we be sure that this approach accurately provides Neftel classification?</p><p>b) The same classification method is suggested to result in greater stratification of the Neftel MES category. This result may be confounded by the presence of tumor-associated microglia that will be classified as mesenchymal. Were all classified cells tumor cells and how was this validated?</p><p>c) It was not fully explained why single cells without evidence for either Chr7 amplification or Chr10 deletion were included in further analyses regarding glioma stem cell populations. The cells that were not labelled by &quot;GBM CNV+&quot; (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) also seem to less frequently be classified as &quot;STEM&quot; (Figure 1D, especially G4250 and G4275). Are these cells of poorer quality or do they represent non-tumor cell types? It would also be helpful to know whether the authors enriched for tumor cells during the dissociation process (otherwise one would expect non-tumor cells too), the number of nuclei that were loaded for 10X, basic quality control metrics for each sample, and if cells identified as non-tumor were excluded from construction of the chromatin modules.</p><p>2) Figure 1 was challenging to follow with the multiple annotations of the patient UMAPs. For instance, in panels 1B and 1D the original numbered clusters remain for some not all cells. Are these cells that failed to confidently classify as cell states (i.e., AC, MES, NPC, OPC) or stem states? Perhaps consider &quot;graying&quot; out cells that fail to classify and explain why not all tumor cells might have a cell state classification would benefit the audience. I could not find mention of this in the Results or Materials and methods sections. Also, what happens when all cells from the four subjects are analyzed together in a single analysis? Do shared chromatin states that exist across patients emerge or is there highly specific patient clustering that reflects inter-patient heterogeneity? Panel C in this figure was also difficult to understand. None of the modules equal to 100%, is this because some cells failed to classify?</p><p>3) Bulk GBM ATACseq tumor profiles were generated in the TCGA dataset that presumably have accompanying RNA, DNA, and methylation data (Corces et al. Science 2018). While this represents a small dataset, it would be advantageous to incorporate analysis of these more complex tissue samples alongside the already presented data to provide confidence in generalizability.</p><p>4) Figure 3 appears to be missing some critical information. Figure 3A is missing a legend as there is no indication what the intensity values represent. For Figure 3B, is there an associated P-value testing for the enrichment of TCGA subtypes among the GSC ATAC states? Figure 3C could present cut-offs for what was considered statistically significant (i.e., a dotted line). Importantly, &quot;Figure 3—figure supplement 1&quot; presents the most differentially accessible regions between GSC states. While it is difficult to read the all the regions it's notable that ChrX is present in all. I imagine that chromatin accessibility read-outs might be significantly impacted by the presence of an inactive X chromosome. If there is an imbalance in the sex distribution in the GSC states, then this might skew to picking up sex-specific and not tumor-specific differences. Have the authors shown that these regions do not vary with patient sex.</p><p>5) The set of GSCs making up the Invasive subtype are all classified as Mesenchymal by gene expression (Figure 3B), consider calling it as such for consistency?</p><p>6) The evidence that &quot;GSC states are not genetically defined (Figure 3D)&quot; is derived from DNA methylation copy number, and a signature of selected genes. Is this sufficient? What about bona fide glioblastoma genes such as PDGFRA, NF1, AKT3, QKI? Did DNA copy number profiles align with transcriptional subtypes? Do the GSC states cluster by frequent chromosome arm-level events (chr7, chr19, chr20 gains and chr10 loss)? If they still do not cluster by GSC state, then it is perhaps more accurate to say that &quot;GSC states are not defined by somatic copy number events&quot; since there is no gene mutation data presented for these samples.</p><p>7) More than one publication has speculated to be able to stratify IDH wild type glioblastoma into prognostically relevant groups, i.e. PMID 30753603.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) The tumor cell and GSC population enrichment should be validated using functional and genomic methods (including evidence for either Chr7 amplification or Chr10 deletion), and additional patient samples should be analyzed, preferably without extended culture times. Indeed, there appeared to be a low correlation between GBM stem TF enrichment and GSC signature enrichment and the degree of concordance between samples was not fully developed. It would be important to have more samples for many reasons, including the idea presented by the authors of differences between tumors in the dominant cell type. GBM has significant variation spatially, as well, so having only 4 tumors seems underpowered.</p></disp-quote><p>Evidence of chr7 and chr10 alterations at the single cell level can be found in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-D, with details presented in the Materials and methods section “Single cell ATAC-seq”, and in the main text. To further explore the concordance between samples in response to this and other comments below, we also annotated single cells that failed to classify into one of the Neftel et al. subtypes, and the number of tumours sharing UMAP modules of each state. These data can be found in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B, and in the main text.</p><p>We also conducted additional analyses into the concordance of stem cell calls by the two signatures (GSCs and the 19 stem TF signature by Suva et al., 2014). We found that the overlap in cells significantly enriched for either stem signature across the four tumours was significant (hypergeometric test p-value = 8.8 x 10<sup>−8</sup>), and this has been added to the main text.</p><p>Restrictions due to the covid-19 pandemic prevented us from obtaining and processing new samples for scATAC-seq. We however attempted to incorporate new samples into our single-cell analysis using publicly available data from the Wang et al. (Cancer Discovery, 2019) study. That study contained four IDH-wt GBM samples processed for scATAC-seq, of which three had raw data available (one sample’s data was corrupted on the EGA archive). Unfortunately, only one of the three samples had more than 350 cells available after quality control, and that sample had only 19% sequencing saturation (as compared to ~75% in our samples). Under these circumstances it was unfeasible to integrate these data into our study and perform on them the same analyses used on our samples.</p><p>Collectively, the data presented in this manuscript represent the most comprehensive study to date of single cell chromatin accessibility in glioblastoma and, as highlighted in your summary above, provide novel insights and a valuable resource to the community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Details about the tumor collection should be included as should full information about tumor genetics, patient information, and treatment for each sample.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included details of tumor collection for those samples used in the scATAC-seq as well as known patient characteristics (IDH status, sex, and age) in the Materials and methods section “Single cell ATAC-seq”. Details on sample collection for the GSCs are included in the Materials and methods section “Patient samples and cell culture”. Details on the GSC state of each GSC are in Supplementary Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1 should be revised to clarify cells which fail to classify and to signify whether shared chromatin states exist across patients.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added that information in the form of stacked bar plots in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3 should be revised. Data pertaining to GSCs should be compared to the published GBM scRNAseq data to check the subtypes (Neftel et al., 2019, etc.). In addition, the top and bottom panels could be combined, and the sample assignment of TCGA subtypes, chromatin clusters and expression clusters should be better presented in the sankey diagram. The GSC samples and color bars showing chromatin clusters should be kept consistent between the top and the bottom panels. Figure 3A is missing a legend as there is no indication of what the intensity values represent. For Figure 3B, please clearly indicate an associated P-value testing for the enrichment of TCGA subtypes among the GSC ATAC states. Figure 3C should present cut-offs for what was considered statistically significant (i.e., a dotted line). Importantly, &quot;Figure 3—figure supplement 1&quot; presents the most differentially accessible regions between GSC states. Notably, ChrX is present in all. Chromatin accessibility read-outs might be significantly impacted by the presence of an inactive X chromosome. Hence an imbalance in the sex distribution in the GSC states might pick up sex-specific and not tumor-specific differences. Thus, the authors should show that these regions do not vary with patient sex. Finally, the evidence that &quot;GSC states are not genetically defined (Figure 3D)&quot; is derived from DNA methylation copy number, and a signature of selected genes. Bona fide GBM genes such as PDGFRA, NF1, AKT3, QKI should also be included in this analysis and the possibility that the GSC states cluster by frequent chromosome arm-level events (chr7, chr19, chr20 gains and chr10 loss) should be entertained. If they still do not cluster by GSC state, then it is perhaps more accurate to say that &quot;GSC states are not defined by somatic copy number events&quot; since there is no gene mutation data presented for these samples.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s recommendations we have combined the top and bottom panels of Figure 3B, and corrected the sample labelling on the heatmap. We thank the reviewers for pointing out that error. We have additionally added a legend to both heatmaps on Figure 3A and 3B and added the GSEA Enrichment Score range to Figure 3B.</p><p>In Figure 3C only significant (q-value &lt;=0.05 after multiple test correction) terms are displayed. We have included this in the revised figure legend.</p><p>The reviewers correctly point out that sex imbalance between groups could have been a concern; we had verified there was none early in the study but failed to discuss it in the original version of this manuscript. This is now included in the Materials and methods section “ATAC-seq”.</p><p>On the reviewers’ recommendation, we have extensively updated Figure 3D, including additional samples, as well as more GBM-related genes and the large genomic events most commonly found in GBM, including on chromosomes 7,10,19 and 20. The conclusions from this analysis are maintained and we have amended the text as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The validation of the states in the TCGA data are not strong. The cut-offs seem arbitrary and most of the samples seem to fall into a single group. Is this due to sampling bias? There is no connection to tumor genetics. Also, the bulk GBM ATACseq tumor profiles were generated in the TCGA datasets that presumably have accompanying RNA, DNA, and methylation data (Corces et al. Science 2018). While this represents a small dataset, it would be advantageous to incorporate analysis of these more complex tissue samples alongside the already presented data to provide confidence in generalizability. The concordance between RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data for the paired datasets should also be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>The cut-offs and methods used in the TCGA state labelling are detailed in the Materials and methods section “Survival Analysis”. They were set at z-score of 1.65 (which corresponds to a p-value of 0.05) for the Invasive-high to identify those patients with a significant enrichment of the Invasive GSC signature. For the Invasive-mid patients, we chose a z-score between 1 and 1.65 in order to identify those patients who displayed an important enrichment of the signature even though it did not reach significance. In addition, we show in Figure 5—figure supplement 2B-C, that changing these thresholds does not alter the conclusions of the analysis.</p><p>While we appreciate the suggestion to use the Corces et al. datasets to match expression and chromatin accessibility, the 9 GBM ATAC-seq samples used in that study do not have RNA-seq data available. This can be verified in the supplementary table of the study as well as directly on the GDC data portal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Invasion assays should include all subtypes in order to highlight properties of the invasive subtype.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed numerous additional invasion assays to confirm the invasive properties of the invasive GSC state. Using a minimum of three representative GSC lines from each of the three GSC states as well as two human fetal neural stem cells (hfNSCs) as controls, we performed collagen invasion assays. For each GSC, the assay was repeated in triplicate, and at least 3 spheres were measured for each replicate. The results confirm that Invasive state GSCs are over 3-fold more invasive than GSCs from the other states or the control hfNSCs. These data can be found in Figure 5 B-C, Figure 5—figure supplement 1, in the Materials and methods section “Invasion assays”, and in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In order to support the claim that the &quot;Invasive-high&quot; group confers a worse prognosis, a multivariate analysis should be employed if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>With this analysis, we were investigating whether a particular GSC subtype enriched in a given tumour might be associated with survival. To do this we calculated the hazard ratios of the different GSC states both in the xenografts and TCGA data as shown in the Results. As no other molecular signature in GBM has so far been reported that can significantly stratify the poorer prognosis IDH wild-type patients by survival, and as using profiles from GSCs specifically has not been attempted before, there are no known covariates we could integrate into this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) There are a number of clerical errors that should be addressed:</p><p>– Figure 4—figure supplement 3A is blank</p><p>– Please double check all sample names, in Figure 3B, G613 changes from invasive to reactive and there are several instances where the sample names do not match up.</p><p>– If other samples (outside of the 27 discussed in Figure 3) were used in Figure 4, it should be made clear.
