However, understanding how GRNs evolve is hampered by finding relevant <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element (CRE) mutations, and interpreting the protein-DNA interactions they alter. We investigated evolutionary changes in the duplicated Bric-à-brac (Bab) transcription factors and a key Bab target gene in a GRN underlying the novel dimorphic pigmentation of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and its relatives. It has remained uncertain how Bab was integrated within the pigmentation GRN. Here, we show that the ancestral transcription factor activity of Bab gained a role in sculpting sex-specific pigmentation through the evolution of binding sites in a CRE of the pigment-promoting <italic>yellow</italic> gene. This work demonstrates how a new trait can evolve by incorporating existing transcription factors into a GRN through CRE evolution, an evolutionary path likely to predominate newly evolved functions of transcription factors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>gene regulatory network</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>cis-regulatory element</kwd><kwd>bric-a-brac</kwd><kwd>pigmentation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1555906</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rebeiz</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Thomas Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01GM114093-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rebeiz</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The conserved biochemical activity of the duplicate Bab transcription factors were integrated into the regulatory hierarchy of an evolving gene regulatory network by binding site gains in a target gene's cis-regulatory region.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription factors play central roles in the development and evolution of animal traits by binding to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements to spatially and temporally regulate patterns of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davidson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levine, 2010</xref>). Collectively, the complex web of connections between transcription factors and CREs form vast gene regulatory networks (GRN) that govern a tissue’s development. As transcription factor genes are generally much older than the traits they impact, a central question of evolutionary developmental biology is the relative role that gene duplication, protein coding and CRE sequence evolution play in the evolution of GRNs for novel traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stern and Orgogozo, 2008</xref>). Answers to this question require studies of recently evolved traits for which the derived and ancestral states of genes and gene components can be inferred through manipulative studies of GRN function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rebeiz and Williams, 2011</xref>).</p><p>One such experimentally tractable trait is the rapidly evolving pigmentation patterns that adorn the abdominal cuticle of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and its close relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rebeiz and Williams, 2017</xref>). The melanic pigmentation of the dorsal cuticle tergites covering the A5 and A6 abdominal segments of males has been inferred to be a novelty that evolved in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> lineage after it diverged from an ancestral monomorphically pigmented lineage within the <italic>Sophophora</italic> subgenus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al., 2006</xref>). Within the GRN controlling this trait, the Hox gene <italic>Abd-B</italic> plays an important role in activating the expression of terminal enzyme genes that are required for pigment formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). One enzyme, encoded by the <italic>yellow</italic> gene is activated through a CRE known as the ‘body element’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wittkopp et al., 2002</xref>) that possesses at least two binding sites for the Hox factor Abd-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> females, <italic>yellow</italic> expression is repressed in the A5 and A6 segments through its regulation by the tandem duplicate <italic>bab1</italic> and <italic>bab2</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al., 2006</xref>), collectively referred to as Bab. Both paralogs encode proteins that possess a conserved BTB domain that functions in homodimerization and heterodimerization, and a conserved domain with pipsqueak (psq) and AT-hook domains that together confer a similar in vitro DNA-binding capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lours et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast to the 78% amino acid identity observed for both BTB and conserved domain of the paralogs, amino acid identity drops to ~26% throughout the remainder of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couderc et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

This dimorphic pattern of Bab expression required changes to two CREs controlling Bab’s abdominal epidermis expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Williams et al., 2008</xref>). Although this dimorphic pattern of regulation allows <italic>yellow</italic> to be expressed in the epidermis underlying the pigmented male A5 and A6 segment tergites, several questions remain unanswered pertaining to how and when Bab was incorporated into the sexually dimorphic pigmentation GRN. Specifically, is <italic>yellow</italic> a direct target of Bab repression, and was it a target of regulation prior to the evolution of the dimorphic trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gompel and Carroll, 2003</xref>)? Moreover, to what extent did gene duplication, protein coding sequence, and CRE evolution contribute to this derived trait?</p><p>In this study, we sought to characterize the derived functions of Bab1 and Bab2 in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> pigmentation GRN and determine the extent to which this derived pigmentation function additionally required evolutionary changes to Bab protein coding sequences and the 5’ <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region of <italic>yellow</italic> that contains its abdominal CRE. We found that Bab1 and Bab2 bind directly to the <italic>yellow</italic> body CRE to a region required for male-limited enhancer activity. Moreover, the capability of Bab paralogs to function in this repressive manner appears to result not from protein-coding changes, but instead through the evolution of these binding sites which arose contemporaneously with the derived pattern of dimorphic Bab expression. Thus, the origin of the male-specific pigmentation of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is an example where evolutionarily conserved transcription factors gained a new function through their integration into a GRN by CRE evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bab1 suppresses <italic>yellow</italic> expression through <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element encodings</title><p>We sought to characterize how Bab1 exerts its influence on a minimal 0.6 kb body element CRE (yBE0.6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camino et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) that drives male-limited GFP reporter transgene expression in the dorsal epidermis of the A5 and A6 abdominal segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). This reporter transgene activity matches the spatial, sex-limited, and temporal pattern of abdominal expression of <italic>yellow</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camino et al., 2015</xref>). We designed a set of 10 mutant yBE0.6 CREs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>) to localize regions responsible for this element’s sex-limited activity. In each mutant yBE0.6, we introduced a block of ~70–85 base pairs in which every other base pair possessed non-complementary transversion mutations and compared its activity to the wild type CRE in transgenic <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camino et al., 2015</xref>). While 8 of 10 ‘scanning mutant’ CREs showed wild type reporter repression in the female abdomen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), we observed increased expression in the A5 and A6 segments of the SM4 and SM10 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Moreover, the increased expression was more pronounced when the SM4 and SM10 mutations were combined in the same reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These results identified two CRE sub-regions that are required to suppress <italic>yellow</italic> expression in the posterior female abdomen, likely through the recruitment of a transcriptional repressor protein.</p><p>We speculated that the sequences altered by the SM4 and SM10 mutations normally function to respond either directly or indirectly to the repressive Bab proteins. When Bab1 was ectopically expressed in the dorsal midline of the male abdomen by the GAL4/UAS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calleja et al., 2000</xref>), yBE0.6 reporter expression was largely suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>). However, a yBE0.6 CRE containing the SM4 and SM10 mutations, was unresponsive to ectopic Bab1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). These data reveal that the SM4 and SM10 CRE regions encode inputs that respond to regulation by Bab proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Bab1 directly interacts with multiple <italic>yellow</italic> CRE binding sites</title><p>Bab proteins may suppress the yBE0.6 CRE activity through two major routes: indirect or direct regulations. Bab may indirectly regulate the yBE0.6 CRE by controlling the expression of a transcription factor that interacts with binding sites in the SM4 and SM10 regions. On the other hand, Bab may directly interact with binding sites in the yBE0.6 CRE, acting as a transcriptional repressor. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we performed gel shift assays to see whether Bab specifically interacts with sequences within the SM4 and SM10 regions in vitro. Previously, it was shown that the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of Bab1 and Bab2 bound to similar DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lours et al., 2003</xref>); therefore, we chose to perform our experiments with the Bab1 DBD.</p><p>The SM4 region is 70 base pairs (bp) in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which we divided into three overlapping sub element regions that were tested for binding by serial two-fold dilutions of a GST fusion protein possessing the Bab1 DNA-binding domain (Bab1 DBD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Of the three regions, only the third probe was substantially bound by the Bab1 DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). This binding was DNA-sequence specific, as a scanning mutant probe version failed to similarly shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

We found that three of these mutant probes were still bound and shifted by the Bab1 DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–K</xref>). However, the sub2 probe that spanned nine base-pairs and disrupted two of the TA motifs was not noticeably shifted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Collectively, this set of gel shift assays supports a direct Bab1 binding mechanism to suppress this CRE sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, red sequence).</p><p>We performed a similar set of gel shift assays to localize Bab1 binding within the 85 bp SM10 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We tested three overlapping sub element regions for an interaction with the Bab1 DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>), and observed mobility shifts for the first and third regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and E</xref>). A scanning mutant version of the third region was bound, albeit to a lesser extent, by Bab1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), indicating that this in vitro binding was not sequence-specific or that the mutant probe created a weak Bab-binding site. Therefore, we focused our attention on the first region for which a scan mutant probe was not noticeably bound by the Bab1 DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We next analyzed four small mutant versions (sub1-sub4) of the first region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–K</xref>). While each mutant probe appeared to be bound to a lesser extent than the wild type probe, the sub3 mutant probe showed little-to-no binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). These results suggest the presence of at least one additional Bab-binding site in the SM10 region. Collectively, our results support a direct model of regulation in which Bab1 functions as a DNA-binding transcription factor that interacts with at least two sites within the yBE0.6 CRE and thereby represses the expression of this CRE in the female abdomen where Bab1 is highly expressed.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32273.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The yBE0.6 possesses a binding site for Bab in the SM10 region.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The wild type DNA sequence of the SM10 region is shown, which was subdivided into three smaller regions annotated below that were used as double stranded probes in gel shift assays with the GST-Bab1 DNA-binding Domain (Bab1-DBD).

expressive phenotype if both paralogs’ expression were suppressed. To test this prediction, we created ‘chained’ shmiRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haley et al., 2010</xref>) to co-express the effective <italic>bab1</italic> shmiR (Id #3) separately with each <italic>bab2</italic> shmiR (Id #12 and #16). We found that these chained shmiR transgenes, when ectopically expressed in the dorsal midline resulted in more expansive ectopic pigmentation phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). Notably, for one chained combination, ectopic pigmentation included the A4 tergites of males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, red arrowheads). These results show that <italic>bab1</italic> and <italic>bab2</italic> paralog expression are necessary to fully suppress tergite pigmentation, including the A4 segment of males and females.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the RNAi phenotypes were most extreme in the female abdomen as the pupal male abdomen lacks significant <italic>bab1</italic> and <italic>bab2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salomone et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies have shown that both <italic>bab1</italic> and <italic>bab2</italic> are sufficient to suppress male tergite pigmentation when ectopically expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couderc et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kopp et al., 2000</xref>). However, direct comparisons of the individual paralogs were hampered by the positional effects associated with random insertion of <italic>bab</italic> paralog open-reading frame (ORF) transgenes into different genomic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couderc et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kopp et al., 2000</xref>). Here, we created transgenes with the <italic>D. melanogaster bab1</italic> and <italic>bab2</italic> ORFs under UAS regulation that were integrated site-specifically into the attP40 site on the second chromosome. In the absence of a GAL4 driver, leaky expression of these transgenes resulted in reduced pigmentation of the male A5 and A6 tergites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). When we drove ectopic expression of these ORFs in the dorsal midline by the <italic>pnr-GAL4</italic> chromosome, we failed to recover viable adult males which possessed the UAS-<italic>bab1</italic> ORF transgene, indicating that the ectopic-expression phenotype was lethal. While we obtained fewer than expected offspring with ectopic expression of the <italic>bab2</italic> ORF than expected for independent assortment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), some adults were identified. For these specimens, tergite pigmentation was eliminated in the dorsal midline of males, and a non-specific split tergite phenotype was seen for both males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To test whether this compromised ability to bind DNA in vitro has in vivo significance, we created a <italic>bab1</italic> ORF transgene that possesses both the psq and AT-Hook mutations (called <italic>bab1</italic> DNA-binding mutant or <italic>bab1</italic> DBM, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>) and incorporated this transgene into the same genomic site as our other UAS transgenes. We found that leaky expression of the <italic>bab1</italic> DBM was insufficient to suppress tergite pigmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Moreover, ectopic expression of the Bab1 DBM by the <italic>pnr-GAL4</italic> driver resulted in detectable accumulation of nuclear protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>) which did not induce lethality or a pigmentation phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). Similarly, expression of the Bab1 DBM in the <italic>y-GAL4</italic> pattern resulted in males with the wild type melanic tergites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Collectively, these results lend further support to a model in which DNA binding is required for the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Bab paralogs to repress tergite pigmentation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Functional equivalence of bab homologs for the suppression of tergite pigmentation</title><p>The currently favored model for the origin of the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> sexually dimorphic tergite pigmentation posits that it evolved from an ancestor that expressed Bab in a sexually monomorphic manner, and for which melanic pigmentation in males and females was limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kopp et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salomone et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, CRE evolution has prominently factored into the origin of this dimorphic pigmentation trait, as changes in CREs of <italic>bab</italic> have been previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Williams et al., 2008</xref>). The possibility that Bab protein coding sequence evolution has additionally contributed has largely remained untested. To investigate whether the Bab1 and Bab2 proteins have functionally evolved, we created UAS-regulated transgenes possessing the <italic>D. willistoni bab1</italic> and <italic>D. mojavensis bab2</italic> ORFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). These orthologous protein coding sequences come from fruit fly species presumed to possess the ancestral sexually monomorphic patterns of pigmentation and Bab expression. At the time this study was initiated, the <italic>D. willistoni bab2</italic> ORF included far fewer codons than the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ortholog, indicating that the full ORF remained uncharacterized. Thus, we opted to use the ORF for the <italic>D. mojavensis</italic> ortholog. As seen for the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ORF transgenes, leaky expression from the attP2 genomic site of transgene insertion resulted in a similar reduction in male A5 and A6 tergite pigmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> <italic>D. willistoni bab1</italic>; and 6E, <italic>D. mojavensis bab2</italic>). Pigmentation was dramatically suppressed when these orthologous proteins were ectopically expressed in the dorsal medial midline pattern of <italic>pnr-GAL4</italic>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) and <italic>y-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref> <italic>D. willistoni bab1</italic>; and 6K, <italic>D. mojavensis bab2</italic>). These results suggest that the ability of the Bab1 and Bab2 proteins to regulate dimorphic pigmentation did not require the evolution of an altogether new biochemical capability.</p><p>The origin of the Bab1 and Bab2 paralogs likely resulted from a duplication event that occurred in the evolutionary history of the Dipteran order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This scenario is supported by the findings that all species of fruit flies with sequenced genomes and the Tsetse fly <italic>Glossina morsitans</italic> possess <italic>bab1</italic> and <italic>bab2</italic> paralogs, whereas basally branching Dipteran species such as <italic>Anopheles</italic> (<italic>A.</italic>) <italic>gambiae</italic> and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> only possess a single paralog. Moreover, the genomes of the flour beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> and the moth <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, from orders closely related to Diptera, each possess a single <italic>bab</italic> gene. We were curious as to whether the pigmentation and gene regulatory functions of the derived <italic>bab</italic> paralogs were present in the pre-duplication <italic>bab</italic> gene. To test this hypothesis, we created a UAS-regulated ORF transgene for the <italic>A. gambiae bab</italic> gene to use as a surrogate for the pre-duplication ancestral <italic>bab</italic> gene. We found that like all other <italic>bab</italic> orthologs tested in this study, leaky expression of the <italic>A. gambiae bab</italic> gene resulted in reduced pigmentation in the male A5 and A6 tergites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Moreover, forced ectopic expression driven by <italic>pnr-GAL4</italic> and <italic>y-GAL4</italic> both resulted in more extensive repression of tergite pigmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). These outcomes are consistent with the interpretation that the general functional capability of these proteins was ancient and has been conserved during the 100 million years or more since the gene duplication event occurred. However, these experiments cannot rule out the possibility that some changes have occurred in the <italic>bab</italic> protein coding sequences that cause incremental differences in the ability to regulate dimorphic pigmentation. In fact, the further reduced pigmentation caused by the Bab1 orthologs compared to those for Bab2, and <italic>A. gambiae</italic> Bab suggests that such incremental enhancements have indeed occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>We sought to determine whether the functional equivalence of the distantly related Bab orthologs can also be seen at the level of target gene regulation. Here, we focused on the capability of the orthologs to repress the expression of the Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) reporter transgene expression driven by the sequence 5’ of <italic>yellow</italic> exon one that contains the wing element and body element CREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) from the dimorphic species <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–G</xref>) and <italic>D. malerkotliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H–M</xref>).

We observed the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> orthologs were similarly capable of repressing reporter transgenes regulated by the <italic>yellow</italic> regulatory regions of both dimorphic species.

We compared the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Bab-binding sites from the SM4 and SM10 regions to the orthologous gene regions from species descending from either a dimorphic or monomorphic pigmented ancestor (Figure 9A). This analysis revealed orthologous sequences with several conserved nucleotides among the body elements of species descending from a dimorphic pigmented common ancestor (Figure 9A, node 1).

Dimorphic pigmentation is thought to have derived from a monomorphic ancestral state in the lineage of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> after it diverged from that for <italic>D. willistoni</italic> and perhaps even as recently as the <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> split in the <italic>Sophophora</italic> subgenus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salomone et al., 2013</xref>). Assuming this scenario is generally correct, then when and how did Bab become a part of this GRN? One plausible explanation is that Bab regulated the expression of pigmentation genes prior to the emergence of this dimorphic trait, perhaps as a part of an antecedent dimorphic GRN. One study provided data consistent with this scenario, showing that Bab2 expression often, but not always, displayed an anti-correlation to where melanic pigmentation developed on fruit fly tergites, including non-<italic>Sophophora</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gompel and Carroll, 2003</xref>). If Bab had an ancient role in regulating the expression of pigmentation genes such as <italic>yellow</italic>, then dimorphic pigmentation could have evolved by re-deploying a conserved Bab-responsive CRE in the abdomen. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that an abdominal epidermis CRE activity is present in the <italic>yellow</italic> gene intron of the monomorphic pigmented species such as <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>, <italic>D. willistoni</italic>, and the non-Sophophoran species <italic>D. virilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalay and Wittkopp, 2010</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable for the Bab-body element linkage to have been present, while the monomorphic activity of this second <italic>yellow</italic> CRE masked the dimorphic regulation of the body element.</p><p>However, various data are difficult to reconcile with this re-deployment model. First, the melanic species <italic>D. virilis</italic> expresses Bab1 and Bab2 throughout the male and female abdomens suggesting an inability of Bab to suppress pigmentation genes such as <italic>yellow</italic> in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salomone et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the regulation of <italic>yellow</italic> by Bab in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is limited to the body element CRE in which we found Bab binding sites. This is significant as clearly identifiable orthologs to the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> body element remains difficult to identify in more distantly related fruit fly species hailing from monomorphically pigmented lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), although the wing element and its activity has remained well-conserved by comparison. Thus, there is no evidence for an ancient linkage between Bab and an antecedent of the <italic>yellow</italic> body element. While an ancestral <italic>bab-yellow</italic> linkage may exist for a yet unidentified trait, the activation of <italic>yellow</italic> in the well-studied male-specific spot that adorns the wings of <italic>D. biarmipes</italic> is <italic>bab</italic>-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnoult et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gompel et al., 2005</xref>).

Thus, the co-option of either Bab or Abd-B would be insufficient to account for the origin of this dimorphic trait.</p><p>Based upon the available data, it seems much more likely that Bab was integrated into an antecedent GRN to play a key role in differentiating the expression outcomes between males and females. This integration involved the remodeling of existing CREs controlling Bab expression in the abdominal epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rogers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Williams et al., 2008</xref>), and the acquisition of <italic>yellow</italic> as a direct target of regulation through the formation of binding sites in the emergent body element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). At this point, it is unclear whether dimorphic Bab expression preceded the evolution of Bab sites in the <italic>yellow</italic> body element CRE or if the Bab sites evolved first. One hint to this puzzle may lie in <italic>D. pseudoobscura,</italic> a species whose <italic>yellow</italic> body element CRE is mildly Bab-responsive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), but for which Bab expression retains its ancestral monomorphic expression. This might suggest that the capability to respond (albeit weakly) to Bab evolved first, followed by the evolution of dimorphic Bab expression patterns. Further, the evolutionary connections identified here represent a subset of the connections downstream of Bab. While the <italic>yellow</italic> body CRE contains separable activating and repressing inputs, the gene <italic>tan</italic>, which is co-expressed with <italic>yellow</italic> appears to have a very different encoding for dimorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camino et al., 2015</xref>). Extensive mutagenesis of the <italic>tan</italic> MSE failed to find any mutations that relaxed dimorphic expression, suggesting that activating and repressing inputs are overlapping, or are closely situated in this CREs DNA sequence. Future studies of this GRN will illuminate how the network downstream of Bab was elaborated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The incorporation of old transcription factors into new networks</title><p>We suggest that the increased complexity of the dimorphic pigmentation GRN through the integration of the Bab transcription factors by CRE evolution will exemplify a common mechanism whereby increasingly sophisticated GRNs have come about to regulate traits throughout the animal kingdom. The vast majority of transcription factor binding specificities remain conserved over long evolutionary periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nitta et al., 2015</xref>), and many of these factors are functionally equivalent between distantly related taxa. The exceptions to this trend may represent rare examples of transcription factor diversification that occurred in the distant past, and thus are limited to a vanishingly small number of traits, or may represent examples of developmental systems drift in which the molecular mechanisms change, but the outcome remains the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">True and Haag, 2001</xref>). Studying more recent trait divergence allows one to more clearly discern phenotypically relevant evolutionary changes from those involving systems drift. Tests of regulatory sequence divergence are particularly hampered by drift, as sequence divergence is rapid and CREs from distantly related taxa often work poorly in heterologous transgenic environments. Thus, further comparisons of genetically tractable traits that arose over similarly recent timescales, in which protein coding and <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence can be directly compared in vivo are required to unveil the nature of this broader trend.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">bab1</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">FLYB:FBgn0004870</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">bab2</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">FLYB:FBgn0025525</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">yellow</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">FLYB:FBgn0004034</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">pnr-Gal4</td><td valign="top">Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center</td><td valign="top">BDSC:3039</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">y-Gal4</td><td valign="top">Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center</td><td valign="top">BDSC:44267;

In brief, an overnight bacterial culture was grown at 37°C in LB media with 200 μg/ml Ampicillin.

After a 15 minute (min) incubation on ice, DTT was added to 5 mM and Sarkosyl to 1.5%. The bacterial suspension was subjected to 4 rounds of sonication on ice at 33 amps for 1 min each round with, and a 1-min rest between rounds. 1 ml of glutathione agarose (Thermo Scientific) was then added to the suspension and allowed to mix for 15 min with nutation at 4°C.

Collected aliquots were combined and concentrated using Vivaspin 20 spin columns with a 100,000 MWCO (Sartorious). The purified GST-Bab1 DBD protein was snap frozen using a dry ice ethanol bath, and stored in aliquots at −74°C.</p><p>Reverse complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies) that contain wild type or mutant yBE0.6 sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">4</xref>).

In brief, all oligonucleotides were biotin-labeled on their 3’ end using the DNA 3’ End Biotinylation Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham MA) using the manufacture’s protocol. Biotin-labeled complementary oligonucleotides were annealed to form double stranded probes, and labeling efficiency was evaluated by the manufacturer’s quantitative Dot Blot assay. Binding reactions included 25 fmol of probe and GST-Bab1 DBD protein in General Footprint Buffer (working concentration of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 12.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.05 mM EDTA, and 17% glycerol). For each probe, separate binding reactions were done that included 4000 ng, 2000 ng, 1000 ng, 500 ng, and 0 ng of the GST-Bab1 DBD protein. Binding reactions were carried out for 30 min at room temperature and then size separated by electrophoresis through a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel for 60 min at 200 V. Following electrophoresis, the samples were transferred and cross linked to a Hybond-N +membrane (GE Healthcare Amersham) for chemiluminescent detection using the Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module and manufacture’s protocol (Thermo Scientific).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cis-regulatory evolution integrated the Bric-à-brac transcription factors into a novel fruit fly gene regulatory network&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors study how an ancient transcription factor became integrated into a gene regulatory network (GRN) underlying the novel sexually dimorphic abdominal pigmentation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. Specifically, the authors elucidate the regulatory linkage between the two key TFs in this GRN, the Bab paralog pair, and the effector pigmentation pathway gene, yellow. They address two main questions: 1) How and when was Bab incorporated into the dimorphic pigmentation GRN? 2) To what extent did gene duplication, protein coding sequence and CRE evolution contribute to the derived trait? The experiments conducted to address these questions were well-designed and the paper is well written. We have a few major requests for revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide a more complete introduction to the GRN under study. For example, Abd-B is mentioned throughout the text, but the exact role of this TF in this network is rather unclear. Either elaborating <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, or having a diagram of the whole GRN in (or as) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> will better contextualize the Bab-yellow regulatory linkage and will help orient the readers, when discussing the different components of the GRN in the text.</p><p>2) Tone down the language related to the evolutionary conservation of Bab functions after duplication. Over-expressing a gene with the GAL4-UAS system produces protein levels that are not in the physiological range. So, it is likely that the amount of bab in epidermal cells is saturating. Indeed, this might be the reason why the level of suppression of yBE0.6 is so similar for all bab homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). With the assay used, it cannot be claimed that the function of these genes has been conserved and that the suppressive capabilities of homologs are similar. For example, DNA binding affinity might have changed, but this wasn't visible because of the over-expression of these proteins, which might pass a threshold. To be clear, we are not asking for additional experiments to address this point given the time and effort required. Rather, we are asking you to solve this issue by softening the conclusions. A sequence comparison showing there have not been radical amino acid changes in Bab homologs would also be helpful to include. The following three sentences, for example, should be modified: &quot;by these ectopic expression assays, we find that not only are the Bab paralogs sufficient to suppress pigmentation when ectopically expressed, but that their suppressive capabilities are similar&quot;; &quot;These results suggest that the ability of the Bab1 and Bab2 proteins to regulate dimorphic pigmentation did not require noteworthy changes in their protein coding sequences&quot;; &quot;These outcomes are consistent with the interpretation that the general functional capability of these proteins was ancient and has been generally conserved during the 100 million years or more since the gene duplication event occurred&quot;.</p><p>3) Refine your conclusions regarding Bab evolution. The regulation of this enhancer by Bab (bab1+bab2) is probably a derived condition, and the regulation of yellow by Bab evolved at roughly the same time as the regulation of bab by Abd-B (another regulatory linkage that contributes to sexually dimorphic pigmentation). However, this conclusion comes with the caveat that taxon sampling in this study is very limited. It remains possible that the bab-yellow linkage is more ancient but has been lost/reduced in some clades.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32273.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide a more complete introduction to the GRN under study.

Specifically, we changed “Here we show that Bab gained a role in sculpting sex-specific pigmentation through the evolution of binding sites in a CRE of the pigment-promoting <italic>yellow</italic> gene and without any noteworthy changes to Bab protein coding sequences.” to “Here we show that the ancestral transcription factor activity of Bab gained a role in sculpting sex-specific pigmentation through the evolution of binding sites in a CRE of the pigment-promoting <italic>yellow</italic> gene.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Refine your conclusions regarding Bab evolution.
