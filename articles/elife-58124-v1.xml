into polarized neurons is a well-coordinated process which has mostly been studied in classical non-human model systems, but to what extent these findings are recapitulated in human neurons remains unclear. To study neuronal polarization in human neurons, we cultured hiPSC-derived neurons, characterized early developmental stages, measured electrophysiological responses, and systematically profiled transcriptomic and proteomic dynamics during these steps. The neuron transcriptome and proteome shows extensive remodeling, with differential expression profiles of ~1100 transcripts and ~2200 proteins during neuronal differentiation and polarization. We also identified a distinct axon developmental stage marked by the relocation of axon initial segment proteins and increased microtubule remodeling from the distal (stage 3a) to the proximal (stage 3b) axon. This developmental transition coincides with action potential maturation. Our comprehensive characterization and quantitative map of transcriptome and proteome dynamics provides a solid framework for studying polarization in human neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hiPSC-derived neuron</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>proteome</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>polarity</kwd><kwd>axon</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>617050</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lindhout</surname><given-names>Feline W</given-names></name><name><surname>Stucchi</surname><given-names>Riccardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001826</institution-id><institution>ZonMw</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>912.16.058</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kooistra</surname><given-names>Robbelien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003404</institution-id><institution>Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16NEPH05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herstel</surname><given-names>Lotte J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A dynamic qualitative and quantitative map of human iPSC-derived neuronal stem cells transitioning into polarized neurons with the identification and characterization of a previously unrecognized axon developmental stage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal development is a complex multistep process in which neurons undergo dramatic morphological changes, including axon outgrowth, dendritogenesis, and synapse formation. Much of the fundamental knowledge about neuronal development is based on experimental studies in non-human model systems, such as <italic>Drosophila, C. elegans</italic>, mice and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao and Bhattacharyya, 2018</xref>). However, to what extent the knowledge obtained in these animal models can be extrapolated to human neuronal development remains largely unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao and Bhattacharyya, 2018</xref>). Moreover, analysis of human-specific characteristics of dynamic processes in neurons is hindered by the difficulty in obtaining human brain tissue. The generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has provided a critical step forward for studying the development and function of human neuronal cells.</p><p>In recent years, many labs have used human iPSC-derived neuronal cultures to study fundamental neurobiological questions. This has contributed to our understanding of processes such as neuronal development, spine development and synaptic plasticity in human neurons. For example, human iPSC-derived model systems have been used to study dynamic changes in gene expression during early neurogenesis, and to study differentiation of neuronal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Compagnucci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grassi et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, human synaptic transmission and plasticity have been studied at single cell level in hiPSC-derived neurons, and human-specific protein functions have been shown to regulate excitatory synaptic transmission specifically in human neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meijer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marro et al., 2019</xref>). These examples illustrate how the use of human iPSC-derived neurons as a model system can lead to novel findings for human neurodevelopment.</p><p>One of the classic model systems to study neuronal development and polarity are the dissociated rat hippocampal neuron cultures developed by Banker and collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dotti et al., 1988</xref>). These neurons undergo five well-defined developmental stages, transforming from round, spherical cells to fully mature, polarized neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Craig and Banker, 1994</xref>). First, the symmetric young neurons form small processes (stage 1) and multiple neurites (stage 2). Next, the cells undergo polarization, where one neurite is specified as the axon (stage 3), while the remaining neurites will further develop into dendrites. The axon rapidly extends and further matures during which is assembles an axon initial segment (AIS) at the proximal axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leterrier, 2018</xref> ). The AIS is required for generating action potentials (APs) and maintaining neuronal polarity. In addition to the classic AIS component Ankyrin-G (AnkG), the microtubule binding protein Trim46 also localizes to the AIS and is critical for axon formation by forming parallel microtubule bundles in the proximal axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Beuningen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gumy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harterink et al., 2018</xref>). As the neuron matures, the developing axons and dendrites undergo significant morphological and molecular changes and form dendritic spines (stage 4–5), which allow for the formation of synaptic contacts and the establishment of functional neuron-to-neuron interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris and Kater, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fletcher et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grabrucker et al., 2009</xref>). In depth proteomic analysis of dissociated rat neurons in culture have identified a number of specific pathways and unique protein profiles that contribute to various aspects of neurodevelopment processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frese et al., 2017</xref>). Proper characterization and quantitative profiling of transcriptome and proteome dynamics is essential to study the specific neurodevelopment events in human iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, including early developmental changes such as neuronal polarization and axon specification.</p><p>In this study, we performed extensive characterization of the early developmental stages of hiPSC-derived neurons by immunocytochemistry, electrophysiology, RNA sequencing, and stable isotope labeling combined with high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We established transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of the early developmental stages (stage 1–3), comprising 14,551 transcripts and 7512 protein identifications, of which we assessed 1163 and 2218 factors that showed differential expression, respectively. These transcriptomic and proteomic profiles point to the importance of microtubule cytoskeleton remodeling in the early stage of neuronal development. Combining this framework with additional methods such as genetic manipulation and live-cell imaging allowed us to investigate the cellular and molecular processes during neuronal polarization and axon outgrowth. Specifically, we identified a distinct, previously unrecognized developmental stage during early axon development, characterized by the reorganization of the axonal microtubule network and relocation of AIS proteins from the distal to proximal axon. The transition through these early axon developmental stages coincided with the time window in which maturation of action potentials occurred. Together, our study provides a quantitative description of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of hiPSC-derived neuron cultures, which is a rich resource for further analyses of critical signaling pathways during early human neurodevelopment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of developmental stages in human iPSC-derived neurons</title><p>We first systematically assessed if the human iPSC-derived neurons proceed through the initial neurodevelopmental stages, which have previously been described in dissociated rat neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dotti et al., 1988</xref>). The hiPSC-derived neuron cultures were obtained by neuronal induction of neuronal stem cells (NSCs) and maintained up to ~15 days. Neurons transited through early neurodevelopmental stages 1–3, which was mapped by transducing neurons with FUGW-GFP lentivirus to visualize cell morphologies, and immunostaining them at different timepoints (day 1, 5 and 14) for proliferation marker Ki67 and NSC marker Nestin to identify NSCs (stage 1), neuron specific markers ß3-Tubulin and MAP2 to identify differentiated neurons (stage 2 and on), and AIS markers AnkG and Trim46 to discriminate between non-polarized (stage 2) and polarized neurons (stage 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Differentiated neurons adopted a cortical identity, as shown by the appearance of cortical marker Ctip2 in ß3-Tubulin positive cells specifically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The transition from NSCs to polarized cortical neurons was confirmed by western blot analyses of the cultures at different timepoints (day 1, 5 and 14): NSC markers Nestin and Sox2 reduced over time, while neuron marker ß3-Tubulin and axon markers Trim46 and Gap43 increased as cells differentiated and polarized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Together, these markers indicated a clear developmental transition of human early neurodevelopment over time: stage 1 NSCs (~day 1) differentiated into stage 2 neurons with a characteristic neuronal morphology (~day 5), and subsequently developed axons containing AIS structures (~day 14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). Accordingly, the timing of AIS assembly at day ~13–14 coincided with an observed developmental decrease of axon width, whereas dendrite width remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Successful AIS assembly at relatively similar timepoints was confirmed using different neuronal differentiation protocols and NSCs from different donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). These observations indicate that hiPSC-derived NSCs follow a relatively prolonged neuronal and axonal development compared to dissociated rat neurons, consistent with the protracted development of the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dotti et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Petanjek et al., 2011</xref>). This further supports the emerging evidence revealing species-dependent differences in developmental timing of human and non-human neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nicholas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Otani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Linaro et al., 2019</xref>). We further analyzed the structural organization of the AIS in axons of hiPSC-derived neurons by quantifying the average fluorescence intensity profiles of Trim46 and AnkG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Consistent with previous reports in dissociated rat neurons, we found that Trim46 and AnkG localization largely overlapped, with the peak of AnkG intensity located ~6 µm more distally than the peak Trim46 intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Beuningen et al., 2015</xref>). The AIS structure was also enriched for voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV), which strongly overlapped with AnkG structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). In summary, these data demonstrate that human iPSC-derived neurons follow the characteristic sequence of developmental stages during neuronal polarization, which occurs at a relatively slower rate than in non-human neurons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Successful and protracted transition through early developmental stages in human iPSC-derived neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration and timing of neurodevelopmental stages 1, 2 and 3 in human iPSC-derived NSCs/neurons.

Neuronal excitability was further analyzed in neurons generated using our standard protocol and cell line, by quantifying the number of APs in response to increasing current stimuli (steps of 5 pA; 400 ms) in 54 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). Of these, 22 neurons (41%) fired multiple times upon higher current stimulation, while 32 neurons (59%) fired only once, independent of stimulus strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Neurons that fired a single AP showed more immature intrinsic cell properties, including depolarized resting membrane potential, lower input resistance, smaller maximum sodium current and smaller after-hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>). Spontaneous AP firing or incoming spontaneous synaptic responses were only observed in a few neurons (4/22). This is in line with previous studies reporting that synapse formation typically starts around two weeks after neuronal induction in human iPSC-derived neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Together, the immunofluorescence and electrophysiology data indicate that human iPSC-derived neurons develop functional axons after neuronal polarization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Transcriptomic profiling of developing human iPSC-derived neurons</title><p>To assess global changes in gene expression during differentiation and neuronal polarization, we next performed an unbiased, in-depth analysis of the transcript expression profiles during early neuronal development. We collected human iPSC-derived neurons at the previously described developmental stages and monitored mRNA expression changes using quantitative population-based transcriptome analysis. The synchronized differentiation and relatively slow development of these cultures enabled us to select time points at which particular stages manifested in the majority of the cells. The cells were sampled for RNA analysis at days 1, 3, and 7, corresponding to stage 1, the onset of stage 2, and the onset of stage 3, respectively. On the same days, we collected samples for in-depth proteome analysis, which is discussed below. In two biological replicates with two technical replicates each, we identified transcripts corresponding to 14,551 genes by RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Of these, 9655 transcripts were successfully quantified at all time points and normalized to reads per million for further analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). As expected, most genes with significantly altered expression were found between day 1 and day 7: 614 genes were downregulated and 549 genes were upregulated at day 7 compared to day 1 (FDR &lt; 0.05 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>]). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of downregulated genes indicates that many of the top enriched GO terms relate to processes involved in cell proliferation, such as DNA replication, cell cycle, and cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>). Upregulated genes correspond to several cellular components and biological processes including nervous system development, neuron projection, and axonogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>). Consistently, upregulation of many genes related to neurodevelopment and axonogenesis was previously observed in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and iPSCs as well as human ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, upregulated genes also showed enrichment of multiple GO terms related to the microtubule cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Among the highly downregulated genes were several proliferation factors, such as SOX2, NOTCH1, and OTX2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>). Furthermore, the chromokinesin motor proteins KIF4a and KIF22, involved in cell proliferation through regulation of spindle microtubule dynamics during mitosis, were downregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida and Maiato, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bisht et al., 2019</xref>).

Additionally, the neuron-specific tubulin TUBB3 and the axonal microtubule associated protein MAPT were upregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>).

We collected samples for proteome analysis on the same days as described above for RNA sequencing. We identified 7512 proteins in two technical replicates and quantified 5620 proteins across all three time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata5">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>). Of these, 2218 proteins showed a changed expression profile during differentiation and neurodevelopment. We assessed the global proteome changes by unsupervised clustering, and identified six clusters with distinct expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata5">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>). Proteins in clusters 1, 2, and 3 were upregulated, and proteins present in cluster 4, 5, and 6 were downregulated during early neuronal development. Moreover, many proteins within specific clusters showed overlap in functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata5">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>). Cluster 1 contains proteins that show a slight increase from day 1 to day 7. GO enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of several terms related to neuronal differentiation and intracellular transport mechanisms, which reflects cell-autonomous remodeling of molecular processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata5">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>). One of the upregulated proteins in cluster one is KLC1, a subunit of the microtubule motor protein, which was found to be required for neuronal differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Killian et al., 2012</xref>). The AIS protein Trim46, which is known to regulate neuronal polarity and axon specification by controlling microtubule organization during development, is also found in this cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Beuningen et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, this cluster contains Camsap1, Camsap2 and Camsap3, proteins which localize to the minus ends of microtubules to stabilize them, thereby regulating neuronal polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). Proteins in cluster 2 present a considerable increase in relative expression from day 3 to day 7, which coincides with the onset of axon formation and development (stage 3). Accordingly, enriched GO terms include proteins associated with neuronal development, axonogenesis, and other axon-related mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Similarly, the GO terms representing factors associated with neuronal development, axons, and synapses were also enriched during differentiation of immortalized human neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Song et al., 2019</xref>). Among the highly upregulated proteins in this cluster are several members of the Septin family: neuronal-specific Sept3, Sept5, and Sept6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata5">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>). Although mechanistic insights remain unclear, emerging evidence implicates Septins as potential factors for establishing neuronal polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Falk et al., 2019</xref>). Septins interact with actin and microtubule networks and could affect neuronal polarity by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spiliotis, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Falk et al., 2019</xref> ). Sept6 specifically is suggested to play a role in axonal filopodia formation as well as in dendritic branching, and its increased expression coincides with axonal outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2012</xref> ). Moreover, examples of proteins with the highest relative expression in this cluster are DCX, Tau, Ncam1, Basp1, Snap91, and Syt1, which are generally considered to be neuronal differentiation and polarization markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata5">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>). These data confirm the neuronal identity of the human iPSC-derived cells, and the presence of cellular machinery involved in axon development. Cluster 3 represents proteins with increased expression from day 1 to day 3, and minimal changes in expression from day 3 to day 7. This cluster comprises proteins enriched in GO terms that are associated with cell metabolism and (re)localization of intracellular and extracellular components, which correspond to substantial changes in the cellular proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Proteins in this cluster that show differential expression from day 1 to day 3 include Sox4 and Sox11, both members of the SoxC transcription factor family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata5">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>). These factors are involved in neurogenesis and their expression induces subsequent expression of neuron-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kavyanifar et al., 2018</xref>). Also represented in this cluster are Arpc2 and Arpc4, subunits of the Arp2/3 complex. The Arp2/3 complex mediates actin polymerization and is required for formation of lamellipodia and filopodia as well as axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chou and Wang, 2016</xref>). Clusters 4, 5, and 6 encompass proteins that are downregulated during the differentiation of NSCs into polarized neurons. GO analysis of these clusters reveals that they contain proteins involved in intracellular metabolism and homeostasis, genomic translation, the cell cycle, and biosynthesis of amino acids and peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Downregulation of DNA replication and cell cycle-related proteins is also reported to coincide with terminal differentiation in neuroblastoma cells and with development of cultured rat neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murillo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frese et al., 2017</xref>). These results suggest that the overall proteome dynamics are indicative of cellular processes such as cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation. Together, these dynamic proteomic profiles, similar to the transcriptomic data, represent a population-wide shift from hiPSC-derived NSCs to polarized neurons over time.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Comparison of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of developing human iPSC-derived neurons</title><p>To compare the transcriptome and proteome dynamics, we performed correlative analysis of the relative RNA and protein expressions on day 7 compared to day 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata6">Figure 2—source data 6</xref>). Based on their annotated gene names we were able to compare the expression dynamics of 7021 factors. Of these, 4536 followed the same trend for transcriptomic and proteomic expression dynamics, and overall, we found a significant correlation between the relative transcriptomic and proteomic expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In agreement with the observed immunofluorescence, typical stem cell markers (NOTCH1, SOX2, MKI67, LIN28A, OTX2, and NES) showed a downregulation of both RNA and protein levels during neuronal differentiation. RNA levels as well as protein levels of typical neuron markers (DCX, ENO2, SYP, MAP2, STMN1, and TUBB3) and of axonal markers (TRIM46, MAPT, BASP1, ANK3, NCAM1, GAP43, and NFASC) displayed a marked increase during neuronal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). Dynamic developmental expression profiles were also observed for several semaphorins and Rap1GTPases, which are important regulators of neuronal polarity and migration in the developing mammalian neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pasterkamp, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shah et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Through quantitative analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic dynamics we were able to characterize human iPSC-derived neuronal differentiation and identify early neurodevelopmental processes in an unbiased manner. These quantitative maps of neuronal transcriptome and proteome dynamics provide a rich resource for further analyses and may identify molecular mechanisms involved in neuronal polarity and axon specification.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Identification and characterization of intermediate stages during axon specification</title><p>Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of developing neurons revealed that axonal components are upregulated after ~7 days, and assembled AIS structures were detected at proximal axons after ~14 days. Next, we studied the process of axon formation in human iPSC-derived neurons in more detail, and investigated the appearance of AIS proteins at different timepoints between day 5 and 11. In stage 2 neurons, in which neurites are unpolarized and have similar lengths, AIS proteins Trim46 and AnkG appeared as punctate structures at one or more neurites in a subset of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Quantification of the relative abundance of stage 2 neurons lacking AIS proteins (referred to as stage 2a), or containing AIS proteins at one or more neurites (referred to as stage 2b), showed a developmental transition over time from stage 2a to stage 2b neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Stage 3 neurons were morphologically defined by the appearance of a single elongated neurite, the future axon, which has grown at least twice as long as the other neurites. Interestingly, we found that AIS proteins in stage 3 neurons first appeared as noncontinuous structures consisting of multiple smaller puncta and stretches that cover distal parts of the axon (referred to as stage 3a), prior to their more conventional localization in the AIS at the proximal axon (referred to as stage 3b) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). This newly identified axon developmental stage 3a was also observed in neurons differentiated using other protocols and in neurons derived from other donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Quantifications of the abundance of these neurodevelopmental stages over time revealed a developmental decline of stage 2b neurons that was accompanied with an increase of stage 3a neurons, as well as an increase of stage 3b neurons with a relatively later onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We further characterized the distribution of AIS proteins by measuring their lengths and distances to the soma at each stage. Developmental changes in the length of AnkG and Trim46 structures were observed, as the total neurite length covered by Trim46 or AnkG signals was strongly increased by ~40% in stage 3a neurons, and significantly reduced by ~55% in stage 3b neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Movereover, the axonal Trim46 and AnkG structures were localized more distally in stage 3a neurons, as the distance from the soma to both the start as well as the end of the Trim46 and AnkG appearance was significantly larger compared to stage 3b neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). The localization of NaV at axons shows a similar dynamic profile as Trim46 and AnkG during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Together, these data imply that axon specification (transition stage 2–3) in human iPSC-derived neurons can be subdivided in four steps (stage 2a, 2b, 3a and 3b) based on the subcellular localization of AIS proteins. Specifically, AIS proteins first form relatively long, noncontinuous structures in the distal axon (stage 3a) before accumulating at the proximal axon to form the AIS structure (stage 3b).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Identification of intermediate developmental stages during onset of axon formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration and timing of neurodevelopmental stages 2a, 2b, 3a and 3b in human iPSC-derived NSCs/neurons.

Hence, we hypothesized that the noncontinuous appearance of NaV channels at distal axons in the newly identified stage 3a neurons affect AP firing. To address this, we performed electrophysiological recordings of neurons from day 7 to 14 to capture the developmental transition from stage 3a to stage 3b neurons. Our recordings showed progressive maturation of physiological properties during this developmental time window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>).

No differences in AP amplitude and half-width were found between neurons of 7 and 10–11 days. However, on day 7, neurons fired APs with smaller after-hyperpolarization (data not shown), possibly reflecting a developmental increase in potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Song et al., 2013</xref>). Other intrinsic properties, like resting membrane potential, input resistance, AP firing threshold and maximum sodium current, remained stable during this developmental period.

Bidirectional MT+TIP movement, as shown by comets moving in both the anterograde and retrograde direction, was observed at day 5 (representing stage 2 neurons) with a preference for the anterograde direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Over time, this preference shifted towards more retrograde movement in developing dendrites, and towards unidirectional anterograde movement in developing axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These changes are consistent with differences in microtubule organization in axons and dendrites found in non-human neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schätzle et al., 2016</xref>). In similar fashion to the distal to proximal reorganization of AIS proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the observed shift towards a unidirectional microtubule organization in axons occurred first in distal parts of the axon, followed by proximal reorganization at later time points. The observed developmental changes in anterograde and retrograde ratios are mostly explained by changes in retrograde comets, as the total number of retrograde comets over time was increased in dendrites and decreased in axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). The comet growth speed is slightly reduced during development, while comet run length increased markedly, suggesting a reduction in catastrophe events during axon and dendrite development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Imaging of MT+TIPs provides information about the dynamic ends of microtubules, but the fraction of moving comets does not directly reflect the orientations of all microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yau et al., 2016</xref>). To analyze microtubule orientations of both dynamic and stable microtubules, we combined our previous live-cell imaging approach with laser-severing. Cutting microtubules with a short-pulsed laser generates new microtubule ends, which allows for analysis of newly formed MT+TIPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I,J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Following laser severing, a strong shift towards a balanced, bidirectional orientation in developing dendrites is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). The number of comets in both directions increased during development, with those moving in the retrograde direction increasing relatively more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L,M</xref>). This suggests the presence of a larger pool of stable, minus-end out microtubules in dendrites. In developing axons, the shift towards unidirectional, plus-end out microtubules was more notably observed following laser severing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). Laser severing led to a large increase in the number of anterogradely moving comets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>), suggesting the presence of a stable pool of plus-end out microtubules. These results indicate that the axonal microtubule remodeling in a distal to proximal fashion coincides with the observed relocation of AIS proteins. Together, these data show that axon formation is characterized by the reorganization of the axonal microtubule network and relocation of the AIS from the distal to proximal axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Axonal microtubule cytoskeleton is reorganized in a distal-to-proximal fashion during development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of stage 2 (day 5), 3a (day 7) and 3b (day 14) human iPSC-derived neurons.

We systematically assessed the early stages of human neurodevelopment in culture, including axon specification (transition stage 2–3), and performed transcriptomic and proteomic profiling during these steps. We describe previously unrecognized intermediate stages of axonal outgrowth, which is in particular characterized by a distal (stage 3a) to proximal (stage 3b) reorganization of the axonal microtubule network and relocation of AIS proteins.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Development of polarized and functional human iPSC-derived neurons</title><p>In this study we showed that NSCs consistently gave rise to polarized and functional human neurons, which was demonstrated by the loss of cell proliferation and NSC markers, and the appearance of neuron and AIS markers. These neurons formed an axon with a functional AIS, and exhibited AP firing. As expected, AP properties and cell intrinsic variables appeared immature compared to other studies performed at later developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bardy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunhanlar et al., 2018</xref>). Passive physiological properties were comparable to neurons recorded from <italic>ex vivo</italic> fetal cortical brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moore et al., 2009</xref> ). We consistently observed neurons that fired a single AP and neurons that fired multiple APs at different developmental stages. The underlying difference in these subgroups remain unknown, but may indicate variation in the maturation, cell morphology or other factors that could contribute to cellular heterogeneity of the culture. Non-human neurons develop at faster rates: for example, rat dissociated neurons reach stage 3 after approximately 1.5 days in culture, and cortical development and maturation in mammals ranging from mouse to primate is both faster and less complex than in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dotti et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clowry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Molnár and Clowry, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Silbereis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marchetto et al., 2019</xref>). We found that human iPSC-derived neurons transit to stage 3 in approximately 7–14 days, which is consistent with the described prolonged development of human neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grabrucker et al., 2009</xref>). The slow rate of development is also reflected by the lack of spontaneous AP firing or incoming synaptic responses as mature synapses have likely not formed yet. Notably, co-culturing with astrocytes could promote synaptogenesis, as this has been shown to enhance synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). The prolonged development of human iPSC-derived neurons allows studying neurobiological processes, such as AP maturation and AIS assembly, with higher temporal resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Quantitative profiles of transcriptomic and proteomic of early human neurodevelopment</title><p>Quantitative transcriptome analysis identified 549 upregulated genes and 614 downregulated genes during early stages of neurodevelopment. As expected, and in agreement with changes observed in other differentiating cell types, GO term enrichment analysis showed strong downregulation of genes related to cell proliferation during terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tripathi et al., 2014</xref>). Simultaneously, genes related to neurodevelopmental processes such as neurite formation and axonogenesis are upregulated, which is in line with changes previously observed in mouse iPSCs and human ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). To determine if regulatory changes of transcripts are reflected in protein expression, we performed quantitative proteome analysis. We identified 2218 proteins with more than two-fold expression changes during the first stages of neurodevelopment, indicating that significant remodeling of the proteome takes place during early stages. We identified six clusters of expression profiles and conducted GO enrichment analysis, which revealed a coordinated proteomic rearrangement during neurodevelopment. Proteins related to neuronal differentiation are upregulated and proteins related to cell proliferation are downregulated. Similar changes are observed in dissociated rodent neurons, differentiating neural crest and immortalized human neural progenitor cells, confirming the neuronal identity adopted by our human iPSC-derived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kobayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frese et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Song et al., 2019</xref>). Similar to changes in protein expression levels, RNA expression also showed a strong increase of factors involved in neuronal differentiation and polarization, such as TUBB3 and TRIM46. Indeed, RNA and protein dynamics were generally correlated, indicating a coordinated cellular reprogramming of NSCs into polarized neurons. Furthermore, reorganization of the microtubule cytoskeleton is reflected in both transcriptome and proteome profiles during early neurodevelopment. However, differences between transcriptome and proteome dynamics during early neurodevelopment are also observed. This may reflect a temporal shift in regulation of transcription and translation. In addition, possible regulatory mechanisms on the protein level might be at play. Together, these data provide a rich resource for both the transcriptome and proteome dynamics in developing human neurons, which can be used in future studies to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in neuronal differentiation and polarity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Distal to proximal relocation of AIS proteins during axon development</title><p>A critical event in early neurodevelopment is the polarization of a symmetric cell into a neuron, which is initiated by the formation of a single axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dotti et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Craig and Banker, 1994</xref>). Here, we studied the onset of polarity in human iPSC-derived neurons in detail, and found that axon specification proceeds through a multistage process with several intermediate steps. We observed that AIS proteins Trim46, AnkG and NaV first appear as long, noncontinuous structures in distal regions of axons at the onset of stage 3 (stage 3a), and later relocate and cluster at proximal regions to form the stable AIS structures (stage 3b). In conjunction, we also found a distal-to-proximal reorganization of the microtubule cytoskeleton network in axons. This is marked by a developmental shift towards the characteristic uniform, plus-end out orientation in growing axons. Although the precise relation between AIS formation and microtubule remodeling in early axon development is unclear, various studies have shown the cooperative interaction between AIS components and microtubule structures during axon development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leterrier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fréal et al., 2016</xref>). Recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fréal et al., 2019</xref>, described a feedback-based mechanism that drives AIS assembly, in which membrane, scaffolding, and microtubule(-associated) proteins, including AnkG and Trim46, cooperate to form a stable AIS-microtubule structure in the proximal axon. It has been shown that AnkG can act as a scaffold to recruit Trim46-positive microtubules and subsequently direct AIS protein trafficking to the proximal axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fréal et al., 2019</xref>). The possible function of AIS proteins in the distal axon remains elusive. Similar to their function in stabilizing microtubules at the proximal axon, the AIS proteins present at the distal axon may also assist in locally stabilizing microtubules to presumably drive axon outgrowth. AnkG in distal axons may provide additional support to the formation of Trim46-positive parallel microtubules during outgrowth. Then, as Trim46 moves proximally, the axonal microtubule network close to the cell body is also remodeled to the characteristic uniform plus-end out orientation. This idea is consistent with the observed shift of the unidirectional parallel microtubule organization in the distal parts of the axon first, followed by proximal reorganization. Finally, AnkG and Trim46 together may drive AIS assembly at the proximal axon, as previously described in dissociated rodent neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fréal et al., 2019</xref>). It remains unknown if the observed intermediate step of distal AIS protein accumulation is unique to human neurons. Axons in humans grow significantly longer compared to rodents, thus additional regulatory mechanisms enhancing axon outgrowth might be at play in humans. Alternatively, it is possible that these changes have not been observed in rodent neurons because of their relatively faster development. We also observed differences in microtubule dynamics, as MT+TIP growth speeds are higher than those found in rodent neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, hinting at species-specific regulation of microtubule dynamics in human neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stepanova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kleele et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yau et al., 2016</xref>).

We investigated early development in human neurons and uncovered an intermediate axon developmental step in stage 3 neurons, thereby illustrating the potential of this model system to study neurobiological processes in human neurons. This study also provides a framework and important starting point for further studies that aim to complement our understanding of polarization in human neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>hiPSC-derived neuronal cell culture</title><p>Human iPSC-derived cortical neural stem cells (NSCs; ax0016, Axol Bioscience) were obtained from three different donors (donor #1: ax0016; donor #2 ax0018; donor #3 ax0015, Axol Bioscience).

Stage 2a and stage 2b neurons contained unipolar neurites of similar lengths. In stage 2a neurons, all neurites were negative for Trim46. In stage 2b neurons, one or more neurites were positive for Trim46. Stage 3a and stage 3b neurons were identified by the presence of a single elongated neurite, the future axon, that was at least twice as long as the other neurites. In stage 3a neurons, Trim46 appeared as distal non-continuous stretches at distal axons. In stage 3b neurons, Trim46 showed a dense accumulation at proximal axons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Live-cell imaging</title><p>For all live-cell imaging of microtubule dynamics without laser severing, time-lapse acquisition was performed using the 491 nm 100 mW Calypse (200 ms exposure) and 561 nm 100 mW Jive (200 ms exposure) with one frame per second (fps) for 5 min. 16-bit images were projected onto the EMCCD chip with intermediate lens 2.0X (Edmund Optics) at a magnification of 0.111 µm/pixel at 60x, or onto the sCMOS chip with no intermediate lens at a magnification of 0.150 µm/pixel at 60x. For all live-cell imaging of microtubule dynamics with laser severing, time-lapse acquisition was performed using the 491 nm 100 mW Calypse (50–200 ms exposure, depending on the expression level) and 561 nm 100 mW Jive (50–200 ms exposure, depending on the expression level) with 1 fps for 3 min, and photoablation was induced after 30 s. 16-bit images were projected onto the sCMOS chip with no intermediate lens at a magnification of 0.063 µm/pixel at 100x.

Coverslips were continuously perfused with carbonated (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, in mM: 126 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 20 glucose; with an osmolarity of ~310 mOsm/L) at a rate of approximately 1 ml/min. As an acute change in extracellular osmolarity has previously been reported to affect the excitable properties of neurons, an extra medium refreshment was done the day before recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pasantes-Morales, 1996</xref>). Bath temperature was monitored and maintained at 30–32°C throughout the experiment. Recording pipettes (resistance of 4–7 MΩ) were pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments) and filled with internal solution (in mM: 140 K-gluconate, 4 KCl, 0.5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 4 MgATP, 0.4 NaGTP, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>-Phosphocreatine; with pH 7.3 and osmolarity 295 mOsm/L), containing 30 µM Alexa 568 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to facilitate visualization of cells. For post hoc cellular identification, biocytin was included in the internal solution. On an upright microscope, hiPSC-derived neurons were visually identified with a 60x water immersion objective (Nikon NIR Apochromat; NA 1.0) and selected for whole-cell somatic patch clamp recordings. Cells were kept at a baseline holding potential of −60 or −70 mV in both voltage and current clamp throughout the recording.

To determine differential expression a linear regression ANOVA model was used where gene expression is explained by timepoint + biological replicate and technical replicate (nested in the biological replicate). To obtain the differences (in both p-value and effect between the timepoints) a Tukey-test was performed for each gene using the same model. We corrected for multiple-testing by pairwise comparison using the p.adjust() function in R with the ‘BH’ setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">R Development Core Team, 2020</xref>).

Lysates were sonicated on ice with a Bioruptor (Diagenode) and cleared by centrifugation at 2500 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The protein concentration of the samples was determined by Bradford assay. Per sample 100 µg of proteins were reduced (5 mM DTT, 55 °C, 1 hr), alkylated (10 mM Iodoacetamide, 30 min in the dark) and sequentially digested by LysC (Protein-enzyme ratio 1:50, 37 °C, 4 hr) and trypsin (Protein-enzyme ratio 1:50, 37 °C, overnight). After digestion (overnight), formic acid (final concentration 3%) was used to acidify the samples and resulting peptides were afterwards desalted with Sep-Pak C18 columns (Waters). Samples were labeled with stable isotope TMT-6plex labeling, according to manufacturer’s instruction (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In short, peptides were resuspended in 80 µl of 50 mM HEPES buffer, 12.5% ACN (pH 8.5), while TMT reagents were dissolved in 50 µl anhydrous ACN.

Peptides were trapped for 10 min at 5 µl/min in solvent A (0.1M acetic acid in H20) and then separated at a flow rate of approximately 300 nl/min (split flow from 0.2 ml/min) by applying a 120 min linear gradient as follows: 13% up to 40% solvent B (0.1M acetic acid in 80% ACN) in 95 min, 40–100% in 3 min and finally 100% for 1 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. Full MS spectra from m/z 375–1600 were acquired at a resolution of 60.000 with an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 3e6 and maximum injection time (IT) of 20 ms. The 15 most intense precursor ions were selected for HCD fragmentation. HCD fragmentation was performed at a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 32%. MS/MS spectra were obtained at a 30.000 resolution with an AGC target of 1e5 and maximum injection time (IT) of 50 ms.

A database search was performed using the Swissprot <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> database and Mascot (version 2.5.1, Matrix Science, UK) as search engine. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine, acetylation at the N-termini, TMT-6plex of lysine residues and TMT-6plex at the peptide N-termini were set as variable modifications. Trypsin was set as cleavage specificity, allowing a maximum of two missed cleavages. Data filtering was performed using percolator, resulting in 1% false discovery rate (FDR). Additional filters were search engine rank one and mascot ion score &gt;20. Only unique peptides were included for quantification and the obtained TMT ratios were normalized to the median.

To infer protein dynamics upon differentiation, TMT reporter intensity values of hiPSC neurons at time point day 3 and day 7 were normalized to their correspondent day one or alternatively day 7 was normalized to day 3. TMT generated ratios (previously normalized to the median) were then log2-transformed. A log2-transformed mean of the TMT-ratios of the individual replicates was calculated. Proteins with less than three peptides used for TMT quantification or with a reporter ion variability &gt;100% in at least one TMT-ratio (high reporter ions variability) or with a median log2 fold-change &gt;0.4 between the replicates in at least one TMT-ratio (high replicate variability) were excluded from the analyses.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper Lindhout et al. studied neuronal polarization in human iPSC derived neurons, by the characterization of electrophysiological responses, and systematically profiled transcriptomic and proteomic dynamics during early neuronal developmental stages. As expected they found extensive remodeling of the neuron transcriptome and proteome during development. They also described a distinct stage in axon development marked by an increase in microtubule remodeling and apparent relocation of the axon initial segment from the distal to the proximal axon.</p><p>This is a comprehensive characterization and quantitative map of transcriptome and proteome dynamics of early-stage development of human iPSC derived neurons. However, the overall data remain in a descriptive stage and the findings describe the expected overall transcriptome and proteome changing during neuronal development already described in other models. In addition, the lack of some critical experiments does not allow us to consider the data presented fully complete for a compelling study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All the experiments have been done using only one iPSC line, but considering the high heterogeneity of the different human iPSC lines, the obtained results should be confirmed, at least for some data, with other iPSC lines. Indeed the authors claim that the observed intermediate step of distal AIS protein accumulation is unique to human neurons. These data can be considered valid only if confirmed in other independent iPSC lines.</p><p>2) Another important aspect is that the authors used only one method for neuronal differentiation. In the literature, however, many protocols have been described. Thus the obtained results might not be possible to be extended if NPCs are differentiated with other methodologies. This aspect reduces considerably the impact of the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58124.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All the experiments have been done using only one iPSC line, but considering the high heterogeneity of the different human iPSC lines, the obtained results should be confirmed, at least for some data, with other iPSC lines.

To address this, we carefully selected more iPSC lines to get a total of three independent iPSC cell lines of donors with mixed gender, age (newborn and 74 years) and using different starting material (cord blood CD34+ cells and fibroblasts). We observed successful AIS assembly as well as action potential (AP) firing upon current stimulation in all cell lines, indicating that iPSCs derived from different donors all developed into polarized and functional neurons (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F, H, I). Importantly, the newly identified intermediate axon developmental step characterized by distal AIS protein accumulation was also consistently observed in all cell lines, thereby confirming our initial findings (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another important aspect is that the authors used only one method for neuronal differentiation.

Indeed, it is relevant to validate some of our key findings using other neuronal differentiation methodologies. To address this, we used two additional protocols that are based on either induced neuronal differentiation – a largely adjusted version of our standard protocol – or spontaneous neuronal differentiation (please see the Materials and methods section for details). As with our standard protocols, differentiated neurons showed successful AIS assembly as well as action potential firing upon current stimulation with both other differentiation protocols (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F, H, I). Moreover, we steadily observed that developing neurons proceeded through axon developmental stage 3a, marked by the appearance of AIS proteins in distal axons, using any of the neuronal differentiation protocols (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B). Thus, we report similar results in NSCs differentiated using three different methodologies, thereby largely increasing the possibility to extend our findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
