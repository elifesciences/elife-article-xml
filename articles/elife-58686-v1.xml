heterogeneous cell population, but while <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood is dominated by a macrophage-like lineage (plasmatocytes), until very recently these cells were considered to represent a homogeneous population. Here, we present our identification of enhancer elements labelling plasmatocyte subpopulations, which vary in abundance across development. These subpopulations exhibit functional differences compared to the overall population, including more potent injury responses and differential localisation and dynamics in pupae and adults. Our enhancer analysis identified candidate genes regulating plasmatocyte behaviour: pan-plasmatocyte expression of one such gene (<italic>Calnexin14D</italic>) improves wound responses, causing the overall population to resemble more closely the subpopulation marked by the <italic>Calnexin14D</italic>-associated enhancer. Finally, we show that exposure to increased levels of apoptotic cell death modulates subpopulation cell numbers. Taken together this demonstrates macrophage heterogeneity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, identifies mechanisms involved in subpopulation specification and function and facilitates the use of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to study macrophage heterogeneity in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship 102503/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>Iwan Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship 102503/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>Iwan Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRC Discovery Medicine North (DiMeN) Doctoral Training Partnership MR/N013840/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brooks</surname><given-names>Elliot</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Drosophila</italic> macrophages are a heterogeneous population of cells containing subpopulations with enhanced responses to injury that display considerable variation in their abundance across development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macrophages are key innate immune cells responsible for clearing infections, debris, and apoptotic cells, the promotion of wound healing and are necessary for normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wynn et al., 2013</xref>). However, their aberrant behaviour can also cause or exacerbate numerous human disease states, including cancer, atherosclerosis, and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wynn et al., 2013</xref>). Macrophages are a highly heterogeneous population of cells, which enables them to carry out their wide variety of roles, and this heterogeneity arises from diverse processes. These processes include the dissemination and maintenance of tissue resident populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gordon and Plüddemann, 2017</xref>) and the ability to adopt a spectrum of different activation states (termed macrophage polarisation), which can range from pro-inflammatory (historically termed as M1-like) to anti-inflammatory, pro-healing (M2-like) macrophage activation states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Martinez and Gordon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Murray, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Macrophage heterogeneity is not limited to mammals, appearing conserved across vertebrate lineages – both in terms of polarisation and the presence of tissue resident populations. For example, evidence suggests the existence of pro-inflammatory macrophage populations in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nguyen-Chi et al., 2015</xref>), with polarisation also a well-defined phenomenon in other fish species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wiegertjes et al., 2016</xref>). Zebrafish are also known to contain tissue resident macrophages such as myeloid-derived microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ferrero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). Vertebrate macrophages interact with and can become polarised in response to signals produced by Th1 and Th2 cells, leading to acquisition of M1-like and M2-like activation states, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Murray, 2017</xref>), while B- and T-cell-based adaptive immunity is thought to have evolved in teleost fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buchmann, 2014</xref>). Therefore, the absence of an adaptive immune system may restrict the diversity of macrophage populations in more simple organisms that possess only an innate immune system. However, the fact that macrophage markers can be highly divergent, even when comparing mammals as closely related as mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Murray and Wynn, 2011</xref>), has hampered investigation of whether this is indeed the case, indicating a need for alternative markers and approaches.</p><p>Macrophage heterogeneity has been extensively studied in mammalian systems and, although this has provided a good understanding of how macrophages determine their polarisation state, this has also identified considerable complexity with many activation states possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Murray et al., 2014</xref>). Additional complexity arises with both M1-like and M2-like macrophages found at the same sites of pathology, for example within atherosclerotic plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Colin et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the cytokine profiles that can be induced in vitro depend on the exact activation methods used experimentally and these do not necessarily reflect polarisation states in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vogel et al., 2014</xref>), while other macrophage subpopulations may be missed by in vitro approaches. Given these intricacies, it is clear that we need to better understand the fundamental components and pathways responsible for the specification of different macrophage subtypes, particularly in vivo. Recently, the ‘macrophage-first’ hypothesis has been proposed, re-emphasising the idea that acute signals can polarise macrophages ahead of the involvement of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wiegertjes et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, organisms without a fully developed adaptive immune system represent intriguing models in which to examine this idea and better understand macrophage heterogeneity in vivo.</p><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has been extensively utilised to study innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchon et al., 2014</xref>), but lacks an adaptive immune system. Fruit fly blood is specified in two waves – an embryonic wave in the head mesoderm and in the larval lymph gland, with those cells released at the end of larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gold and Brückner, 2015</xref>). Blood cell proliferation has also been shown to occur in haematopoietic pockets attached to the larval body wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Leitão and Sucena, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>). These waves of haematopoiesis generate three types of blood cell (also referred to as hemocytes): plasmatocytes, crystal cells, and lamellocytes. Of these, plasmatocytes are functionally equivalent to vertebrate macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Evans et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wood and Jacinto, 2007</xref>), with the capacity to phagocytose apoptotic cells and pathogens, secrete extracellular matrix, disperse during development and migrate to sites of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ratheesh et al., 2015</xref>). Although <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood lineages are considerably less complex than their vertebrate equivalents, they are specified via transcription factors related to those used during vertebrate myelopoiesis, including GATA and Runx-related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Evans et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, plasmatocytes utilise evolutionarily conserved genes in common with vertebrate innate immune cells to migrate (e.g. SCAR/WAVE, integrins, and Rho GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Comber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Evans et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Paladi and Tepass, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Siekhaus et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Stramer et al., 2005</xref>]) and phagocytose (e.g. the CED-1 family member Draper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Manaka et al., 2004</xref>] and CD36-related receptor Croquemort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Franc et al., 1996</xref>]). Given these striking levels of functional and molecular conservation, <italic>Drosophila</italic> has been extensively used for research into macrophage behaviour in vivo with its genetic tractability and in vivo imaging capabilities facilitating elucidation of different macrophage behaviours conserved through evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ratheesh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wood and Jacinto, 2007</xref>). However, despite these evolutionarily-conserved commonalities, the plasmatocyte lineage has, until very recently, been considered a homogeneous cell population. Hints that <italic>Drosophila</italic> plasmatocytes may exhibit heterogeneity exist in the literature with variation in marker expression observed in larval hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kurucz et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shin et al., 2020</xref>) and non-uniform expression of TGF-β homologues upon injury or infection in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clark et al., 2011</xref>). Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) experiments performed on larval hemocytes have also suggested the presence of multiple clusters of cells, which were interpreted as representing either different stages of differentiation or functional groupings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cattenoz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tattikota et al., 2019</xref>). However, the in vivo identification of subtypes and insights into the roles and specification mechanisms of potential macrophage subtypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has not yet been described.</p><p>Here, we describe the first identification and characterisation of molecularly and functionally distinct plasmatocyte subpopulations within <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Drawing on a collection of reporter lines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://enhancers.starklab.org/">https://enhancers.starklab.org/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kvon et al., 2014</xref>), we have identified regulatory elements that define novel plasmatocyte subpopulations in vivo. We show that these molecularly distinct subpopulations exhibit functional differences compared to the overall plasmatocyte population and that the proportion of cells within these subpopulations can be modulated by external stimuli such as increased levels of apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that misexpression of a gene associated with a subpopulation-specific enhancer element is able to modulate plasmatocyte behaviour in vivo, thereby identifying novel effector genes of plasmatocyte subpopulation function. Together our findings reveal that macrophage heterogeneity is a fundamental and evolutionarily conserved characteristic of innate immunity that pre-dates the development of the adaptive immune system. This significantly extends the utility of an already powerful genetic model system and provides further avenues to understand regulation of innate immunity and macrophage heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic plasmatocytes do not behave as a uniform population of cells</title><p>The macrophage lineage of hemocytes (plasmatocytes) has historically been considered a homogeneous population of cells. However, careful analysis of plasmatocyte behaviour in vivo suggested to us that this lineage might not be functionally uniform. For instance, imaging the inflammatory responses of plasmatocytes to epithelial wounds, we find that some cells close to injury sites rapidly respond by migrating to the wound, while other neighbouring cells fail to respond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). We also find that plasmatocytes exhibit variation in their expression of well-characterised plasmatocyte markers such as <italic>crq-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–b’</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Franc et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Stramer et al., 2005</xref>) and display a broad diversity in their migration speeds within the embryo (random migration at stage 15; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–d</xref>). These professional phagocytes also display differences in their capacities to phagocytose apoptotic cells with some cells engulfing many apoptotic particles, whereas others engulf very few, if any (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Furthermore, phagocytosis of microorganisms by larval hemocytes also varies significantly from cell-to-cell in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). These differences within the plasmatocyte lineage led us to hypothesise that this cell population is more heterogeneous than previously appreciated.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Heterogeneity of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic plasmatocyte responses.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) GFP (green) and nuclear red stinger (magenta) labelled plasmatocytes on the ventral side of a stage 15 embryo at 0 min (<bold>a</bold>) and 60 min post-wounding (<bold>a’</bold>); plasmatocyte tracks at each timepoint are overlaid (<bold>a–a’</bold>) or shown in full (<bold>a’’</bold>). Examples of plasmatocytes failing to respond to the wound (w) indicated via asterisks; square bracket (<bold>a</bold>) indicates neighbouring plasmatocytes, one of which responds to wounding, while the other fails to respond (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

To address this and look for molecular differences between plasmatocytes, we examined transgenic enhancer reporter lines (<italic>VT-GAL4</italic> lines) produced as part of a large-scale tilling array screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kvon et al., 2014</xref>) that had been annotated as labelling hemocytes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://enhancers.starklab.org/">http://enhancers.starklab.org/</ext-link>). Based on examination of the published <italic>VT-GAL4</italic> expression patterns, we identified <italic>VT-GAL4</italic> lines that appeared to label reduced numbers of plasmatocytes in the embryo, reasoning that plasmatocyte subpopulations could be molecularly identified on the basis of differences in reporter expression. While a number of the enhancers appeared to label all plasmatocytes (e.g. <italic>VT41692-GAL4</italic>), we identified several that labelled discrete numbers of plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We next confirmed that the cells labelled by these <italic>VT-GAL4</italic> lines were plasmatocytes by using these constructs to drive expression of <italic>UAS-tdTomato</italic> in the background of a <italic>GAL4</italic>-independent, pan-hemocyte marker (<italic>srpHemo-GMA – serpent</italic> enhancer region driving expression of a GFP-tagged actin-binding domain of Moesin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>). As initially predicted based on their morphology and position during embryogenesis, each of the <italic>VT-GAL4</italic> lines marking potential subpopulations did indeed express in the hemocyte lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). These subpopulation cells were identified as plasmatocytes based upon their morphology, the absence of lamellocytes in embryos and the non-migratory nature of crystal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wood and Jacinto, 2007</xref>) and could be observed to follow both the dorsal and ventral migration routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ratheesh et al., 2015</xref>) used by plasmatocytes during their developmental dispersal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). In order to quantify the proportion of cells labelled by each <italic>VT-GAL4</italic> line, we counted the number of cells labelled on the ventral midline of the developing stage 15 embryo, using <italic>VT-GAL4</italic> lines to drive expression from <italic>UAS-GFP</italic>. This verified reproducible and consistent labelling of discrete subsets of plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f–h</xref>), suggesting that these cells represent stable subpopulations within this macrophage lineage.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identification of enhancers labelling discrete plasmatocyte subpopulations in <italic>Drosophila.</italic></title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Lateral views of stage 13/14 embryos with in situ hybridisation performed for GAL4 for indicated <italic>VT-GAL4</italic> lines (anterior is left). Taken with permission from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://enhancers.starklab.org/">http://enhancers.starklab.org/</ext-link> (n.b. these images are not covered by the CC-BY 4.0 licence and further reproduction of this panel would need permission from the copyright holder); <italic>VT41692-GAL4</italic> represents an example in which the majority of plasmatocytes are labelled.

In order to exclude potential expression in non-hemocyte cells (e.g. the non-plasmatocyte cells apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), we labelled subpopulation cells specifically using a split GAL4 approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>), employing the <italic>serpent</italic> enhancer (a well-characterised hemocyte marker; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lebestky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rehorn et al., 1996</xref>) and VT enhancers to express the transcriptional activation domain (AD) and DNA binding domains (DBD) of GAL4 independently. Only when co-expressed in the same cell do the AD and DBD heterodimerise and allow expression of UAS transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Characterising the split GAL4 lines in the embryo via expression of the EGFP-derivative Stinger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barolo et al., 2000</xref>) confirmed that this split GAL4 approach labels discrete subpopulations of plasmatocytes within the embryo, although with a higher proportion of cells labelled compared to the original <italic>VT-GAL4</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b–d</xref>) – a difference likely due to a combination of amplification via the split GAL4 system and enhanced detectability of Stinger, which accumulates in the nucleus due to its nuclear localisation signal. Similar trends in the proportions of plasmatocytes labelled in a variety of locations across the embryo were observed for each subpopulation; for example, <italic>VT32897</italic>-labelled cells were the least frequently observed in the lateral head region and on the dorsal and ventral sides of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b–d</xref>). As per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, this suggests there are no clear biases between the dispersal routes undertaken by subpopulation cells.</p><p>While <italic>serpent</italic> expression decreases in hemocytes during larval stages, we found that <italic>srpHemo-AD;srpHemo-DBD</italic> in concert with <italic>UAS-stinger</italic> was sufficient to label large numbers of cells in both L1 and L2 larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref>), consistent with previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gyoergy et al., 2018</xref>). Following hatching of embryos, we cannot use cell morphology to discriminate between plasmatocytes and other hemocyte lineages (crystal cells and lamellocytes) and therefore refer to subpopulation cells as hemocytes for post-embryonic stages of development. Quantification of the numbers of subpopulation cells that could be detected using the split GAL4 system to drive expression from <italic>UAS-stinger</italic> showed that roughly 50% of <italic>serpent</italic>-positive hemocytes were labelled in L1 larvae for each VT subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–c</xref>).

Therefore, it is possible that greater than 50% of hemocytes are labelled at this stage; nonetheless, a significant proportion of subpopulation cells are not labelled via these split GAL4 reporters in L1 larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–c</xref>).

This approach confirmed the low numbers of cells observed in L3 larval images and revealed no bias in subpopulation localisation, with similar proportions present in circulation and adhered to tissue for each subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Quantification of subpopulation localisation along the L3 body axis suggested that <italic>VT57089</italic> and <italic>VT62766</italic> cells exhibit a bias toward the posterior of the larvae compared to the total population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h–h’</xref>).</p><p>The striking decrease in proportion of subpopulation cells that can be detected in L3 larvae compared to earlier stages suggests reprogramming of cells leading to a loss of enhancer activity. To test this hypothesis, split GAL4 lines were used in lineage tracing experiments via G-TRACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Evans et al., 2009</xref>). In this approach, current expression of reporters is marked via Red Stinger and also leads to the permanent expression of Stinger via the activity of a co-expressed FLP recombinase. As such, the expression of both fluorophores indicates current split GAL4 activity, while the expression of Stinger alone indicates historical activity in cells where expression has since ceased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Analysing the total complement of current and historic subpopulation cells in L3 larvae via G-TRACE revealed that a significant proportion of subpopulation cells were positive for historical expression only (Stinger expression alone; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). This confirms that subpopulation cells from earlier timepoints survive in vivo but change their transcriptional profile – a finding consistent with reprogramming events rather than a loss of cells themselves.</p><p>Imaging of white pre-pupae (WPP), the stage that marks the beginning of pupal development and metamorphosis, showed very similar patterns across the split GAL4 VT enhancer lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–f</xref>), with a further reduction in the numbers of cells labelled. It was possible to observe the occasional cell moving in circulation within WPP, strongly suggesting these cells are hemocytes (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). Live imaging of <italic>VT32897</italic> WPP also confirmed association of cells with the pumping dorsal vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). Significantly, this data indicates that the presence of subpopulations within embryos is not simply a consequence of slow accumulation of fluorescent proteins by weak drivers, since these enhancer-based reporters do not label an ever-increasing number of cells as development proceeds. Overall, the numbers of hemocytes within subpopulations that can be detected decreases over larval and early pupal stages, suggesting that plasmatocyte subpopulations are developmentally regulated and exhibit plasticity. This reprogramming could reflect specific and changing requirements for specialised plasmatocyte subpopulations across the life cycle, for example, an association with processes required for organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Charroux and Royet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Defaye et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Regan et al., 2013</xref>).

Stage 15 embryos were imaged for 1 hr and individual plasmatocyte movements were tracked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e–f</xref>). Only the <italic>VT17559-GAL4</italic>-labelled plasmatocyte subpopulation displayed statistically significantly faster rates of migration compared to the overall plasmatocyte population (labelled using <italic>srpHemo-GAL4</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8g</xref>). There were no differences in directionality (cell displacement divided by total path length) for any of the subpopulations, suggesting that the mode of migration was similar across these lines and with that of the overall population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8h</xref>).</p><p>Apoptotic cell clearance (efferocytosis) represents another evolutionarily-conserved function performed by embryonic plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Therefore, we investigated this function in subpopulations, using numbers of phagosomal vesicles per cell as a proxy for this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Evans et al., 2013</xref>). Cells labelled via <italic>VT17559-GAL4</italic>, <italic>VT57089-GAL4</italic> and <italic>VT62766-GAL4</italic> (but not <italic>VT32897-GAL4</italic>) contained fewer phagosomes than the overall plasmatocyte population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8i–k</xref>), suggesting that these discrete populations of cells are less effective at removing apoptotic cells inside the developing embryo. To confirm this result dynamically, GFP-myc-2xFYVE, a phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wucherpfennig et al., 2003</xref>) was used to measure the rate of phagocytosis in subpopulation cells. This reporter rapidly and transiently localises on the surface of engulfed phagosomes in plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Roddie et al., 2019</xref>). All subpopulations exhibited lower rates of phagocytosis compared to the overall plasmatocyte population using this reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8l</xref>), suggesting the differences in numbers of phagosomes per cell result from distinct phagocytic abilities.</p><p>Finally, we examined cell size and the shape of labelled plasmatocyte subpopulations. Vertebrate macrophages are highly heterogeneous, with distinct morphologies dependent upon their tissue of residence or polarisation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McWhorter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ploeger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rostam et al., 2017</xref>). We found no obvious size or shape differences between <italic>VT-GAL4-</italic>labelled cells and the overall plasmatocyte population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1a–e</xref>). This was also the case when <italic>VT-GAL4-</italic>positive cells were compared to internal controls (<italic>VT-GAL4</italic>-negative cells within the same embryos) for a range of shape descriptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1f–i</xref>). Similarly, we were unable to detect differences in ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>) or the proportion of <italic>VT-GAL4</italic>-labelled plasmatocytes that phagocytosed pHrodo-labelled <italic>E. coli</italic> compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>), two processes associated with pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benoit et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Taken together these data show that the subpopulations of plasmatocytes identified via the <italic>VT-GAL4</italic> reporters exhibit functional differences compared to the overall plasmatocyte population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, as well as displaying molecular differences in the form of differential enhancer activity, and hence reporter expression, these discrete populations of cells behave differently. This strongly suggests that these cells represent functionally distinct subpopulations and that the plasmatocyte lineage is not homogeneous. Furthermore, not all subpopulations displayed identical functional characteristics, suggesting that there are multiple distinct subtypes present in vivo, although some overlap between subpopulations seems likely. For example, <italic>VT17559-GAL4-</italic>labelled cells were more effective at responding to wounds and migrated more rapidly but carried out less phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. By contrast, <italic>VT32987-GAL4-</italic>labelled cells only displayed improved wound responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1"

Thus, genes proximal to enhancers that label plasmatocyte subpopulations represent candidate regulators of immune cell function (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>). <italic>VT62766-GAL4</italic> labels a subpopulation of plasmatocytes with enhanced migratory responses to injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a–c</xref>) and this enhancer region is found within the genomic interval containing <italic>paralytic</italic> (<italic>para</italic>), which encodes a subunit of a voltage-gated sodium channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lin et al., 2009</xref>), and upstream of the 3’ end of <italic>Calnexin14D</italic> (<italic>Cnx14D</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>). <italic>Cnx14D</italic> encodes a calcium-binding chaperone protein resident in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christodoulou et al., 1997</xref>). Alterations in calcium dynamics are associated with clearance of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cuttell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gronski et al., 2009</xref>) and modulating calcium signalling within plasmatocytes alters their ability to respond to wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Weavers et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, given the association of <italic>Cnx14D</italic> with the <italic>VT62766</italic> enhancer and the potential for plasmatocyte behaviours to be modulated by altered calcium dynamics, we examined whether misexpressing <italic>Cnx14D</italic> in all plasmatocytes was sufficient to cause these cells to behave more similarly to the <italic>VT62766</italic> subpopulation. Critically, pan-hemocyte expression of <italic>Cnx14D</italic> stimulated wound responses with elevated numbers of plasmatocytes responding to injury compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b–c</xref>), consistent with the enhanced wound responses of the endogenous <italic>VT62766-GAL4</italic>-positive plasmatocyte subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). This reveals that genes proximal to subpopulation-defining enhancers represent candidate genes in dictating the biology of cells in those subpopulations.

These subpopulations showed functional differences compared to the overall plasmatocyte population, exhibiting enhanced responses to injury, faster migration rates and reduced rates of apoptotic cell clearance within the developing embryo. These subpopulations are highly plastic with their numbers varying across development, in line with the changing behaviours of <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood cells across the lifecourse. That these discrete populations of plasmatocytes represent bona fide subpopulations is evidenced by the finding that numbers of cells within subpopulations can be manipulated via exposure to enhanced levels of apoptotic cell death in vivo. Furthermore, pan-hemocyte expression of a gene (<italic>Cnx14D</italic>) linked to one of the enhancers used to visualise these subpopulations (<italic>VT62766-GAL4</italic>) shifts the behaviour of these cells towards a more wound-responsive state, resembling the behaviour of <italic>VT62766-GAL4</italic>-labelled cells. Taken together this data strongly suggests that <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood cell lineages are more complex than previously known.</p><p>Vertebrate macrophage lineages show considerable heterogeneity due to the presence of circulating monocytes, a wide variety of tissue resident macrophages and a spectrum of activation states that can be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gordon and Plüddemann, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wynn et al., 2013</xref>). Whether simpler organisms such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> exhibit heterogeneity within their macrophage-like lineages has been a topic of much discussion and hints in the literature suggest this as a possibility. Braun and colleagues identified variation in reporter expression within plasmatocytes in an enhancer trap screen, but without associating these with functional differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 1997</xref>), while heterogeneity has also been suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kurucz et al., 2007a</xref>). For instance, non-uniform expression has been reported for plasmatocyte genes such as <italic>hemolectin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Goto et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>hemese</italic>, <italic>nimrod</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kurucz et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kurucz et al., 2007a</xref>), <italic>croquemort</italic>, TGF-β family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clark et al., 2011</xref>), and the iron transporter <italic>malvolio</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Folwell et al., 2006</xref>). The ease of extracting larval hemocytes has meant these cells have received more attention than their embryonic counterparts; recent transcriptional profiling approaches via scRNAseq that emerged during preparation of this manuscript have suggested the existence of distinct larval blood cell populations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cattenoz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tattikota et al., 2019</xref>) and provided further confirmation of the existence of self-renewing/proliferating plasmatocytes at this stage of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>). Similar approaches have been taken to study the cells of the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cho et al., 2020</xref>), though further work is required to establish whether the blood cells generated in this second haematopoietic wave contribute to subpopulation numbers in pupae and adults. While it has been suggested that some of these molecular differences may, at least in part, reflect the presence of transient progenitor states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tattikota et al., 2019</xref>), these studies identified a number of potentially different functional groups, including more immune-activated cell populations displaying expression signatures reflective of active Toll and JNK signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cattenoz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tattikota et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, our identification of developmentally regulated subpopulations, coupled with this recent evidence from larvae, strongly points to functional heterogeneity within the plasmatocyte lineage.</p><p>How do the functionally distinct subpopulations we have uncovered relate to the transcriptionally-defined clusters revealed via scRNAseq? These approaches profiled L3 larval hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cattenoz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tattikota et al., 2019</xref>), the stage at which fewest subpopulation cells can be identified. Therefore, it is possible that VT-labelled cells do not correspond to any of the scRNAseq clusters: subpopulation cells in L3 larvae may represent high expressors from earlier in development that are only marked due to perdurance of fluorescent protein. Alternatively, in terms of function, it could be concluded that the VT-labelled subpopulations display a degree of immune activation given their decreased efficiency at removing apoptotic cells and increased responses to wounds. These subpopulations could thus relate to clusters displaying signatures of immune activation (PM3-PM7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tattikota et al., 2019</xref> PL-Rel, PL-vir1, PL-AMP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cattenoz et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to clusters predicted to be proliferative (PM9-11/PL-prolif/PL-Inos), these activated clusters did not show a bias in their distribution between circulation and sessile patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cattenoz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tattikota et al., 2019</xref>), similar to the localisation of VT-labelled cells. While we have not categorically identified which genes are regulated by the VT-enhancers that define subpopulations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> for candidates), transcripts of several of these candidates are enriched in PM6, an immune-activated cluster, and PM12, which accounts for less than 1% of plasmatocytes and has been difficult to classify since it is defined by uncharacterised genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tattikota et al., 2019</xref>). While the field is still at an early stage, further characterisation and new tools based on marker genes will enable these different clusters and subpopulations to be more carefully compared.</p><p>The subpopulations we have identified are significantly reduced in L3 larvae and consequently may represent functional heterogeneity more relevant to other developmental stages. It is clear that the biology of <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood cells varies significantly across the lifecourse: for instance plasmatocytes play strikingly different functional roles in embryos and larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Charroux and Royet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Defaye et al., 2009</xref>), shifting from developmental roles to host defence. Additionally, plasmatocytes undergo directed migration to sites of injury in embryos and pupae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moreira et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Stramer et al., 2005</xref>), stages of development when subpopulation cells are most obvious. In contrast, hemocytes are captured from circulation via adhesion in L3 larvae and their migratory abilities are less obvious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babcock et al., 2008</xref>). These functional differences are reflected in molecular differences between embryonic and larval blood cells revealed via bulk RNAseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cattenoz et al., 2020</xref>), with reprogramming to suit the different requirements of these cells within larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Charroux and Royet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Defaye et al., 2009</xref>), potentially explaining why our VT enhancer-labelled subpopulations are substantially decreased at that stage. Transcriptional changes are also associated with steroid hormone-mediated signalling in pupae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Regan et al., 2013</xref>) and this hormone (ecdysone) can also drive alterations in blood cell behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sampson et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, steroid hormone signalling represents a potential candidate mechanism to drive re-emergence of subpopulations in time for metamorphosis.</p><p>In higher vertebrates, erythro-myeloid precursor/progenitor cells seed the developing embryo to give rise to tissue resident macrophage populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gomez Perdiguero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hoeffel and Ginhoux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mass et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, the localisation of subpopulations in larvae and adult flies shows some biases between subpopulation lines and the overall population, hinting at the potential for some degree of tissue residency in <italic>Drosophila</italic> or that individual tissues and their microenvironments can imprint tissue-specific transcriptional programmes upon plasmatocytes in those locations. Hemocytes are known to localise to and/or play specialised roles at a range of tissues including the respiratory epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sanchez Bosch et al., 2019</xref>), dorsal vessel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cevik et al., 2019</xref>), ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Van De Bor et al., 2015</xref>), wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kiger et al., 2001</xref>), gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayyaz et al., 2015</xref>), and proventriculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zaidman-Rémy et al., 2012</xref>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that particular subpopulations could be recruited to these locations or differentiate in situ in order to carry out specific functions. As hemocytes are thought to be relatively immobile in larvae and adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sanchez Bosch et al., 2019</xref>), recruitment may occur during embryonic stages or in pupae when these cells are more motile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moreira et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Paladi and Tepass, 2004</xref>). Vertebrate studies typically show acquisition of tissue resident transcriptional profiles after homing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gosselin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lavin et al., 2014</xref>) – therefore, it seems more likely that the ultimate environment in which plasmatocytes find themselves shapes their transcriptional profile. Further fine-tuning in response to local stimuli, such as via phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">A-Gonzalez et al., 2017</xref>), may also play a role in this process, as seen with increased exposure to apoptotic cells reducing plasmatocyte subpopulations in the developing embryo. Future work will establish the extent to which we can use flies to model the mechanisms by which tissue microenvironments sculpt macrophage heterogeneity.</p><p>Macrophage diversity enables these important innate immune cells to operate in a variety of niches and carry out a wide variety of functions in vertebrates. Our data demonstrate that not all macrophages are equivalent within the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, although the enhancers we have used to identify plasmatocyte subpopulations do not correspond to markers used in defining vertebrate macrophage polarisation or tissue resident populations in an obvious way. Therefore, how the subpopulations we have uncovered map onto existing vertebrate paradigms remains an open question. Nonetheless, these <italic>Drosophila</italic> subpopulations could be viewed as displaying a pro-inflammatory skewing of immune cell behaviours, given their enhanced wound responses, faster rates of migration and decreased efferocytic capacity. Pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1-like) in vertebrates are associated with clearance of pathogens, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and, most pertinently, initial responses to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benoit et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2-like) are more allied with tissue development and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Krzyszczyk et al., 2018</xref>) and can display enhanced rates of efferocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lingnau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ogden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zizzo et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Apoptotic cell clearance can promote anti-inflammatory states in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fadok et al., 1998</xref>). Consequently, it is both consistent and compelling that exposure of <italic>Drosophila</italic> plasmatocytes to excessive levels of apoptotic cells dampens their inflammatory responses to injury and rates of migration in the developing embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armitage et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Evans et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Roddie et al., 2019</xref>) and also shifts cells out of the more wound-responsive and potentially pro-inflammatory subpopulations we have discovered. Previous work suggests that macrophage polarisation may exist in <italic>Drosophila</italic> with infection causing hemocytes to prioritise aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Krejčová et al., 2019</xref>), similar to the situation on acquisition of pro-inflammatory states in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Van den Bossche et al., 2017</xref>). Parallels also exist in the eye following UV-induced damage, with upregulation of the M2 marker arginase in hemocytes as part of repair responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Neves et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, TGF-β signalling is associated with promotion of anti-inflammatory characteristics in vertebrates during resolution of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fadok et al., 1998</xref>) and these molecules can be found in discrete sets of hemocytes on injury and infection in adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clark et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, despite significant evolutionary distance between flies and vertebrates, comparable processes and mechanisms may control the behaviours of their innate immune cells.</p><p>We have concentrated on using the VT enhancers as reporters to follow subpopulation behaviour in vivo. While a lack of associated gene expression does not preclude the use of these enhancers to label subpopulations, these elements also potentially identify genes required for specific functions associated with each subpopulation. For instance, the <italic>VT17559</italic> enhancer overlaps <italic>Lisencephaly-1</italic>, which has been shown to be expressed in hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Williams, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, misexpression of <italic>Cnx14D</italic>, located proximally to the <italic>VT62766</italic> enhancer, was sufficient to improve overall wound responses, paralleling the behaviour of the <italic>VT62766-GAL4-</italic>labelled subpopulation. Cnx14D can bind calcium and therefore potentially modulates calcium signalling within plasmatocytes. Calcium signalling is known to influence wound responses in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Weavers et al., 2016</xref>) and plays a central role during phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cuttell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gronski et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, a molecule such as Cnx14D, which also has a known role in phagocytosis in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Müller-Taubenberger et al., 2001</xref>), could help fine-tune the behaviour of specific macrophage subpopulations. When considered in combination with the ability to manipulate the numbers of cells within subpopulations with physiologically relevant stimuli, the functional linkage of candidate genes with subpopulation behaviours strongly suggests that we have identified bona fide functionally and molecularly distinct macrophage subpopulations in the fly.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that <italic>Drosophila</italic> macrophages are a heterogeneous population of cells with distinct functional capabilities. We have characterised novel tools with which to visualise these subpopulations and have used these tools to reveal functional differences between these subpopulations and the general complement of hemocytes. Furthermore, we have shown that these subpopulations can be manipulated by exposure to apoptotic cells and can be linked to specific functional players.

High-resolution live imaging of plasmatocytes was carried out on an UltraView Spinning Disk system (Perkin Elmer) using a 40x UplanSApo oil immersion objective lens (NA 1.3). A Nikon A1 confocal microscope was used to image plasmatocyte morphology (40x CFI Super Plan Fluor ELWD oil immersion objective lens, NA 0.6) and a Zeiss Airyscan microscope (40x Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective lens, NA 1.4) was used for imaging of embryos stained with ROS dyes.</p><p>L1 and L2 larvae were allowed to develop at 22°C from embryos laid on apple juice agar plates at the same temperature. Larvae were selected and washed in distilled water in embryo baskets, then partially anaesthetised using diethyl ether (2 min for L1 larvae, 3.5 min for L2 larvae). Larvae were then transferred to double-sided tape and covered with halocarbon oil 500 (Sigma-Aldrich). Thickness one coverslip bridges (VWR) were attached to the tape either side of larvae and another coverslip placed across these supports (over the larvae) and attached in place with nail varnish. Larvae were immediately imaged on a MZ205 FA fluorescent dissection microscope with a 2x PLANAPO objective lens (Leica) and LasX software (Leica). To quantify numbers of cells labelled via the split GAL4 system in newly hatched larvae, L1 larvae were flattened under a coverslip in a small drop of halocarbon oil 500. Overlapping images of the flattened larvae were taken using the same microscope and mosaics assembled in Adobe Photoshop. Mosaics were blinded and the number of cells expressing Stinger counted using the multipoint selection tool in Fiji. The same microscope was also used to image L3 larvae, white pre-pupae (WPP), pupae, and adults (see below).</p><p>Wandering L3 Larvae and WPP were removed from straight-sided culture bottles containing the food on which they were reared at 25°C and cleaned in distilled water. L3 Larvae were imaged in fresh ice-cold, distilled water to minimise their movements, while WPP were immobilised on double-sided tape (Scotch). For analysis of plasmatocyte populations in pupae, white pre-pupae were also collected, aged at 25°C and the pupal cases removed at a range of times after puparium formation. Dissected pupae were covered with halocarbon oil 500 to prevent desiccation during imaging. For imaging of plasmatocyte populations in adults, females were aged in vials containing cornmeal/agar/molasses media (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) at 25°C, with no more than seven flies kept per vial.

Larvae were then ripped open from the posterior end using size five forceps to release hemocytes into the S2 cell media. Larval carcasses were gently agitated for 5 s before being removed from the S2 media droplet. The cell suspension was then transferred to a well of a 96-well plate (Greiner) and a further 75 μL of S2 media was added per well. Hemocytes were allowed to settle for at least 90 min in a humidified box prior to fixation. Cells were then fixed for 15 min using 4% EM-grade formaldehyde (Thermo Scientific) in PBS (Oxoid). Cells were then permeabilised for 4 min using 0.1% Triton-X-100 in PBS.

The bled larva was then transferred to another 75 μL drop of S2 media, while the media containing the initial bleed was transferred to a well in a 96-well plate. Bled larval carcasses were held down using a 27G needle and then jabbed/scraped with a separate needle to release sessile/adherent hemocytes. After jabbing/scraping, the carcass was removed, and the media droplet transferred to a well of a 96-well plate (Greiner).

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;.

(If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Coates et al. identify distinct subtypes of hemocytes by the Vienna tile enhancer-trap screen and propose the functional divergence of hemocyte subpopulations in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model organism. The authors label hemocyte with enhancer trap Gal4 drivers and identify Gal4 drivers that exhibit differential expressions in a subset of hemocytes. The Gal4-expressing subpopulations show dynamic patterns during embryonic- and larval development and in adult flies. The subpopulations are further characterized by testing their engagement in wound response, phagocytosis, or migratory activities. The authors also observe that enhancer trap expression in subpopulations changes under conditions such as enhanced organismal apoptosis. Finally, the authors show that cnx14D as an associated gene that promotes wound response in one of the subpopulations found.</p><p>This study utilizes an interesting genetic approach to understanding the heterogeneity of hemocytes and suggests the functionally distinct hemocyte subtypes in different stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Despite the potential merits of this study, the reviewers agreed that more wide-reaching and solid conclusions could be drawn by re-analyses of data and thorough and thoughtful rewriting. Many of the essential revisions can be adequately dealt with by careful rewriting and reanalyses and there are additional experiments required to sufficiently address the concerns. I have attached the reviewers' original comments below for details.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The loss of certain subpopulations shown at larval stages could be due to the disappearance of the subpopulation, but it could be also caused by changes in the enhancer activity. This point is not clear in the manuscript and requires better interpretations. As indicated in the reviewers' concerns (Reviewer 1 concern 1-2, Reviewer 2 concern 2), additional analyses with new experiments (such as GTRACE or Flp out) will clarify the issue.</p><p>2. Although the authors identified the subpopulations according to the differential patterns of VT-gal4, the molecular and biological characteristics of these cells need to be better established (Reviewer 1 concern 1-1 and Reviewer 3). Additional experiments will be essential for addressing the point by staining with representative antibodies (e.g. anti-Crq, anti-SIMU, anti-Draper) or enhancers.</p><p>3. As suggested by Reviewer 1 concern 3 and Reviewer 2 concerns 5-6, some of the expression patterns indicated by VT-gal4 in larvae or adults require additional analyses and quantitations.</p><p>4. Related to point 3, the characterization of larval hemocyte subpopulations need to be substantiated as indicated in Reviewer 1, concern 3 and Reviewer 2, concern 7. Since larval hemocytes relocate between local microenvironments and circulation, looking into earlier larval stages when hemocytes are more resident or proper bleeding of larval hemocytes will resolve the issue.</p><p>5. Related to point 3, detailed expression patterns of adult hemocytes can be better presented by providing closeup images (please see Reviewer 2, concern 5-6).</p><p>6. Given that hemocytes dynamically relocate and interact with other tissues, it will be critical to address as to how subpopulations shape during development and how they possibly interact with local microenvironments, as suggested in Reviewer 2, concern 1. One way of resolving this concern is to add discussions about recent relevant studies, as indicated in the reviewers' comments. And if possible, related experiments can be performed to sufficiently address the concern.</p><p>7. Related to point 6, recent scRNA-seq studies proposed subtypes/subpopulations of hemocytes based on differential transcriptome profiles. The authors can suggest and correlate the identified subtypes with previous analyses in the discussion (as suggested by Reviewer 2, concern 1).</p><p>8. As pointed in Reviewer 2 concern 4, srp-gal4 is relatively weak in larval hemocytes and may not be the most appropriate enhancer to use in the stage. It seems it is too late to repeat every experiment with an alternative driver. However, I would suggest to sufficiently discuss the issue in the discussion.</p><p>9. This is an optional point. Two of the reviewers suggested reconsidering the title.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Evans and colleagues used VT enhancer reporter lines to label plasmatocyte subpopulations and observed distinct subpopulations that are varied over development. Then the authors take on to characterize differential functions of these cells and found that each subpopulation exhibits variable wound responses, migratory activities, and reactivity to cell death. Further, the authors showed that overexpression of cnx14D, which is coupled with one of the VT-gal4, improves wound responses similar to the cnx14D-associated enhancer.</p><p>This timely study suggests that hemocytes are more heterogeneous than has been thought. Moreover, functional analyses highlight that each subpopulation may exhibit differential activities to immune/wound responses. Related to recent single-cell studies where different subtypes of hemocytes are shown, this study will provide functional insights into how each plasmatocyte subpopulation behaves differently under diverse responses. Overall, I found this study interesting and will be of broad interest to the immunity/hematopoiesis field, however, there are several points that need to be substantiated with regard to the characterization of subpopulations and functional analyses of cnx14D.</p><p>1. Characterization of the subpopulation</p><p>a. In the recent scRNA seq analyses, the subpopulation/subtype/subclass of hemocytes was defined by differential expressions of multiple genes or by transcriptional activities. In the other study, subtypes of lamellocytes derived upon wasp infestation were validated by multiple reporter lines as well as protein expressions (Anderl et al., 2016). Is the expression of VT enhancer alone sufficient for defining the subpopulation? Co-expression of VT+ subpopulations with other markers and quantitation of each population would clarify and strengthen the main findings of this work.</p><p>b. The authors showed that VT+ subpopulations change their numbers during the embryonic development, and most of the subpopulations are significantly reduced or even absent in the 3rd instar larvae. These patterns can be explained by changes in the enhancer activity and may not reflect the loss of specific cells. Are hemocytes that had turned on a VT-gal4 remain afterward (larval to WPP) while shutting off its expression? Or do they disappear or die? This question can be in part addressed by the tracing experiment (UAS-Gtrace).</p><p>c. We can predict possible target genes of each VT enhancer by their genomic locations. However, enhancer activity does not always reflect the expressions of the associated gene. The authors showed the functional correlation of VT62766 cells with cnx14D without providing evidence for cnx14D expression in the VT62766 subpopulation. Is cnx14D found in the recent scRNA seq data? If so, how does it correlate to (number, developmental stage) the pattern shown by VT62766? If not, can it be validated by mRNA FISH?</p><p>2. The authors showed that overexpression of cnx14D in most hemocytes enhances wound responses with more plasmatocytes responding. This phenotype could be due to altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics given the function of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the wound response as the authors mentioned and does not sufficiently prove that enhanced wound response seen in VT62766+ cells is caused by cnx14D. Does cnx14D RNAi reduce the wound response of VT62766+ hemocytes? And how do the authors expect the 3' end enhancer function in the cnx14D expression or function?</p><p>3. Hemocyte populations in larvae and adults need better quantitation and characterization (Figure 3-5). As the whole larvae image only displays the sessile portion of hemocytes, it should be accompanied by proper bleeding of hemocytes. Bleeding hemocytes before and after vortexing, in case of larvae, will separate sessile and circulating hemocyte pools and quantitation of each VT+ cells per total DAPI or other hemocyte markers will provide a clear overview of each subpopulation. Similarly, adult hemocytes can be quantified after bleeding. Moreover, hemocytes attached to each body part can be quantified as shown in Bosch et al. 2019. Since the authors claim that each subpopulation is closely associated with specific sites, this should be quantified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the model organism <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Coates et al. identify functionally distinct macrophage (plasmatocyte) populations. Findings will inform <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis, immunity, and wound healing. The authors label macrophage subpopulations through enhancer element GAL4 drivers, which show dynamic patterns of expression during development and in the ageing adult fly. Testing by criteria such as wound responses, and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, the authors find differential engagement of certain macrophage subpopulations. They further find that reporter expression in subpopulations changes during development and shifts under conditions such as enhanced organismal apoptosis. Lastly, the authors provide proof of principle how this enhancer collection can lead to gene discovery: they identify calnexin 14D as a gene that promotes wound responses.</p><p>Overall this study is based on an interesting approach. Experiments are carefully conducted. However, in the current state the study misses more wide-reaching conclusions. In some cases the authors seem to make rather unlikely speculations, which should be tested in order to draw solid conclusions. Also, existing literature should be taken more into consideration and cited accordingly.</p><p>1. While the authors have surveyed the enhancer-based lines quite broadly, the manuscript does not convey a clear take-home message. What do we really learn from this study functionally? For example, are hemocyte populations shaped by their environment and function, or vice versa do they home to their anatomical sites driven by their expression makeup? While the authors seem to gravitate toward the latter explanation, I think the former is much more likely, also because there is precedent in vertebrates: Lavin et al. Cell 2014, and Gosselin et al. Cell 2014 showed that tissue-resident macrophage enhancer landscapes, and tissue-specific macrophage identities, are shaped by local microenvironments. I think it would be important to investigate this question in more detail, so the authors can draw conclusions based on their findings, whichever way it may be.</p><p>2. During development and in the adult, the authors find that certain reporters cease to be detected; likely these hemocyte subpopulations are not lost but the reporter expression is simply downregulated. However, this needs to be properly analyzed by some kind of lineage tracing, such as GTRACE or flipout-lacZ lineage tracing.</p><p>3. Can the authors, based on their findings of functionally distinct hemocyte behaviors, suggest correlation of certain subgroups of this study with differentially expressing clusters in scRNAseq studies that were recently published? How about plasmatocyte clusters that may resemble vertebrate M1 or M2 macrophages?</p><p>4. Srp-GAL4 is not the best driver for hemocytes in the larva, and may be weak in many plasmatocytes by itself. With this approach the authors may overlook many cells that form plasmatocyte subpopulations. I think it would make more sense to perform split GAL4 expression with one part of GAL4 expressed under Hml∆ control.</p><p>5. In the adult, do the expression domains really overlap with the general srp expression? It doesn't look like that to me in some of the current images, and it would be helpful if this could be shown in closeups, and highlighted in the images. Also, some kind of model that would indicate the different populations would be helpful.</p><p>6. The authors restrict quantification of hemocyte subsets to the population of hemocytes in the VNC. Would the relative fraction of hemocytes be different elsewhere?</p><p>7. Late 3rd instar larvae were used to release hemocytes. However since at that point hemocytes already enter circulation, their defined expression properties may start to be lost, if indeed hemocyte subgroups are defined by factors from local microenvironments. Perhaps it would be beneficial to look earlier (second or early third instar), when hemocytes are still more resident?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a solid study, which reveals that <italic>Drosophila</italic> plasmatocytes (macrophages) are not a uniform population as it was considered previously. The authors identified and characterized distinct subpopulations of the fly macrophages, which exhibit molecular and functional differences, and specific localization during different developmental stages. This exciting finding establishes heterogeneity in the innate immune system, which is not connected to adaptive immunity. The authors also reveal that subpopulation sizes are affected by increased apoptosis, demonstrating plasticity of the system. In addition, genes associated with the subpopulation-specific enhancers might act as the effector genes of the specific function, which is nicely exemplified with overexpression of calnexin14-D and opens new directions in clarifying the mechanisms regulating macrophage diversity.</p><p>I am reluctant to ask for additional experiments but it would be interesting to test whether other known genes involved in efferocytosis by macrophages like crq show differential expression in distinct subpopulations. It could be examined by immunostaining of different VT-Gal4&gt;GFP labeled populations with anti-Crq, anti-Draper and anti-SIMU antibodies.</p><p>In my view, the paper is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> as it stands.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58686.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The loss of certain subpopulations shown at larval stages could be due to the disappearance of the subpopulation, but it could be also caused by changes in the enhancer activity. This point is not clear in the manuscript and requires better interpretations. As indicated in the reviewers' concerns (Reviewer 1 concern 1-2, Reviewer 2 concern 2), additional analyses with new experiments (such as GTRACE or Flp out) will clarify the issue.</p></disp-quote><p>In our experience we have not observed apoptosis of hemocytes during larval development. Consistent with this, there is no evidence in the literature that suggests there is significant death of blood cells during larval development that could explain the decrease in numbers of subpopulation cells by the L3 stage. This suggests that subpopulations of labelled cells may be lost via reprogramming to alternative states, which would very likely involve changes in gene expression (that are visualised by our reporters). We therefore interpret the loss of enhancer activity as a loss of subpopulation identity and an example of cellular plasticity, as witnessed in reprogramming of macrophages during inflammatory responses in vertebrates. We have made this important point clearer in the manuscript at various points. In addition, we also present additional lineage tracing experiments we have undertaken that also support this conclusion (see below).</p><p>As requested, we have added further characterisation of subpopulations at a number of developmental stages and expanded our characterisation to include larval stages L1 and L2 in a completely new figure (Figure 3). This new data includes quantification of the proportions of blood cells that are positive for VT enhancer expression in L1 larvae (Figure 3c), L3 larvae (new data, Figure 4g-h) and in adults (new data, Figure 7f). This reveals additional information about the dynamics of these subpopulations and identified a dramatic decrease in proportions of labelled cells between L2 and wandering L3 stages of development. The L1 and L2 data are described from page 9, line 198. The L3 data are described from page 10, line 228. The adult data are described and discussed from page 13, line 294.</p><p>Furthermore, we have used lineage tracing (G-TRACE) in combination with our split GAL4 lines to investigate reprogramming of subpopulation cells during larval stages in a new figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1a-b). These data show that VT reporter expression is dynamic and many cells seem to switch off expression during larval development. This supports the hypothesis that these subpopulations are plastic and change across the lifecourse. These data are described from page 11, line 237.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Although the authors identified the subpopulations according to the differential patterns of VT-gal4, the molecular and biological characteristics of these cells need to be better established (Reviewer 1 concern 1-1 and Reviewer 3). Additional experiments will be essential for addressing the point by staining with representative antibodies (e.g. anti-Crq, anti-SIMU, anti-Draper) or enhancers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this point through a series of new experiments, visualising subpopulation cells using novel GAL4-independent lines we have made (<italic>VT-RFP</italic>) in combination with enhancer-based reporters of known markers (Crq, Simu, Eater). <italic>eater-GFP</italic> does not overlap with subpopulation cells in the embryo (new figure, Figure 2—figure supplement 1). <italic>simu-cytGFP</italic> expression is uniformly expressed in embryonic plasmatocytes and therefore does not specifically define subpopulation cells (new figure, Figure 2—figure supplement 2a,c). In contrast to <italic>simu</italic> and as shown in Figure 1b-b’, <italic>crq-GAL4</italic> expression is very heterogeneous (new figure, Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Despite this heterogeneity, <italic>crq</italic> expression does not define subpopulation cells by either its presence or absence (Figure 2—figure supplement 1b-c) with cells expressing RFP alone, GFP alone and both fluorophores present for each <italic>VT-RFP</italic> line tested. Taken together this data suggests that VT-labelled subpopulations do not show obvious overlap with the three well-characterised markers we have investigated. This new data is described from page 8, line 162.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. As suggested by Reviewer 1 concern 3 and Reviewer 2 concerns 5-6, some of the expression patterns indicated by VT-gal4 in larvae or adults require additional analyses and quantitations.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2 asked about numbers of subpopulation cells in regions away from the VNC (point 6). We have now visualised and quantified elsewhere in the embryo using the split GAL4 lines (new data, Figure 3—figure supplement 1b-g). The relative amounts of each subpopulation seem similar in different regions of the embryo (although numbers of cells detected increases as development proceeds since it is difficult to detect subpopulations at earlier stages when expression first begins). This new data is described and discussed from page 8, line 179. Quantification of subpopulations in L1 larvae (new data, Figure 3c), L3 larvae (new data, Figure 4g) and the adult (new data, Figure 7f) are now also provided.</p><p>Reviewer 2 also queried overlap between <italic>srp</italic> domains and subpopulations in the adult. There is biological variation between flies such that the position of hemocytes is not completely stereotyped. As a result it is not expected that the positions of cells in control and experimental images will align perfectly. However, we have replaced the original control panel with a better example in which the thoracic cells are more in focus and have used alternative views taken of the same fly to highlight leg and proboscis hemocytes (Figure 7a). Close ups are also now provided (Figure 7a-e).</p><p>Reviewer 1 asked us to investigate <italic>Cnx14D</italic> expression: at least three very closely related genes encode Calnexin proteins in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome: <italic>Cnx14D</italic>, <italic>Cnx99A</italic> and <italic>CG1924</italic>, complicating probe design for in situ hybridisation approaches. Nonetheless, we generated a collection of fluorescently-labelled RNA oligonucleotide probes using Stellaris probe design software that were specific to <italic>Cnx14D</italic> which should target neither <italic>Cnx99A</italic> nor <italic>CG1924</italic>. A probe library for <italic>EGFP</italic> was also generated as a positive control. While we were able to detect <italic>EGFP</italic> expression within embryos containing macrophage-specific expression of <italic>EGFP</italic> (data not shown), <italic>Cnx14D</italic> signals were considerably weaker and barely detectable above background / noise (data not shown). This suggests either that our probes did not work or that <italic>Cnx14D</italic> transcripts are expressed at levels below the detection threshold. Interestingly, genome-wide transcriptional data generated by the modENCODE consortium (Graveley et al., 2011 Nature) reports low transcript levels for this gene within embryos consistent with our difficulties detecting <italic>Cnx14D</italic> expression via in situ hybridisation. Sadly, the only two published enhancer trap reporters we were able to identify (<italic>Cnx14D<sup>PG156</sup></italic> and <italic>Cnx14D<sup>PL42</sup></italic>; Bourbon et al., 2002 Mech Dev) are no longer extant, having been discarded in spring 2020 (Alain Vincent, personal communication).</p><p>We also attempted to address this at the protein level via immunostaining. There is no <italic>Drosophila</italic>-specific antibody available and the anti-hCalnexin antibody that we were able to source (Rb anti-Calnexin ab75801, Abcam) did not appear to detect the fly protein (data not shown). As such, we have tried multiple means to profile expression at the RNA and protein level, but unfortunately to make progress will require further new reagents or a different approach that is beyond the scope of these revisions.</p><p>Finally, we interrogated single-cell sequencing data (only openly available for two studies: Tattikota et al., 2020 and Cattenoz et al., 2020). Both studies applied scRNAseq to cells bled from L3 larvae, the stage at which subpopulation cells are least apparent. Cattenoz et al. did not find <italic>Cnx14D</italic> transcripts, although expression within one cluster (PM6) was identified by Tattikota et al. However, this expression was not robust with only 2% of cells in this cluster expressing <italic>Cnx14D</italic> (11/500 cells). Therefore, it is possible that <italic>Cnx14D</italic> produces low abundance transcripts which make detection difficult via both in situ hybridization and scRNAseq.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Related to point 3, the characterization of larval hemocyte subpopulations need to be substantiated as indicated in Reviewer 1, concern 3 and Reviewer 2, concern 7. Since larval hemocytes relocate between local microenvironments and circulation, looking into earlier larval stages when hemocytes are more resident or proper bleeding of larval hemocytes will resolve the issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We have imaged subpopulations in L1 and L2 larvae and quantified numbers in the former (new Figure 3). We have also made videos of L1 larvae (new Video 2, cited page 9, line 208). While substantial numbers of blood cells are labelled in L1 larvae, fewer are labelled than in <italic>serpent</italic> controls (new Figure 3a-c). Live videos of L1 larvae (new Video 2) show that the majority of VT-labelled cells are attached to the body wall and therefore do not change their relative positions as the larvae contract and attempt to crawl. The large numbers of subpopulation cells (roughly 50% of the total population) in L1 and L2 larvae makes localisation beyond what we have described difficult to discern. This data is described from page 9, line 198.</p><p>We have also made additional videos to cover each genotype at L3 stages and tracked cells to show that at least some subpopulation cells are in circulation (new Video 4), with many of the subpopulation cells appearing to be attached to the body wall. This data is described from page 10, line 224.</p><p>We have performed bleeds as suggested and characterised relative numbers of sessile and circulating cells and this new data is presented in Figure 4g. This substantiates the imaging showing subpopulation cells are present both in circulation and attached to the body wall, since similar proportions are present in initial bleeds and following scraping of larval carcasses to retrieve sessile cells (as per the method of Petraki et al., 2015 JOVE). This data is described from page 10, line 228.</p><p>The numbers of larvae showing the localisations described in the L3 stages are now shown in Figure 4c-f as annotations within the respective figure panels.</p><p>Lastly, we have quantified the localisation of the subpopulation cells along the body axis and this data suggests there is a bias in the localisation towards the posterior end compared to localisations of the overall population (Figure 4h-h’). This is described from page 10, line 233.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Related to point 3, detailed expression patterns of adult hemocytes can be better presented by providing closeup images (please see Reviewer 2, concern 5-6).</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide close ups of the key images and extra annotation (Figure 7a-e). See Point 3 above for our response regarding overlap with <italic>srp</italic> expression domains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Given that hemocytes dynamically relocate and interact with other tissues, it will be critical to address as to how subpopulations shape during development and how they possibly interact with local microenvironments, as suggested in Reviewer 2, concern 1. One way of resolving this concern is to add discussions about recent relevant studies, as indicated in the reviewers' comments. And if possible, related experiments can be performed to sufficiently address the concern.</p></disp-quote><p>The key message of this paper is the identification of subpopulation plasmatocytes that exhibit functionally distinct behaviours compared to the overall complement of blood cells. As such, our work moves the field beyond description of largely uncharacterised sub-groups in larval blood found via scRNAseq, data that emerged during preparation of our manuscript.</p><p>We look forward to investigating whether subpopulations home to specific tissues or are specified in situ but this is significantly beyond the scope of this work as it requires long-term live imaging of larvae or pupae. We look forward to exploring this in more detail in the future. We have however discussed existing precedents in the discussion from page 22, line 511.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Related to point 6, recent scRNA-seq studies proposed subtypes/subpopulations of hemocytes based on differential transcriptome profiles. The authors can suggest and correlate the identified subtypes with previous analyses in the discussion (as suggested by Reviewer 2, concern 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We now include a paragraph in the discussion in which we suggest how the subpopulations we have uncovered may relate to the clusters that have been identified via scRNAseq approaches. This appears on page 20, line 466.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. As pointed in Reviewer 2 concern 4, srp-gal4 is relatively weak in larval hemocytes and may not be the most appropriate enhancer to use in the stage. It seems it is too late to repeat every experiment with an alternative driver. However, I would suggest to sufficiently discuss the issue in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point; however the reviewer is correct in pointing out that it is too late to repeat experiments with another driver. However, we would suggest that the <italic>srp</italic> driver is appropriate (or at least sufficient) in this context. Other groups have successfully used the same promoter fragment to label larval hemocytes (Gyoergy et al., 2018) and our positive controls (<italic>srp-AD</italic> with <italic>srp-DBD</italic>) show clear labelling of large numbers of larval hemocytes validating the use of <italic>srp-AD</italic> in concert with <italic>VT-DBD</italic> at these stages (Figure 4b; new Video 3). This is described from page 9, line 198.</p><p>However, to address this criticism more directly we have also dissected cells from larvae in which the original <italic>VT-GAL4</italic> constructs were used to drive expression from <italic>UAS-stinger</italic> and quantified the proportions labelled (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). This approach did not label more cells than the split GAL4 approach and, if anything, the split GAL4 approach is more sensitive. This suggests the split GAL4 approach’s reliance on <italic>serpent</italic>-based drivers does not dramatically alter the result and that <italic>serpent</italic>-negative, VT-positive cells do not make a large contribution to these subpopulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. This is an optional point. Two of the reviewers suggested reconsidering the title.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed “regulated by efferocytosis” from the title. The title now reflects the most important aspect of the paper – the discovery of functional differences that can be associated with specific and discrete cell populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Evans and colleagues used VT enhancer reporter lines to label plasmatocyte subpopulations and observed distinct subpopulations that are varied over development. Then the authors take on to characterize differential functions of these cells and found that each subpopulation exhibits variable wound responses, migratory activities, and reactivity to cell death. Further, the authors showed that overexpression of cnx14D, which is coupled with one of the VT-gal4, improves wound responses similar to the cnx14D-associated enhancer.</p><p>This timely study suggests that hemocytes are more heterogeneous than has been thought. Moreover, functional analyses highlight that each subpopulation may exhibit differential activities to immune/wound responses. Related to recent single-cell studies where different subtypes of hemocytes are shown, this study will provide functional insights into how each plasmatocyte subpopulation behaves differently under diverse responses. Overall, I found this study interesting and will be of broad interest to the immunity/hematopoiesis field, however, there are several points that need to be substantiated with regard to the characterization of subpopulations and functional analyses of cnx14D.</p><p>1. Characterization of the subpopulation</p><p>a. In the recent scRNA seq analyses, the subpopulation/subtype/subclass of hemocytes was defined by differential expressions of multiple genes or by transcriptional activities. In the other study, subtypes of lamellocytes derived upon wasp infestation were validated by multiple reporter lines as well as protein expressions (Anderl et al., 2016). Is the expression of VT enhancer alone sufficient for defining the subpopulation? Co-expression of VT+ subpopulations with other markers and quantitation of each population would clarify and strengthen the main findings of this work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this as part of our response to essential revision 2 with new experimental data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The authors showed that VT+ subpopulations change their numbers during the embryonic development, and most of the subpopulations are significantly reduced or even absent in the 3rd instar larvae. These patterns can be explained by changes in the enhancer activity and may not reflect the loss of specific cells. Are hemocytes that had turned on a VT-gal4 remain afterward (larval to WPP) while shutting off its expression? Or do they disappear or die? This question can be in part addressed by the tracing experiment (UAS-Gtrace).</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed these points as part of our response to essential revision 1, quantifying L1 and L2 larvae and performing lineage tracing as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. We can predict possible target genes of each VT enhancer by their genomic locations. However, enhancer activity does not always reflect the expressions of the associated gene. The authors showed the functional correlation of VT62766 cells with cnx14D without providing evidence for cnx14D expression in the VT62766 subpopulation. Is cnx14D found in the recent scRNA seq data? If so, how does it correlate to (number, developmental stage) the pattern shown by VT62766? If not, can it be validated by mRNA FISH?</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed these points as part of our response to essential revisions 3 and 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors showed that overexpression of cnx14D in most hemocytes enhances wound responses with more plasmatocytes responding. This phenotype could be due to altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics given the function of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the wound response as the authors mentioned and does not sufficiently prove that enhanced wound response seen in VT62766+ cells is caused by cnx14D. Does cnx14D RNAi reduce the wound response of VT62766+ hemocytes? And how do the authors expect the 3' end enhancer function in the cnx14D expression or function?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments and agree understanding how Cnx14D impacts calcium dynamics is a fascinating new area of research – one that is being actively pursued in the Evans and Zeidler labs at this time. It is however significantly beyond the scope of this paper, but will be the subject and focus of a further publication in due course.</p><p>Regarding the role of the <italic>VT62766</italic> enhancer, which sits 3’ to <italic>Cnx14D</italic> – it is well established that enhancers can operate at either ends of a gene to regulate its transcription. For example, the enhancers that regulate <italic>even skipped</italic> expression for stripes 4+6 and 1+5 lie 3’ to that gene (Borok et al., 2010 Development).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Hemocyte populations in larvae and adults need better quantitation and characterization (Figure 3-5). As the whole larvae image only displays the sessile portion of hemocytes, it should be accompanied by proper bleeding of hemocytes. Bleeding hemocytes before and after vortexing, in case of larvae, will separate sessile and circulating hemocyte pools and quantitation of each VT+ cells per total DAPI or other hemocyte markers will provide a clear overview of each subpopulation. Similarly, adult hemocytes can be quantified after bleeding. Moreover, hemocytes attached to each body part can be quantified as shown in Bosch et al. 2019. Since the authors claim that each subpopulation is closely associated with specific sites, this should be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>These comments have been addressed in response to essential revisions 3-6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the model organism <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Coates et al. identify functionally distinct macrophage (plasmatocyte) populations. Findings will inform <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis, immunity, and wound healing. The authors label macrophage subpopulations through enhancer element GAL4 drivers, which show dynamic patterns of expression during development and in the ageing adult fly. Testing by criteria such as wound responses, and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, the authors find differential engagement of certain macrophage subpopulations. They further find that reporter expression in subpopulations changes during development and shifts under conditions such as enhanced organismal apoptosis. Lastly, the authors provide proof of principle how this enhancer collection can lead to gene discovery: they identify calnexin 14D as a gene that promotes wound responses.</p><p>Overall this study is based on an interesting approach. Experiments are carefully conducted. However, in the current state the study misses more wide-reaching conclusions. In some cases the authors seem to make rather unlikely speculations, which should be tested in order to draw solid conclusions. Also, existing literature should be taken more into consideration and cited accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments and hope that the extra experiments we have conducted satisfactorily address their points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. While the authors have surveyed the enhancer-based lines quite broadly, the manuscript does not convey a clear take-home message. What do we really learn from this study functionally? For example, are hemocyte populations shaped by their environment and function, or vice versa do they home to their anatomical sites driven by their expression makeup? While the authors seem to gravitate toward the latter explanation, I think the former is much more likely, also because there is precedent in vertebrates: Lavin et al. Cell 2014, and Gosselin et al. Cell 2014 showed that tissue-resident macrophage enhancer landscapes, and tissue-specific macrophage identities, are shaped by local microenvironments. I think it would be important to investigate this question in more detail, so the authors can draw conclusions based on their findings, whichever way it may be.</p></disp-quote><p>The main message of this paper is the identification of functionally-distinct subpopulations of plasmatocytes. This links molecular differences to specific and distinct cellular behaviours. How subpopulations are specified by local microenvironments is an interesting (but supplementary and secondary) question that would not be conceivable without having first defined subpopulations. Nonetheless, this work identifies at least one mechanism (apoptotic cell clearance) regulating the identities we have found. We have added the existing precedents on page 22, line 511, but believe that investigating this in more detail lies beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. During development and in the adult, the authors find that certain reporters cease to be detected; likely these hemocyte subpopulations are not lost but the reporter expression is simply downregulated. However, this needs to be properly analyzed by some kind of lineage tracing, such as GTRACE or flipout-lacZ lineage tracing.</p></disp-quote><p>See essential revision point 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Can the authors, based on their findings of functionally distinct hemocyte behaviors, suggest correlation of certain subgroups of this study with differentially expressing clusters in scRNAseq studies that were recently published? How about plasmatocyte clusters that may resemble vertebrate M1 or M2 macrophages?</p></disp-quote><p>These questions have been addressed in response to essential revision 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Srp-GAL4 is not the best driver for hemocytes in the larva, and may be weak in many plasmatocytes by itself. With this approach the authors may overlook many cells that form plasmatocyte subpopulations. I think it would make more sense to perform split GAL4 expression with one part of GAL4 expressed under Hml∆ control.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed in response to essential revision 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In the adult, do the expression domains really overlap with the general srp expression? It doesn't look like that to me in some of the current images, and it would be helpful if this could be shown in closeups, and highlighted in the images. Also, some kind of model that would indicate the different populations would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>These comments have been addressed in response to essential revisions 3-5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors restrict quantification of hemocyte subsets to the population of hemocytes in the VNC.

Late 3rd instar larvae were used to release hemocytes. However since at that point hemocytes already enter circulation, their defined expression properties may start to be lost, if indeed hemocyte subgroups are defined by factors from local microenvironments. Perhaps it would be beneficial to look earlier (second or early third instar), when hemocytes are still more resident?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now characterised L1 and L2 larvae (Figure 3); see also essential revision point 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is a solid study, which reveals that <italic>Drosophila</italic> plasmatocytes (macrophages) are not a uniform population as it was considered previously.
