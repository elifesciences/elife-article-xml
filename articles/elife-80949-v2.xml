Here, we show classical cardiac hypertrophy markers were absent in TG<sup>AC8</sup>, and that total left ventricular (LV) mass was not increased: a reduced LV cavity volume in TG<sup>AC8</sup> was encased by thicker LV walls harboring an increased number of small cardiac myocytes, and a network of small interstitial proliferative non-cardiac myocytes compared to wild type (WT) littermates; Protein synthesis, proteosome activity, and autophagy were enhanced in TG<sup>AC8</sup> vs WT, and Nrf-2, Hsp90α, and ACC2 protein levels were increased. Despite increased energy demands in vivo LV ATP and phosphocreatine levels in TG<sup>AC8</sup> did not differ from WT. Unbiased omics analyses identified more than 2,000 transcripts and proteins, comprising a broad array of biological processes across multiple cellular compartments, which differed by genotype; compared to WT, in TG<sup>AC8</sup> there was a shift from fatty acid oxidation to aerobic glycolysis in the context of increased utilization of the pentose phosphate shunt and nucleotide synthesis. Thus, marked overexpression of AC8 engages complex, coordinate adaptation &quot;circuity&quot; that has evolved in mammalian cells to defend against stress that threatens health or life (elements of which have already been shown to be central to cardiac ischemic pre-conditioning and exercise endurance cardiac conditioning) that may be of biological significance to allow for proper healing in disease states such as infarction or failure of the heart.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cardiac overexpression of human ADCY8</kwd><kwd>left ventricle</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>proteome</kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd><kwd>proteosome 35 activity</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>ROS scavenging</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd><kwd>protection from apoptosis</kwd><kwd>nutrient sensing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01HL155218</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Field</surname><given-names>Loren</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL136918</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paolocci</surname><given-names>Nazareno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL1155760</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paolocci</surname><given-names>Nazareno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL63030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiss</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL61912</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiss</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#18CDA34110140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ranek</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#20TPA35500008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ranek</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Overexpression of hAC8 engages complex, coordinate adaptation 'circuity' that has evolved in mammalian cells to defend against stress that threatens health or life, and may be important for proper healing in disease states such as heart infarction or failure.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adaptations have evolved in all organisms to cope with both acute and chronic internal and environmental stress. For example, during acute exercise increased autonomic sympathetic-mediated AC/cAMP/PKA/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, the quintessential mediator of both acute and chronic stress, also activates acute physiologic adaptations to moderate the exercise-induced increase in sympathetic signaling. In response to repeated bouts of acute exercise induced AC/cAMP/PKA/Ca<sup>2+</sup> stress, chronic adaptations emerge (endurance exercise conditioning) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vega et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Venturaclapier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lovallo, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Prolonged and intense chronic cAMP-mediated stress in experimental animal models results in cardiomyopathy and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antos et al., 2001</xref>). During chronic pathophysiologic states for example chronic heart failure (CHF) in humans, AC/cAMP/PKA/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling progressively increases as the degree of heart failure progresses, leading to cardiac inflammation, mediated in part, by cyclic-AMP- induced up-regulation of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) signaling. Standard therapies for CHF include β-adrenoreceptor blockers and RAS inhibitors, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Squire and Barnett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Werner and Böhm, 2008</xref>) which although effective, are suboptimal in amelioration of heart failure progression.</p><p>One strategy to devise novel and better therapies for heart failure, would be to uncover the full spectrum of concentric cardio- protective adaptations that becomes activated in response to severe, chronic AC/cAMP/PKA/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced cardiac stress. The young adult TG<sup>AC8</sup> heart in which cardiac-specific over expression in mice of Adenylyl Cyclase (AC) Type 8, driven by the α myosin heavy chain promoter, markedly enhances AC activity and cAMP signaling, may be an ideal model in which to elucidate the features of a wide-spread an adaptive paradigm that must become engaged in response to incessant chronic activation of cardiac AC/cAMP/PKA/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.

Overexpression in TG<sup>AC8</sup> LV of genes and proteins that are operative within the glucose metabolic pathway, for example G6PDH, PGD, and PRPS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>), suggests that the PPS is more highly utilized in the TG<sup>AC8</sup> vs WT LV. Enhanced utilization of PPS in TG<sup>AC8</sup> may be involved in re-synthesis of crucial amino acids and nucleotides following their degradation (via increased autophagy, mitophagy and proteosome activity in TG<sup>AC8</sup> vs WT). PPS and may also be involved in catalyzing the replenishment of NADPH in TG<sup>AC8</sup> via LDH and increased G6PDH and PGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>).

Enhancement of these processes in TG<sup>AC8</sup> via increased utilization of PPS may be linked to signals pointing to increased cell cycle, cell proliferation and growth and development in TG<sup>AC8</sup> vs WT.

Thus, increased utilization of aerobic glycolysis and PPS, in TG<sup>AC8</sup> vs WT may be a crucial factor that underlies increased cardiac biomass (thicker LV walls vs WT containing an increased number of small myocytes, and an increased number of EdU-labeled non-cardiac myocyte nuclei, in the absence of increased collagen deposition).</p><p>In addition to pointing to increased glycolysis in TG<sup>AC8</sup> vs WT, bioinformatic signals suggested that the fatty acid β oxidation pathway and pathways that degrade branched chained amino acids are concurrently reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>).

Thus, it might be expected that the persistent high cardiac workloads that are characteristic of TG<sup>AC8</sup> heart, in conjunction with reduced MAS and reduced expression of proteins involved in TCA cycle and mitochondrial respiration in TG<sup>AC8</sup> vs WT, are associated with increased replenishment of cytosolic NADH from NAD+, at the expense of replenishment of mitochondrial NADH from NAD<sup>+</sup> within mitochondria. It is also important to note that both transcripts and protein levels of IDH, which catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate, are reduced in TG<sup>AC8</sup> vs WT.

Samples were sonicated on ice (3x15 s at setting 2, with 15 s of rest between bursts). 1800 µl of lysates (combined from two mice) were used for membrane isolation. To each such combined sample a Sample Separation Buffer (SSB, composition: 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.01% PIC) was added to a total volume of 11 ml.

Following a quality control check, RNA was processed with a SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit - Pico Input Mammalian (Takara Bio USA, Inc). 75 bp single end reads generated 30–40 million reads per library. Raw RNA sequencing (RNASeq) reads were aligned and after quality trimming was mapped to the UCSC mm10 mouse reference genome and cDNA of human AC8 and assembled using Tophat v2.0 to generate BAM files for each sample. Cufflinks v.2.1.1 was used to calculate FPKM (Fragments per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) for each sample. Differential gene expression analysis was performed with a Cuffdiff package (Cufflinks v2.1.1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>LV proteome analysis</title><p>Four LV samples from WT and TG<sup>AC8</sup> mouse hearts were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. On average, 2 mg of muscle tissue from each sample was pulverized in liquid nitrogen and mixed with a lysis buffer containing (4% SDS, 1% Triton X-114, 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)), pH 7.6. Samples were sonicated on ice using a tip sonicator for 1 min with 3 s pulses and 15 s rest periods at 40% power. Lysates were centrifuged at +4 °C for 15 min at 14,000 rpm, aliquoted and stored at –80 °C until further processing. Protein concentration was determined using commercially available 2-D quant kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Sample quality was confirmed using NuPAGE protein gels stained with fluorescent SyproRuby protein stain (Thermo Fisher).</p><p>In order to remove detergents and lipids 500 µg of muscle tissue lysate was precipitated using a methanol/chloroform extraction protocol (sample:methanol:chloroform:water – 1:4:1:3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wessel and Flügge, 1984</xref>).

Nonsoluble fractions were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 10 min (4 °C). The homogenates were kept on ice and analyzed immediately. Stock solutions of 1-hydroxy-3-methoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrrolidine hydrochloride (CMH; Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) were prepared daily in nitrogen purged 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, 25 g/L Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad) and 0.1 mM DTPA, and kept on ice.

Briefly, isolated cardiomyocytes were resuspended in HEPES buffer: 137 mM NaCl, 4.9 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 15 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES, and 1.0 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (pH to 7.3). To assess the susceptibility of the mPTP to induction by ROS, cells were loaded with 100 nM tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM; Invitrogen I34361) for at least 2 hr at room temperature. Cells were imaged with an LSM-510 inverted confocal microscope, using a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss Inc, Jena, Germany) with the optical slice set to 1 µm. Images were processed by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). Line scan images at 2 Hz were recorded from ~22 mitochondria arrayed along individual myofibrils with excitation at 543 nm and collecting emission at &gt;560 nm, and the confocal pinhole was set to obtain spatial resolutions of 0.4 µm in the horizontal plane and 1 µm in the axial dimension. Repetitive laser scanning of this row of mitochondria in a myocyte loaded with TMRM results in incremental, additive exposure of only the laser-exposed area to the photodynamic production of ROS and consequent mPTP induction. The occurrence of mPTP induction is clearly identified by the immediate dissipation of ΔΨ in individual mitochondria and is seen at the point in time where “columns” of the line scan image suddenly lose TMRM fluorescence intensity and become black (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The ROS threshold for mPTP induction (tmPTP) was determined as the average time necessary to induce mPTP in the exposed row mitochondria (N=3 in each genotype) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M and N</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-28"><title>Determination of autophagolysosome accumulation</title><p>Cardiomyocytes were loaded with the autophagy dye from CYTO-ID Autophagy detection kit (ENZO 51031-K200), according the manufacturer protocol (dilution 1:500 in HEPES buffer) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then the dye was washed out by HEPES buffer and cell imaged with a confocal microscope (see above) in frame mode using 488 nm excitation and &gt;505 nm emission filter. Images were processed by MetaMorph software. To discriminate the fluorescent spots representing autophagolysosomes from background and to ensure that all staining analyzed was only the true positive labelling, a defined threshold value was set for 488 nm excited fluorescence pixel intensity. The area of cell occupied by autophagolysosomes was expressed as fraction of total cell area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aon et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-29"><title>Source data</title><p>We provided source data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">13</xref>.

The connection between this study and cancer is less clear, which appears to be primarily based on the transcriptomic and proteomic studies. While malignancy and the cardiovascular phenotype in this mouse model share certain cellular properties (cell proliferation, inflammation, changes in metabolic profiles), the relationship between the two is hypothesis generating.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the connection made between our results and cancer in the original manuscript was somewhat confusing and highlighting this connection may have appeared to hypothesis generating. We have removed reference to cancer from the Abstract and have referred to it only in one part of the Discussion, which we have rewritten for clarity, as follows:</p><p>When we attempted to ascertain the extent to which cardiac protection circuits identified in the TG<sup>AC8</sup> LV (Figure 13) might be utilized as adaptations to the stress of various disease states, the top disease categories identified in both the TG<sup>AC8</sup> transcriptome and proteome were Organismal Injury and Abnormalities and Cancer, the latter category being subsumed within the former. Because it is well known that cancers of the heart are rare, the implication of the patterns of “cancer” in the TG<sup>AC8</sup> LV based on our bioinformatics analytic tools (IPA analyses) was at first puzzling to us, so we tried to rationalize what that might mean. But, as pointed out by Weinberg and Hanahan in their “Hallmarks of Cancer” <sup>15, 16</sup> mammalian cells have evolved complex concentric circuits to defend against stress that threatens their health or life, and envisioned that cancer cells successfully breach one or more of these concentrically arrayed defenses, because of somatic mutations in genes coding for proteins within this adaptive circuitry. They referred to this ability of cancer cells to breach this defense circuitry as the “Hallmarks of Cancer,” which, in reality, mirrored aspects of the mammalian complex defense circuitry that had been breached.</p><p>Thus, we envisioned that the overwhelming cardiac stress within heart cells of chronic intense AC/PKA/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, due to the expression of a single gene, AC8, engages this conserved complex mammalian concentric defense circuitry within heart cells that is embodied in over 250 canonical signaling pathways that were differentially enriched or activated in TG<sup>AC8</sup> vs WT. Numerous processes within these pathways, e.g., protection from apoptosis, enhanced survival, engagement of aerobic glycolysis, increased proliferation, enhanced protein synthesis and quality control, increased inflammatory and immune response, enhanced tissue damage repair and regeneration because the sequalae of marked chronically increased AC/cAMP/PKA signaling illustrated in TG<sup>AC8</sup> LV protection circuitry (Figure 13), are embodied within the “Hallmarks of Cancer”. <sup>15, 16</sup> We envision that engagement of this concentric protection circuitry in TG<sup>AC8</sup> allows its heart to cope (for at least up to a year with numerous, marked cell-tissue stressors driven by the markedly augmented AC-cAMP-PKA-Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling).<sup>10</sup> “Very limited versions” of this emergent cardio-protective profile in the TG<sup>AC8</sup> LV have been previously discovered (by reductionist biologic research) to be central to cardiac ischemic pre-conditioning<sup>88</sup> and exercise endurance cardiac conditioning.<sup>1,89</sup></p><p>When our omics data reflecting engagement of concentric adaptive circuits within the TG<sup>AC8</sup> LV but were specifically filtered for “cardiovascular system” and “cardiovascular disease,” bioinformatic analyses predicted features commonly associated with a variety of cardiomyopathies (Table S.11 A, B). The basis of this prediction, to us, seems likely to stem from the fact that omics “insights”, generated by findings in prior cross-sectional studies of experimental heart failure, may have often been misinterpreted to be causal factors of the heart failure, rather than adaptations that are activated to compensate for the causal factors of heart failure, due to a lack of longitudinal prospective.</p><p>Chronic consistent engagement of numerous adaptive pathways, however, may present a double-edged sword, compensating for the stress of chronic myocardial performance in the “short run”, but becoming maladaptive when utilized over prolonged periods of time. In fact, TG<sup>AC8</sup> mice have a reduced (about 30%) <sup>10</sup> median life span, and later in life (about 12 mo) marked LV fibrosis and dilated cardiomyopathy become manifest. Thus studies, conducted longitudinally over the TG<sup>AC8</sup> life course, are required in order to determine which of these correlated findings are cause-and-effect vs those that are simply associated. In other terms, longitudinal analysis are required to dissect out which mechanism within the “super performing heart” of the TG<sup>AC8</sup> during young adulthood gradually fail over a prolonged period of time, resulting in accelerated cardiac aging and severe, dilated cardiomyopathy.<sup>10</sup></p><p>We trust that revising the Discussion in this way clarifies what we mean by our reference to cancer in this context. Of note, the majority of studies in the cardiac literature these days, being somewhat reductionist in nature, usually focus on one or another pathway of this concentric stress adaptation circuitry. Here, we have been able to achieve a broad view of concentric adaptive circuity in the TGAC8 heart and feel that it is important to preserve this idea in our paper, because the relationship between the two is hypothesis generating and is a new way of thinking about the heart’s exquisite, complex, built-in, <italic>concentric circuitry</italic> to cope with stress. But if you still advise us to remove any reference to cancer in the manuscript, we, of course, will comply.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

How do these cell types differ from cardiomyocytes? This may be an area of future direction as may not be feasible to incorporate additional data into the present study.</p></disp-quote><p>Presently, we do not have any single-cell sequencing data, but because our discovery on interstitial non-cardiac myocytes is extremely novel, we are about to launch single-cell/single-nuclear RNAseq of both the TGAC8 SAN and LV. We believe that interstitial non-cardiac myocytes population is part of a major “stem cell niche” in the heart, renewing non-cardiomyocytes that produce cytokines/chemokines that are essential to the preservation of myocardial health.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. How did the authors select the mouse age and time frame for study in the present work? Have the authors compared these results to when TGAC8 develops decompensated heart failure?</p></disp-quote><p>We engaged in studies of the TGAC8 mouse because of our prior discovery that the “biochemical engine” driving spontaneous action potential firing in sinoatrial nodes is adenylyl cyclase type 8 (AC8). We chose 3 months of age because it was the approximate age of earlier studies of the Hanoune group (Circulation 2000) at INSERM in Créteil who created this mouse. We first sought to determine the role of AC8 in heart rate in vivo<italic>,</italic> and implanted these mice at 3 months of age with telemeters, and uncovered not only a marked increase in heart rate around the clock, but also a markedly coherent heart rate variability pattern (Moen reference). We went on to thoroughly characterize the cardiac LV structure and function phenotype via echocardiographic assessment of cardiac structure and function, and performed numerous assays of LV cells/tissue, including multi-omics that are embodied in the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

For example, reports on cardiac specific overexpression of AC5 and AC6 never provided broader view on these mice and were focused only on a limited number of traits i.e., arrhythmogenesis, chronic pressure overload, contraction (Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol. 2015 Feb 1;308(3):H240-9; Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol. 2010 Sep;299(3):H707-12; Clin Transl Sci. 2008 Dec;1(3):221-7; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Aug 19;100(17):9986-90; Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol. 2013 Jul 1;305(1):H1-8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Can any of the pathways that are apparently activated be directly perturbed to assess whether they are mechanistically important?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, many of the pathways that are activated in TGAC8 can be perturbed to assess whether they are mechanistically important. Our approach was initially to define the circuitry of numerous interconnected stress responses, as we did in the present manuscript. Following that, our goal is to perturb several select pathways to investigate their specific mechanisms in the TGAC8 stress response. We have already begun to do this in numerous pathways including proteostasis, autophagy, ROS defenses and metabolism. But these studies will require substantial time to complete. Another major goal of our lab is to define how the elements of the stress response circuitry fails as the TGAC8 mouse ages, in part, by replicating the systems approach and assays used in the present study in mice of different ages, followed by specific mechanistic studies.

Assessing the mice at birth (e.g. structure, cell number, perinatal proliferative window) might help.</p></disp-quote><p>It is likely that an increase in number of cardiomyocytes may have occurred during the embryonic stage of development (8.5 dpc), when AC8 expression begins. Since submitting our manuscript we have found that the expression level of human AC8 (the type of AC8 employed in this transgenic model) increases markedly during the embryonic period when compared to endogenous AC8 and remains elevated in both the fetal and perinatal periods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Metabolism – ideally, any robust conclusions need to be based on an assessment of activity of key pathways (e.g. by metabolic flux) or perhaps metabolomics (less direct). As a minimum, this key limitation should be acknowledged and the conclusions moderated.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur and have described some of the types of metabolic assessments in the last section of our discussion “Opportunities for Future Scientific Inquiry Afforded by the Present Results”: “… precisely defining shifts in metabolism within the cell types that comprise the TGAC8 LV myocardium via metabolomic analyses, including fluxomics.97 It will be also important that future metabolomics studies elucidate post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination and 14-3-3 binding) of specific metabolic enzymes of the TGAC8 LV, and how these modifications affect their enzymatic activity”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Apparently, the mice ultimately develop heart failure at around 12 months of age. Do the authors know what changes?</p><p>5. I had to educate myself and look up the meaning of consilience, which seems to be a favorite word! Based on the definition in Websters, are the authors confident that it has been used appropriately in every place?</p></disp-quote><p>We are indeed using the Merriam-Webster definition of consilience as the linking together of principles from different disciplines especially when forming a comprehensive theory. We used the word consilience as a noun or consilient as an adjective numerous time in the manuscript. Our intent was to use the term to link together numerous pathways that concurrently become activated to protect the TGAC8 heart, i.e., a consilience of activated pathways. In the revised text, in numerous places, we have substituted consilience with the word concentric, e.g., mammalian cells have evolved complex concentric circuits to defend against stress that threatens their health or life.</p></body></sub-article></article>
