transgene-free induction and stem cell selection protocol. Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, qPCR, digital RNA expression profiling, and scRNA-Seq studies identify iMyoblasts as a <italic>PAX3+/MYOD1+</italic> skeletal myogenic lineage with a fetal-like transcriptome signature, distinct from adult muscle biopsy myoblasts (bMyoblasts) and iPSC-induced muscle progenitors. iMyoblasts can be stably propagated for &gt;12 passages or 30 population doublings while retaining their dual commitment for myotube differentiation and regeneration of reserve cells. iMyoblasts also efficiently xenoengrafted into irradiated and injured mouse muscle where they undergo differentiation and fetal-adult MYH isoform switching, demonstrating their regulatory plasticity for adult muscle maturation in response to signals in the host muscle. Xenograft muscle retains PAX3+ muscle progenitors and can regenerate human muscle in response to secondary injury. As models of disease, iMyoblasts from individuals with Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy revealed a previously unknown epigenetic regulatory mechanism controlling developmental expression of the pathological <italic>DUX4</italic> gene. iMyoblasts from Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy R7 and R9 and Walker Warburg Syndrome patients modeled their molecular disease pathologies and were responsive to small molecule and gene editing therapeutics. These findings establish the utility of iMyoblasts for ex vivo and in vivo investigations of human myogenesis and disease pathogenesis and for the development of muscle stem cell therapeutics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Muscular dystrophies are a group of inherited genetic diseases characterised by progressive muscle weakness. They lead to disability or even death, and no cure exists against these conditions.</p><p>Advances in genome sequencing have identified many mutations that underly muscular dystrophies, opening the door to new therapies that could repair incorrect genes or rebuild damaged muscles. However, testing these ideas requires better ways to recreate human muscular dystrophy in the laboratory.</p><p>One strategy for modelling muscular dystrophy involves coaxing skin or other cells from an individual into becoming ‘induced pluripotent stem cells’; these can then mature to form almost any adult cell in the body, including muscles. However, this approach does not usually create myoblasts, the ‘precursor’ cells that specifically mature into muscle during development. This limits investigations into how disease-causing mutations impact muscle formation early on.</p><p>As a response, Guo et al. developed a two-step protocol of muscle maturation followed by stem cell growth selection to isolate and grow ‘induced myoblasts’ from induced pluripotent stem cells taken from healthy volunteers and muscular dystrophy patients. These induced myoblasts can both make more of themselves and become muscle, allowing Guo et al. to model three different types of muscular dystrophy. These myoblasts also behave as stem cells when grafted inside adult mouse muscles: some formed human muscle tissue while others remained as precursor cells, which could then respond to muscle injury and start repair.</p><p>The induced myoblasts developed by Guo et al. will enable scientists to investigate the impacts of different mutations on muscle tissue and to better test treatments. They could also be used as part of regenerative medicine therapies, to restore muscle cells in patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human ipsc myogenesis</kwd><kwd>muscle stem cells</kwd><kwd>iMyoblasts</kwd><kwd>xenograft</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005202</institution-id><institution>Muscular Dystrophy Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>480265</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Emerson</surname><given-names>Charles P</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD060848</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Emerson</surname><given-names>Charles P</given-names></name><name><surname>Hayward</surname><given-names>Lawrence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3R37HD007796</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Emerson</surname><given-names>Charles P</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005202</institution-id><institution>Muscular Dystrophy Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>577797</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hayward</surname><given-names>Lawrence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LGMD 2I Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Emerson</surname><given-names>Charles P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>iMyoblasts, a novel iPS-derived PAX3 muscle stem cell for gene editing, muscle engraftment, and stem cell therapeutics to treat muscle injury and muscular dystrophies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The technologies for reprogramming human somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>) and for inducing specific differentiated cell types are providing extraordinary opportunities for investigating mechanisms of human tissue differentiation, the molecular pathology of diseases, and therapeutic development. Much of the research on iPS cell-type induction has focused on optimizing the production of differentiated cells to provide a platform for investigations of disease pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardhanareeswaran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Georgomanoli and Papapetrou, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heslop and Duncan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">van Mil et al., 2018</xref>). Less attention has been given to generation of lineage-specific human stem cells and progenitors to enable studies of tissue and organ development, genetic and epigenetic disease mechanisms, and stem cell therapeutics.</p><p>The goal of our study has been to isolate and propagate myogenic stem cells from human iPSC cultures in response to gene-free myogenic induction and cell growth selection and to establish the utility of these myoblast stem cells for molecular investigations of human myogenesis and muscular dystrophies. Here, we report an efficient and reliable transgene-free myogenesis protocol to generate human skeletal muscle stem cells (iMyoblasts) from healthy control (Ctrl) and patient iPSCs. This protocol efficiently produces a stably committed and expandable population of PAX3+/MYOD1+ iMyoblasts that differentiate as regenerative stem cells ex vivo in cell culture and in vivo in muscle xenografts in irradiated and injured mouse tibialis anterior (TA) muscle, which maintain a renewable PAX3+ iMyoblast population. iMyoblast muscle xenografts undergo fetal-to-adult MYH isoform switching demonstrating their plasticity to respond to maturation signals provided by the host adult muscle. Finally, we show that iMyoblasts generated from Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) Type 1 (FSHD1), Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) R7 and R9 (formerly LGMD2G and 2I), and Walker Warburg Syndrome (WWS) patient iPSCs model the molecular pathologies of these diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Isolation of iMyoblasts by iPSC transgene-free induction and reserve cell selection</title><p>We developed a two-step protocol to isolate iMyoblasts from cultures of Ctrl and patient iPSCs, using transgene-free iPSC myogenic induction in combination with reserve cell selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Human iPSC lines for these studies were generated by reprogramming bMyoblasts and fibroblasts isolated from muscle biopsies of adult FSHD1 and Ctrl subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Homma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones et al., 2012</xref>), or dermal fibroblasts from subjects with early onset FSHD1, LGMDR7, LGMDR9, and WWS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kava et al., 2013</xref>). The first step of the iMyoblast protocol was transgene-free iPSC myogenesis induction using commercially available reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caron et al., 2016</xref>; Amsbio, Skeletal Muscle differentiation Kit) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This three-stage iPSC myogenesis protocol induces cultures of Ctrl and disease iPSCs to sequentially upregulate expression of muscle master regulators, <italic>PAX3</italic> (S1 stage) and <italic>MYOD1</italic> (S2 stage), and the muscle differentiation marker <italic>MYH8</italic> (S3 Stage) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caron et al., 2016</xref>), as assayed by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Gene expression was also assayed in the FSHD1 and Ctrl Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) lines originally used to develop and optimize this induction protocol to assure that iPSCs and ESCs respond similarly to this transgene-free myogenesis induction protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These studies established that Ctrl and disease iPSC and ESC lines robustly upregulated expression of <italic>PAX3</italic>, <italic>MYOD1</italic>, and <italic>MYH8</italic> on the order of 1000-fold during S1, S2, and S3 stages of myogenic induction, validating the consistency and efficiency of the transgene-free induction protocol.

Because Genea 096 showed neither hypomethylation nor clear bimodality (excluding one outlier clone, an unlikely split of sampling from two alleles with equal probability), a 4qA-L methylation assay was also performed for this sample, as this haplotype can also be permissive for FSHD1.

Since the uncontracted D4Z4 arrays for these two FSHD1 subjects have haplotypes not amplified in this assay (4qB and 4qA-L), methylation is specifically assayed only on contracted 4qA alleles. Our findings showed that DUX4 4qA remained hypomethylated in FSHD1 iPSCs and hypermethylated Ctrl iPSCs, and these methylation states were maintained throughout S1, S2, and S3 differentiation and in proliferating and differentiating iMyoblasts and iMyotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). DUX4 4qA alleles associated with D4Z4 contracted chromosomes of FSHD1 ESCs were also hypomethylated compared to Ctrl ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), as assayed using DUX4 bisulfite sequencing with 4qA-specific primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jones et al., 2014</xref>). These findings contradict a recent report, which found that DUX4 is hypermethylated in these same FSHD1 ESC lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dion et al., 2019</xref>). However, unlike the 4qA-specific primers we used, the bisulfite sequencing primers used in this earlier study can amplify all D4Z4 repeat units from both chromosomes, which we found obscures the hypomethylation at the distal 4qA repeat encoding DUX4 (data not shown). Unlike the DUX4 4qA locus, we found that the <italic>MYOD1</italic> core enhancer sequences of bMyoblasts became hypermethylated during iPSC reprogramming of parental bMyoblasts and then became demethylated during myogenic induction and differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), concordant with <italic>MYOD1</italic> RNA upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as previously observed in developing mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunk et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, methylation and demethylation machinery is operative in iPSCs and induced myogenic cells, but contracted 4qA alleles associated with FSHD1 are refractory to this machinery and changes in the methylation status of the 4qA DUX4 locus cannot account for the repression of DUX4 expression in FSHD1 iPSCs and ESCs and S3 iMyocytes.</p><p>To investigate whether <italic>DUX4</italic> repression during iPSC reprogramming is mediated by alternative epigenetic mechanisms, we screened a battery of epigenetic drugs for activation of DUX4 in S3 muscle cultures.

Additionally, assays of the efficiencies of xenoengraftment showed that S1 stage FSHD1 cells engrafted poorly and did not differentiate well compared to iMyoblast xenografts, as evidenced by qPCR assays for muscle RNAs showing high raw Ct values comparable to unengrafted mouse TA samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). These data further highlight the efficiency of iMyoblast engraftment and their utility for in vivo studies of muscle maturation and regeneration.</p><p>WWS and LGMDR9 (formerly LGMD2I) FKRP dystroglycanopathies are caused by recessive mutations in the coding sequences of the gene <italic>FKRP</italic>, disrupting its function in the glycosylation of α-Dystroglycan (α-DG) for laminin binding to maintain cellular interactions with the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Piccolo et al., 2002</xref>). WWS subjects carry loss-of-function <italic>FKRP</italic> mutations that fully disrupt α-DG glycosylation for laminin binding, causing clinically severe neuronal and muscle developmental damage and death following birth. LGMDR9 FKRP mutations cause partial loss of FKRP enzymatic function, resulting in adolescent onset of muscle weakness without neuronal involvement, and partial disruption of α-DG glycosylation and laminin binding. WWS iMyoblasts xenoengraft efficiently into irradiated and injured TA muscles of NSG mice, as evidenced by IF assays using human-specific lamin A/C and laminin β1 antibodies, and express muscle RNAs at similar abundance to Ctrl iMyoblasts, FSHD1 iMyoblasts, and LGMDR7 iMyoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and D</xref>). Ex vivo laminin binding assays of fluorescently labeled laminin to WWS iMyotubes showed almost complete absence of binding compared to Ctrl Myotubes, and LGMDR9 iMyotubes showed intermediate binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>), reflecting the dose-dependent FKRP enzymatic loss of function. Similarly, α-DG glycosylation was assayed biochemically by probing Western blots of iMyotube membrane extracts with IIH6 antibody, which reacts with α-DG glycosylation epitopes, and with α-DG core protein antibody that assays glycosylation based on the reduced mobility of α-DG on SDS gels. WWS iMyotubes were nearly completely deficient in IIH6 reactivity and had smaller, unglycosylated α-DG core protein (75 kDa) compared to glycosylated Ctrl iMyotubes (100 kDa), whereas LGMDR9 had intermediate IIH6 intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>), showing that differences in glycosylation between WWS and the less severe LGMDR9 alleles can model the functional and clinical severity of FKRP mutations. Taken together, these data demonstrate the capacity of iMyoblasts in ex vivo and in vivo assays and provide well-developed models for FKRP therapeutic development as well as for muscle regeneration studies, as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Regenerative potential of iMyoblast muscle xenografts</title><p>To investigate whether iMyoblast xenograft muscle had regenerative potential, primary xenografts were generated by xenoengraftment of Ctrl and WWS iMyoblasts and assayed by immunostaining for PAX3 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Both Ctrl and WWS primary xenografts had a significant population of PAX3+ nuclei in humanized regions of the engrafted TA muscle, indicating that xenografts maintain a progenitor cell population. PAX3+ nuclei co-stained with human-specific lamin A/C and were associated with human muscle fibers as detected by immunostaining with human-specific spectrin-β1 whereas other nuclei appeared to be localized more interstitially. Additionally, xenografts included lamin A/C+ nuclei that did not immunostain with PAX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>).

Other iPSC myogenesis protocols have been optimized to generate differentiated skeletal muscle from mouse and human ESCs and iPSCs, either by transgene misexpression of muscle master regulatory genes including <italic>MYOD1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dekel et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maffioletti et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>PAX7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darabi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rao et al., 2018</xref>), or by transgene-free protocols that transition ESCs and iPSCs through an early developmental progression that regulates skeletal myogenesis in the vertebrate embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van der Wal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hicks et al., 2018</xref>) rather than through direct induction of PAX3-expressing muscle progenitors as in our protocol. Our approach also differs in its efficient reserve cell selection of highly enriched, stably committed, and expandable populations of iMyoblasts by growth selection, without requiring FAC sorting of induced subpopulations. Our findings demonstrate the utility of our protocol for the isolation of iMyoblasts from iPSCs from healthy control (Ctrl) subjects and patients with FSHD1, LGMDR7, WWS, and LGMDR9 muscular dystrophies that express the molecular pathologies of these diseases. iMyoblasts can be maintained and expanded for at least 30 population doublings while stably retaining their capacity for myogenic differentiation. iMyoblast cell expansion enables statistically powered cell and molecular studies of human myogenesis and investigations of muscle disease pathology and therapeutic development using both ex vivo and in vivo in muscle xenograft models, as demonstrated in this study. By contrast, adult bMyoblasts often cannot be propagated from biopsies of muscular dystrophy patients who have advanced muscle pathology or have limited growth in culture because of the age and disease-related senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Webster and Blau, 1990</xref>). The advantages of iPSC derived iMyoblasts for mechanistic studies of epigenetic disease mechanisms are shown by our discovery of a previously unknown developmental epigenetic repression of the FSHD1 disease gene, <italic>DUX4</italic>. Finally, iMyoblasts undergo enhanced differentiation in response to specialized media, which enable 3D modeling of muscle maturation and contractile and electrophysiological activities that will further enhance knowledge of disease mechanisms and enable therapeutic development. iMyoblasts express markers of fetal myoblasts, including <italic>PAX3</italic> and <italic>CD82</italic>, as well as <italic>NFIX</italic>, a regulator of the transcriptional switch from embryonic to fetal myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Messina et al., 2010</xref>). The iMyoblast transcriptome is distinct from iPSC-induced S1 and S2 myogenic progenitors, which do not express <italic>NFIX</italic> and differentiate as mononucleated myocytes typical of the earliest stage embryonic muscle, and also is distinct from adult bicep muscle bMyoblasts, which express <italic>PAX7</italic>, <italic>MYF5</italic>, <italic>MRF4</italic> as well as <italic>PAX3</italic> and <italic>MYOD1</italic>, and higher levels of <italic>NFIX</italic>. The iMyoblast transcriptome also is distinct from the transcriptomes of iPSC-induced <italic>PAX7</italic> Myoblasts, but share the fetal-like gene expression profiles along the developmental trajectory of limb myogenic cells described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xi et al., 2020</xref>. iMyoblasts also may be related to adult <italic>PAX3</italic> myogenic cells identified in muscles such as diaphragm or to stress resistant <italic>PAX3</italic> myogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Der Vartanian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scaramozza et al., 2019</xref>), noting that, in humans, <italic>PAX3</italic> and <italic>PAX7</italic> may be functionally redundant, as suggested by recent genetic studies showing that <italic>PAX7</italic> is not an essential gene for satellite cell production and muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marg et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to <italic>PAX3</italic> and <italic>MYOD1</italic>, iMyoblasts express an array of other transcription factors, including <italic>GATA3</italic>, <italic>GATA6</italic>, <italic>HAND2</italic>, <italic>MEIS2</italic>, <italic>GLI2</italic>, <italic>NOTCH1</italic>, <italic>ETS1,</italic> and <italic>ETS2,</italic> that most certainly play a role to regulate the isoform-specific expression of ECM, focal adhesion, migration/chemotaxis, and cell signaling genes of the iMyoblast transcriptome.</p><p>The fetal-like phenotype of iMyoblasts ex vivo is further reflected by the expression of embryonic/fetal <italic>MYH8</italic> during iMyotube differentiation, in contrast to <italic>MYH1</italic> expression by adult bMyoblasts. Significantly, iMyoblast xenoengraftment into the mouse TA muscle generated muscle that downregulated expression of embryonic <italic>MYH8</italic> and upregulated expression of adult fast <italic>MYH1</italic> during fiber differentiation, demonstrating the transcriptional plasticity of iMyoblasts to respond to in vivo signals in the fast fiber type TA muscle to mediate adult MYH isoform switching. The signals in xenograft muscle that initiate adult switching may be controlled by physiological mechanisms such as innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xi et al., 2020</xref>) or by conversion of engrafted iMyoblasts to a more adult-like bMyoblast progenitor phenotype. In either case, the capacity of iMyoblasts to engraft directly into adult muscle to produce xenograft muscle that undergoes adult MYH isoform switching in combination with the capacity of iMyoblasts for extensive cell expansion and efficient CRISPR gene editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iyer et al., 2019</xref>) supports their potential utility for development of muscle stem cell therapies, which to date have been unsuccessful. iMyoblasts have growth and differentiation characteristics of self-renewing stem cells based on their dual commitment to differentiation and iMyoblast reserve cell renewal ex vivo and the capacity of iMyoblast xenograft muscles to regenerate human muscle and PAX3+ cells in response to secondary injury. The stem cell characteristics of iMyoblasts likely reflect their isolation using reserve cell selection from cultures of highly differentiated S3 stage muscle following transgene-free induction using the myogenic induction protocol, which was optimized to generate differentiated cultures of S3 iMyocytes without transitioning iPSCs through earlier mesodermal and somite developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caron et al., 2016</xref>). A realized consequence was that this differentiation protocol also generated reserve cells that could be isolated from differentiated cultures by growth factor activation. The mechanisms that control reserve cell generation are not yet understood, but likely are based on the initiation of <italic>MYOD1</italic> autoregulation in earlier stage cells during the S1 and S2 stages of iPSC induction, as shown in previous studies of <italic>MYOD1</italic> overexpression in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Weintraub et al., 1989</xref>). iMyoblasts maintain low level <italic>MYOD1</italic> and <italic>PAX3</italic> expression cell-autonomously, which enables their myogenic potential over 30 population doublings while retaining their commitment to differentiate as iMyotubes and replenish <italic>PAX3</italic> iMyoblasts as reserve cells. In vivo, this enables iMyoblasts to xenoengraft and generate differentiated muscle and a population of <italic>PAX3</italic> expressing cells that are retained in xenografts in response to secondary injury. The regulatory mechanisms that control the distinct growth, differentiation and self-renewal capacities of iMyoblasts are not yet understood. iMyoblasts express genes well-known to regulate <italic>MYOD1</italic> function, myoblast differentiation and self-renewal, including <italic>ID</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benezra et al., 1990</xref>), Wnt and BMP antagonists <italic>DKK1</italic> ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jones et al., 2015b</xref>) and <italic>GREM1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fabre et al., 2020</xref>), and <italic>RGS4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yilmaz et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>TXNRD1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mercatelli et al., 2017</xref>), <italic>UCHL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2017</xref>), NR2F2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2017</xref>), <italic>FOXC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lagha et al., 2009</xref>), and <italic>HMGA2</italic> and <italic>IGF2BP</italic> myogenic regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Studies to investigate the myogenic and stem cell functions of these iMyoblast genes and others identified in our studies are now approachable using CRISPR gene editing.</p><p>Overall, our findings establish a protocol for isolation of iMyoblasts and establish its suitability for ex vivo and in vivo investigations of human myogenesis and muscle disease pathogenesis. Our expectation is that iMyoblasts will enable development and validation of multiple disease corrective modalities, including gene editing and muscle stem cell therapeutics, to ameliorate disease

Transgenic Animal Modeling Core using CytoTune-iPS Sendai Reprogramming Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Isolated iPSC clones were characterized by pluripotency identification (OCT4 staining), in vivo teratomas formation, and karyotyping assay. iPSC lines were routinely maintained on Matrigel (Corning) with StemMACS iPS-Brew XF (Miltenyi Biotec). The cells were passaged every 4 days using StemMACS Passaging Solution XF (Miltenyi Biotec) and the Rock inhibitor Y27632 (10 μM, STEMCELL Technologies) for 24 hr to improve the survival rates. 15AM iPSCs, 15VM iPSCs, 17AM iPSCs, 17AF iPSCs, 17UM iPSCs, 30AM iPSCs, 30WM iPSCs, 54574/75 iPSCs, 54585 iPSCs, and LGMDR7 iPSCs were reprogrammed at UMass Medical School. FP and WWS iPSCs were provided by Anne Bang at Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute and 54574/75 and 54585 fibroblasts were provided by Steven Moore at the University of Iowa. iPSC cell line identity was confirmed by STR profiling. iMyoblast isolation iPSCs, typically plated on six-well plates, were induced for myogenic differentiation using media prepared by Genea Biocells and now commercially available as a skeletal muscle differentiation kit (Amsbio) following the manufacturer’s specifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caron et al., 2016</xref>). After 6–7 days in S3 differentiation medium (SKM03), culture plates were rinsed with 2 ml 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cells detached from plates in 0.5 ml TrypLE Express at 37°C and diluted with 4.5 ml HMP growth medium (Ham’s F-10 supplemented with: 20% FBS, 1% chick embryo extract rich with growth factors [Emerson Lab]), 1.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Gibco) (optional). The cell suspension was pipetted 5–10 times to disperse cells and clear plates of residual cells, and then 0.5–1 ml of this cell suspension was plated onto 10 cm gelatin-coated dishes in 10 ml HMP medium, cells were cultured at 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C and fed daily with fresh HMP medium to support the growth of iMyoblasts. After 2–3 culture passages, iMyoblast cells were recovered and maintained as frozen stocks for investigations. 15AM iMyoblasts, 15VM iMyoblasts, 17AM iMyoblasts, 17AF iMyoblasts, 17UM iMyoblasts, 30AM iMyoblasts, 30WM iMyoblasts, 54574/75 iMyoblasts, 54585 iMyoblasts, LGMDR7 iMyoblasts, LGMDR9 FP iMyoblast, and WWS iMyoblasts were generated at UMass Medical School. Identity for cell lines used in single-cell RNA-sequencing was confirmed by SNP analysis. FKRP (for WWS and LGMDR9) and TCAP (for LGMDR7) mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing and aDG expression. All cell lines have been tested for mycoplasma and have tested negative.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>FAC sorted CD56+ and unsorted bMyoblasts recovered from muscle biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Homma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones et al., 2012</xref>) and iMyoblasts isolated from iPSC muscle cultures were routinely maintained on gelatin-coated 10 or 15 cm dishes in HMP growth medium and passaged at 70–90% confluence.

Cell Ranger version 3.1.0 (10× Genomics) and STAR 2.5.1b were used to align reads from FASTQ files to the human reference genome. Gene annotations from GRCh38.93 were prepared with cellranger mkgtf as in Cell Ranger, but with filtering modified to also retain gene biotypes ‘processed_transcript’ and ‘bidirectional_promoter_lncRNA.’ Initial filtering, barcode counting, and UMI counting yielded an estimate of 29,049 potential cell barcodes. 92.4% of the 562.5 million total reads were in cells. SNPs for each subject were genotyped from bulk RNA-seq, performed by Novogene, of S1 and iMyoblast cells for each subject in Python 2.7.9 using Opossum 0.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oikkonen and Lise, 2017</xref>) and Platypus 0.8.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rimmer et al., 2014</xref>).

Further filtering using the Seurat 3.1.4 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) in R 3.6.2 removed 7.0% of the remaining cells that contained ≥12% UMIs mapped to mitochondrial genes, ≤ 1000 or ≥ 5500 detected genes, or ≥40,000 detected UMIs. This resulted in 24,991 cells, with a median of 2678 genes detected per cell and 7909 UMI per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Cell clustering, cell cycle state estimation, and downstream analyses were performed for these cells in Seurat. Normalization and scaling were performed using SCTransform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>) with regression against the percentage of mitochondrial gene expression. The 3000 genes with highest variability across cells were used for principal component reduction, and components 1–30 were used to construct a shared nearest neighbor graph for unsupervised cell clustering using the Louvain algorithm. This resulted in 16 cell clusters (3 for S1 cells, 4 for S2 cells, 5 for iMyoblast cells, and 4 for muscle biopsy primary cells), which were visualized using the UMAP method with resolution 0.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>). Most of the within-cell-type subclusters were merged to reduce to six clusters, keeping separate the bMes cluster that was clearly distinct from the other three primary cell subclusters comprising bMyoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and the S2A cluster that expressed low <italic>MYOD1</italic> and <italic>CDH15</italic> and distinguished it from the other three S2 subclusters comprising more differentiated S2B cells, as described in the Results. The top 200 differentially expressed genes from each pairwise cell-type comparison using edgeR (below) were reviewed to construct a curated set of genes relevant to myogenesis or cell-type expression (shown as a Seurat dot plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Differential gene expression and GO/KEGG analyses</title><p>Values from the single-cell raw count matrix (prior to normalization) were summed for each combination of the six cell types of interest (S1, S2A, S2B, iMB, bMB, and bMes) and the six donors (15A, 15V, 17A, 17U, 30A, and 30W) to obtain a table of pseudobulk counts for these 36 samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Lowly expressed genes were filtered out with the function filterByExpr, and counts were normalized using calcNormFactors to yield values for 14,103 filtered genes across the 36 samples. We specified a quasi-likelihood negative binomial generalized log-linear model with cell-type and donor as additive factors in the model. We used estimateDisp to estimate the dispersion for all genes, glmQLFit (robust=T) to fit a joint model to the data from all cell-types, and glmQLFTest to perform statistical tests of differential expression for each of the 15 contrasts between pairs of cell-types. The FDR was computed with the function topTags. Genes that satisfied (unadjusted) p-value&lt;1.0E−06 and |log2(FC)|&gt;1 were considered differentially expressed and ranked by p-value for each comparison. The results for all genes sorted by p-value are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, which also includes the FDR for each gene. Comparisons between the three FSHD1 and three control donors used the same edgeR procedure as above, but with models fit separately for each cell type, including the filterByExpr step. For GO/KEGG analyses, the differentially expressed (DE) genes, separated into up and down sets based on the sign of log2(FC), were used as DE input, and the full set of genes from the edgeR analysis after the filterByExpr step was used as the gene universe. Overrepresentation of GO terms in BP, CC, and MF ontologies (annotations from org.Hs.eg.db 3.11.4) were computed using the goana function and in KEGG pathways using the kegga function in edgeR, in both cases using log2(CPM) [CPM = counts per million] as a covariate to adjust for potential biases due to gene expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Young et al., 2010</xref>).

Thus, whether an RNA-seq read maps to <italic>MRPL23</italic> or to <italic>AC004556.1</italic> depends on its base-call at this variant position, and it appears that none of the Ctrl subjects has the variant but all three FSHD1 subjects are heterozygous for it. In a larger collection of FSHD1 and Ctrl subjects, this variant had allele frequency ~20% in both cases (not shown), so this is not likely to reflect an FSHD1-associated genotype, but rather a chance occurrence, and one for which the reported p-value for differential expression is artificially small because the sample variance for the number of reads assigned to <italic>AC004556.1</italic> has severely underestimated the population variance. Note that this G &gt; A variant has allele frequency 17% in gnomAD 2.1.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/11-1977552-G-A?dataset=gnomad_r2_1">https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/11-1977552-G-A?dataset=gnomad_r2_1</ext-link>), which uses the GRCh37 genome assembly, but is not reported at all in gnomAD 3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/11-1956322-G-A?dataset=gnomad_r3">https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/11-1956322-G-A?dataset=gnomad_r3</ext-link>), which uses the GRCh38 genome assembly.

The authors mention that iMyoblasts are a distinct lineage, but do not provide additional information on whether this is a culture artefact or a real developmental lineage captured in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>Our iMyoblast technology is unique. This technology employs a commercially available (AMSBIO) gene free myogenic induction, similar to other iPSC induction protocols, but this induction protocol is used in combination with a reserve cell selection protocol not used by other protocols. Reserve cell selection recover iMyoblast with stem cell capacity to become quiescent in differentiated muscle cultures analogous to satellite cells. iMyoblasts retain dual potential for regeneration and differentiation both ex vivo (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) and in vivo in response to injury (Figure 10). Furthermore, our reserve cell protocol reproducibly generates a homogeneous, expandable population of PAX3/MYOD1 iMyoblasts. Expansion has not yet been demonstrated by other iPSC gene free myogenic induction protocols, which require FAC sorting to recover minor cell populations which also differ from iMyoblasts in their expression of PAX7. The capacity of iMyoblasts for expansion enables statistically powered ex vivo and in vivo molecular, cellular and stem cell studies of human myogenesis and disease pathology, as we demonstrate in our study.</p><p>– scRNA-Seq studies show that iMyoblasts have a transcriptome that is distinct from both S1 and S2 myogenic progenitors produced by the AMSBIO commercial iPSC induction kit used in the first step of our iMyoblast isolation protocol and from adult bMyoblasts (Figure 2). iMyoblasts fuse and activate FSHD disease genes to high levels similar to adult biopsy bMyoblasts, whereas S1 and S2 cells differ in their differentiation as mononucleated iMyocytes typical of the first formed embryonic muscles (Figures 4, 5 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2) and activate FSHD disease genes at very low levels (Figure 5C), further confirming that iMyoblasts are a different myogenic cell. In revision, we discuss evidence that iMyoblast transcriptome also is distinct from the transcriptomes of iPSC-induced <italic>PAX7</italic> Myoblasts generated by published protocols, although both PAX3 iMyoblasts and iPSC induced PAX7 cells share the fetal-like gene expression profiles along the developmental trajectory of limb myogenic cells as described by Xi et al. In light of of these considerations, in the revised manuscript, we no longer refer to iMyoblasts as a “distinct lineage”.</p><p>– Regarding the reviewer’s expectation of seeing markers of more mature/adult-like myogenic progenitors: iMyoblasts express CD82, an established marker of fetal myoblasts (Figure 1D), and the differentiation gene expression profiles of iMyoblasts ex vivo in culture are embryonic/fetal as shown by their expression of embryonic MYH8 in response to iMyotube differentiation (Figure 4). Notably, this embryonic/fetal ex vivo signature can switch in vivo in iMyoblast xenograft muscle, which upregulate the expression of adult Myosin isoforms and down regulate embryonic/fetal isoforms following engraftment, revealing the developmental plasticity and capacity of iMyoblast xenografts to transcriptionally switch towards adult muscle phenotypes in response to the in vivo environment of adult muscle (Figures 7 and 8).</p><p>– In the case of NFIX expression, we note in the revision that our scRNA-Seq data (Figure 2C and Supplementary file 3) show that iMyoblasts express NFIX although at somewhat lower levels than biopsy myoblasts, consistent with their fetal-like phenotype, but at higher levels than S1 and S2 stage myogenic cells, consistent with their embryonic-like iMyocyte phenotype. We also note that NFIX is not a myogenic-specific gene based on its abundant expression by bMes non-myogenic cells isolated from muscle biopsies (Figure 2C).</p><p>– iMyoblasts are a PAX3 myogenic progenitor cells. In mouse, different neonatal and adult muscles are populated with both PAX3 and PAX7/PAX3 myogenic cells (PMID: 31006622; PMID: 31006621). In humans, we know little about PAX3 and PAX7 myogenic progenitor populations and these may be divergent from the mouse, as suggested by recent human genetic evidence that PAX7 is not an essential human muscle gene as it is in the mouse (PMID: 31852888; PMID: 31092906). Therefore, we do not draw lineage inferences about PAX3 iMyoblasts.</p><p>The revised manuscript addresses and clarifies all of the above issues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The downstream applications of this protocol shown in this study are not novel and overall, difficult to follow. it is unclear if the authors wanted to validate a new methodology using established readouts or show that their methodology can unravel new findings. Overall, having three different disease targets, in vito and in vivo models makes the story somehow difficult to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We strongly disagree with Reviewer 2’s assertion that the downstream applications of this protocol are not novel. While some of the experiments may be viewed as validation that iMyoblasts behave similarly to primary biopsy bMyoblasts in certain regards, iMyoblasts enable applications that would not be possible or practical with bMyoblasts.</p><p>– Expandable populations of human iMyoblasts from patients with genetic diseases (Figure 1C) enable statistically powered and reproducible qPCR and NanoString gene expression investigations of human myogenesis and disease pathology, as illustrated in our cell culture studies (Figures 4, 5, &amp; Figure 4—figure supplement 1) and in vivo in iMyoblast-generated xenograft studies (Figures 7, 9 &amp; 10). As such, iMyoblasts capacity for robust myotube differentiation also will enable proteomic and electrophysiological studies of patient and control muscle in 3D culture models;</p><p>– Expandable populations of human iPSCs from patients enable development of human autologous transplantation technologies to repair disease and damaged muscles, a technology that in the past has been limited by the inability to produce large numbers of myoblasts because of patient age or disease progression;</p><p>– CRISPR gene editing is efficient in iMyoblasts compared to adult bMyoblasts, as we have reported in studies of TCAP iMyoblasts (Iyer et al., Nature, 2019), and in combination with the capacity of iMyoblasts for expansion, iMyoblasts uniquely enable development of disease gene editing strategies for multiple genetic muscle diseases. Additionally, CRISPR mutagenesis and gene activation/repression technologies are being used to investigate the functions of specific muscle regulatory genes (identified in our scRNA-Seq studies) in the regulation of iMyoblast identity, stem cell behavior and the initiation of differentiation, processes that can be investigated both ex vivo and in vivo in iMyoblast muscle xenografts;</p><p>– iMyoblasts can be readily produced from patient iPSC cells for drug screening studies, as shown by our finding that FSHD iMyoblasts are responsive to established FSHD drugs ex vivo (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), and support future delivery and target engagement studies in vivo in xenograft muscles (Figure 7).</p><p>– iMyoblasts efficiently engraft and undergo adult MYH isoform switching in response the in vivo muscle environment, uniquely enabling in vivo experimental investigations of MYH isoform switching, innervation, and vascularization (Figures 7B, Figure 7—figure supplement 1 &amp; 8).</p><p>– iMyoblasts isolated as reserve cells behave as an expandable regenerative stem cell, both ex vivo (Figure 1 figure supplement 2) and in vivo (Figure 10). This enables studies to use iMyoblasts as a stem cell source for development of muscle stem cell therapeutics as well as a model for gene editing studies to identify genes that control stem cell behavior and to modify iMyoblast gene expression to enhance in vivo delivery and engraftment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please find below a list of some general issues:</p><p>– Genea company and differentiation kit no longer exist and no mention about validation of this work with the new Myocea kit.</p></disp-quote><p>All of our culture and iMyoblast isolation studies were performed using the Genea/Myocea VC media components, which are commercially available from AMSBIO (Skeletal Muscle Differentiation kit), as confirmed by Myocea.

Our FSHD iMyoblast findings highlight the power of iMyoblast and iPSC technology to investigate the epigenetic as well as genetic mechanisms that regulate the DUX4 disease gene through a DNA methylation repression mechanism. Our FSHD findings challenge the findings of Caron et al., 2016 by showing that DUX4 expression is highly repressed in S3 myocytes during primary induction of FSHD patient iPSCs using the same FSHD patient ESCs initially reported on by Caron et al. (Figures 6A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Our findings also show that this DUX4 repression is mediated by a DNA methylation mechanism (Figure 6E), and that FSHD iMyoblasts have similar kinetics of upregulation and levels of DUX4 expression during differentiation as we show for FSHD adult biopsy Myoblasts (Figure 5A), establishing their utility for ex vivo and in vivo investigations of FSHD molecular pathology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– FKRP: in this case the novelty is limited (e.g. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31566294/) and the reported findings are very limited in terms of disease modelling.</p></disp-quote><p>Investigations of FKRP iMyoblasts validate the utility of iMyoblasts for investigating the muscle pathology in FKRP dystrophies.

What is the message of that panel in the context of figure 1? (see general comments).</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, Figure 1, Panel C is introduced later in the section on FSHD iMyoblast modeling, which we agree was awkwardly presented in the original manuscript. This and other figures have been reorganized in the revised manuscript to more effectively integrate iMyoblasts characterization and disease modeling in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In figure legend: unclear what Genea 002, 015, 019, etc. mean. Please specify this in Material and Methods as well as Results sections.</p></disp-quote><p>Genea 002, 015 and 019 refer to the ESC cell line designation reported in Caron et al. paper, and we clarified this in the revised manuscript. These FSHD ESC lines were utilized to validate our unexpected finding of DUX4 repression in FSHD patient iPSC during primary induction of myogenesis and exclude the possibility that this finding was an artifact of iPSC reprogramming. We show that Genea/Myocea FSHD ESCs and our iPSCs do not activate DUX4, which remains repressed by a DNA methylation mechanism, challenging the conclusions of the Caron et al. paper on DUX4 expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: lack of IF quantifications (MyoD, pax3, pax7, fusion index…).</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, the revised manuscript provides IF quantification for MYOD1 and fusion indices in Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: conclusion/take home message unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript clarifies the impact of scRNA-Seq UMAP and edgeR analyses for identification of iMyoblasts as a distinct myogenic cell, including further discussion of NFIX target genes as markers of a fetal cell lineage, as elaborated above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: Dux4 up regulation from reporter line not quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised paper provides quantitative data on reporter gene expression (Figure 5B), to complement the quantitative qPCR data showing that FSHD patient iMyoblasts and biopsy bMyoblasts upregulate DUX4 to similar levels in response to differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Significant work is required to reshape the form and message of this manuscript, including adding more data.</p><p>Please find below a list of some general issues:</p><p>– Genea company and differentiation kit no longer exist and no mention about validation of this work with the new Myocea kit – Please validate key findings of this study with Myocea kit.</p><p>– Pax 3 and MyoD not quantified at the protein level – please quantify.</p><p>– Fusion stated to be a key difference between iMyoblasts and S3 cells, but not quantified – please quantify.</p><p>– Tertiary reserve population experiment not quantified – please quantify.</p></disp-quote><p>These concerns have been fully addressed in revision, as discussed in detail above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In vivo section:</p><p>– no quantification of LAMIN A/C &amp; SPECTRIN double positive donor derived fibers provided. – please quantify.</p><p>– given the capacity of forming reserve cells, the expectation in this study was to see this finding validated also in vivo with serial injuries or transplantation, as well as quantification of contribution to satellite cell pool – please quantify donor derived Pax7+ cells in vivo and perform serial injury or transplantation study and quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>These concerns have been fully addressed in revision, as discussed in detail above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Disease modelling:</p><p>– FSHD– please clarify take home message and quantify Dux4 from reporter cell line.</p></disp-quote><p>These concerns have been fully addressed in revision, as discussed in detail above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
