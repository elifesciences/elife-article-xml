However, the precise molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we report that KPNB1, an importin β component of the ncRNA repressor of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NRON) ribonucleoprotein complex, mediates nuclear translocation and repressor function of the PER/CRY complex. RNAi depletion of KPNB1 traps the PER/CRY complex in the cytoplasm by blocking nuclear entry of PER proteins in human cells. KPNB1 interacts mainly with PER proteins and directs PER/CRY nuclear transport in a circadian fashion. Interestingly, KPNB1 regulates the PER/CRY nuclear entry and repressor function, independently of importin α, its classical partner. Moreover, inducible inhibition of the conserved <italic>Drosophila</italic> importin β in lateral neurons abolishes behavioral rhythms in flies. Collectively, these data show that KPNB1 is required for timely nuclear import of PER/CRY in the negative feedback regulation of the circadian clock.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08647.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08647.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08647.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most organisms have an internal clock—known as the circadian clock—that regulates many aspects of their biology and behavior in roughly 24-hr long cycles. In animals, the core of the circadian clock is made of two ‘activator’ proteins and two ‘repressor’ proteins that inhibit the activators so that the levels of all four proteins in cells fluctuate over the cycle.</p><p>The activator proteins switch on the genes that encode the repressor proteins. This increases the production of the repressor proteins in an area of the cell called the cytoplasm. The repressor proteins then bind to each other and then move into the nucleus of the cell to inactivate the activator proteins. However, it was not clear how the repressor proteins move into the nucleus.</p><p>Lee et al. used a technique called ‘RNA interference’ to study the circadian clock in human cells and fruit flies. The experiments show that a protein called importin β enables the repressor proteins to move into the nucleus. Importin β directly interacted with only one of the repressor proteins (called PER). Previous studies have shown that importin β is able to interact with another protein called importin α, but Lee et al.'s results show that this interaction is not important for importin β's role in the movement of the repressor proteins.</p><p>Blocking importin β activity resulted in the loss of circadian rhythms in both human cells and fruit flies, which suggests that importin β performs the same role in many different animals. The circadian clock is disrupted in many cancers, so Lee et al.'s findings may also help to lead us to new treatments to fight these diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08647.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08647.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>KPNB1</kwd><kwd>PER</kwd><kwd>CRY</kwd><kwd>nuclear entry</kwd><kwd>circadian clock</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JBH, 1R01NS054794-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hogenesch</surname><given-names>John B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>John Harer, Duke University, DARPA-D12AP00025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hogenesch</surname><given-names>John B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004897</institution-id><institution>Pennsylvania Department of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Penn Genome Frontiers Institute under a HRFF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hogenesch</surname><given-names>John B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>KPNB1 regulates rhythmic spatio-temporal nuclear import of the PER/CRY complex and is required for negative feedback repression in mammalian and fly clock function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nearly all organisms have circadian clocks, internal timing systems that anticipate and adapt physiology and behavior to daily changes in the light–dark cycle. In eukaryotes, the clock is an interlocked transcriptional–translational feedback loop, which drives rhythmic expression of both core clock genes that make up the oscillator and clock-output genes that drive biological rhythms. These include rhythms in the sleep wake cycle, body temperature, hormone secretion, and energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reppert and Weaver, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bass and Takahashi, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Many components and the molecular mechanism of the circadian clock are conserved between flies and mammals. Conserved components include the bHLH-PAS transactivators, CLOCK/NPAS2 (fly Clk) and BMAL1 (fly Cyc). This heterodimer binds E-box elements in the promoters of two families of transcriptional repressors, the <italic>PER1/PER2/PER3</italic> (fly <italic>Per</italic>) and <italic>CRY1/CRY2</italic> (fly <italic>Cry</italic>) genes. Once translated, PERs and CRYs (Per and Tim in flies) accumulate in a cytoplasmic complex and then translocate into the nucleus to repress the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer, thereby repressing their own transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Panda et al., 2002</xref>). This primary negative-feedback loop is complemented by an ancillary loop, which while conserved, has different components in mammals and flies. In mammals, the ROR element binding repressors REV-ERBα/β and activators RORα/β/γ drive rhythmic expression of <italic>BMAL1</italic>. In flies, vrille (dVRI) or PAR-domain protein-1 (dPDP1) make up this ancillary loop and stabilize the <italic>Drosophila</italic> clock by driving rhythmic expression of <italic>Clk</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yu and Hardin, 2006</xref>). Further modulation of these feedback circuits occurs at the post-translational level as core clock proteins undergo phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and protein degradation by several conserved kinases (CKIδ/CKIε, GSK3β; double-time [dDBT] and shaggy [dSGG]), phosphatases (PP2A; dPP2A), and E3 ubiquitin ligases (FBXL3, FBXL21; dSLMB1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gallego and Virshup, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hirano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yoo et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>KPNB1 is a nuclear import receptor that mediates docking of nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing cargo bound to importin α to the nuclear envelope, thereby facilitating nuclear entry of the target protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">van der Watt et al., 2013</xref>). KPNB1 can also directly recognize the cargo and facilitate nuclear transport independently of importin α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lam et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Forwood et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ghildyal et al., 2005</xref>). In several intensive molecular analyses, PER1/2 and CRY1/2, have been found to contain a functional NLS for their nuclear entry and transcriptional feedback function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vielhaber et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miyazaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hirayama et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of PER proteins, in conjunction with protein dimerization, phosphorylation and turnover, is critical for clock function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yagita et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2002</xref>). However, the specific carrier molecules responsible for nuclear translocation of the clock proteins have not been fully elucidated. Interestingly, a previous biochemical and cellular study reported that nuclear transport of mouse Cry2 is mediated by its direct interaction with importin α family members (RCH1, QIP-1, NPI-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sakakida et al., 2005</xref>). However, the functional relevance of these factors in the clock was not evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sakakida et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, the role of importin β was not investigated.</p><p>In recent studies, KPNB1 was identified as a key nuclear importin component of ncRNA repressor of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) (<italic>NRON</italic>) (lncRNA repressor of the NFAT) RNA-protein-scaffold complex containing several kinases, CKIε, GSK3β, and DYRK2 that regulate NFAT phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gwack et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sharma et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, most of these kinases are also well-known to regulate phosphorylation-related proteolysis and nuclear entry of circadian clock proteins. These data suggested that the clock may share a common molecular mechanism of nuclear translocation with NFAT.</p><p>Here, we tested this hypothesis and report that KPNB1 mediates circadian nuclear translocation and feedback repression activities of the PER/CRY complex through direct complex formation, independently of importin α. Loss of KPNB1 abolished not only rhythmic gene expression in human cells, but also circadian behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Collectively, these results highlight the evolutionarily conserved role of the KPNB1 in regulating nuclear translocation and function of the circadian clock.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KPNB1 is a required for nuclear translocation of PER/CRY</title><p>The NRON complex is composed of a variety of proteins involved in signal transduction, proteolysis, and nuclear transport of NFAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Willingham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sharma et al., 2011</xref>). We noted that three of these components, CK1ε (<italic>dco</italic>, <italic>Dbt</italic>), GSK3β (<italic>sgg</italic>), and DYRK1a (<italic>mnb</italic>), are clock components in both flies and mammals. Moreover, NFAT nuclear translocation has been suggested to be mediated by KPNB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Willingham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sharma et al., 2011</xref>). Thus we hypothesized that KPNB1 would also be closely involved in nuclear entry of the PER/CRY complex and thus circadian clock function.</p><p>To test this, first, we explored how KPNB1 knockdown affects cellular localization of the core clock factors. Interestingly, in immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of cells expressing several flag-tagged clock proteins, knockdown of KPNB1 completely blocked (PER1, PER2), partly blocked (CRY1), or didn't significantly block (CRY2, REVERBα, CLOCK, CHRONO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anafi et al., 2014</xref>]) nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to the flag-tagged proteins, microscopy and immunoblot analysis of cells expressing the Venus (V)-tagged clock proteins (PER1-V, PER2-V, CRY1-V, CRY2-V), KPNB1 knockdown markedly blocked PER1 and PER2 localization and slightly or negligibly effected CRY1 and CRY2 nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In many previous studies, PER and CRY proteins have been shown to work together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tamanini et al., 2005</xref>). Hence, we looked into the effect of KPNB1 knockdown on the subcellular localization of various PERs/CRYs complexes using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shyu et al., 2006</xref>). The BiFC assay showed that KPNB1 depletion significantly impaired nuclear localization of various combinations of PER and CRY proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, nuclear accumulation of the PER2/CRY1 complex was totally blocked by KPNB1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition to ectopically expressed clock proteins, KPNB1 depletion substantially increased cytoplasmic accumulation of endogenous PER1/2 and CRY1/2 proteins thus reducing their relative levels in nuclei in most cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these evidence show that KPNB1 serves as an integral nuclear transport receptor of the PER/CRY complex.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08647.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>KPNB1 knockdown blocks nuclear translocation of PERs/CRYs complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescence microscopic analysis of the effect of KPNB1 depletion on subcellular localization of PER1, PER2, CRY1, and CRY2.

KPNB1 interacted more strongly with PER1 and PER2 proteins than either CRY1 or CRY2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). This suggested that PER proteins may play the leading role in PERs/CRYs nuclear translocation with KPNB1. In support of this, by IF KPNB1 co-localized with both cytoplasmic and nuclear PER2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

To investigate the circadian role of KPNB1 in nuclear localization of PER/CRY, we prepared cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from mouse liver tissues collected at 4 hr intervals for 24 hr in constant darkness.

However, the functional carrier molecules responsible for nuclear localization of the feedback regulators have yet to be determined.

We noted that CKIε, GSK3β, and DYRK2, clock kinases in both mammals and flies, are also constituents of the NRON complex, which regulates cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation of NFAT and consequently its function in the immune systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Willingham et al., 2005</xref>). The NRON complex also contains several molecules involved in protein stability and, critical for this study, nuclear translocation (KPNB1, TNPO1, CSEL1). Subsequent study showed that KPNB1 is the major transport receptor for NFAT nuclear entry and activity upon its dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sharma et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Thus, we investigated the role of KPNB1 on nuclear localization of PER/CRY complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that KPNB1 knockdown trapped PER and CRY proteins at the nuclear membrane, preventing their nuclear accumulation. Consistent with this, in our transcriptional study, we found KPNB1 knockdown significantly relieved <italic>PER1 </italic>transcriptional repression by the PER/CRY complex. Depletion of the other NRON complex translocation factors, TNPO1 and CSE1L, did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), nor did they interact with PER or CRY proteins (data not shown). These data suggest a specific role of KPNB1 as a nuclear transport receptor directly involved in negative feedback regulation of the core clock, in addition to its previously described role in NFAT signaling.</p><p>Despite not playing a role in PER/CRY function, both TNPO1 and CSE1L displayed circadian gene expression in various mouse tissues, and also affected circadian period length (TNPO1) or were required for cellular rhythms (CSE1L) when silenced ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pizarro et al., 2013</xref>], data not shown). Interestingly, the recent in situ hybridization analysis showed that TNPO1 exhibits circadian expression profiles in its mRNA in SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sato et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, these proteins may also play a role in mammalian clock function independent from PER/CRY, perhaps regulating import and export of other clock related components.</p><p>Notably, in our biochemical analyses, KPNB1 strongly interacted with PER proteins and exhibited rhythmic nucleocytoplasmic localization and concurrent nuclear accumulation with PER/CRY in transcriptional repression phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These data suggest KPNB1 drives circadian nuclear entry of PER/CRY. This raises the question: what causes phase-dependent KPNB1 nuclear entry? Most recently, it was reported that intracellular calcium levels regulate importin β-dependent nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaur et al., 2014</xref>). Further, a previous model suggests that KPNB1 nuclear-translocates NFAT immediately after stimulation dependent intracellular calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sharma et al., 2011</xref>). In this regard, several studies have demonstrated the important function of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in circadian clock regulation. For example, periodic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the cytosol, resulting from circadian variation in membrane potential or by the release of Ca(2+) from ryanodine-sensitive stores in SCN neurons, is a critical process for circadian pacemaker function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ikeda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lundkvist et al., 2005</xref>). Based on this evidence, we postulate that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rhythms contribute to driving timely nuclear localization of KPNB1 and its PER/CRY cargo as a critical step in negative feedback regulation of the clock.</p><p>In early models, KPNB1 mediates docking of the importin α/substrate complex in the nuclear pore. More recent evidence shows that KPNB1 can function as nuclear transport receptor independently of importin α by directly recognizing substrates such as CREB, AP-1 transcription factors, and parathyroid hormone-related protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lam et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Forwood et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ghildyal et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, a previous report showed that importin α isoforms (RCH, QIP-1, NPI-2) mediate nuclear localization of CRY2 through direct interactions but did not investigate the functional consequence of this interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sakakida et al., 2005</xref>). In this regard, our data suggest that in mammals KPNB1 mediates nuclear localization of the PER/CRY complex independently of importin α, as overexpression of a KPNB1 mutant lacking an importin α interaction domain had a similar phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with this, both KPNA2 and KPNA1, the well-known KPNB1 interacting importin alpha proteins (importin α1, importin α5), when depleted in cells, did not affect circadian rhythmicity or subcellular localization of PER2 or CRY2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). In a recent report, cytoplasmic retention of PER proteins was accelerated by <italic>KPNA2</italic> overexpression in mouse stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Umemura et al., 2014</xref>). However, intriguingly we found that <italic>KPNA2</italic> overexpression substantially reduced cells expressing PER2-Venus protein in our imaging studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Moreover, both the endogenous and overexpressed KPNA2 protein localized predominantly in the nucleus, which was confirmed by nuclear cytoplasmic fraction Western analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This suggests that KPNA2 might regulate PER2 protein level through an unknown mechanism in U2 OS cells. Thus, we speculate that these different results are likely due to the different cell types and species used.</p><p>On the other hand, knockdown of KPNB1 had strong (PER1, PER2), modest (CRY1), or no effect (CRY2) on single tagged PER and CRY proteins, while it had strong effects on all combinations of PER/CRY complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Similarly, knockdown of KPNB1 increased cytoplasmic retention of endogenous PER1, PER2, CRY1, and CRY2 to varying degrees, probably through complex interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The immunoprecipitation analysis showed that KPNB1 interacted strongly with PERs compared with CRYs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These data suggest that the PERs mediate interaction with KPNB1 and gate nuclear translocation of PER/CRY complex. This is reminiscent of a previous report indicating that the nuclear entry of CRY is mainly dependent on PER, in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). Finally, knockdown of KPNB1 or its fly ortholog <italic>ketel</italic> resulted in arrhythmic U2 OS cells or fly locomotor activity rhythms, while knockdown of most of KPNA isoforms had no significant effect on the rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). These data suggest a model in which KPNB1 plays a necessary role in mediating nuclear entry of the PER/CRY complex in core clock regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Recently, importin β emerged as a potential molecular target for cancer prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">van der Watt et al., 2013</xref>).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom served as Guest Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The study by Lee et al. describes the importance for KPNB1, a member of the importin β family, for nuclear localization of clock proteins, in particular PERIOD proteins in both human cells as well as in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Timed nuclear accumulation of members of the negative limb within the circadian clockwork has long been known to be critical for a functional circadian clock. Circadian rhythms of nuclear appearance of clock proteins as well as functional nuclear localization and nuclear export sequences (NLS and NES) in these proteins have been reported. The dynamics of this is important since it ensures the correct timing of negative feedback repression of clock genes. Here, the authors show that KPNB1 depletion results in primarily cytoplasmic localization of PER in human cells and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Timely subcellular localization of PER2, CRY1, and KPNB1 coincides well and KPNB1 mainly interacts with PER1/2. Thus, the authors concluded that KPNB1 controls nuclear translocation of PER/CRY complex via direct interaction with PER. Intriguingly, KPNB1 mediated nuclear translocation of PER/CRY complex is not dependent on KPNA2 (importin α1) which is a well-known partner of importin β proteins and identified as major carrier protein for PER/TIM repressor complex in flies.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Clarify the role of KPNB1 knockdown on clock gene expression (see Reviewer#1, point 1).</p><p>2) Is KPNB1 really required for CIRCADIAN feedback repression (see Reviewer#1, point 4)?</p><p>3) Better define (and discuss) the roles of KPNA family members (see Reviewer #2, point 1 and Reviewer #3).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The study by Lee et al. describes the importance for KPNB1 (importin β) for nuclear localization of clock proteins, in particular PERIOD proteins in both human cells as well as in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Timed nuclear accumulation of members of the negative limb within the circadian clockwork has long been known to be critical for a functional circadian clock. Circadian rhythms of nuclear appearance of PERs, CRYs as well as TIM (in flys) as well as functional nuclear localization and nuclear export sequences (NLS and NES) in these proteins have been reported. The dynamics of this is important since it ensures the correct timing of negative feedback repression of clock genes.</p><p>Here, the authors show that KPNB1 (but not KPNA2 – importin α) depletion in human cells results in primarily cytoplasmic localization of PER proteins (and to a lesser extent also of CRYs) both for overexpressed as well as for endogenous proteins (a nice and complete set of experiments). In addition, PER proteins directly bind to KPNB1 (are the NLS required?). Also very convincing and carefully conducted are the results they found in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: again, PER is shifted towards more cytosolic localization upon depletion of <italic>ketel</italic>, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of KPNB1. Probably as a consequence, flies with KPNB1 depletion in pdf cells or all clock cells are largely arrhythmic.</p><p>Less convincing are the experiments aiming to demonstrate effects on the circadian clockwork in mammalian cells (see below).</p><p>Overall, however, the manuscript is of high quality and should eventually be published, if the following points can be convincingly addressed:</p><p>1) The effects of KPNB1 knockdown on clock gene expression show conflicting results: either upregulation of PER1 pre-mRNA and downregulation of <italic>BMAL1</italic> pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) or the opposite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). In addition, the effects in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> are very subtle (1.2-fold upregulation of CRY1 pre-mRNA - I don't believe that there is statistical significance given that the (partly high) error bars are SEM with n=3). What about endogenous clock gene levels upon overexpression of KPNB1? Maybe this helps to solve the issue.</p><p>2) In addition, the effects on circadian rhythmicity should be better characterized: are there period effects? Why does the <italic>Per2</italic>-reporter show a low and the <italic>Bmal1</italic>-reporter a high magnitude, if KPNB1 knockdown is supposed to lead to less inhibition of E-boxes?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>: controls do oscillate with a 16-18 hour period (in conflict with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and in conflict with knockdown time series). This is odd and could be normalization artefact - at least the authors should show <italic>BMAL1</italic> as an antiphasic control.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>: The authors claim that KPNB1 is responsible for circadian accumulation and feedback repression, hence they only observe correlations. To unambiguously show that KPNB1 is required for circadian feedback repression, they should analyze circadian protein accumulation (especially CRYs, since they are the major repressors and still go in the nucleus without KPNB1) in wild-type and KPNB1 depleted cells together with analysis of clock gene pre-mRNA over time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors explored the molecular mechanism for nuclear translocation of circadian repressor complex, PER/CRY. They identified KPNB1, a member of the importin β family, plays major role for nuclear translocation of PER1/2, PER/CRY complex and hence feedback repression. Timely subcellular localization of PER2, CRY1, and KPNB1 coincides well and KPNB1 mainly interacts with PER1/2. Thus, the authors concluded that KPNB1 controls nuclear translocation of PER/CRY complex via direct interaction with PER. Intriguingly, KPNB1 mediated nuclear translocation of PER/CRY complex is not dependent on KPNA2 (importin α1) which is a well-known partner of importin β proteins and identified as major carrier protein for PER/TIM repressor complex in flies. Overall, the experiments are well executed and this finding will enhance our understanding of detailed biochemical mechanisms underlying timely controlled nuclear translocation of circadian repressor complex.</p><p>Although the results demonstrating KPNB1 is the major carrier protein for PERs are very solid, the conclusion about KPNB1 being the major carrier protein for PER/CRY complex in mammals and PER/TIM complex in flies needs to be further qualified (see below).</p><p>1) As cited in the text, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sakakida et al. (2005)</xref> demonstrated that importin α family members (including importin α1, KPNA2) control nuclear translocation of CRY2 but not importin β. The data from Sakakida et al., is consistent with this study showing that depletion of KPNB1 produces minimal effects on CRY2 translocation and partial effects on CRY1 translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Based on these two studies, this reviewer thinks that Importin α1 might control translocation of mainly CRY2 and some of CRY1. This is somewhat similar to the case of flies, where translocation of TIM (fly counterpart of CRY at least in the functional aspect) is controlled by importin α1 (Jang AR et al., Plos Genetics 2014, <italic>Drosophila</italic> TIM binds importin α1, and acts as an adapter to transport PER to the nucleus). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> luciferase results indicated that CRY1/CRY2 represses even better than PER1/PER2. Then, confusion comes from the data showing KPNA1 deficiency did not produce any defects in cellular rhythms. Thus, this reviewer is wondering how CRY2 localized in KPNA1 knockdown cells. By performing this experiment we might be able to clarify the reason why KPNA1 depletion did not produce any effects on cellular rhythms. Is that due to either (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bass and Takahashi, 2010</xref>) KPNA1 does not playing any role in translocation of clock proteins (mainly CRY2) on the contrary to previous report and different from the fly case (or there might be cell-type specific issue?) or (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reppert and Weaver, 2002</xref>) nuclear translocation defects of CRY2 not producing any effects on feedback repression suggesting that main repressor of feedback circuitry is PER not CRY?</p><p>2) The authors showed that knockdown of <italic>ketel</italic> (fly homolog of KPNB1) in clock cells made flies arrhythmic via inhibiting nuclear translocation of PER, hence claiming KPNB1 mediates nuclear entry of PER. In another paper lead by some of the authors in this study, they demonstrated that importin α1 protein is critical for nuclear translocation of fly circadian repressor complex PER/TIM, through direct interaction between TIM and importin α1 (Jang AR et al., Plos Genetics, 2014). There, Jang AR et al. proposed the model in which TIM bound to importin α1 acts as a carrier for PER translocation together with importin β. Thus, this reviewer is wondering whether nuclear translocation of TIM is also inhibited in <italic>ketel</italic> mutant, which will be a slightly different case to the mammals. Or, very little amounts of PER translocate to the nucleus in a TIM-independent manner through <italic>ketel</italic>. The authors showed only the PER patterns in <italic>ketel</italic> knockdown flies. By showing TIM patterns in <italic>ketel</italic> knockdown flies, it will be clarified that PER translocate into the nucleus as a PER/TIM/importin α1/importin β complex or via two pathways one is TIM/importin α1 dependent and the other is <italic>ketel</italic> dependent as in mammals.</p><p>3) In the Discussion, the authors state: “Similarly, knockdown of KPNB1 resulted in cytoplasmic retention of endogenous PER1, PER2, CRY1, and CRY2 substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure1–figure supplement 2</xref>).” However, I do not see any substantial effects on CRY2 protein. Rather, this data clearly indicated KPNB1 did not play any roles in nuclear translocation of CRY2 protein. Thus, this statement needs to be rewritten.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript entitled “KPNB1 mediates PER/CRY nuclear translocation and circadian clock function” by Lee et al., the authors investigate the role of KPNB1 (Importin β subunit) for nuclear translocation of PER proteins and its functional implication for circadian clock oscillation in mammalian cells and flies. The authors clearly show that KPNB1 critically regulates the nuclear translocation of PER proteins which are largely independent from CRY proteins in U2OS cells. Interestingly, a knock-down of KPNB1 blocked the nuclear translocation of the PER/CRY complex, suggesting that PER proteins played a dominant role in the nuclear translocation of the PER/CRY complex in mammalian cells. In addition, the authors exhibit that the loss of KPNA2 does not block the nuclear translocation of PER proteins and circadian molecular rhythms in mammalian cells. Moreover, the authors show that a decrease in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Importin β also blocks the nuclear translocation of PER proteins and results in the severe impairment of circadian locomotor activity rhythms in flies. By gathering these findings, the authors conclude that KPNB1 is the essential factor to elicit the cyclic nuclear translocation of PER/CRY in the negative-feedback regulation of the circadian clock.</p><p>In general, the study includes novel findings, especially for the regulation mechanism of subcellular PER/CRY dynamics, which is essential for the circadian clock. However, the reviewer requires the authors discuss the following points before publication.</p><p>Different from KPNA1, expression level of KPNA2 is usually very low in normal somatic cells. On the other hand, KPNA2 highly expressed in early embryo or pluripotent stem cells as well as in some cancer cells. For example, the expression level of the Kpna2 transcript is extremely low in adult mice liver (Koike et al., Science, 2012). In addition, it has recently been reported that KPNA2 accelerates cytoplasmic localization of proteins in some cases (e.g. Yasuhara et al., Mol. Cell, 2012; Alshareeda et al., Br. J. Cancer, 2015). Through the accumulated findings, KPNA2 has been thought to be a unique protein among the KPNAs, and does not represent the function of other KPNAs in somatic cells. Thus, the reviewer feels curious as to why the authors performed knock-down study against KPNA2 instead of KPNA1 or any other KPNAs. The authors might have taken into account a recently reported study which mentioned KPNA2 as a factor to obstruct circadian clock cycling in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (Umemura et al., PNAS, 2014). Umemura et al. showed the high level expression of KPNA2 and cytoplasmic retention of PER protein in undifferentiated ES cells. In addition, overexpression of KPNA2 did not facilitate nuclear translocation, rather accelerated cytoplasmic retention of PER proteins. Strikingly, the authors here clearly showed that knock-down of KPNA2 in U2OS cells resulted in the exclusive nuclear localization of PER2 and increased amplitude of <italic>Per2</italic>:dluc circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>). These results are all well compatible with the results mentioned in the paper by Umemura et al. Therefore, the reviewer recommends that the authors discuss this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08647.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Clarify the role of KPNB1 knockdown on clock gene expression (see Reviewer#1, point 1)</italic>.</p><p><italic>2) Is KPNB1 really required for CIRCADIAN feedback repression (see Reviewer#1</italic>, <italic>point 4)?</italic></p><p><italic>3) Better define (and discuss) the roles of KPNA family members (see Reviewer #2, point 1 and Reviewer #3)</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) The effects of KPNB1 knockdown on clock gene expression show conflicting results: either upregulation of PER1 pre-mRNA and downregulation of</italic> BMAL1 <italic>pre-mRNA (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3E</italic></xref><italic>) or the opposite (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4B and C</italic></xref><italic>).

What about endogenous clock gene levels upon overexpression of KPNB1? Maybe this helps to solve the issue</italic>.</p><p>We agree and did the experiment you suggested. In parallel, we tested both KPNB1 knockdown and overexpression on endogenous clock components regulated primarily by the E-box loop. This showed that KPNB1 knockdown led to significant up-regulation of most of the E-box-controlled genes, PER1, CRY1, DBP, REV-ERBβ. Conversely, these genes are repressed by KPBN1 over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, subsection “KPNB1 regulates transcriptional repressor activity of PERs/CRYs and circadian gene expression independently of importin α (KPNA2)”, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, legend).

To unambiguously show that KPNB1 is required for circadian feedback repression, they should analyze circadian protein accumulation (especially CRYs, since they are the major repressors and still go in the nucleus without KPNB1) in wild-type and KPNB1 depleted cells together with analysis of clock gene pre-mRNA over time</italic>.</p><p>We agree and did a time course of control and KPNB1 knockdown cells for both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of clock proteins and pre-mRNAs levels. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, KPNB1 knockdown markedly reduced or altered the rhythmic accumulation of PER2, CRY1, and CRY2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, legend). Correspondingly, the mRNA levels of several clock genes were arrhythmic in KPNB1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, these data further strengthen the conclusion that KPNB1 is required for circadian feedback repression of clock gene expression.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) As cited in the text,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28"><italic>Sakakida et al. (2005)</italic></xref> <italic>demonstrated that importin α family members (including importin α1, KPNA2) control nuclear translocation of CRY2 but not importin β. The data from Sakakida et al., is consistent with this study showing that depletion of KPNB1 produces minimal effects on CRY2 translocation and partial effects on CRY1 translocation (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>). Based on these two studies, this reviewer thinks that Importin α1 might control translocation of mainly CRY2 and some of CRY1. This is somewhat similar to the case of flies, where translocation of TIM (fly counterpart of CRY at least in the functional aspect) is controlled by importin α1 (Jang AR et al., Plos Genetics 2014,</italic> Drosophila <italic>TIM binds importin α1, and acts as an adapter to transport PER to the nucleus).</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>luciferase results indicated that CRY1/CRY2 represses even better than PER1/PER2. Then, confusion comes from the data showing KPNA1 deficiency did not produce any defects in cellular rhythms. Thus, this reviewer is wondering how CRY2 localized in KPNA1 knockdown cells. By performing this experiment we might be able to clarify the reason why KPNA1 depletion did not produce any effects on cellular rhythms. Is that due to either (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"><italic>Bass and Takahashi, 2010</italic></xref><italic>) KPNA1 does not playing any role in translocation of clock proteins (mainly CRY2) on the contrary to previous report and different from the fly case (or there might be cell-type specific issue?) or (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27"><italic>Reppert and Weaver, 2002</italic></xref><italic>) nuclear translocation defects of CRY2 not producing any effects on feedback repression suggesting that main repressor of feedback circuitry is PER not CRY?</italic></p><p>Thank you for your comments and suggestions. The nomenclature of the KPNA1/2 genes is confusing. In both human and mouse KPNA genes, KPNA1 is importin α5 (IPOA5), while KPNA2 is Importin α1 (IPOA1).</p><p>As you suggested, we tested KPNA2 (Importin α1) knockdown effect on subcellular localization of endogenous or ectopically expressed CRY2 localization and found no significant effects in our nuclear cytoplasmic fractionation and immunofluorescence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>, legend). We also knocked down KPNA1 and tested its effects on rhythms in U2 OS cells driven by <italic>Per2</italic>::luc as well as PER2/CRY2 localization and found no significant changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref> legend). In addition, in our earlier work, we knocked down KPNA1, KPNA3, KPNA4, KPNA5, KPNA6, and KPNA7 (Zhang et al., Cell, 2009), with no measurable effects on circadian rhythms in <italic>Bmal1</italic>::luc activity in U2 OS cells.</p><p><italic>2) The authors showed that knockdown of</italic> ketel <italic>(fly homolog of KPNB1) in clock cells made flies arrhythmic via inhibiting nuclear translocation of PER, hence claiming KPNB1 mediates nuclear entry of PER. In another paper lead by some of the authors in this study, they demonstrated that importin α1 protein is critical for nuclear translocation of fly circadian repressor complex PER/TIM, through direct interaction between TIM and importin α1 (Jang AR et al., Plos Genetics, 2014). There, Jang AR et al. proposed the model in which TIM bound to importin α1 acts as a carrier for PER translocation together with importin β. Thus, this reviewer is wondering whether nuclear translocation of TIM is also inhibited in</italic> ketel <italic>mutant, which will be a slightly different case to the mammals. Or, very little amounts of PER translocate to the nucleus in a TIM-independent manner through</italic> ketel<italic>. The authors showed only the PER patterns in</italic> ketel <italic>knockdown flies. By showing TIM patterns in</italic> ketel <italic>knockdown flies, it will be clarified that PER translocate into the nucleus as a PER/TIM/importin α1/importin β complex or via two pathways one is TIM/importinαα1 dependent and the other is</italic> ketel <italic>dependent as in mammals</italic>.</p><p>We think it is very unlikely that TIM would be nuclear in <italic>ketel</italic> mutants. For one thing, a second <italic>ketel</italic>-dependent (and TIM-independent mechanism) would result in PER being partly nuclear in <italic>ketel</italic> mutants. Also, PER would be partly nuclear in tim mutants. Neither one is the case. While PER is unstable in the cytoplasm without TIM, it is stable in the nucleus, so nuclear PER would have been visible in tim mutants. Thus we believe that Importin alpha typically requires an importin beta, and PER likely translocates into the nucleus as a PER/TIM/importin α1/importin β complex in flies.</p><p><italic>3) In the Discussion, the authors state: “Similarly, knockdown of KPNB1 resulted in cytoplasmic retention of endogenous PER1, PER2, CRY1, and CRY2 substantially (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1D</italic></xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2"><italic>Figure1–figure supplement 2</italic></xref><italic>).” However, I do not see any substantial effects on CRY2 protein. Rather, this data clearly indicated KPNB1 did not play any roles in nuclear translocation of CRY2 protein. Thus, this statement needs to be rewritten</italic>.</p><p>We agree that KPNB1 does not affect nuclear translocation of CRY2 protein when ectopically expressed. In fact, if we looked at endogenous CRY2 localization carefully upon KPNB1 knockdown as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure1–figure supplement 2</xref>, we observed slightly more cytoplasmic accumulation of CRY2 proteins in the KPNB1-depleted cells than control cells, probably due to its interaction with endogenous PER proteins. This also corresponds with BiFC data showing KPNB1 knockdown effects on various combinations of PER/CRY complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, we revised the sentence to: “Similarly, knockdown of KPNB1 increased cytoplasmic retention of endogenous PER1, PER2, CRY1, and CRY2 to varying degrees, probably through complex interactions” (Discussion).</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>[…] Different from KPNA1, expression level of KPNA2 is usually very low in normal somatic cells.
