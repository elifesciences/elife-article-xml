Autism affects males more frequently than females and sex-related mechanisms (e.g., X-linked genes, androgen hormones) can influence E:I balance. This suggests that E:I imbalance may affect autism differently in males versus females. With a combination of in-silico modeling and in-vivo chemogenetic manipulations in mice, we first show that a time-series metric estimated from fMRI BOLD signal, the Hurst exponent (H), can be an index for underlying change in the synaptic E:I ratio. In autism we find that H is reduced, indicating increased excitation, in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) of autistic males but not females. Increasingly intact MPFC H is also associated with heightened ability to behaviorally camouflage social-communicative difficulties, but only in autistic females. This work suggests that H in BOLD can index synaptic E:I ratio and that E:I imbalance affects autistic males and females differently.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Autism is a condition that is usually diagnosed early in life that affects how a person communicates and socializes, and is often characterized by repetitive behaviors. One key theory of autism is that it reflects an imbalance in levels of excitation and inhibition in the brain. Excitatory signals are those that make other brain cells more likely to become active; inhibitory signals have the opposite effect. In non-autistic individuals, inhibitory activity outweighs excitatory activity. In people with autism, by contrast, an increase in excitatory activity is believed to produce an imbalance in excitation and inhibition.</p><p>Most of the evidence to support this excitation-inhibition imbalance theory has come from studies of rare mutations that cause autism. Many of these mutations occur on the sex chromosomes or are influenced by androgen hormones (hormones that usually play a role on typically male traits). However, most people with autism do not possess these particular mutations. It was thus unclear whether the theory could apply to everyone with autism or, for example, whether it may better apply to specific groups of individuals based on their sex or gender. This is especially important given that about four times as many men and boys compared to women and girls are diagnosed with autism.</p><p>Trakoshis, Martínez-Cañada et al. have now found a way to ask whether any imbalance in excitation and inhibition in the brain occurs differently in men and women. Using computer modeling, they identified a signal in brain scans that corresponds to an imbalance of excitation and inhibition. After showing that the technique works to identify real increases in excitation in the brain scans of mice, Trakoshis, Martínez-Cañada et al. looked for this signal, or biomarker, in brain scans of people with and without autism. All the people in the study identified with the gender that matched the sex they were assigned at birth. The results revealed differences between the men and women with autism. Men with autism showed an imbalance in excitation and inhibition in specific ‘social brain' regions including the medial prefrontal cortex, but women with autism did not. Notably, many of these brain regions are strongly affected by androgen hormones.</p><p>Previous studies have found that women with autism are sometimes better at hiding or ‘camouflaging’ their difficulties when socializing or communicating than men with autism. Trakoshis, Martínez-Cañada et al. showed that the better a woman was at camouflaging her autism, the more her brain activity in this region resembled that of non-autistic women.</p><p>Excitation-inhibition imbalance may thus affect specific brain regions involved in socializing and communication more in men who have autism than in women with the condition. Balanced excitation and inhibition in these brain areas may enable some women with autism to camouflage their difficulties socializing or communicating. Being able to detect imbalances in activity using standard brain imaging could be useful for clinical trials. Future studies could use this biomarker to monitor responses to drug treatments that aim to adjust the balance between excitation and inhibition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autism</kwd><kwd>heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>sex/gender</kwd><kwd>excitation</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>755816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lombardo</surname><given-names>Michael V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>602849</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panzeri</surname><given-names>Stefano</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>400061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baron-Cohen</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>802371</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gozzi</surname><given-names>Alessandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Excitation-inhibition imbalance affects medial prefrontal cortex differently in autistic males versus females.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Excitation-inhibition (E:I) balance in the brain has been hypothesized to be atypical in many neuropsychiatric conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019</xref>), including autism. Rubenstein and Merzenich originally suggested that some types of autism may be explained by an E:I imbalance that may lead to hyper-excitability in cortical circuitry and potentially enhanced levels of neuronal noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</xref>). However, coming to a better understanding of how E:I balance is affected across a heterogeneous mixture of autistic individuals has proven to be challenging because of the limited availability of robust E:I biomarkers that are non-invasive and applicable in humans and which can be measured on a large scale. A majority of the literature about E:I balance in autism extends from investigations of prominent single gene mutations associated with autism and the animal model research around these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Nelson and Valakh, 2015</xref>). This leaves a significant gap in evaluating the E:I theory on a larger majority of the autistic population. While no one theory can fully explain all individuals with an autism diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Happé et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lombardo et al., 2019a</xref>), the E:I imbalance theory may have utility for understanding subtypes of autistic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lombardo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lombardo et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lombardo et al., 2019b</xref>).</p><p>Sex/gender may be an important stratifier of relevance for highlighting E:I imbalance subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lai et al., 2017a</xref>). Many highly penetrant autism-associated genes are located on the sex chromosomes (e.g., <italic>FMR1</italic>, <italic>MECP2</italic>, <italic>NLGN3</italic>, <italic>GABRA3</italic>, <italic>ARX</italic>, <italic>SYN1</italic>) and are known to lead to pathophysiology implicating E:I dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bozzi et al., 2018</xref>). Other genes playing important roles in the balance between excitation and inhibition in the brain (e.g., <italic>MEF2C, GRIK2, GRIA1, SCN3A, SCN9A, NPTX2</italic>) are highly sensitive to androgens in human neuronal stem cells and are highly expressed in ‘social brain’ circuitry such as the default mode network, and in particular, the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lombardo et al., 2018b</xref>). Optogenetic stimulation to enhance excitation in mouse MPFC also results in changes in social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Selimbeyoglu et al., 2017</xref>). These results hint that sex-relevant biological mechanisms affect E:I balance and that key social brain regions such as MPFC may be of particular importance for explaining how E:I imbalance affects social behavior. Sex/gender heterogeneity also leads to differing clinical presentations and compensatory mechanisms in autism that may depend on E:I balance in MPFC. It is known that many cognitively able adult autistic women engage in camouflaging behaviors that tend to compensate or mask their social-communicative difficulties moreso than autistic men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lai et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hull et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schuck et al., 2019</xref>). Prior work has shown that whereas autistic males show reduced ventral MPFC (vMPFC) self-representation response, autistic females show intact vMPFC self-representation. Furthermore, the degree to which vMPFC shows intact self-representation response in autistic females is associated with enhanced ability to camouflage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lai et al., 2019</xref>). If E:I imbalance asymmetrically affects vMPFC function in males versus females, this could help explain differential camouflaging in adult autistic females.</p><p>To better understand sex-specific E:I imbalance in autism we need better neuroimaging biomarkers that index underlying synaptic E:I mechanisms and which can be deployed on a large-scale for in-vivo investigation in deeply phenotyped cohorts. Here we pursue the idea that spectral properties of neural time-series data (e.g., local field potentials (LFP) or blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal) could be used to isolate such biomarkers. It has been long known that LFP and resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) data exhibits rich spectral properties, with power decreasing as function of frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bullmore et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Maxim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">He, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bédard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">He, 2014</xref>). Models of neural networks have reported that the E:I ratio has profound effects on the spectral shape of electrophysiological activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brunel and Wang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mazzoni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lombardi et al., 2017</xref>). Recent work with simplified models has proposed that the exponent of the 1/f spectral power law, an index closely related to the Hurst exponent (H), reflects the extent of E:I imbalance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that neurophysiologically heightened E:I ratio generates flatter 1/f slope in LFP data and this could drive H (as measured in BOLD) to be decreased. In past work we have shown that H is atypically decreased in rsfMRI data of adult autistic males, particularly for social brain areas like MPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lai et al., 2010</xref>). H is statistically relevant for the concept of ‘neural noise’ since lower levels of H can be interpreted as closer to what would be expected of a completely noisy random signal (e.g., white noise produces an H = 0.5). Related to H and long-memory characteristics of the rsfMRI time-series, prior work has also shown case-control differences in the intrinsic neural timescale in autism (e.g., magnitude of temporal autocorrelation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref>). However, these prior studies examine primarily male-dominated samples and thus cannot shed insight into sex-related heterogeneity in autism.</p><p>In this work we aim to better understand how E:I imbalance may differentially affect autistic males and females. To achieve this aim, we first took a bottom-up approach by using in-silico (i.e. computational) models of local neuronal microcircuitry to make predictions about how H and 1/f slope in LFP and rsfMRI BOLD data may behave when there are underlying changes in E:I balance. Importantly, our approach takes a major step forward from prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gao et al., 2017</xref>) by utilizing a model that includes interactions within and between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations. Next, our in-silico predictions are then tested in-vivo with a combination of rsfMRI and experimental manipulations in mice that either increase neurophysiological excitation or that silence the local activity in the network. Chemogenetic (i.e. designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs; DREADD) or optogenetic manipulations are optimally suited to these purposes, owing to the possibility of enabling remote control of neuronal excitability with cell-type and regional specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferenczi et al., 2016</xref>). Manipulations of neuronal activity like these in animals are key for two reasons. First, they allow for experimental in-vivo confirmation of in-silico predictions. Second, such work is a key translational link across species (i.e. rodents to humans), given the common use of neuroimaging readouts from rsfMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balsters et al., 2020</xref>). At the genomic level we then examine what cell types could possibly underlie sex-related heterogeneity in E:I imbalance. Finally, we then turn to the human rsfMRI data to show how E:I imbalance may differ amongst autistic males and females and how such mechanisms may explain individual differences in camouflaging behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Analysis of E:I balance in simulated LFPs from a recurrent network model</title><p>In a bottom-up fashion, we first worked to identify potential biomarkers of E:I imbalance from neural time-series data such as local field potentials (LFPs). Motivating our in-silico modeling of E:I effects on LFP and BOLD data, we note prior work by Gao and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). This prior work simulated LFP time-series from non-interacting excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and showed that spectral properties such as the 1/f slope flatten with increasing E:I ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Given the relationship between 1/f slope and H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Stadnitski, 2012</xref>), we show within this modeling approach that as E:I ratio increases, H decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, a limitation of this prior work is that it does not include interactions between excitatory and inhibitory populations nor does it allow for recurrent connections within such populations.</p><p>To address these limitations, we developed a more biologically plausible recurrent network model of interacting excitatory and inhibitory integrate-and-fire neuronal populations that receive external inputs (both a sensory driven thalamic input and a sensory unrelated intracortical input) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; see Materials and methods for more details). From this model, we computed the network’s LFP as the sum of absolute values of all synaptic currents. The absolute value is taken because AMPA synapses are usually apical and GABA synapse are peri-somatic and thus their dipoles sum with the same sign along dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mazzoni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mazzoni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deco et al., 2004</xref>). We computed LFP summing presynaptic currents from both external inputs and recurrent interactions, as real LFPs capture both sources of synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Logothetis, 2008</xref>). We have extensively validated this method of computing LFPs from integrate-and-fire networks in previous work on both real cortical data and simulations with networks of realistically-shaped 3D neurons and have shown that it works better than when using alternatives such as the sum of simulated membrane potentials, the signed sum of synaptic currents or a time integration of the spike rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mazzoni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mazzoni et al., 2015</xref>).

The spectral profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) display two different regions of frequencies with different spectral properties: a region of steeper negative 1/f slopes at higher frequencies (&gt; 30 Hz) and a region of shallower (small negative and sometimes positive) slopes at low frequencies (&lt; 30 Hz). Thus, we calculated slopes for the low- and high-frequency regions with piecewise regressions of log power predicted by log frequency. Slopes from the low-frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and high-frequency region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) increase when <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is reduced (i.e. E:I ratio augmented).

Changes in slopes are more prominent in the excitation-dominated region where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf21"><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is smaller (that is, E:I ratio is shifted in favor of E) than the reference value (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> = 11.3), which has been shown to be a plausible reference value that reproduces cortical power spectra well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mazzoni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mazzoni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mazzoni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mazzoni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbieri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cavallari et al., 2014</xref>). An increase in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> beyond this reference value (shifting the E:I balance towards stronger inhibition) had a weaker effect on slopes.

To answer this question, we first had to simulate BOLD data from the LFP data generated from the recurrent model. Our approach to simulating BOLD (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for how BOLD was simulated from LFP), captures several key characteristics about the empirical relationship between LFP and BOLD. Studies with simultaneous LFP and BOLD measured in animals have shown that although BOLD signal correlates with both LFPs and spikes, it correlates more strongly with the LFP than with spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Magri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rauch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Viswanathan and Freeman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lauritzen and Gold, 2003</xref>). Further studies with simultaneous LFP and BOLD measured in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Magri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schölvinck et al., 2010</xref>) have considered the relationship between frequency-resolved LFPs and BOLD and indicate that LFP power shows time-lagged correlations with the time course of BOLD signal and that different frequency bands vary in how they correlate with measured BOLD signal. In particular, gamma band frequencies tend to show the strongest correlation between LFP power and BOLD signal. Frequency dependency of the EEG-BOLD relationship, with prominent predictive power of the gamma band, is also reported in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Scheeringa et al., 2011</xref>). Remarkably, these empirical observations are recapitulated with simulated LFP and BOLD data from the recurrent model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows time-lagged correlations between time-dependent LFP power and BOLD. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows that all considered LFP frequency bands (e.g., alpha, beta, gamma) correlate with BOLD, but with the gamma band showing the strongest correlations. Thus, our method for simulating BOLD from recurrent model LFP data retains key empirical relationships observed between real LFP power and BOLD. Simulating BOLD with a simple hemodynamic response function (HRF) convolution of the LFP would have not respected the patterns of correlations between LFP power and BOLD observed in empirical data (i.e. the relative increase in correlation between the gamma band and BOLD with respect to other bands; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Relationship between E:I ratio from the recurrent model and H measured in simulated BOLD response.</title><p>Panel <bold>A</bold> shows time-lagged Pearson correlations between LFP power across a range of different frequencies and the BOLD signal.

Note that a moderate increase in H with higher input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) was also found when comparing two very different levels of input. Given that a possible non-local action of hM4Di might lead to less excitatory input to the considered area coming from the silencing of nearby regions, this suggests that our conclusion should still hold even in the presence of some non-local DREADD effects. In general, the effects of simulating hM4Di DREADD were far less prominent than those reported above when simulating enhanced excitation specifically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results predict overall a very small effect of the hM4Di DREADD on H and 1/f slopes.

The in-silico modeling of BOLD data suggests that if E:I ratio is increased via enhanced excitability of excitatory neurons, then H should decrease. To empirically test this prediction in-vivo, we measured rsfMRI BOLD signal in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice under conditions where a chemogenetic manipulation (hM3Dq DREADD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>) is used to enhance excitability of pyramidal neurons. Here we used a sliding window analysis to assess dynamic changes in H over the course of 3 different phases of the experiment – 1) a ‘Baseline’ phase where the CNO drug or a SHAM injection had not yet occurred, 2) a ‘Transition’ phase directly following CNO or SHAM injection, and 3) a ‘Treatment’ phase, whereby CNO has its maximal effect. We find that H is modulated over time by the DREADD manipulation (condition*time*treatment phase interaction <italic>F</italic> = 349.03, p&lt;0.0001). During the Baseline phase of rsfMRI scanning before the DREADD-actuator CNO was injected, H under DREADD or a SHAM control conditions are not affected (condition main effect <italic>F</italic> = 0.82, p=0.37; condition*time interaction <italic>F</italic> = 0.36, p=0.54). However, during the Transition phase of the experiment where the CNO begins to have its effects, we find a condition*time interaction (<italic>F</italic> = 4.94, p=0.0262), whereby H drops over time at a steeper rate during the DREADD condition compared to the SHAM condition (green line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Evidence from animal models of rare genetic variants associated with autism have typically been used as the primary evidence for the E:I imbalance theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019</xref>). However, these variants affect only a small percentage of the autism population. Thus, it is unclear how E:I imbalance might affect the majority of heterogeneous individuals within the total autism population. To bridge this gap we need multi-level methods that can be applied to understand the ‘living biology’ behind actual human individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Courchesne et al., 2019</xref>), such as in vivo neuroimaging data and metrics applied to such time-series data that are linked to actual underlying neural E:I mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Markicevic et al., 2020</xref>). Bridging this gap will help us identify mechanistic targets that explain neural and behavioral variability across a much larger portion of individuals in the autism population.</p><p>Based on earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gao et al., 2017</xref>), we reasoned that metrics such as 1/f slope and H in neural time-series data would be relevant as an in vivo neuroimaging marker of E:I mechanisms. Prior work suggested this relationship via a model that considers inhibition and excitation as separate entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). However, excitation and inhibition in the brain are inseparably linked. Results about the relationship between spectral shape and E:I balance obtained with our model of recurrent excitation and inhibition are largely compatible with those obtained with an earlier model of uncoupled excitation and inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). The uncoupled model predicts a linear increase of the slope value (i.e. flatter, less negative slopes) as E:I ratio increases. This is because in the uncoupled model changing the E:I ratio modifies only the ratio of the contribution to the LFP spectra of excitatory (faster time constant) and inhibitory (slower time constant) synaptic currents, leading to a linear relationship between slopes and E:I. In contrast, we found that the relationship between E:I and the spectral slope flattens out for high values of I. This, in our view, may in part arise from the fact that, as shown in studies of recurrent network models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brunel and Wang, 2003</xref>), higher recurrent inhibition leads to higher peak frequency of gamma oscillations (i.e. an increase of power at higher frequencies) thus partly counteracting the low-pass filtering effect of inhibitory currents in the uncoupled model. We plan to investigate in future studies how these opposing effects interact in a wider range of configurations and to use these results to gain a better understanding of the relationship between E:I ratio and LFP spectral shape.</p><p>Furthermore, prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gao et al., 2017</xref>) considered only 1/f slopes in simulated LFP data and did not explore the effect of the transformation between LFP neural activity to BOLD. Our simulations address these problems and significantly extends prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gao et al., 2017</xref>) on the relationship between E:I imbalance and changes in spectral properties of neural signals. We showed that when excitation and inhibition interact in a recurrent network model, flatter 1/f slopes and decreases in H are specific markers of increases in E:I ratio. We also showed that in simulated BOLD signal, H and E:I ratio are associated in a manner similar to the relationships observed with LFP data. Taken together, these results predict that changes in H in neural time-series data can be interpreted as a shift in synaptic E:I ratio that permeates through in LFP or BOLD readouts.</p><p>Our simple model to generate BOLD from frequency-resolved LFPs reflect several features of the empirical LFP-BOLD relationship - namely the presence of a particularly strong gamma-BOLD relationship and the fact that a better prediction of the BOLD is obtained from the frequency-resolved LFP than from the wideband LFP. However, a limitation of our simple model is that, in its present form, it cannot capture the negative relationship between the power of some low-frequency LFP bands and the BOLD amplitude that has been reported in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schölvinck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Scheeringa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mukamel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Niessing et al., 2005</xref>). Modelling the low frequency LFP to BOLD relationship in greater detail would require significant extensions of our neural model, as lower frequency oscillations are thought to arise from more complex cortico-cortical and thalamocortical loops than those that can be captured by our simple model of a local recurrent circuit with only two classes of neurons and no spatial structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Scheeringa and Fries, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zucca et al., 2019</xref>). An important topic for further modelling work will be to understand how biomarkers of more complex neural feedback loops can be extracted from LFP or BOLD spectral signatures.</p><p>The power of our in-silico modeling approach is that it provides explicit predictions of what to expect in real BOLD data when synaptic E:I imbalance occurs. Remarkably, these in silico predictions are confirmed in vivo with rsfMRI BOLD data in halothane-sedated mice after experimental chemogenetic manipulations that specifically enhance neural excitation. Intriguingly, and consistent with in-silico predictions, manipulations that silence both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations do not have a strong effect on H in BOLD. These results are in line with optogenetic studies showing that specifically enhancing excitation in MPFC seems to have the biggest effects on social behavior in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>). The present work clearly shows that enhancement of excitation results in measurable changes in BOLD readouts as decreases in H. This insight allows us to leverage H as an in-vivo rsfMRI biomarker that has strong relevance back to synaptic E:I imbalance. Future extensions of our research might involve refined modelling and the use of chemogenetic manipulations in awake conditions, hence minimizing the possible confounding contribution of anesthesia on baseline E:I balance.</p><p>With regards to how sex-related heterogeneity in E:I imbalance might manifest in autism, we utilized genomics data and found that autism-associated genes that affect excitatory neuronal cell types are enriched for genes that are differentially expressed by DHT in human neuronal stem cells. This inference extends prior work implicating excitatory neuron cell types in autism-relevant biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Satterstrom et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Velmeshev et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Willsey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Parikshak et al., 2013</xref>) by linking genomic mechanisms in these cell types to the male-specific influence of androgen hormones. Importantly, other cell types such as inhibitory neurons do not express autism-associated genes that are also influenced by DHT. Additionally, the DHT-sensitive and autism-associated excitatory genes tend to spatially express in the human adult brain in regions such as MPFC, PCC, insula, and intraparietal sulcus, which have been shown to be affected in autism across a range of task-related and rsfMRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Di Martino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Di Martino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Uddin and Menon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Padmanabhan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lombardo et al., 2010</xref>), and which overlap with areas discovered by the PLS analysis to express a sex-by-diagnosis interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Moving to human rsfMRI data on adult individuals with autism, we utilized H as a neuroimaging biomarker of E:I imbalance. Specifically, we examined whether H differs between adult males and females with and without autism. Mass-univariate analysis highlighted one region in vMPFC which showed a sex-by-diagnosis interaction - that is, H was specifically reduced in adult autistic males, but not in autistic females. Reduced H in autistic males is compatible with the inference of elevated E:I ratio potentially driven by enhanced excitation. The observed effect in vMPFC may also be consistent with a ‘gender-incoherence’ pattern (i.e. towards reversal of typical sex differences in autism) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bejerot et al., 2012</xref>). However, sex-specific normative ranges would need to be better established before interpreting effects in autism as being reversals of normative sex differences. More work with much larger general population-based datasets is needed to establish whether there are robust normative sex differences in H and to describe the normative ranges of H may take for each brain region, sex, and across age. Such work would also help with normative modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bethlehem and Seidlitz, 2018</xref>) approaches that would enable identification of which autistic individuals highly deviate from sex-specific norms.</p><p>Multivariate PLS analysis extended the mass-univariate results by showing that a distributed neural system structurally and functionally connected to vMPFC, such as default mode network (DMN) areas like PCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buckner and DiNicola, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>), as well as intraparietal sulcus and insular cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Uddin and Menon, 2009</xref>), also expressed a similar but more subtle sex-by-diagnosis interaction. Interestingly, these regions highlighted by the PLS analysis are remarkably similar to the map of brain regions where autism-associated excitatory and DHT-sensitive genes highly express (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Therefore, important social brain circuitry such as the DMN, and other integrative hubs of the salience network (e.g., insula) that connect DMN to other important large-scale networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Uddin and Menon, 2009</xref>) may be asymmetrically affected by heightened E:I ratio in autistic males more than autistic females.</p><p>These human rsfMRI results are not only compatible with the in silico predictions and the in vivo mouse rsfMRI data presented here, but are also compatible with several prior lines of work. Our prior work highlighted that DMN functional connectivity in typically developing adolescent males, but not females, is affected by heightened levels of fetal testosterone and this network was heavily comprised of MPFC and PCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lombardo et al., 2018b</xref>). In the same work, we showed that a cortical midline DMN subsystem comprising MPFC and PCC highly expresses several genes relevant for excitatory postsynaptic potentials (e.g., <italic>MEF2C, GRIK2, GRIA1, SCN3A, SCN9A, NPTX2</italic>). The current findings linking autism-associated genes in excitatory neuron cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) allow for more precise inferences about the importance of excitatory cell types over and above other inhibitory cell types. This is important given that evidence regarding inhibitory neuronal cell types and their role in E:I imbalance in autism is more mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Horder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coghlan et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, the expression of these genes in human neuronal stem cells is elevated after exposure to the potent androgen DHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lombardo et al., 2018b</xref>). Thus, one potential explanation for the male-specific reduction of H in vMPFC could have to do with early developmental and androgen-sensitive upregulation of genes that play central roles in excitatory neuron cell types, and thus ultimately affecting downstream E:I imbalance. Such effects may be less critical in human females and may serve an important basis for sex-differential human brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaczkurkin et al., 2019</xref>). These effects may also help explain why qualitative sex differences emerge in autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lai et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bedford et al., 2020</xref>). rsfMRI H in autistic adults was also relevant in a sex-specific manner to a clinical behavioral phenomenon known as ‘camouflaging’. Camouflaging relates to a set of compensatory or masking strategies/mechanisms that allow individuals to cope with their social-communicative difficulties in everyday social situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lai et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hull et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Livingston et al., 2019</xref>). It is known that cognitively able adult autistic females tend to engage in more camouflaging behavior than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lai et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hull et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schuck et al., 2019</xref>) and the extent to which individual females engage in camouflaging is linked to vMPFC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lai et al., 2019</xref>). One of the most important known functions of vMPFC has to do with self-representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lombardo et al., 2010</xref>) and simulating others based on information about the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mitchell et al., 2006</xref>). In prior task-related fMRI work we found a similar sex-by-diagnosis interaction effect whereby males are more impaired in vMPFC self-representation response than their female autistic counterparts. Furthermore, increased magnitude of vMPFC self-representation neural response correlates with increased camouflaging ability, but only in adult autistic females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lai et al., 2019</xref>). Strikingly, here we find a similar sex-by-diagnosis interaction effect in vMPFC H as well as a female-specific correlation with camouflaging - as vMPFC H increases, indicative of a more normative or intact level of E:I balance, camouflaging also increases. This converging set of results suggests that intrinsic mechanisms such as E:I balance may be atypical only in cognitively able autistic males at vMPFC. More intact E:I balance in the vMPFC of autistic females may enable better vMPFC-related function (e.g., self-representation) and thus potentially better enable these individuals to camouflage social-communicative difficulties and cope in social situations. Future work changing E:I balance in vMPFC may provide a useful avenue for ameliorating daily life social-communication adaptation and coping difficulties in autistic males and enable them to optimally engage in compensatory processes such as camouflaging to the similar extent as autistic females. It may also be fruitful to examine how intact E:I balance in vMPFC of females may be an expression of protective factors that are hypothesized to buffer risk for autism in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Robinson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Werling, 2016</xref>).</p><p>This work may also be of broader relevance for investigating sex-specific E:I imbalance that affects other early-onset neurodevelopmental disorders with a similar male-bias as autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rutter et al., 2003</xref>). For instance, conditions like ADHD affect males more frequently than females and also show some similarities in affecting behavioral regulation and associated neural correlates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chantiluke et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, gene sets associated with excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters are linked to hyperactivity/impulsivity severity in ADHD, suggesting that E:I-relevant mechanisms may be perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Naaijen et al., 2017</xref>). It will be important for future work to test how specific sex-specific E:I imbalance is to autism versus other related sex-biased neurodevelopmental disorders. Similarly, future work should investigate how H may change over development. Prior work has shown that H and other related measures such as 1/f slope can change with normative and pathological aging in both rsfMRI and EEG data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Maxim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wink et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Voytek et al., 2015</xref>). Imperative to this work will be the establishment of age and sex-specific norms for H in much larger datasets. Age and sex-specific norms will enable more work to better uncover how these biomarkers may be affected in neurodevelopmental disorders or disorders relevant to neurodegeneration. Such work combined with normative modeling approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bethlehem and Seidlitz, 2018</xref>) may help uncover how experiential and environmental effects further affect such metrics.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that spectral properties of neural time-series data, such as H and 1/f slope, can be utilized in neuroimaging readouts like LFP and BOLD as a biomarker for underlying E:I-relevant mechanisms. In silico predictions from simulated LFP and BOLD data were confirmed in vivo with rsfMRI BOLD data where excitation was enhanced through chemogenetic manipulation. Finally, in application to humans, we show that H in rsfMRI data is reduced in vMPFC and other DMN areas of adult autistic males, but not females. Reduced H is indicative of enhanced excitation and thus points to sex-specific dysregulation of E:I balance in social brain networks of autistic males. This male-specific dysregulation of E:I balance may be linked to sex-differential early developmental events such as androgen-upregulation of gene expression for genes that play important roles in excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lombardo et al., 2018b</xref>). The intact levels of H in females may help facilitate elevated levels of compensation known as camouflaging to cope with daily social-communicative difficulties. This important female-specific brain-behavioral correlation may also be key for future interventions targeting E:I mechanisms and MPFC-related brain networks to enable better coping with daily social-communicative difficulties. More generally, this work extends the relevance of the E:I imbalance theory of autism beyond evidence from autism-associated rare genetic variants and specify a larger portion of the autism population whereby these E:I mechanisms may be of critical importance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human participants</title><p>All procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008.

Core preprocessing was implemented with AFNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cox, 1996</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/">http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/</ext-link>) using the tool speedypp.py (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bit.ly/23u2vZp">http://bit.ly/23u2vZp</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kundu et al., 2012</xref>). This core preprocessing pipeline included the following steps: (i) slice acquisition correction using heptic (7th order) Lagrange polynomial interpolation; (ii) rigid-body head movement correction to the first frame of data, using quintic (5th order) polynomial interpolation to estimate the realignment parameters (3 displacements and three rotations); (iii) obliquity transform to the structural image; (iv) affine co-registration to the skull-stripped structural image using a gray matter mask; (v) nonlinear warping to MNI space (MNI152 template) with AFNI 3dQwarp; (vi) spatial smoothing (6 mm FWHM); and (vii) a within-run intensity normalization to a whole-brain median of 1000. Core preprocessing was followed by denoising steps to further remove motion-related and other artifacts. Denoising steps included: (viii) wavelet time series despiking (‘wavelet denoising’); (ix) confound signal regression including the six motion parameters estimated in (ii), their first order temporal derivatives, and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal (referred to as 13-parameter regression). The wavelet denoising method has been shown to mitigate substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity in motion-related artifact that manifests linearly or non-linearly and can do so without the need for data scrubbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Patel et al., 2014</xref>). Data scrubbing (i.e. volume censoring) cannot be used in our time-series-based analyses here as such a procedure breaks up the temporal structure of the time-series in such a way that invalidates estimation of the Hurst exponent (H) that examine long-memory characteristics. Wavelet denoising is implemented with the Brain Wavelet toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brainwavelet.org">http://www.brainwavelet.org</ext-link>). The 13-parameter regression of motion and CSF signals was achieved using AFNI 3dBandpass with the –ort argument. To further characterize motion and its impact on the data, we computed FD and DVARS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Power et al., 2012</xref>). Between-group comparisons showed that all groups were similar with respect to head motion as measured by meanFD with no diagnosis (<italic>F(3,106)</italic> = 1.77, p=0.18) or sex (<italic>F(3,106)</italic> = 0.51, p=0.47) main effects or sex-by-diagnosis interaction (<italic>F(3,106)</italic> = 1.10, p=0.29). All groups showed average meanFD of less than 0.2 mm (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Mean time-series for each of the 180 parcels within the Human Connectome Project Multimodal Parcellation (HCP-MMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>) were extracted from the final preprocessed data, to estimate H. The estimation of H utilizes a discrete wavelet transform and a model of the time-series as fractionally integrated processes (FIP) and is estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. This method utilizing the FIP model for estimating H differs from our prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lai et al., 2010</xref>), which used a model of fractional Gaussian noise (fGn). fGn is one type of process subsumed under the FIP model. However, the fGn model has the limitation of assuming that the BOLD time-series is stationary and also limits the upper bound of H at 1. In practice, we have seen that the upper bound of H = 1 from the fGn model results in ceiling effects for many brain regions and subjects. Thus, to remove the assumption of stationarity and upper bound of H = 1, the FIP model offers more flexibility and potentially added sensitivity due to better estimation of between-subject variability when estimates are near or exceed H = 1. When H &gt; 1 the time-series is considered non-stationary and has long memory characteristics (e.g., is fractal). H is computed using the <italic>nonfractal</italic> MATLAB toolbox written by one of the co-authors (WY) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/wonsang/nonfractal">https://github.com/wonsang/nonfractal</ext-link>).

These models also incorporated meanFD and FIQ as covariates of no interest. Multiple comparison correction was achieved using an FDR q &lt; 0.05 threshold. Visualization of effect sizes for figures was achieved using the <italic>ggseg</italic> library in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/ggseg">https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/ggseg</ext-link>).</p><p>In addition to mass-univariate analysis, we also utilized multivariate partial least squares (PLS) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krishnan et al., 2011</xref>) to highlight distributed neural systems that capture the effect of a sex-by-diagnosis interaction. This analysis was implemented with code from the <italic>plsgui</italic> MATLAB toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rotman-baycrest.on.ca/pls/">http://www.rotman-baycrest.on.ca/pls/</ext-link>). A matrix with participants along the rows and all 180 HCP-MMP parcels along with columns was input as the primary neuroimaging matrix for PLS. We also inserted a vector describing the sex-by-diagnosis contrast as the matrix to relate to the neuroimaging matrix. This vector describing the sex-by-diagnosis interaction was computed by matrix multiplication of the contrast vector of [1, -1, -1, 1] to a design matrix that was set up with columns defining TD males, autism males, TD females, and autism females, respectively. The PLS analysis was run with 10,000 permutations to compute p-values for each latent-variable (LV) pair and 10,000 bootstrap resamples in order to compute bootstrap ratios (BSR) to identify brain regions of importance for each LV pair. To isolate specific brain regions of importance for a statistically significant LV, we selected the top 20th percentile of brain regions ranked by BSR.</p><p>Relationships between H and camouflaging were conducted within autistic males and females separately. Pearson’s correlations were used to estimate the strength of the relationship and groups were compared on the strength of the relationship using Fisher’s r-to-z transform as implemented with the paired.r function in the <italic>psych</italic> library in R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioral index of camouflaging</title><p>Camouflaging (consciously or unconsciously compensating for and/or masking difficulties in social–interpersonal situations) was operationalized as prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lai et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lai et al., 2019</xref>): the discrepancy between extrinsic behavioral presentation in social–interpersonal contexts and the person’s intrinsic status. We used both the AQ score and RMET correct score as reflecting intrinsic status (i.e. self-rated dispositional traits and performance-based socio-cognitive/mentalizing capability), and the ADOS Social-Communication total score as reflecting extrinsic behavioral presentation. The three scores were first standardized (S<sub>ADOS</sub>, S<sub>AQ</sub> and S<sub>RMET</sub>) within our sample of autistic men and women by mean-centering (to the whole autism sample in this study) and scaling (i.e. divided by the maximum possible score of each) to generate uniformly scaled measures that can be arithmetically manipulated. The first estimate of camouflaging was quantified as the difference between self-rated autistic traits and extrinsic behaviors (CF1 = S<sub>AQ</sub> − S<sub>ADOS</sub>), and the second estimate between mentalizing ability and extrinsic behaviors (CF2 = −S<sub>RMET</sub> − S<sub>ADOS</sub>). Then, using principal component analysis, the first principal component score of CF1 and CF2 (accounting for 86% of the total variance) was taken as a single, parsimonious measure of camouflaging for all subsequent analyses. This method was utilized in order to be consistent with prior work which computed the camouflaging metric in an identical fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lai et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lai et al., 2019</xref>). This measure should be interpreted by relative values (i.e. higher scores indicate more camouflaging) rather than absolute values. This operationalization only allows for estimating camouflaging in autistic individuals in our cohort, as it partly derives from the ADOS score which was not available in TD participants. This approach remains informative, as qualitative studies suggest that camouflaging in autism can be different from similar phenomenon (e.g. impression management) in TD individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bargiela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hull et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In vivo chemogenetic manipulation of excitation in mouse prefrontal cortex</title><p>All in vivo studies in mice were conducted in accordance with the Italian law (DL 116, 1992 Ministero della Sanità, Roma) and the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Briefly, the initial 120 volumes of the time-series were removed to allow for T1 and gradient equilibration effects. Data were then despiked, motion corrected and spatially registered to a common reference template. Motion traces of head realignment parameters (three translations + three rotations) and mean ventricular signal (corresponding to the averaged BOLD signal within a reference ventricular mask) were used as nuisance covariates and regressed out from each time course. All rsfMRI time-series also underwent band‐pass filtering to a frequency window of 0.01–0.1 Hz and spatial smoothing with a full width at half maximum of 0.6 mm.</p><p>The experimental design of the study allowed for computation of H during time-windows in the rsfMRI scan before drug injection (i.e. ‘Baseline’), a transition phase where the drug begins having its effect (i.e. ‘Transition’), and a treatment phase when the drug is thought to have its optimal effect (i.e. ‘Treatment’). Analysis of condition, treatment phase, time, and all interactions between such factors was achieved using a sliding window analysis. Each window was 512 volumes in length and the sliding step was 1 vol. H is computed at each window and results in an H time-series. The H time-series is used as the dependent variable in a linear mixed effect model (i.e. using the <italic>lme</italic> function within the <italic>nlme</italic> library in R) with fixed effects of condition, time, treatment phase, and all 2-way and 3-way interactions between such factors as well as a factor accounting for scan day. Random effects in the model included time within mouse as well as treatment phase within mouse, all modeled with random intercepts and slopes. This omnibus model was utilized to examine a 3-way interaction between condition, time, and treatment phase. If this interaction was present, we then split the data by the 3 levels of the treatment phase (e.g., Baseline, Transition, and Treatment), in order to examine the main effect of condition or the condition*time interaction.

Similarly, simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG)/fMRI studies in humans have found that the BOLD correlates with the EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Scheeringa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Scheeringa et al., 2009</xref>), which in turns correlates strongly with the LFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Whittingstall and Logothetis, 2009</xref>). Importantly, the BOLD amplitude at any given time has been found to correlate preferentially with the power of high frequency bands. In particular, the BOLD amplitude correlates strongly with the gamma (40–100 Hz) band. However, the power distribution across frequency bands carries complementary information about the BOLD signal, meaning that each band contributes to the prediction of BOLD and predicting the BOLD signal directly from a wide band (i.e. the whole LFP spectrum) leads to poorer predictions of BOLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Magri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schölvinck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Scheeringa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goense and Logothetis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kilner et al., 2005</xref>). To account for these empirical observations, we have developed a model of BOLD signal that integrates contributions from different bands with a preferential contribution from high frequency bands.</p><p>To compute the simulated BOLD through the convolutions of the simulated LFPs, we needed to generate longer time-series than the initial 10 seconds simulated for LFPs. However, it was unfeasible to simulate very long BOLD time-series due to limitations on computational resources. We thus created, from the LFP data used for evaluations of individual g values, aggregated LFP time-series corresponding to different intervals of g (rather than individual values of g), as follows. The set of 10-second LFP time-series was divided into 3 equi-populated groups of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf49"><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>:</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> &lt; 7.5, 7.5 &lt; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf50"><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> &lt; 11 and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf51"> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> &gt; 11. A concatenated LFP time-series was created for each group by randomly concatenating 20 LFP traces, which provided 200-second LFP signals. Low frequencies of the concatenated data were log-log linearly extrapolated based on the low-frequency slopes obtained in LFP log-log linear piecewise fitting. To account for statistical variability, the process of concatenating data was repeated 20 times for each group of g, randomly changing the order in which the individual LFP traces were combined within the group.</p><p>Once concatenated LFP time-series data was simulated, we compute the simulated BOLD time-series as the LFP data convolved not only with a hemodynamic response function (HRF), as in standard network models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deco et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wijeakumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buss et al., 2014</xref>), but also with a high-pass filter (HPF) that gives more predictive power to higher LFP frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We have tested different parameters of the HPF, checking that changing the parameters produce qualitatively similar results and a monotonic correspondence between H of simulated LFP and H of simulated BOLD, and we opted for a HPF with a cutoff frequency (the frequency where the response is lowered by 3 dB) of 12.5 Hz and with a peak response at 20 Hz. The effect of the HPF was to attenuate low frequencies of the BOLD power distribution, partly compensating the low-frequency enhancement of HRFs, and to shift the peak frequency of BOLD power to 0.03 Hz, a value much closer to the peak frequency found in our real BOLD data and in most BOLD studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcauter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2011</xref>) with respect to the one that would have been obtained without convolution (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To simulate BOLD response from the LFP data generated from the recurrent model, within the frequency domain we multiplied the LFP spectrum with spectra of the high-pass filter (HPF) and the hemodynamic response function (HRF), as follows:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>+</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf52"><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the fast Fourier transform operation and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf53"><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is a constant white noise term. This noise term summarizes neurovascular relationship at frequencies not observable because they are faster than the BOLD acquisition frequencies. We assumed that the amplitude of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf54"><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> was very small and we assigned small values to this noise term. We checked that the exact value of amplitude of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf55"><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, or the spectral profile of this noise term (for example, simulating 1/f noise instead of white noise), did not alter the monotonic relationship between the simulated H of BOLD and LFP.

The HRF used for simulating BOLD was the HRF from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Magri et al., 2012</xref>, but similar results were obtained when using a canonical HRF (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analyses examining enrichment of autism-associated genes in different cell types with genes differentially expressed by androgen hormones</title><p>To test hypotheses regarding cell types that may be affected by androgen influence, we examined genes linked to autism via rare de novo protein truncating variants that are enriched for expression in specific cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Satterstrom et al., 2020</xref>). Of the 102 genes reported by Satterstrom et al., we split these lists by enrichments in early excitatory neurons (C3), MGE derived cortical interneurons (C16), microglia (C19), and astrocytes or oligodendrocyte precursor cells (C4). In addition to high risk mutations linked to autism, we additionally used a list of genes differentially expressed (DE) in different cell types within post-mortem prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex tissue of autistic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Velmeshev et al., 2019</xref>). These DE gene lists were split into cell types, and we examined DE genes in any excitatory neuronal cell class (L2/3, L4/L5/6), inhibitory cell classes (IN-PV, IN-SST, IN-VIP, IN-SV2C), microglia, astrocytes (AST-PP, AST-FB), and oligodendrocytes.</p><p>To test the question of whether cell type autism-associated gene lists were enriched for genes known to be differentially expressed by DHT, we used a previous DE gene list from an RNA-seq dataset of DHT administration to human neuronal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lombardo et al., 2018b</xref>).

dysfunction in autism. In doing so, it nicely integrates computational (in silico) modelling with novel methods for the analysis of time series data, picking up on a recent thread on excitation-inhibition balance in neocortex. One very unique approach of the paper is the notion of a &quot;behavioral camouflage&quot; – that is, the ability mask social communicative difficulties through cognitive strategies: the authors find that a relatively intact E:I balance in medial prefrontal cortex may assist women with autism to recruit behavioural camouflage. This work obviously needs to be further nuanced with the various contributions of social gender roles, learning and cognitive strategies more broadly, as these pertain to persons with autism. This paper makes valuable contributions towards neurophysiological mechanisms of large-scale neurophysiological signals, the role of biophysical models in neuroscience, and our understanding of autism spectrum disorders.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Intrinsic excitation-inhibition imbalance affects medial prefrontal cortex differently in autistic men versus women&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Büchel as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Takamitsu Watanabe (Reviewer #1); Richard Gao (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper presents an impressive integration of in silico modelling, in-vivo rodent fMRI with chemogenetic manipulation and human fMRI. A number of key insights are advanced and integrated: the emerging and informative knowledge of time scale hierarchies in the brain; neurobiological and social aspects of autism spectrum disorder, including sex/gender considerations; and the role of computational models in linking micro- and macroscopic scales of investigation.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers were impressed with the ambition and technical accuracy of the study. Their detailed technical suggestions are included below – all of which essentially request edits to the text (mainly Introduction and Discussion), more detailed appraisals of the data, and further visualizations. There are no new data acquisitions required and the additional analyses are suggested to improve the depth and quality of the presentation.</p><p>Reviewer 2 challenges the link between BOLD and LFPs versus spiking behaviour. Since the work of Logothetis and colleagues (and as confirmed subsequently), it is generally accepted that BOLD reflects broad spectrum LFP fluctuations more than spiking output, although this finding may be at times over-simplified. Therefore I suggest a brief discussion of this issue either in the Materials and methods (to justify the choice) or the Discussion (to acknowledge a partial limitation).</p><p>The reviewers' points are provided in full (because they are detailed and constructive), but where possible we will endeavour to rely on editorial discretion in appraising the revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this work, the authors first demonstrated an association between E/I balance and Hurst component (H) by showing that [1] in a computational study, the Hurst component based on LFP was positively correlated with E/I balance, [2] also in-silico, the H based on BOLD signals was positively correlated with E/I balance –this part is predictable given prior work about the LFP-BOLD association – and [3] in vivo, the BOLD-based H was increased when neuronal excitability was enhanced.</p><p>Afterwards, they showed [4] MPFC was among human brain regions whose gene expression had both male-specific and autism-specific patterns, [5] in resting-state fMRI signals, a significant sex-diagnosis interaction effect was found in Hurst component in vMPFC and [6] only in the autistic female, the H was correlated with the camouflaging score.</p><p>Based on these observations, the authors claim that [A] Hurst component can be an index for the E/I balance and [B] the association between E/I balance and autism differs between sexes.</p><p>The theme (E/I balance, autism and sex difference) is important and each observation appears scientifically sound. In particular, the first half about the relationship between E/I balance and H (results [1]-[3] in above) is straight forward and looks solid. Relatively, the last half could be improved if the following concerns are addressed.</p><p>First, I think readers would like to know the spatial relationship between the MPFC found in the gene analysis and the vMPFC detected in the following rsfMRI analysis. In my understanding, if the authors want to say any link between sex-related genes and autism/sex-specific H changes, these two regions should be somewhat overlapped.</p><p>Second, I think readers would appreciate it if the authors supply some more information about associations between Hurst component in the vMFPC and behaviours/symptoms: at least, in both sexes, associations between H and symptom severity (total, social part and RRB component, respectively) in autistic individuals and those between H and AQ scores in both TD and autistic groups in both sexes. Such additional information would be quite helpful to re-interpret the function of the brain area in each sex and in TD and autism.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, Trakoshis, Martinez-Cañada and colleagues take a multi-scale approach to study how altered excitation-inhibition balance manifests in spectral features of the fMRI BOLD signal and apply it to study autism. Combining computational modeling of recurrent spiking neural networks, rodent chemogenetic experiments in-vivo, and sex- and autism-related gene expression in neuronal stem cells and post-mortem brain tissue, the authors relate changes in Hurst exponent (H) and 1/f exponent of the power spectrum to modulation of neuronal excitation specifically. With this link, they argue for a mechanistic interpretation of BOLD signal differences (in H) between autistic males and females, as well as the neural correlate of social camouflaging in females only.</p><p>The study is well-designed and logically presented, and I especially commend the multiscale approach that start with computational modeling to establish experimental hypotheses. Overall, I believe the paper is of quality and within the scope of <italic>eLife</italic>, as it integrates several levels of biology and thus appeals to a broad audience. Substantive concerns regarding modeling and analysis choices, as well as potentially problematic interpretations are listed below. I would recommend the manuscript for publication after those are addressed through additional analyses and writing changes, without collection of additional data.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) I have two potential issues regarding the simulation of BOLD from LFP. First – and I do not claim domain expertise here whatsoever – it seems to me that BOLD should be simulated by convolving the HRF with the spiking output of the circuit, not the LFP. The LFP, as the authors note, is a combination of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic fluctuations. While taking the summation of the absolute value of those fluctuations will approximate local spiking, the latter is a true representation of the circuit's output, and is less affected by the strength of the inputs.</p><p>2) Second, and related, is that the authors draw attention to the frequency-dependent correlation between BOLD and LFP power, as correlation increases with frequency. But this pattern in correlation is essentially baked into the model itself, since a high-pass filter is applied after convolution with the HRF, imposing a higher correlation in higher frequencies. In addition, while this model partially recapitulates empirical data, it's also been shown that there is a negative correlation between LFP low-frequency power (e.g., α, 8-12 Hz) and BOLD (e.g., Mukamel et al., 2005). While it's good that the authors demonstrate changes in H to be unaltered by a conventional HRF-convolution model, I would like them to please comment on these two points, and whether the latter can be recapitulated in their model. If not, this is a good point of limitation to discuss.</p><p>3) When simulating the effect of DREADD silencing, do the neurons still spike at very low leak potentials? If not, then the LFP is effectively driven by the statistics of the cortical and thalamic inputs, which would represent a different circuit regime from the recurrent interactions enabled by higher leak potentials. While this does not change the conclusion of the study drastically, it would implicate the non-recurrent inputs to be the key factor in shaping H in this instance, which can alter the interpretation of the DREADD data.</p><p>4) A related point: the spiking network model represents some local circuit that receives cortical inputs. When simulating the effect of DREADD, only E<sub>L</sub> is changed, but not the cortical inputs. How realistic is this assumption? In other words, how local is the effect of DREADD on the resting state activity in the PFC? Additionally, while the authors show changes in H (or the lack thereof) in the two DREADD experiments, does absolute amplitude of BOLD fluctuations change in the expected directions, e.g., an increase with excitation and decrease with silencing?</p><p>5) The rat is anesthetized prior to chemogenetic manipulation, which already shifts E:I balance. Without collecting data from pre-anesthesia periods, it's hard to say what those changes in H are, and how they compare relative to the DREADD manipulation. But the authors should at least discuss this point, and I would even suggest trying to simulate the additional effect of anesthesia to see if there is an interaction with DREADD (though this is not necessary).</p><p>6) E:I is interpreted to be normal in autistic females (no difference in H between TD and ASD females), but there is significant covariation with behavior, which is one of the main findings of the study. However, this begs the question: how much variation in H can be attributed to &quot;healthy behavior-modulated variation&quot;, and how much to pathology? In Figure 5B, it looks like the range in H in the female autism cohort straddles the TD and ASD male cohorts, with comparable standard deviation. On the other hand, H does not correlate with the degree of social camouflaging in the male ASD cohort, yet there is still significant variation in the amount of camouflaging they are capable of. Is there a separate mechanism at play for camouflaging in males then? How do the authors settle these two seemingly contradictory findings?</p><p>7) Subsection “Human fMRI data analysis” appears to state that the mean of the BOLD timeseries across voxel is taken first, from which H is computed. Doesn't it make more sense to compute H for each voxel and then average after? How different are these two situations? I don't have an intuition for how averaging timeseries affect H, but an analogous situation in spectral analysis is destructive interference, where two high-amplitude oscillations may combine to a flat signal due to a phase difference.</p><p>8) Another method question: why not fit PLS directly with the 2-column matrix (CF1 and CF2) directly, since PLS is capable of outputting a single explanatory component, instead of performing PCA first. They should be similar?</p><p>9) Similarly (and maybe I'm not understanding something here), why not fit PLS or mass univariate over the entire cortex for camouflaging as well, as the authors did to find spatial specificity for the sex*diagnosis contrast, instead of only regressing in vMPFC specifically?</p><p>10) Lastly, while I appreciate the ample reference to Gao et al., 2017, I suggest the authors check out Lombardi et al., 2017 as well, as they also look at how 1/f changes as a result of E:I shifts, but with a recurrent and interacting-E:I spiking model that is arguably more similar to the model in this manuscript. However, their finding is in contrast to Gao et al., 2017, where 1/f flattens for increasing inhibition. This is worth referencing and noting in the discussions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an impressive piece of work combining multi-level methods and different modalities using both mouse and human data that substantially enhances our understanding of E:I imbalance in autism. The authors demonstrate and extend the link between E:I balance and the Hurst component and 1/f slope in local field potentials and rsfMRI data using a biologically more plausible network model than prior work. They further establish the spatial distribution of autism-linked genes associated with excitation and androgen-sensitive genes that coincide with the sex-differential region associated with the H-component in the human rsfMRI data. Interestingly, this region also shows a sex-differential relationship to camouflaging behavior. This is an impressive set of analyses with elaborate and thorough methodological steps. Listed below are some minor comments that can help increase the clarity of the manuscript and interpretation of the results.</p><p>1) The authors start the Introduction with the sentence that E:I imbalance affects many disorders. This calls for at least a short mention in the Discussion how findings are specific to autism.</p><p>2) The Introduction lacks a bit of a red line to my taste. It would be clearer to read if sub-paragraphs were linked to each other. The different sections make sense – however it is left to the reader to link them to each other. Given the complexity and many aspects touched on, I think the flow of the Introduction could still be improved a bit.</p><p>3) Could authors explain in more details what “in silico” refers to in this context? This might not be clear to a broad readership.</p><p>4) How was mean frame-wise displacement calculated? Power? Jenkinson?</p><p>5) In Table 3, could authors also report differences in symptom scores and camouflaging between autistic males and females.</p><p>6) What is the justification for the use of PLS on top? What additional information is revealed?</p><p>7) A large part of the results is in mouse data. The Introduction should thus also include a section introducing how E:I imbalance can be investigated in animal models. Right now, the Introduction refers solely to human participants, whereas the entire first Result section does not.</p><p>8) Given the results first format, it should be pointed out briefly which dataset was used for which set of results. The first section should clearly state that this is done in the mouse data for example.</p><p>9) The sex-differential results in humans are intriguing. However, when looking at Figure 5B, I wonder whether a gender-incoherent pattern is evident here? Could authors further discuss this? Also, in line with this, I wonder whether authors could refine this part of the Discussion stating: &quot;Thus, one potential explanation for the male-specific reduction of H in vMPFC could have to do with early developmental and androgen-sensitive upregulation of genes that play central roles in excitatory neuron cell types, and thus ultimately affecting downstream E:I imbalance. Such effects may be sex-differential and thus less critical in human females, serving an important basis of sex-differential human brain development and explaining the sex-based heterogeneity and qualitative sex differences of autism neurobiology in human.&quot; Do authors refer to typical females here? The results look like TD females show a similar pattern to autistic males. So how do authors explain the differential pattern in TD females and autistic females.</p><p>10) I like the link to the camouflaging behavior. However, the question arises whether there is also a sex-differential link to core autistic symptoms such as for example repetitive behaviors that have also been shown to differ across autistic males and females?</p><p>11) Could authors include information on the age range of autistic subjects (currently, I can't see the age range anywhere) and discuss the potential effect of age on their results from a neurodevelopmental perspective?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55684.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>First, I think readers would like to know the spatial relationship between the MPFC found in the gene analysis and the vMPFC detected in the following rsfMRI analysis.

First – and I do not claim domain expertise here whatsoever – it seems to me that BOLD should be simulated by convolving the HRF with the spiking output of the circuit, not the LFP. The LFP, as the authors note, is a combination of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic fluctuations. While taking the summation of the absolute value of those fluctuations will approximate local spiking, the latter is a true representation of the circuit's output, and is less affected by the strength of the inputs.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up two important questions in this comment. The first question pertains to whether BOLD correlates more with spiking activity (a measure of the circuit’s output) or with the LFP. The second question regards why we computed the LFP from network activity as a sum of absolute values of synaptic currents.</p><p>To answer the first question, and as the Editor points out in their summary notes of the revisions, this has been addressed extensively by the seminal and widely known work of Logothetis, as well as work of others, on simultaneous recordings of intracranial neural activity and BOLD (to which some of us have also contributed). A fair but a little oversimplified summary is that in these experiments it was consistently found that BOLD correlates with both LFPs and spikes, but that, when LFPs and BOLD are dissociated (by pharmacological techniques or within natural fluctuations of brain activity), BOLD correlates more with the LFP (Logothetis et al., 2001; Magri et al., 2012; Rauch et al., 2008; Viswanathan and Freeman, 2007; Lauritzen and Gold, 2003). These findings are usually interpreted as implying that the BOLD contrast mechanism reflects the synaptic input and intracortical processing of a given area rather than its spiking output. When considering frequency-resolved LFP activity, in general the BOLD signal correlates more strongly with the power of high frequency LFP bands. In the previous version of the paper, we covered in our text the result that BOLD correlates more with gamma band of LFP power than with other bands. However, we did not discuss that BOLD correlates more with the LFP than with spikes. We now added this information, and related citations, to the text of the revised manuscript.</p><p>“Studies with simultaneous LFP and BOLD measured in animals have shown that although BOLD signal correlates with both LFPs and spikes, it correlates more strongly with the LFP than with spikes (Logothetis et al., 2001; Magri et al., 2012; Rauch, Rainer and Logothetis, 2008; Viswanathan and Gold, 2003).”</p><p>The reviewer’s second question dealt with why we computed the LFP from network activity as a sum of absolute values of synaptic currents. Following established and well validated procedures, we computed the simulated LFP from the model network of point-like integrate-and-fire neurons as the sum of absolute values of synaptic currents because AMPA synapses are usually apical and GABA synapse are peri-somatic and thus their dipoles sum with the same sign along dendrites (Mazzoni et al., 2008; Mazzoni et al., 2010; Deco et al., 2004). We have extensively validated this method of computing LFPs from integrate-and-fire networks in previous work. For example, we reported in previous work that computing the LFP as a sum of absolute values of synaptic currents gives a much better fit to real cortical LFP data (Mazzoni et al., 2008) or to LFPs generated by anatomically detailed three-dimensional networks models (Mazzoni et al., 2015) than using alternatives such as the sum of simulated membrane potentials, the signed sum of synaptic currents or a time integration of the spike rate.</p><p>“From this model, we computed the network’s LFP as the sum of absolute values of all synaptic currents. The absolute value is taken because AMPA synapses are usually apical and GABA synapse are peri-somatic and thus their dipoles sum with the same sign along dendrites (Mazzoni et al., 2008; Mazzoni et al., 2010 and Deco, Rolls and Horwitz 2004). We computed LFP summing presynaptic currents from both external inputs and recurrent interactions, as real LFPs capture both sources of synaptic activity(Logothetis, 2008). We have extensively validated this method of computing LFPs from integrate-and-fire networks in previous work on both real cortical data and simulations with networks of realistically-shaped 3D neurons and shown that it works better than when using alternatives such as the sum of simulated membrane potentials, the signed sum of synaptic currents or a time integration of the spike rate (Mazzoni et al., 2008 and Mazzoni et al., 2015.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Second, and related, is that the authors draw attention to the frequency-dependent correlation between BOLD and LFP power, as correlation increases with frequency. But this pattern in correlation is essentially baked into the model itself, since a high-pass filter is applied after convolution with the HRF, imposing a higher correlation in higher frequencies. In addition, while this model partially recapitulates empirical data, it's also been shown that there is a negative correlation between LFP low-frequency power (e.g., α, 8-12 Hz) and BOLD (e.g., Mukamel et al., 2005). While it's good that the authors demonstrate changes in H to be unaltered by a conventional HRF-convolution model, I would like them to please comment on these two points, and whether the latter can be recapitulated in their model. If not, this is a good point of limitation to discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not think that the BOLD-LFP pattern of correlation is hard-wired into the model by construction. In Figure 2—figure supplement 2A (Magri’s et al., 2012 HRF) and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B (canonical HRF), we show that removing the high-pass filter from simulation of BOLD response does not modify significantly the pattern of correlation between LFP power at high frequency bands (including gamma) and BOLD. The high-pass filter only adds an improvement in the fitting of experimental data in terms of the relative distribution of values of correlation across frequency bands. We added a note to the main text to highlight this fact.</p><p>“Removing the high pass filter from simulation of BOLD response did alter the relative values of correlation between LFP power and BOLD across frequency bands, making the BOLD response more in disagreement with experimental data, but did not change the relationship of decreasing H with decreasing <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf57"><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), suggesting that our conclusions are robust to the details of the model of the LFP to BOLD relationship.”</p><p>We also thank the reviewer for pointing out the need to discuss the sometimes-observed negative correlation between the low-frequency LFP power and BOLD. While our simplified model to generate BOLD from LFPs captures several empirical features of the LFP-BOLD relationship (namely the presence of a particularly strong gamma power-BOLD relationship and the fact that a better prediction of the BOLD is obtained from the frequency-resolved LFP than from the wideband LFP), our model is not able to capture all experimentally reported relationships, including the low frequency LFP power-to-BOLD anticorrelation pointed out by the reviewer. We feel that modelling the low frequency LFP power-to-BOLD relationship in greater detail would be outside the scope of this work. It is thought, in fact, that lower frequency oscillations arise from more complex cortico-cortical and thalamocortical loops than those that can be captured by a simple model of a local recurrent circuit with only two classes of neurons and no spatial structure, as it is ours. Following the recommendations of the Editor in the summary, we addressed this point by pointing out this limitation of our work, and the need for further investigations, in Discussion.</p><p>“Our simple model to generate BOLD from frequency-resolved LFPs reflect several features of the empirical LFP-BOLD relationship – namely the presence of a particularly strong gamma-BOLD relationship and the fact that a better prediction of the BOLD is obtained from the frequency-resolved LFP than from the wideband LFP. However, a limitation of our simple model is that, in its present form, it cannot capture the negative relationship between the power of some low-frequency LFP bands and the BOLD amplitude that has been reported in some studies (Schölvinck et al., 2010; Scheeringa et al., 2011; Mukamel, 2005 and Niessing, 2005). Modelling the low frequency LFP to BOLD relationship in greater detail would require significant extensions of our neural model, as lower frequency oscillations are thought to arise from more complex cortico-cortical and thalamocortical loops than those that can be captured by our simple model of a local recurrent circuit with only two classes of neurons and no spatial structure (Scheeringa and Fries, 2019; Zucca et al., 2019). An important topic for further modelling work will be to understand how biomarkers of more complex neural feedback loops can be extracted from LFP or BOLD spectral signatures.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) When simulating the effect of DREADD silencing, do the neurons still spike at very low leak potentials? If not, then the LFP is effectively driven by the statistics of the cortical and thalamic inputs, which would represent a different circuit regime from the recurrent interactions enabled by higher leak potentials. While this does not change the conclusion of the study drastically, it would implicate the non-recurrent inputs to be the key factor in shaping H in this instance, which can alter the interpretation of the DREADD data.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s question, in our simulations excitatory and inhibitory populations spike for all simulation scenarios reported in the paper, including the data points with the highest value of inhibition within an individual graph and in the DREADD silencing simulations mentioned by the reviewer. Of course, firing rates of E and I neurons are lower when increasing inhibition or lowering resting potentials. In both real cortical data and in recurrent network simulations, it is well known that the LFP is driven by presynaptic currents from both external inputs and recurrent interactions. Because of this, the fact that the BOLD follows LFPs and not spikes has been interpreted by Logothetis and colleagues to imply that the LFP reflects the total processing taking place in a cortical areas (including inputs and recurrent contributions) and not its output. We edited the text to better specify that the LFP spectral shapes, in both real data and our simulations, reflect presynaptic currents from both external inputs and recurrent interactions.</p><p>“From this model, we computed the network’s LFP as the sum of absolute values of all synaptic currents. The absolute value is taken because AMPA synapses are usually apical and GABA synapse are peri-somatic and thus their dipoles sum with the same sign along dendrites (Mazzoni et al., 2008; Mazzoni et al., 2010 and Deco, Rolls and Horwitz, 2004). We computed LFP summing presynaptic currents from both external inputs and recurrent interactions, as real LFPs capture both sources of synaptic activity (Logothetis, 2008). We have extensively validated this method of computing LFPs from integrate-and-fire networks in previous work on both real cortical data and simulations with networks of realistically-shaped 3D neurons and shown that it works better than when using alternatives such as the sum of simulated membrane potentials, the signed sum of synaptic currents or a time integration of the spike rate (Mazzoni et al., 2008; Mazzoni et al., 2015).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A related point: the spiking network model represents some local circuit that receives cortical inputs. When simulating the effect of DREADD, only E<sub>L</sub> is changed, but not the cortical inputs. How realistic is this assumption? In other words, how local is the effect of DREADD on the resting state activity in the PFC?</p></disp-quote><p>At the cellular level, the effect of DREADD CNO-mediated activation of hM4Di on silencing neurons has been reported as a decrease of their excitability and of spiking activity, at least in part due to G protein inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels (Armbruster et al., 2007; Atasoy et al., 2012; Carter et al., 2013; Ferguson et al., 2011; Krashes et al., 2011; Ray et al., 2011; Sasaki et al., 2011).</p><p>In the previous version of the paper we simulated the effect of DREADD silencing (hM4Di applied under the control of a pan-neural promoter) by simulating a decrease in excitability through decreasing the resting potential of all neurons (Figure 3B), finding a very moderate increase in H for lower values of the resting potential. Regarding locality of DREADD effect, it should be pointed out that DREADD stimulation is carried out via systemic CNO administration (Roth, 2016), and regional targeting is achieved via localized expression of recombinant adenocairal vectors, which in the case of the present study where transfected in the mouse prefrontal cortex. Given the anterograde nature of the vectors employed, a long range effect of our manipulations cannot be ruled out.</p><p>We thus agree with the reviewer that it is interesting to model in simulations the possible non-locality of DREADD silencing effect through a decrease in the excitatory input to the network (which in our model goes to both E and I neurons, according to established anatomical findings). In the revised paper, we address this question by reporting in the revised text that in the simulations of Figure 3B we compare two different levels of input to the network and we found higher H for lower values of input, thus suggesting that our conclusion should still hold even in the presence of some non-local DREADD effects.</p><p>“Note that a moderate increase in H with higher input (Figure 3B) was also found when comparing two very different levels of input. Given that a possible non-local action of hM4Di might lead to less excitatory input to the considered area coming from the silencing of nearby regions, this suggests that our conclusion should still hold even in the presence of some non-local DREADD effects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, while the authors show changes in H (or the lack thereof) in the two DREADD experiments, does absolute amplitude of BOLD fluctuations change in the expected directions, e.g., an increase with excitation and decrease with silencing?</p></disp-quote><p>In order to address this question, we computed fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) (Zuo et al., 2008) on PFC BOLD timeseries data from the DREADD experiments. Given that 1/f slope flattens and H is reduced due to heightened excitation, we expected that the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations would be lowered as well. Using the same type of sliding window analysis as reported for H in the manuscript, we show that fALFF indeed drops systematically as a result of the DREADD excitation manipulation. In contrast, no such effects exist for the DREADD silencing manipulation. Although there are condition effects with the baseline period, those effects are weak in nature and also differ in opposing directions across the two DREADD manipulations. Furthermore, the lower baseline level of fALFF in the DREADD excitation experiment is not sufficient to explain the much larger drop in fALFF which is obvious in the plots, given the steep drop off halfway through the transition phase and which stays consistently lower throughout the treatment phase when the drug has its maximal effects.</p><p>“Consistent with the idea that heightened excitation leads to flattening of the 1/f slope and reductions in H, we also computed a measure of the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF)(Zou et al., 2008). Given the effect of flattening 1/f slope, we expected that fALFF would show reductions due to the DREADD excitation manipulation but would show no effect for the DREADD silencing manipulation. These expectations were confirmed, as DREADD excitation results in a large drop in fALFF, which shows a stark drop off midway through the transition phase and stays markedly lower throughout the treatment phase when the drug has its maximal effects. In contrast, similar effects do not occur for the DREADD silencing manipulation (see Figure 3—figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The rat is anesthetized prior to chemogenetic manipulation, which already shifts E:I balance. Without collecting data from pre-anesthesia periods, it's hard to say what those changes in H are, and how they compare relative to the DREADD manipulation. But the authors should at least discuss this point, and I would even suggest trying to simulate the additional effect of anesthesia to see if there is an interaction with DREADD (though this is not necessary).</p></disp-quote><p>Because of the difficulty in controlling restraint-induced stress in highly rousable rodent species, our chemo-fMRI manipulations were carried out under light sedation. Our sedation protocol ensures physiologically stability, preserves sensorial responsivity (Orth et al., 2006) and does not induce burst-suppression or cortical hyper-synchronization (Liu et al., 2011), resulting in preserved rsfMRI connectivity topography (Coletta et al., 2020; Whitesell et al., 2020) and rich fMRI state dynamics (Gutierrez-Barragan et al., 2019). While it is conceivable that the E:I balance produced by the sedative agent could be brain-state dependent, and as such partly affected by arousal state, converging lines of investigation argue against a significant interaction between anesthesia and DREADD manipulations, supporting the notion that the results of our manipulations are meaningful and translationally relevant, independent of the specific E:I state that characterizes our chemo-fMRI recordings.</p><p>In addition, there are other considerations to note. First, all of our quantifications have been expressed with respect to a reference control arm in both the excitatory and inhibitory DREADD studies, an experimental option that permits to control and account for possible drifts in the physiological state across time. Second, consistent with a negligible DREADD/anesthesia interaction, the results of our in silico modelling, in which no explicit account of anesthesia was included, accurately predicted empirical BOLD rsfMRI recordings as well as dynamic timeseries features observed in awake conditions in autistic individuals. Finally, the successful identification of sex-specific features based on H mapping in autism is also consistent with this view, suggesting that our modelling, and its empirical validation, can capture relevant features that can be extended to the quite wakefulness that characterize rsfMRI recordings in human populations (Reimann and Niendorf, 2020).</p><p>While a formal modelling of the effect of anesthesia would be beyond the scope of the present work in the revised manuscript, we acknowledge the use of DREADD manipulations in sedated animals as a potential limitation of our study.</p><p>“Future extensions of our research might involve refined modelling and the use of chemogenetic manipulations in awake conditions, hence minimizing the possible confounding contribution of anesthesia on baseline E:I balance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) E:I is interpreted to be normal in autistic females (no difference in H between TD and ASD females), but there is significant covariation with behavior, which is one of the main findings of the study. However, this begs the question: how much variation in H can be attributed to &quot;healthy behavior-modulated variation&quot;, and how much to pathology? In Figure 5B, it looks like the range in H in the female autism cohort straddles the TD and ASD male cohorts, with comparable standard deviation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important question regarding normative ranges of H in the human brain (and its association pattern with behaviors) and how these vary by factors such as sex. In the absence of large-scale data from the general population, it is difficult to judge what would be the range of healthy versus pathological variation here without better estimates of population-level norms (e.g., mean/median, range, variance) for each region and by sex, and, preferably across age. We would suggest that future work is needed on very large sample datasets from the general population to estimate such norms. Once there is better evidence of robust population-level norms, it may be clearer what could be considered the range of healthy variability versus pathology. We intend to assess this question in future work.</p><p>“The observed effect in vMPFC may also be consistent with a “gender-incoherence” pattern (i.e. towards reversal of typical sex differences in autism)(Bejerot et al., 2012). However, sex-specific normative ranges would need to be better established before interpreting effects in autism as being reversals of normative sex differences. More work with much larger general population-based datasets is needed to establish whether there are robust normative sex differences in H and to describe the normative ranges of H may take for each brain region, sex, and across age. Such work would also help with normative modelling (Bethlehem et al., 2018) approaches that would enable identification of which autistic individuals highly deviate from sex-specific norms.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the other hand, H does not correlate with the degree of social camouflaging in the male ASD cohort, yet there is still significant variation in the amount of camouflaging they are capable of. Is there a separate mechanism at play for camouflaging in males then? How do the authors settle these two seemingly contradictory findings?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding this sex-differential correlation with camouflaging, it is indeed likely that different mechanisms drive the relationship in females than in males. In past work, with task-fMRI (Lai, Lombardo et al., 2019), we interpreted one of such mechanisms to be differing cognitive strategy that might be underpinned by an important vMPFC function – self-representation. The current work adds a new angle to what could possibly be the mechanism, as a second and non-mutually exclusive alternative explanation, could have something to do with cellular mechanisms affecting E:I balance in vMPFC. These different levels of explanations could line up together – that is, E:I imbalance in vMPFC causes disturbance in the development of self-representation, which impairs ability to engage in cognitive strategies that effectively permits camouflaging in males.</p><p>“More intact E:I balance in the vMPFC of autistic females may enable better vMPFC-related function (e.g., self-representation) and thus potentially better enable these individuals to camouflage social-communicative difficulties and cope in social situations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Subsection “Human fMRI data analysis” appears to state that the mean of the BOLD timeseries across voxel is taken first, from which H is computed. Doesn't it make more sense to compute H for each voxel and then average after? How different are these two situations? I don't have an intuition for how averaging timeseries affect H, but an analogous situation in spectral analysis is destructive interference, where two high-amplitude oscillations may combine to a flat signal due to a phase difference.</p></disp-quote><p>We elected to compute mean time-series within a region for several reasons that have to do with spatial smoothness, the spatial extent of effect for DREADD manipulations, and to harmonize the analysis procedures between mouse and human rsfMRI datasets. In addition to the spatial smoothness of the rsfMRI data itself, steps in the preprocessing pipeline introduce spatial smoothing to some extent. The preprocessing step of smoothing will also explicitly make spatially proximal voxels correlated. Thus, computing a mean time-series allows us to summarize the time-series of highly correlated spatially proximal voxels. Other considerations about the mouse rsfMRI data are also noteworthy here. The DREADD manipulation itself affects numerous spatially proximal voxels in the area underlying the injection site, rather than only affecting specific voxels. Therefore, the time-series data from the rsfMRI DREADD data in mice was extracted as a mean time-series from ROI voxels. To keep rsfMRI analyses as similar as possible across mouse and human rsfMRI datasets, we applied an identical approach of computing a mean time-series for the region. To further address the reviewer’s comment here, for the human data, if we compute H first in every voxel in region p32 and then average across voxels, the results remain statistically significant (<italic>F(5,104)</italic> = 7.54, <italic>p</italic> = 0.007), thus indicating that the primary inferences remain the same. We have now included this result in the revised manuscript.</p><p>“A similar sex-by-diagnosis interaction appeared when using another metric such as the intrinsic neural timescale (Watanbe, Rees and Masuda, 2019) (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) and when H was first calculated at each voxel and then averaged across voxels (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Another method question: why not fit PLS directly with the 2-column matrix (CF1 and CF2) directly, since PLS is capable of outputting a single explanatory component, instead of performing PCA first. They should be similar?</p></disp-quote><p>Our application of PCA to extract the shared component of CF1 and CF2 was based on the idea of taking the same approach taken in prior work on the operationalization of camouflaging, where we use PCA on CF1 and CF2 to compute the CF measure (Lai et al., 2017; Lai, Lombardo et al., 2019). We have now added this detail to the revised manuscript.</p><p>“This method was utilized in order to be consistent with prior work which computed the camouflaging metric in an identical fashion (Lai et al., 2017; 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Similarly (and maybe I'm not understanding something here), why not fit PLS or mass univariate over the entire cortex for camouflaging as well, as the authors did to find spatial specificity for the sex*diagnosis contrast, instead of only regressing in vMPFC specifically?</p></disp-quote><p>We specifically assessed the camouflaging correlation in vMPFC specifically given that there was a sex*diagnosis interaction result and because of prior work that also found vMPFC-camouflaging correlations (Lai, Lombardo et al., 2019). This is indicated in the following sentences in the Results:</p><p>“In prior task-fMRI work we found a similar sex-by-diagnosis interaction in vMPFC self-representation response and a female-specific brain-behavioral correlation with camouflaging ability (Lai et al., 2019). Given that adult autistic females engage more in camouflaging on-average (Lai et al., 2017; Hull et al., 2019 and Schuck, Flores and Fung, et al., 2019), we next asked whether vMPFC H would be related to camouflaging in a sex-specific manner.”</p><p>Therefore, this was a hypothesis-driven follow-up analysis driven by observations in prior work finding camouflaging correlations in vMPFC and thus, did not warrant whole-brain testing or PLS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Lastly, while I appreciate the ample reference to Gao et al., 2017, I suggest the authors check out Lombardi et al., 2017 as well, as they also look at how 1/f changes as a result of E:I shifts, but with a recurrent and interacting-EI spiking model that is arguably more similar to the model in this manuscript. However, their finding is in contrast to Gao et al. 2017, where 1/f flattens for increasing inhibition. This is worth referencing and noting in the discussions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing us to this paper. The paper is indeed of interest, as it shows with a simplified non-realistic neural model with discrete update dynamics that the 1/f slope of the PSD of avalanche activity is different when considering different percentages of inhibitory neurons. The limitations of Lombardi’s model in realism of neural dynamics do not allow us to relate their results directly to our findings. Also, the fact that they do not explicitly study variations in E:I parameters, but instead networks with different percentage of inhibitory neurons, does not provide us with the information we need for our study. We feel that for our work it would be more important to cite other papers (especially from Brunel, Wang and colleagues that profoundly influenced this field and our work) that show, using realistic models of neural dynamics, power spectra can be related directly to the frequency content of electrophysiological data. Interestingly, in those papers, Brunel and colleagues report effects that point in a different direction with respect to the results of Gao et al. This is one of the reasons that motivated us in the present study to reevaluate the results of the Gao et al. model with a recurrent network model.</p><p>To accommodate for the reviewer’s concerns, we improved introduction by adding the following references, including the Brunel and Wang paper as well as the Lombardi et al., paper, to the following sentence in Introduction:</p><p>“Models of neural networks have reported that the E:I ratio has profound effects on the spectral shape of electrophysiological activity (Brunel and Wang, 2033; Mazzoni et al., 2008 and Lombardi, Herrmann and de Arcangelis, 2017).”</p><p>In the Discussion, we added the following paragraph that we hope it will be useful for the reader, and motivate future work, regarding the interesting effects suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>“Results about the relationship between spectral shape and E:I balance obtained with our model of recurrent excitation and inhibition are largely compatible with those obtained with an earlier model of uncoupled excitation and inhibition (Gao, Peterson and Voytek, 2017). The uncoupled model predicts a linear increase of the slope value (i.e. flatter, less negative slopes) as E:I ratio increases. This is because in the uncoupled model changing the E:I ratio modifies only the ratio of the contribution to the LFP spectra of excitatory (faster time constant) and inhibitory (slower time constant) synaptic currents, leading to a linear relationship between slopes and E:I. In contrast, we found that the relationship between E:I and the spectral slope flattens out for high values of I. This, in our view, may in part arise from the fact that, as shown in studies of recurrent network models (Brunel and Wang, 2003), higher recurrent inhibition leads to higher peak frequency of γ oscillations (i.e. an increase of power at higher frequencies) thus partly counteracting the low-pass filtering effect of inhibitory currents in the uncoupled model. We plan to investigate in future studies how these opposing effects interact in a wider range of configurations and to use these results to gain a better understanding of the relationship between E:I ratio and LFP spectral shape.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is an impressive piece of work combining multi-level methods and different modalities using both mouse and human data that substantially enhances our understanding of E:I imbalance in autism. The authors demonstrate and extend the link between E:I balance and the Hurst component and 1/f slope in local field potentials and rsfMRI data using a biologically more plausible network model than prior work. They further establish the spatial distribution of autism-linked genes associated with excitation and androgen-sensitive genes that coincide with the sex-differential region associated with the H-component in the human rsfMRI data. Interestingly, this region also shows a sex-differential relationship to camouflaging behavior. This is an impressive set of analyses with elaborate and thorough methodological steps. Listed below are some minor comments that can help increase the clarity of the manuscript and interpretation of the results.</p><p>1) The authors start the Introduction with the sentence that E:I imbalance affects many disorders. This calls for at least a short mention in the discussion how findings are specific to autism.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now inserted some text in the Discussion relevant to this point.</p><p>“This work may also be of broader relevance for investigating sex-specific E:I imbalance that affects other early-onset neurodevelopmental disorders with a similar male-bias as autism (Rutter, Caspi and Moffitt, 2003). For instance, conditions like ADHD affect males more frequently than females and also show some similarities in affecting behavioral regulation and associated neural correlates (Chantiluke et al., 2015). Furthermore, gene sets associated with excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters are linked to hyperactivity/impulsivity severity in ADHD, suggesting that E:I-relevant mechanisms may be perturbed (Naaijen, et al., 2017). It will be important for future work to test how specific sex-specific E:I imbalance is to autism versus other related sex-biased neurodevelopmental disorders.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Introduction lacks a bit of a red line to my taste. It would be clearer to read if sub-paragraphs were linked to each other. The different sections make sense – however it is left to the reader to link them to each other. Given the complexity and many aspects touched on, I think the flow of the Introduction could still be improved a bit.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now edited the writing of the Introduction to make the paragraphs more streamlined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Could authors explain in more details what “in silico” refers to in this context? This might not be clear to a broad readership.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added “<italic>(i.e. computational model)</italic>” after the first instance of in silico in the manuscript.</p><p>“To achieve this aim, we first took a bottom-up approach by using in silico (i.e. computational) models of local neuronal microcircuitry to make predictions about how H and 1/f slope in local field potentials (LFP) and rsfMRI data may behave when there are underlying changes in E:I balance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) How was mean frame-wise displacement calculated? Power? Jenkinson?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a reference to Power et al., in order to show how FD was calculated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Table 3, could authors also report differences in symptom scores and camouflaging between autistic males and females.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now inserted statistics for comparisons between autistic males and females on camouflaging and symptom scores in Table 3 (in the column labeled Sex).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) What is the justification for the use of PLS on top? What additional information is revealed?</p></disp-quote><p>PLS was used as a multivariate alternative to contrast to mass-univariate testing. If effects are correlated across multiple brain regions, PLS will be able to identify such distributed systems-level effects that are multivariate in nature. The effects in the mass-univariate analysis that are subthreshold (potentially due to lower power for such subtle effects in a mass-univariate analysis framework) could be part of a more distributed neural system expressing the sex-by-diagnosis effect, especially given that many such regions are part of the DMN and other regions that show some level of overlap with the DHT-sensitive and ASD-excitatory gene map. Thus, PLS allows us to test and confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>“In contrast to mass univariate analysis, we also used partial least squares (PLS) analysis as a multivariate alternative to uncover distributed neural systems that express the sex-by-diagnosis interaction.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) A large part of the results is in mouse-data. The Introduction should thus also include a section introducing how E:I imbalance can be investigated in animal models. Right now, the Introduction refers solely to human participants, whereas the entire first Result section does not.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included more text in the Introduction to discuss how techniques like chemogenetics in animals can be used to study E:I mechanisms, and how such animal work is key in translationally being able to bridge the gap between species.</p><p>“Next, our in-silico predictions are then tested in-vivo with a combination of rsfMRI and experimental manipulations in mice that either increase neurophysiological excitation or that silence the local activity in the network. Chemogenetic (i.e. designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs; DREADD) or optogenetic manipulations are optimally suited to these purposes, owing to the possibility of enabling remote control of neuronal excitability with cell-type and regional specificity (Yizhar et al., 2011; Ferenczi et al., 2016). Manipulations of neuronal activity like these in animals are key for two reasons. First, they allow for experimental in-vivo confirmation of in-silico predictions. Second, such work is a key translational link across species (i.e. rodents to humans), given the common use of neuroimaging readouts from rsfMRI (Balsters et al., 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Given the results-first format, it should be pointed out briefly which dataset was used for which set of results. The first section should clearly state that this is done in the mouse-data for example.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now tried to include more text to address this point.</p><p>“Changes in H in BOLD after chemogenetic manipulation to enhance excitability of excitatory neurons in mice</p><p>All of the results thus far report results from our in-silico model of recurrent neuronal networks and their readouts as simulated LFP or BOLD data. The in-silico modeling of BOLD data suggests that if E:I ratio is increased via enhanced excitability of excitatory neurons, then H should decrease. To empirically test this prediction in-vivo, we measured rsfMRI BOLD signal in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice under conditions where a chemogenetic manipulation (hM3Dq DREADD) (Alexander et al., 2009) is used to enhance excitability of pyramidal neurons.”</p><p>“Autism-associated genes in excitatory neuronal cell types in the human brain are enriched for genes that are differentially expressed by androgen hormones</p><p>The in-silico and in-vivo animal model findings thus far suggest that excitation affects metrics computed on neural time-series data such as 1/f slope and H. Applied to the idea of sex-related heterogeneity in E:I imbalance in autism, these results make the prediction that excitatory neuronal cell types would be the central cell type affecting such neuroimaging phenotypes in a sex-specific manner. To test this hypothesis about sex-specific effects on excitatory neuronal cell types, we examined whether known autism-associated genes that affect excitatory neuronal cell types (Satterstrom et al., 2020; Velmeshev et al., 2019) are highly overlapping with differentially expressed genes in human neuronal stem cells when treated with a potent androgen hormone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT)(Lombardo et al., 2018; Quartier et al., 2018).”</p><p>“H is on-average reduced in adult autistic men but not women</p><p>We next move to application of this work to human rsfMRI data in autistic men and women.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9). The sex-differential results in humans are intriguing. However, when looking at Figure 5B, I wonder whether a gender-incoherent pattern is evident here? Could authors further discuss this?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out how the pattern looks like it might be similar to a gender-incoherence pattern. We have now amended the text to discuss how the effect could be compatible with an effect like gender incoherence. However, for stronger statements on this interpretation of the results, we would need to better understand how normative, population-level sex differences manifest in H and to better understand the normative ranges that H can take for each brain region, sex, and across age, socio-economic and socio-cultural factors (e.g., gender, race). This is something that future work with much larger normative, general population-based datasets could illuminate.</p><p>“The observed effect in vMPFC may also be consistent with a “gender-incoherence” pattern (i.e. towards reversal of typical sex differences in autism) (Bejerot et al., 2012). However, sex-specific normative ranges would need to be better established before interpreting effects in autism as being reversals of normative sex differences. More work with much larger general population-based datasets is needed to establish whether there are robust normative sex differences in H and to describe the normative ranges of H may take for each brain region, sex, and across age. Such work would also help with normative modelling (Bethlehem et al., 2018) approaches that would enable identification of which autistic individuals highly deviate from sex-specific norms.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, in line with this, I wonder whether authors could refine this part of the Discussion stating: &quot;Thus, one potential explanation for the male-specific reduction of H in vMPFC could have to do with early developmental and androgen-sensitive upregulation of genes that play central roles in excitatory neuron cell types, and thus ultimately affecting downstream E:I imbalance. Such effects may be sex-differential and thus less critical in human females, serving an important basis of sex-differential human brain development and explaining the sex-based heterogeneity and qualitative sex differences of autism neurobiology in human.&quot; Do authors refer to typical females here? The results look like TD females show a similar pattern to autistic males. So how do authors explain the differential pattern in TD females and autistic females.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now cleaned up the writing of this sentence to be more clear. Here we are simply referring to how androgen-dependent effects on gene expression within excitatory neurons in autism may be less critical in human females whom will not be exposed (on-average) to such high levels of androgens in early development.</p><p>“Such effects may be less critical in human females and may serve an important basis for sex-differential human brain development (Kaczkurkin, Raznahan and Satterthwaite, 2019). These effects may also help explain why qualitative sex differences emerge in autism (Lai et al., 2017; Bedford et al., 2019).”</p><p>Regarding the comparison of TD females to autistic males, we have refrained from making such cross-sex and cross-diagnostic comparisons because it is still not clear whether and how the range of normative variability in H can be defined in a sex-specific manner, in the absence of large-scale population-based dataset at this stage. The TD females vary more than TD males in region p32, and thus it may not be pertinent to compare autistic males to TD females given this difference in normative variability between sexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) I like the link to the camouflaging behavior. However, the question arises whether there is also a sex-differential link to core autistic symptoms such as for example repetitive behaviors that have also been shown to differ across autistic males and females?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now analyzed data for ADOS and ADI-R RRB scales but could not identify any effects that would represent a sex-differential effect.</p><p>“Beyond this hypothesis-driven comparison of the relationship between H and camouflaging in vMPFC, we also ran correlations with ADI-R, ADOS and AQ scores. ADOS social-communication (SC) was negatively correlated with vMPFC H in autistic females (r = -0.51, p = 0.008) indicating higher H with lower SC severity. This relationship was not present in autistic males (r = -0.04, p = 0.83). However, the difference between these correlations was not statistically significant (z = 1.70, p = 0.08). ADI-R subdomains, ADOS RRB, and AQ correlations were not statistically significant.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Could authors include information on the age range of autistic subjects (currently, I can't see the age range anywhere) and discuss the potential effect of age on their results from a neurodevelopmental perspective?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now inserted age ranges into the manuscript.</p><p>“Adult native English speakers (n=136, age range = 18-49 years) with normal/corrected-to-normal vision participated”</p><p>We have also inserted some text in the Discussion to talk about the effect of age.</p><p>“Similarly, future work should investigate how H may change over development. Prior work has shown that H and other related measures such as 1/f slope can change with normative and pathological aging in both rsfMRI and EEG data (Maxim et al., 2005; Wink et al., 2006 and Voytek et al 2015). Imperative to this work will be the establishment of age and sex-specific norms for H in much larger datasets. Age and sex-specific norms will enable more work to better uncover how these biomarkers may be affected in neurodevelopmental disorders or disorders relevant to neurodegeneration. Such work combined with normative modeling approaches (Bethlehem et al., 2018) may help uncover how experiential and environmental effects further affect such metrics.”</p><p><bold>References:</bold></p><p>Armbruster, B.
