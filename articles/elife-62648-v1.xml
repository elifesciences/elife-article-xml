HIV-1 develop antibody neutralization breadth during the natural course of the infection, often linked to chronic, high-level viremia. Despite significant efforts, vaccination strategies have been unable to induce similar neutralization breadth and the mechanisms underlying neutralizing antibody induction remain largely elusive. Broadly neutralizing antibody responses can also be found in individuals who control HIV to low and even undetectable plasma levels in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, suggesting that high antigen exposure is not a strict requirement for neutralization breadth. We therefore performed an analysis of paired heavy and light chain B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires in 12,591 HIV-1 envelope-specific single memory B-cells to determine alterations in the BCR immunoglobulin gene repertoire and B-cell clonal expansions that associate with neutralizing antibody breadth in 22 HIV controllers. We found that the frequency of genomic mutations in IGHV and IGLV was directly correlated with serum neutralization breadth. The repertoire of the most mutated antibodies was dominated by a small number of large clones with evolutionary signatures suggesting that these clones had reached peak affinity maturation. These data demonstrate that even in the setting of low plasma HIV antigenemia, similar to what a vaccine can potentially achieve, BCR selection for extended somatic hypermutation and clonal evolution can occur in some individuals suggesting that host-specific factors might be involved that could be targeted with future vaccine strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neutralizing antibodies</kwd><kwd>b-cell evolution</kwd><kwd>BCR repertoire</kwd><kwd>HIV infection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1146996</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seaman</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1066973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alter</surname><given-names>Galit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012802</institution-id><institution>Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Internal funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Juelg</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Extended somatic hypermutation and clonal evolution associated with antibody neutralization breath in HIV controllers with low plasma viral loads provide promise for HIV vaccine development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The induction of cross-reactive broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that can effectively neutralize a majority of circulating HIV-1 strains is a major goal of current HIV vaccine development, but no vaccine candidate to date has achieved this goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burton and Hangartner, 2016</xref>). During natural HIV-1 infection, development of neutralizing antibody responses is seen in about 10–30% of HIV-1-infected individuals but often requires years of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pilgrim et al., 1997</xref>). Specifically, high viremia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mikell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">CAPRISA002 Study Team et al., 2011</xref>) with rapid viral diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">NISC Comparative Sequencing Program et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">NISC Comparative Sequencing Program et al., 2013</xref>) along with infection-associated immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sather et al., 2009</xref>) have been associated with the evolution of antibody neutralization breadth. One specific feature that characterizes many bNAbs is the high mutation frequency in their variable domains, indicative of many cycles of somatic hypermutation (SHM) in immunoglobulin (Ig) variable-diversity-joining [V(D)J] gene segments, ultimately resulting in superior B-cell receptor-antigen affinity maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012</xref>). The requirement for repeated cycling through the germinal centers (GCs) to accumulate affinity and specificity enhancing mutations is a lengthy process and is reflected by the time required for bNAbs to be elicited in the presence of a constantly evolving virus. However, bNAbs with high potency and exquisite breadth against cross-clade viral isolates have also been isolated from HIV-infected individuals who spontaneously control HIV to low plasma levels in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (‘HIV controllers’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Walker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Simek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">González et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schoofs et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Freund et al., 2017</xref>), thus suggesting that neutralizing antibody breadth may be achievable in the absence of high levels of viremia and rapidly evolving viral diversity, a scenario that more likely can be accomplished with vaccination strategies. In these HIV controller individuals, evolution of neutralization breadth was linked to low but persistent HIV viral antigenemia in the setting of a unique inflammatory profile, while antigenic diversity was not a significant contributor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dugast et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, neutralizing antibody breadth may be achievable in the absence of high levels of viremia and rapidly evolving viral diversity, therefore suggesting a scenario that more likely can be accomplished with vaccination strategies. In this study, we selected 22 controllers who exhibited different levels of neutralization breadth (ranging from 0/11 to 11/11 of tier 2/3 viruses neutralized) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Freund et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dugast et al., 2017</xref>) to elucidate features of the HIV-specific antibody repertoire that are associated with neutralization breadth. We performed a natively paired heavy and light chain B-cell receptor repertoire analysis of HIV-1 envelope (Env)-specific memory B-cells (MBCs) using high-throughput single-cell sequencing to determine alterations in the BCR Ig gene repertoire and B-cell clonal expansions that track with neutralization breadth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study cohort characteristics</title><p>Twenty-two HIV-infected individuals, 4 female and 18 male, were included in this study. 11 participants were African American and 11 were of European descent.

Plasma samples were tested for neutralizing activity using a standard reference panel of tier 2 and 3 clade B Env pseudoviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2005</xref>). Six individuals neutralized &gt;90% of viruses at 50% inhibitory dose (ID50) titers above background, and were classified as top-neutralizer (TN), while seven individuals neutralized &lt;10% of the panel viruses and were classified as non-neutralizer (NN). The remaining individuals were considered intermediate neutralizer, exhibiting neutralization of 36–82% of the virus panel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). There was no statistically significant difference in age (mean 53 years; min 44, max 63), CD4 count (mean 726 cells/μl [SD 168]), HIV RNA levels (mean 961 copies/ml [SD 1645]), and time-off-ART (mean 17 years; min 4.5, max 30) between the TN and NN groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Of the seven IGHV gene families, IGHV1 was most commonly used in both NN and TN repertoires, consistent with prior reports that anti-HIV antibodies frequently use IGHV1 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Breden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gorny et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The top two most frequently used IGHV genes were IGHV1-69 and IGHV4-34 in both the TN and NN repertoires, followed by IGHV4-4 in the TN and IGHV1-24 and IGHV1-2 in the NN repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). For IGHD and IGHJ genes, no statistical significant differences were observed. The most frequently used heavy chain VDJ genes were IGHV1-69, IGHD3-22, IGHJ4 in NN and IGHV1-69, IGHD4-17, IGHJ4 in TN. Among IGLV and IGLJ genes, IGLKV3 and IGLKV3-20 dominated in both TN and NN repertoires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This is consistent with previously reported data showing the dominance of IGLKV3-20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jackson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We next compared the proportions of specific IGH/IGL pairs between TNs and NNs. IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20 combination followed by IGHV1-69/IGKV1-5 dominated in NN while IGHV4-4/IGLV6-57 followed by V1-69-2/LV1-51 were most frequently found in TNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Specifically the most frequent IGHV-IGHJ-IGLV-IGLJ combination in NN was IGHV1-69/IGHJ6/IGKV3-20/IGKJ5 and IGHV4-4/IGHJ6/IGLV6-57/IGLJ2 in TNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Overall, the frequencies of the top 3 IGHV/HJ-IGLV/LJ pairs differed significantly between NNs and TNs (Mann Whitney U-test, p&lt;0.05). We next were interested to determine if we could find sequences of known bNAbs as listed in the CATNAP database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yoon et al., 2015</xref>) and as summarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sok and Burton, 2018</xref>, using the same IGHV and IGLV gene segment usage and equal CDRH3 length as minimum criteria. Overall, very few sequences in our data matched known bNAb IGHV and IGLV gene pairs and of those none showed high levels of CDRH3 sequence similarity. No difference in these frequencies between TNs and NNs was observed. Only the V3 glycan antibody BG18 that had been identified previously in TN 622800 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Freund et al., 2017</xref>) was again detected in the BCR repertoire of this individual (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that V(D)J gene usage was similar overall between TNs and NNs, but the frequency and combination of IGH/IGL pairs differed between groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Characteristics of CDRs</title><p>Complementarity determining regions (CDRs) play critical roles in the binding of antibodies to antigens and unusually long CDRH3s have been described for some bNAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sok and Burton, 2018</xref>). The CDRH3/L3 length in TNs was between 3 and 37 aa and 5 and 17 aa, respectively, and 4 to 31 aa and 5 to 14 aa in the NNs, respectively. CDRH3 length distribution in TN sequences was significantly different to CDRH3 length distribution in NN sequences (p&lt;2.2e-16 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, significant differences in length were observed for CDRH2, CDRL1 (data not shown), and CDRL3 (p&lt;2.2e-16 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). There were no significant differences for CDRH1 and CDRL2. The mean CDRH3 lengths observed here are more consistent with what has been described in the CD4 binding site-specific bNAbs like VRC01 and 3BNC117, which have CDRH3 lengths of 14 and 12, respectively, while V2 and V3 glycan-specific bNAbs like PGDM1400 and PGT121 have substantially longer CDRH3 length with 34 and 26 aa, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sok and Burton, 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, CDRH3 length by itself is not a determining feature for neutralization potency and breadth but rather CDRH3-specific sequence characteristics that contribute to the superior binding activity of certain bNAbs. Other than for BG18, however, no CDRH3 sequences, that matched known bNAbs exactly, were indentified in our dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Rates of SHM in IGHV and IGLV</title><p>When we calculated the number of SHMs in IGHV, we noticed that the TN repertoires had significantly higher frequencies of nucleotide mutations compared to NN (mean ± SD: 54 ± 17 mutations for TN and 29 ± 8 mutations for NN, unpaired t-test, p&lt;0.05) with more than 65% of sequences showing mutation frequencies greater than 15% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When comparing the frequency of mutations in IGHV (TNs, NNs, and intermediate neutralizers) with the degree of serum neutralization breadth across the entire cohort, a direct correlation was observed (Spearman’s rho = 0.60, p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Similarly, SHM in IGLV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) was more frequent in TN than NN (mean ± SD: 35 ± 18 mutations for TN and 14 ± 5 mutations for NN, unpaired t-test, p&lt;0.05) with more than 50% of sequences showing mutation rates greater than 10%. Here as well, the frequencies of mutations in IGLV correlated with neutralization breadth (Spearman’s rho = 0.63, p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). We were next interested to determine whether the IGH and IGL V-J gene usage would differ between the more (with higher than 15% mutations in IGH, 10% mutations in IGL) and less (≤15% mutations in IGH, 10% mutations in IGL) mutated sequences. While including all sequences, independent of the mutation rates, there was no apparent difference in IGHV-J (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) or the IGLV-J combinations between NNs and TNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). For the sequences with higher than 15% mutations in IGHV, however, which occurred nearly exclusively in the TNs, the pattern was distinct, demonstrating a selection for fewer dominant V-J combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In particular HJ4/HV1-69-2, HJ6/HV4-4, HJ6/HV3-30.33, and HJ6/HV4-34 were significantly enriched in TN sequences with high mutation rates (p&lt;0.01, one-sided Fisher’s exact test followed by correction for multiple comparison using Benjamini-Hochberg method). The enrichment of HV4-34 usage (p&lt;0.001, one-sided Fisher’s exact test followed by correction for multiple comparison using Benjamini-Hochberg method), a feature of autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wardemann et al., 2003</xref>), in the TN sequences with high mutation rates, is consistent with a recent report that suggested that HIV infection induces a permissive state in which potentially autoreactive clones that would otherwise be eliminated can persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Roskin et al., 2020</xref>). A similar contraction to fewer dominant V-J combinations was also observed for sequences with higher than 10% mutations in IGLV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). The frequencies of the paired IGHV and IGLV genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) demonstrated a dominant pairing of the HV1-69-2 and HV3-30.33 with LV1-51, and HV4-4 with LV6-57 in TNs with &gt;15% heavy chain mutations. Assuming that the somatic IGHV mutation rates in B-cells correlate with the total exposure time in the GC environment, and in light of the fact that the TN and NN did not differ in age, time-off-ART, and viral loads, our data suggests that TNs were more permissive for extensive SHM of B-cell clones.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mutation characteristics of IGHV and IGLV genes and associations with neutralization breadth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The overall mutation frequencies in IGHV in top-neutralizers (TNs) versus non-neutralizers (NNs) are significantly different with mean number of mutations of 54 in TNs and 29 in NNs (unpaired t-test, p&lt;0.05).

The arc length of each segment denotes the normalized frequency at which each gene segment was identified. Rearrangement of a J gene with a V gene segment in a clonal immunoglobulin (Ig) sequence is represented by a ribbon (ribbons carry the color of the HV or LV family of the gene participating in the pairing). The width of the ribbons corresponds to the weighted frequency at which each particular HV-HJ or LV-LJ rearrangement was used in the respective MBC repertoire.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62648-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Clonal selection</title><p>To further assess the clonal nature of the BCR repertoire in TNs, we clustered sequences into clonal groups. Each unique clone is a cluster of sequences that meet the following criteria: (1) derived from the same individual; (2) share the same V and J gene segment annotations in heavy chain and light chain; (3) have equal CDRH3 length; and (4) junction regions share similarity by a defined sequence distance cutoff (see 'Materials and methods'). This clonal assignment identified 770 clones (mean number of sequences 7.4) and showed that larger sized clusters (dominant clones) consist of highly mutated sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To quantify the greater clonality of the highly mutated sequences, we used an unevenness measure, the Gini index. We selected individuals (subject IDs: 330183, 280008, 622800) for whom a total of more than 600 sequences were available. Sequences were divided into two sets, highly mutated (&gt;15% mutations) and less mutated (≤15% mutations) sequences. Each set of sequences was clustered into clones and the Gini index was calculated based on the clone size distributions. For all three subjects, the Gini index was greater in the highly mutated set (paired t-test, p&lt;0.04), thus supporting the observation that the BCR repertoire becomes more narrow with increasing mutation rates, suggesting the dominance of certain clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Clonality analysis.</title><p>A total number of 770 clones were obtained for top-neutralizers (TNs).

The sizes of the circles are scaled to the number of sequences in each clone (mean number of sequences 7.4); the colors represent mean number of mutations per clone. Dominant clones consist of highly mutated sequences. (B) Gini index (0 represents perfect equality and one perfect inequality) was calculated as an estimate of clonality for TNs for which a total of more than 600 sequences were obtained (subject IDs: 330183, 280008, 622800). Per each subject, sequences were divided into two sets as high mutated sequences (&gt;60 mutations) and low mutated sequences (≤60 mutations).

Selective dynamics have been estimated using ω: dN/dS, the ratio of nonsynonymous (amino acid replacement) and synonymous (silent) mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nielsen and Yang, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoehn et al., 2019</xref>). Low ω<sub>CDR</sub> values indicate fewer amino acid changes in CDRs than expected suggesting negative BCR selection to remove affinity-decreasing variants, while positive selection to introduce new affinity-increasing amino acid variants is associated with higher ω<sub>CDR</sub> values. When comparing TNs to NNs we found an overall trend toward fewer amino acid changes in the CDRs of TNs (maximum likelihood estimate of ω<sub>CDR</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) indicating stronger purifying selection. Furthermore, the average lineage tree lengths (﻿the total expected substitutions per codon site within an individual lineage phylogeny) was significantly higher in TNs compared to NNs (p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test) and correlated negatively with ω (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The largest lineage trees constructed in TNs and NNs are visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, respectively. These results are therefore consistent with prior observations that B-cell lineages shift toward negative selection over time as a general feature of affinity maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoehn et al., 2019</xref>) and suggest that the dominant clones in the TNs have reached a level, where the continuous accumulation of additional random amino acid changes would rather be detrimental and decrease affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clarke et al., 1985</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Overall, when comparing frequencies of either IGH or IGL genes between those individuals who developed antibody neutralization breadth compared to those who did not, the repertoire analysis did not reveal substantial differences. This is consistent with the findings from Scheepers et al. who analyzed the IGHV repertoires of bulk peripheral blood B-cells for 28 HIV-1 clade C infected South African women with different ranges of serum neutralization breadth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scheepers et al., 2015</xref>) and observed a wide range in the number of IGHV alleles in each individual but did not find significant differences in germline IGHV repertoires between individuals with or without bNAbs. When we however compared the repertoire of paired IGH/IGL sequences between both groups, clear differences in the hierarchy of IGHV/IGHJ/IGLV/IGLJ combinations were observed. Despite these distinguishing pattern, we did not observe an enrichment of known bNAb sequences in the TNs. In fact, we found very few sequences in our cohort that matched IGHV-IGLV gene combinations and/or CDRH3 -sequences of published Nabs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sok and Burton, 2018</xref>) with BG18 being the exception. Indeed, additional bNAbs, such as the CD4 binding site antibody 3BNC117, have been isolated from HIV controllers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scheid et al., 2011</xref>). The general absence of these or similar bNAb sequences in our data therefore suggests that the neutralization breadth observed in the TNs was either from single bNAbs with non-classical epitope specificities or due to multiple neutralizing antibodies targeting multiple different epitopes. This distinction necessitates the generation of antibodies from a large number of BCRs in the TNs for characterization of their neutralizing activities and such studies are planned in the future.</p><p>In addition to the composition of the BCR repertoire, that separated TNs from NNs, both groups were clearly distinguishable by the significantly higher rates of mutations in the VH and VL genes in the individuals with neutralizing antibody breadth. Our data in HIV-1 specific B-cells confirms findings recently reported by Roskin et al. in a bulk B-cell repertoire analysis, demonstrating that individuals with neutralizing antibody breadth have hundreds to thousands of antibody lineages with long CDRH3s and very high SHM frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Roskin et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the mutation frequency in our data correlated directly with the neutralization breadth consistent with the notion that high levels of SHM are generally necessary for neutralization breadth and potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Klein et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Initial interclonal and then intraclonal competition between B-cells during affinity maturation is well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kuraoka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tas et al., 2016</xref>), resulting in diverse repertoires. Indeed, we found that with increasing numbers of mutations in HV, fewer clones with less diverse HV-HJ combinations dominated, suggesting a process that allows these clones to mature and accumulate mutations. Since GCs select for affinity and not for neutralizing breadth and since evolving viruses, such as HIV-1, will continuously elicit novel immune responses from naive B-cells, strong effective selection normally occurs, so that antibodies specific to the contemporaneous virus have a sufficient advantage to outcompete any less-specific potential broad neutralizers before they take hold. Indeed, by focusing on the kinship relations among Ig gene segment recombinations within individual clones, we found evidence of natural selection in the NNs, with younger and less diverse clones continuously evolving, constantly exploring novel evolutionary space. Conversely, in TNs, this continuous evolution does not seem to occur, but rather specific evolutionary paths are pursued. One potential mechanism behind this observation is that neutralizers may generate massive bursts of clones that compete aggressively and prevent the evolution of lower affinity variants. Alternatively, the effects of immunodominance where B-cell specific to an epitopic site dominate B-cells that target other sites, as has been described in influenza infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angeletti et al., 2017</xref>), might not occur to the same degree in TNs as it might do in NNs. Indeed, a generalized deficiency of normal selection against B-cells expressing IgG with long CDRH3 regions and high SHM frequencies has been associated with the development of HIV neutralizing breadth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Roskin et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While the selection process might be suppressed in the TNs early on, to allow extended SHM with ongoing clonal evolution and increasing affinity, this process seems to revert during the later stages of antibody evolution when the benefit of additional amino acid changes decreases, and purifying selection becomes dominant and removes most non-synonymous mutations. Indeed, Yaari et al. demonstrated that early mutations in the trunk of B-cell clonal lineages from healthy subjects were consistent with positive selection pressure than more recent mutations in the canopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yaari et al., 2015</xref>) and a negative relationship between both signs of increased negative selection (low ωCDR values) and mean repertoire tree length have been reported across subjects of different age and sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoehn et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, Wu and Sheng et al. observed that the evolutionary rates of HIV-1 bNAb antibody lineages derived from different donors consistently decreased over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">NISC Comparative Sequencing Program et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sheng et al., 2016</xref>), also suggesting that SHM occurs at a faster rate during the early phase of lineage development while later on, a decrease in mutation rates may be a mechanism to protect immune memory.</p><p>Several potential mechanisms for differences in BCR evolution and selection can be envisioned in TNs versus NNs. B-cells with the highest affinity receptors tend to acquire the most antigen from the follicular dendritic cell network and present the highest density of cognate peptides to CD4+ T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which respond with survival signals to the B-cell. While some studies have suggested that the quality and quantity of GC Env-specific Tfh cells are associated with the expansion of Env-specific B-cells and broader antibody neutralization activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamamoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Moody et al., 2016</xref>), others have failed to find a correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Roskin et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, Cirelli et al. recently demonstrated that slow delivery of antigen resulted in enhanced autologous tier 2 nAb development in non-human primates by inducing higher frequencies of total and Env-specific GC-Tfh cells accompanied by larger and more diverse Env-specific B-cell lineages. In this model, evolving B-cells with BCRs able to bind to a large array of Env variants, are likely able to capture more antigen, present more effectively to Tfh cells, and thus gain higher survival signals. Conversely, B-cells able to bind tightly, but to only a narrow range of Env variants, will only capture a fraction of arrayed antigens and receive less help. Thus, high affinity, narrow specificities may gain less support compared to lower -affinity, broad -binders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Boer and Perelson, 2017</xref>). Thus, while antigenemia is lower in controllers, the low-level titration of antigen into the system may create a higher bar of selection for evolving B-cell clones. Along with this high degree of competition, B-cell lineages in HIV controllers able to bind many variants may capture larger amounts of antigen and therefore gain enhanced signals from Tfh cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fukazawa et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, HIV controllers with low-level viremia also exhibit unique inflammatory profiles, and sustained GC activity, collectively also potentially providing an optimal environment for B- cell development.</p><p>In summary, development of B-cell lineages with superior neutralization breadth in HIV controllers is linked to selected clonal evolution, therefore allowing B-cells to accumulate mutations and to diversify without the constant risk of clonal interference. Immunization strategies that facilitate this process by providing continuous, diverse, and subtherapeutically dosed antigen, in the setting of target inflammatory signals, could potentially accelerate the development of broad nAb responses in vaccinees.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to compare the distributions between TN and NN repertoires.</p><p>Mean number of mutations between TN and NN were compared using unpaired two-samples t-test. All correlations were performed using Spearman’s correlation. Visualizations were performed using R package ggplot2 (version 3.3.0). The flow graph of IGHV/IGHJ/IGLV/IGLJ combinations were plotted using ggalluvial extension of ggplot2. Circos plots were generated using R package circlize (version 0.4.9) <italic>chordDiagram</italic> function. The layout for clonal network visualization was arranged using R package packcircles (version 0.3.3).</p><p>Clones were defined using DefineClones tool of the Immcantation analysis framework (50). Clones consist of sequences that meet the following criteria: (1) come from the same individual; (2) share the same IGHV and IGHJ gene segment annotations; (3) have equal CDRH3 length; and (4) share sequence similarity calculated by nucleotide Hamming distance threshold of 0.16. Clonal groups were then split that have differing IGLV and IGLJ gene segment annotations.</p><p>The clonality measure was estimated using Gini index and calculated using R package bcRep (version 1.3.6) <italic>clones.giniIndex</italic> function.</p><p>Lineage trees were constructed using IgPhyML (version 1.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stern et al., 2014</xref>). The HLP19 model was used to estimate maximum likelihood tree topologies. Clonal selection was estimated using ω, also called dN/dS, or the ratio of nonsynonymous (amino acid replacement) and synonymous (silent) mutation rates. A value of ω≈1 indicates totally neutral amino acid evolution, ω&lt;1 negative selection, and ω&gt;1 diversifying selection. The topology analyses were carried out using Alakazam (version 1.0.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>) and the lineage trees were visualized using R ggtree (version 2.2.1).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the participants of the Ragon HIV controller studies from whom these samples were obtained, and the staff involved in all the sample collection and processing.

They identified six individuals whose plasmas displayed broad neutralizing activities (top neutralizers, TN) and seven with narrow/no neutralizing activities (non-neutralizers, NN). They then isolated Env-specific class-switched memory B cells from these individuals and sequenced their IGH and IGL genes. This allowed them to determine the frequencies of specific IGH and IGL gene segments (including germline genes of known broadly neutralizing antibodies) and to compare these frequencies between TNs and NNs. Their analysis clearly shows that the donor antibodies' levels of somatic hypermutation correlate with serum neutralization breadth. The authors propose that in the context of prolonged, but relatively low HIV replication, B cells expressing BCRs capable of binding a large array of Env variants may gain more T help than B cells expressing BCRs that target a narrower range of Env variants. The former BCRs could be those from which broadly neutralizing antibodies are derived from, while the later ones could be those that give rise to neutralizing antibodies with narrow breadth. In the context of a continuously evolving virus, this proposal makes sense. The data presented in this manuscript does provide a valuable view into the natural development of neutralization breadth. However, the reviewers have substantial concerns, as outlined below, that they invite you to address in a revised manuscript. While they appreciate the valuable dataset presented by the authors, they believe that the analysis could be more thorough, and that further exploration of neutralizing Abs from the TN would strengthen the study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors report that the composition of the BCR repertoire alone was insufficient to identify the TNs, although higher rates of somatic mutations were observed in the TNs than NNs. It is questionable whether they can draw this conclusion from the way the sequence analysis was performed. Although it is mentioned (first line in the Discussion) that 'paired' IGH and IGL sequences were compared, what is discussed throughout the manuscript are frequencies of either IGH or IGL but not frequencies of specific IGH/IGL pairs. For example, they mention that 'certain genes that are distinctive for known bNAbs, like VH1-2 (and they discuss VRC01-class antibodies)…..'. However, VRC01-class antibodies specifically utilize the *02 VH1-2 allele. Also, VRC01-class antibodies are formed by the pairing of VH1-2*02 with LCs expressing 5 amino acid long CDRL3 domains. We expect that most human VH1-2*02 HCs are paired with LCs expressing &gt;5 amino acid long CDRL3s. They also mention that the CDRH3 lengths were not different between the IGHs found in the TN and NN (and they discuss that certain bnAbs that bind the apex of the trimer on the N332 site). On its own, the length of the CDRH3 loop is unlikely to be a good predictor of antibody neutralizing potency or breadth, because specific amino acids sequences CDRH3 loops of particular lengths are linked with the mechanism by which some anti-apex or anti-N332 antibodies act. The authors could determine the relative frequencies of VRC01-class BCRs from the existing data. Similarly, they could mine their data to identify particular CDRH3 sequences. This would be the minimal they could do prove their point, which would actually necessitate the generation of antibodies from particular BCRs and the characterization of their neutralizing activities.</p><p>2. It is unclear whether the broad neutralizing activities in the samples examined here targeted a single or multiple envelope epitopes. The authors should explicitly discuss this point in the Discussion section.</p><p>3. Several parts of the discussion hard to read and confusing. This reflects the somewhat confusing and contradictory findings of high levels of SHM, but contracting evolution that is shown in Figure 3. The discussion of this could do with some tightening. Parts are speculative and wordy, e.g., the first paragraph of page 8 could be shortened.</p><p>4. It is unclear whether a cocktail of the five different Envs listed in the Methods section was used to sort B cells, and if the same Envs were used in every case or not.</p><p>5. The manuscript reports that the difference in CDRH3 length distribution (Figure 1F) is not statistically significant (they do not report the exact p value produced by the Wilcoxon rank sum test). However, the difference appears substantial in Figure 1F. One wonders whether a different statistical test or looking at subpopulations might give a statistically-significant result. Also, in Figure 1F, can the authors comment on the very high frequency of sequences in NN with CDRH3 lengths of 9 and those of 16 on the TN? Are these sequence artefacts, perhaps of oversampled clones in certain donors?</p><p>6. The authors state that sequence data will be deposited in GEO. The processed sequences (used to make Figure 2, etc.) should be made available, not just the raw NGS sequencing.</p><p>7. There is some inconsistency with the V gene names – &quot;VH1-2&quot; vs. &quot;HV4-59&quot;.</p><p>8. The proposal in the Introduction that neutralizing breadth may be achievable in the absence of high levels of viremia is not entirely new, as broadly neutralizing antibodies have been isolated from elite controllers. For instance, Kwong and colleagues reported on the presence of broadly neutralizing antibody responses in a cohort of long-term non-progressors (Gonzalez et al. PLOS ONE 2018) and the Bjorkman group reported on the isolation of a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody from a 'controller' (Schoofs et al. Immunity 2019).</p><p>9. Page 4 – The authors discuss the varying Ig subclass distributions and suggest for example that the higher percentage of IgG3 in NN versus TN might suggest a higher proportion of more recently induced MBCs in the NNs. These differences are not very convincing, if anything they are driven by a single data point, and we suggest removing related discussion.</p><p>10. Figure 1F – Can the authors comment on the very high frequency of sequences in NN with CDRH3 lengths of 9 and those of 16 on the TN. Are these sequence artefacts, perhaps of oversampled clones in certain donors?</p><p>11. Page 5 – could the authors translate frequency of nucleotide mutations into an approximate % SHM for easy comparison to other studies particularly of bNAbs. How close are these mutation counts of &gt;60 to the levels of SHM we associate with neutralization breadth?</p><p>12. Figure 2 – In both panels A (IGHV) and C (IGLV), while the NNs largely cluster towards the left (with low numbers of mutations), there are a cluster of NN sequences with higher numbers of mutations (~80 for IGHV and 50 for IGLV). Are these sequences from specific donors? What, if anything, distinguishes them from the other sequences?</p><p>13. Page 6 – the last statement that the first paragraph seems somehow circular – &quot;Assuming that the somatic IGHV mutation rates in B cells correlate with the total exposure time in the GC environment, and in light of the fact that the TN and NN did not differ in age, time-off-ART and viral loads, our data suggests that in the TNs, B-cell clones were selected for extensive SHM.&quot; How would B cell clones be selected FOR extensive SHM?</p><p>14.

In the Results section, at the end of clonal selection section (page 7), the discussion of &quot;maximum affinity maturation&quot; does not seem to reckon with the continuous change in the Env antigen, which generally manages to escape antibody pressure.</p><p>18.

For the latter, we identified 3 unique clones utilizing IGHV1-2/IGKV3-20 genes, however these antibodies had 8-9 aa long CDRL3 and no sequence similarity for CDRH3. We screened for all neutralizing antibodies listed in the comprehensive review by Sok and Burton, Nat Immunology 2018 and also compared our sequences to Nabs that are listed in the CATNAP database.</p><p>We found very few sequences that match IGHV-IGLV genes with known bNAbs in either TN or NNs and overall there was no difference (Supplementary file 3). Beside the V3 glycan antibody BG18, that had previously been identified in one of our TNs (622800), we did not find any sequences that matched the exact CDR3-sequences of known bNAbs. However, these results are not surprising given that few of the TN subjects exhibited classic epitope-specific reactivity. Specifically, 22 controllers were profiled against a panel of epitope specific knock out variants in collaboration with Lynn Morris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) (Approach described in PMID: 24204277, PMID: 29950423). 5 TN, 6 MN, and 2 NN were profiled. Among the TN, none possessed class CD4-bs neutralizing antibodies. 622800 possessed PGT128-like response (likely from BG18). Conversely, 3 of the MN possessed CD4bs antibodies. Thus, not unexpectedly, we were not able to identify an enrichment of known bNAb sequences in our cohort.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62648-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Conversely, it is important to note that BG18 and 3BNC117 were isolated from controllers, supporting our findings that extended SHM and affinity maturation occurs in these unusual individuals, and interestingly leads to the evolution of unique clonal lineages that give rise to potent broadly neutralizing antibodies – even in the absence of substantial antigenemia.Finally, we agree 100% with the reviewer that looking at CDR3 length alone is not an adequate predictor of neutralization capacity. We have made this explicitly clear in the text. However, for simple descriptive reasons we still compared CDR length between TN and NN for completeness. However, instead of comparing length means, we deployed a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to describe length distributions in the groups. Indeed, using this approach, and as suspected by the reviewers, the 2 groups had significantly different CDR lengths.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

All anticoagulants can cause some level of cell stress/toxicity of TZM.bl cells at low plasma dilutions. While serum is always preferred for measuring neutralizing antibodies in the TZM.bl assay to avoid this issue, plasma samples are also acceptable when proper controls are in place to account for any non-specific activity, which may also vary between individual samples. The use of a 3-fold cut-off for determining positive responses is actually a standard practice in the field. The validation criteria for the TZM.bl assay outline that titers within a 3-fold range can be considered equivalent (Sarzotti-Kelsoe, M. et al., 2014, J. Immunol. Methods, 409: 131-146). We have referenced this paper in the methods description. Thus, it is critical that a stringent cut-off (i.e. &gt; 3-fold difference in ID50 titers) is utilized for establishing positivity criteria when comparing neutralization responses against HIV-1 pseudovirus strains versus non-specific background observed against non-HIV negative control viruses.</p></body></sub-article></article>
