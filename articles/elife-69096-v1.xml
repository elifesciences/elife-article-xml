oligomeric ring relative to the <italic>a</italic>-subunit. Recent studies suggest that in each step of the rotation, key glutamic acid residues in different <italic>c</italic>-subunits contribute to proton release to and proton uptake from the <italic>a</italic>-subunit. However, no studies have demonstrated cooperativity among <italic>c</italic>-subunits toward F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATP synthase activity. Here, we addressed this using <italic>Bacillus</italic> PS3 ATP synthase harboring a <italic>c</italic>-ring with various combinations of wild-type and <italic>c</italic>E56D, enabled by genetically fused single-chain <italic>c</italic>-ring. ATP synthesis and proton pump activities were decreased by a single <italic>c</italic>E56D mutation and further decreased by double <italic>c</italic>E56D mutations. Moreover, activity further decreased as the two mutation sites were separated, indicating cooperation among <italic>c</italic>-subunits. Similar results were obtained for proton transfer-coupled molecular simulations. The simulations revealed that prolonged proton uptake in mutated <italic>c</italic>-subunits is shared between two <italic>c</italic>-subunits, explaining the cooperation observed in biochemical assays.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells need to be able to store and transfer energy to fuel their various activities. To do this, they produce a small molecule called ATP to carry the energy, which is then released when the ATP is broken down. An enzyme found in plants, animals and bacteria, called F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> ATP synthase, can both create and use ATP. When it does this, protons, or positive hydrogen ions, are transported across cellular boundaries called membranes.</p><p>The region of the enzyme that is responsible for pumping the protons contains different parts known as the <italic>c</italic>-ring and the <italic>a</italic>-subunit. The movement of protons drives the <italic>c</italic>-ring to rotate relative to the <italic>a</italic>-subunit, which leads to producing ATP. Previous research using simulations and the protein structures found there are two or three neighbouring amino acids in the <italic>c</italic>-ring that face the <italic>a</italic>-subunit, suggesting that these amino acids act together to drive the rotation.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, Mitome et al. mutated these amino acids to examine the effect on the enzyme’s ability to produce ATP. A single mutation reduced the production of ATP, which decreased even further with mutations in two of the amino acids. The extent of this decrease depended on the distance between the two mutations in the <italic>c</italic>-ring. Simulations of these changes also found similar results. This indicates there is coordination between different parts of the <italic>c</italic>-ring to increase the rate of ATP production.</p><p>This study offers new insights into the molecular processes controlling ATP synthesis and confirms previous theoretical research. This will interest specialists in bioenergetics because it addresses a fundamental biological question with broad impact.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>FoF1-ATP synthase</kwd><kwd>single-chain c-ring</kwd><kwd>proton uptake</kwd><kwd>molecular simulations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17K07922</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitome</surname><given-names>Noriyo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H02577</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitome</surname><given-names>Noriyo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Network Joint Research Center for Materials and Devices</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitome</surname><given-names>Noriyo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical analysis on hetero-mutated <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub> subunits ring and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the cooperation among <italic>c</italic>-subunits of F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATP synthase in rotation-coupled proton translocation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATP synthase (F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>) is a ubiquitous enzyme that synthesizes or hydrolyzes ATP coupled with proton translocation at the inner mitochondrial membrane, chloroplast thylakoid membrane, and bacterial plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boyer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Walker, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>). F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> synthesizes ATP via rotation of the central rotor driven by the proton motive force across the membrane. The enzyme comprises two rotary motors that share the rotor, that is, the water soluble F<sub>1</sub>, which has catalytic sites for ATP synthesis/hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Noji et al., 2017</xref>), and the membrane-embedded F<sub>o</sub>, which mediates proton translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kühlbrandt, 2019</xref>). The F<sub>o</sub> motor consists of a <italic>c</italic> oligomer ring (<italic>c</italic>-ring), which serves as the rotor, and the <italic>ab</italic><sub>2</sub> stator portion located on the <italic>c</italic>-ring periphery. Downgradient proton translocation through F<sub>o</sub> drives rotation of the central rotor composed of a <italic>c</italic>-ring and γε subunits, thereby inducing conformational changes in F<sub>1</sub> that result in ATP synthesis. Conversely, ATP hydrolysis in F<sub>1</sub> induces reverse rotation of the rotor, which forces F<sub>o</sub> to pump protons in the reverse direction.</p><p>The <italic>c</italic>-ring is composed of 8–17 <italic>c</italic>-subunits depending on the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Watt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Stock et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mitome et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Meier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Matthies et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Vollmar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pogoryelov et al., 2009</xref>). F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> from thermophilic <italic>Bacillus</italic> PS3 and yeast mitochondrial F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> contain 10 <italic>c</italic>-subunits in the <italic>c</italic>-ring, which is designated the <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub>-ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Stock et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mitome et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Symersky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The F<sub>o</sub><italic>-c</italic> subunit harbors an essential proton-binding carboxyl group (<italic>c</italic>-Glu; <italic>c</italic>E56 in <italic>Bacillus</italic> PS3, <italic>c</italic>E59 in yeast mitochondria) located near the center of the membrane-embedded region; this group functions as the proton carrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Protonation in the Glu allows the <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub>-ring to bind a proton, whereas proton release leads to Glu deprotonation. Accordingly, bacterial F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> activity is significantly decreased when the corresponding key residue is modified by the inhibitor <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hermolin and Fillingame, 1989</xref>) or mutated to other amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dmitriev et al., 1995</xref>), and <italic>Bacillus</italic> PS3 F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> carrying a single <italic>c</italic>E56Q mutation in the <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub>-ring does not catalyze ATP-driven proton pumping or ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mitome et al., 2004</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic picture of the <italic>a</italic>-subunit and <italic>c</italic>-ring of F<sub>o</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The <italic>ac</italic><sub>10</sub> part of the F<sub>o</sub> region is depicted as a ribbon diagram.

Recent cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structural analyses of F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> at near-atomic resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allegretti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>) have revealed two long tilted parallel α-helices in the <italic>a</italic>-subunit at the interface with the <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub>-ring. An essential Arg residue (<italic>a</italic>R169 in <italic>Bacillus</italic> PS3, <italic>a</italic>R176 in yeast mitochondria) at the middle of the long parallel helices plays a critical role in separating the two half-channels by preventing proton leakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mitome et al., 2010</xref>), and in the half-channels, two highly conserved Glu residues (<italic>a</italic>E223 and <italic>a</italic>E162 in yeast mitochondria) are regarded as proton-relaying sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Srivastava et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Since the essential Arg (<italic>a</italic>-Arg) localizes near <italic>c</italic>-Glu in the <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub>-ring, the attractive interaction between <italic>a</italic>-Arg and deprotonated <italic>c</italic>-Glu is hypothesized to also contribute to F<sub>o</sub> rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Vik and Antonio, 1994</xref>).</p><p>In the F<sub>o</sub> rotation models proposed based on experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Vik and Antonio, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Elston et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kubo et al., 2020</xref>), the <italic>c-</italic>subunits facing the <italic>a</italic>-subunit perform three functions (proton release, electrostatic interaction with <italic>a</italic>-Arg, and proton uptake) depending on their positions relative to the <italic>a</italic>-subunit. A high-resolution structure analysis of yeast mitochondrial F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> showed four of the 10 <italic>c</italic>-subunits to be facing the <italic>a</italic>-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Srivastava et al., 2018</xref>). Three key residues, that is, <italic>a</italic>Glu162, <italic>a</italic>R173, and <italic>a</italic>Glu223, localize between the <italic>c</italic>-Glu residues of the four <italic>c</italic>-subunits, suggesting that the <italic>c</italic>-Glu residues of adjacent <italic>c</italic>-subunits could cooperate through the <italic>a</italic>-subunit residues. A more recent theoretical study using a hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics (MC/MD) simulation based on a high-resolution structure showed that there can be two or three deprotonated <italic>c</italic>-Glu residues facing the <italic>a</italic>-subunit concurrently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kubo et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests that the waiting time for protonation of <italic>c</italic>-subunits is shared among two or three <italic>c</italic>-subunits. However, the relationship between a shared deprotonation time among multiple <italic>c</italic>-subunits and their cooperation in proton transport remain to be characterized.</p><p>To directly investigate the cooperation among the <italic>c</italic>-subunits in the <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub>-ring, we used a genetically fused single-chain <italic>c</italic>-ring and analyzed the function of <italic>Bacillus</italic> PS3 F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> carrying hetero <italic>c</italic>E56D mutations. Biochemical assays showed that the ATP synthesis activity was reduced, but not completely inhibited, by a single <italic>c</italic>E56D mutation, and that it was further reduced by double <italic>c</italic>E56D mutations. Importantly, across all five double mutants, the activity tended to decrease further as the distance between the two mutation sites increased. To clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms, we performed proton transfer-coupled MD simulations of F<sub>o</sub>, in which the mutations were mimicked, reproducing the characteristics of the biochemical experiment. From the analysis of the simulation trajectories, we found that prolonged duration times for proton uptake in the two mutated <italic>c</italic>-subunits can be shared. As the distance between the two mutation sites increases, the degree of time-sharing decreases. Taken together, these results reveal the functional coupling between neighboring <italic>c</italic>-subunits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Biochemical assays using F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>s with a fused <italic>c</italic>-ring harboring hetero mutations</title><p>To investigate potential cooperation among the <italic>c</italic>-subunits in the <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub>-ring rotation driven by proton translocation, we generated F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> mutants harboring a hetero-mutated <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub>-ring from thermophilic <italic>Bacillus</italic> PS3.

The rotational velocity of mutant “e” is almost two times slower than that of the WT. The rotational velocities of double mutants tend to decrease as the distance between the mutated chains increases. Thus, we were able to capture the characteristics of the experimental results in our simulations qualitatively, but not quantitatively.</p><p>We then evaluated the molecular processes for the simulation. Each <italic>c</italic>E59 (or <italic>c</italic>E59D) is protonated when the corresponding <italic>c</italic>-subunit is far from the <italic>a</italic>-subunit. This is regarded as the resting state of <italic>c</italic>E59 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). As counterclockwise rotation occurs, the <italic>c</italic>-subunit approaches the half-channel of the <italic>a</italic>-subunit, which is connected to the matrix (the matrix half-channel). When <italic>c</italic>E59 comes close to <italic>a</italic>E162, which is the relaying site to the matrix half-channel, proton transfer from <italic>c</italic>E59 to <italic>a</italic>E162 occurs via the Monte Carlo step. Depending on the transfer efficiency, several Monte Carlo steps may be required to achieve proton release from <italic>c</italic>E59. We define the time from the first trial of the <italic>c</italic>E59-to-<italic>a</italic>E162 proton transfer to the success of transfer as “the duration for proton release” (indicated in pink in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Once <italic>c</italic>E59 is deprotonated, the corresponding <italic>c</italic>-subunit can rotate counterclockwise further into the <italic>a</italic>-subunit facing region. After some rotation, the <italic>c</italic>-subunit approaches the other half-channel connected to the IMS (the IMS half-channel). When <italic>c</italic>E59 comes close to <italic>a</italic>E223, which is the relaying site for the IMS channel, <italic>c</italic>E59 attempts to take up a new proton from <italic>a</italic>E223 via the Monte Carlo step. We define the time from the success of proton release to the arrival at the rotation angle for proton uptake as “the duration for the deprotonated rotation” (indicated in green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Again, several Monte Carlo steps may be required to achieve this proton uptake. We define the time from the arrival at the proton uptake angle to success of proton uptake as the “the duration for proton uptake” (blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Then, the <italic>c</italic>-subunit returns to the resting state. Thus, the entire time could be divided into three stages: stage 1, the duration for proton release; stage 2, the duration for deprotonated rotation; and stage 3, the duration for proton uptake, in addition to the resting time. Note that these durations are defined for each <italic>c</italic>-subunit and that the durations in one <italic>c</italic>-subunit overlap with durations in other <italic>c</italic>-subunits. For each mutant and for the WT, for each of the 10 <italic>c</italic>-subunits, we analyzed these three durations.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Analysis of the molecular simulations.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic graph of duration times.

The average durations for stages 1, 2, and 3 were approximately 500, 1100, and 200 MD frames, respectively. As expected, there were no significant differences in the durations among the 10 <italic>c-</italic>subunits.</p><p>Next, we performed the same analysis using the single mutant “e” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d and e</xref>). We found that the mutation in the <italic>c</italic>(e)-subunit clearly affects the duration for this subunit; stages 1 and 2 did not differ much from those in the WT, whereas the duration of stage three was much longer than that in the WT, since <italic>c</italic>E59D has a lower rate of proton transfer, and since the pKa value of <italic>c</italic>E59D is lower than that of <italic>c</italic>E59. The increased duration of stage two in the <italic>c</italic>(g)-subunit, and that of stage three in the <italic>c</italic>(h)- and <italic>c</italic>(i)-subunits, were caused by the delay in proton uptake of the <italic>c</italic>(e)-subunit. Because the <italic>c</italic>(e)-subunit scarcely received protons from the IMS channel, and because the <italic>c</italic>(e)-subunit often stopped around the IMS channel, the <italic>c</italic>(g)-subunit can rarely overcome the <italic>a</italic>-Arg barrier, thus increasing the duration of stage two in the <italic>c</italic>(g)-subunit. Similarly, the <italic>c</italic>(h)- and <italic>c</italic>(i)-subunits spend most of their time in the membrane and are unlikely to pass a proton to the <italic>a</italic>-subunit, but they approach the matrix channel momentarily in fluctuations and try to release a proton to the <italic>a</italic>-subunit. However, the acceptance ratio is so small that the duration of stage three increased.</p><p>We then analyzed double mutants. For the “ef” mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f and g</xref>), similarly to that for the “e” mutant, the <italic>c</italic>E59D mutation in the <italic>c</italic>(e)-subunit prolongs the duration for proton uptake. Additionally, mutation in the <italic>c</italic>(f)-subunit also prolongs the duration for proton uptake. Interestingly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, these prolonged durations in <italic>c</italic>(e)- and <italic>c</italic>(f)-subunits are shared. Thus, by overlapping the delayed steps, the overall slowdown in the “ef” double-mutant system is lower than that if the effects of the two mutations were independent. In other words, sharing the delayed times of multiple subunits reduces the overall delay. In comparison, we examined the durations for the “ej” double-mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>).</p><p>As expected, mutations in the <italic>c</italic>(e)- and <italic>c</italic>(j)-subunits slow proton uptake in these subunits, although the durations are not shared. Therefore, we expect that there is no coupling between the <italic>c</italic>(e)- and <italic>c</italic>(j)-subunit mutations resulting in additive effects of the two mutations.</p><p>In summary, coarse-grained MD simulations qualitatively reproduced the effects of the single and double mutants found in biochemical assays and provided molecular interpretations of the coupling between two mutations. When the two mutations are in distant subunits of the <italic>c</italic>-ring, the effects of the two mutations are additive. In contrast, two mutations in neighboring subunits can result in overlapping of delays by the two mutations, leading to reduced effects of the two mutations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we determined whether <italic>c</italic>-subunits function in a cooperative manner for the rotation of the F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub>-ring and assessed the mechanistic role of <italic>c</italic>-Glu (<italic>c</italic>E56) in this cooperation. We have demonstrated that the degree of cooperation between two <italic>c</italic>-subunits depends on the distance between the <italic>c</italic>E56D hetero-mutations at the proton-carrying site. The activity of F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> was significantly decreased, but not completely abolished, by a single <italic>c</italic>E56D mutation. This activity was further decreased by the second <italic>c</italic>E56D mutation; moreover, the activity was high when the two mutations were introduced into nearby <italic>c</italic>-subunits, and the activity decreased as the distance between the two mutations increased. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study providing unambiguous evidence for the coupling between two <italic>c</italic>-subunits. Molecular simulations reproduced the major features of biochemical experiments on single and double mutants and further revealed the molecular mechanisms of the coupling. Sharing of the prolonged durations by mutations in neighboring <italic>c</italic>-subunits leads to coupling.</p><p>When the <italic>c</italic>E56D substitution was introduced in one of the <italic>c</italic>-subunits, ATP synthesis activity decreased substantially. In <italic>E. coli</italic> F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>, ATP-driven proton pump activity was reported to be decreased after substitution of the conserved <italic>c</italic>Asp61 residue with Glu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Miller et al., 1990</xref>). Here, after <italic>c</italic>E56D substitution, we detected partial retention of not only proton pump activity but also of ATP synthesis activity. In contrast, <italic>c</italic>E56Q substitution in one of the <italic>c</italic>-subunits was found to eliminate ATP synthesis activity, ATP-driven proton pump activity, and DCCD-sensitive ATP hydrolysis activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mitome et al., 2004</xref>). In this study, ATP synthesis activity and ATP-driven proton pump activity were not completely lost when the carboxyl group of Glu was replaced with that of Asp. A comparison of this result with the <italic>c</italic>E56Q substitution results suggested that the presence of a carboxyl group capable of undergoing protonation and deprotonation is critical for rotation in the ATP synthesis direction coupled with proton transfer, and for the proton-transfer-coupled rotation induced by ATP hydrolysis. As changing the Glu side chain to an Asp side chain decreased activity, we concluded that subtle structural differences in the proton-binding site caused by the one-methylene-group difference in the sidechain length, together with the change in pKa, slowed the elementary process required for driving rotation.</p><p>In the F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>s, carrying the <italic>c</italic>E56D mutation in two <italic>c</italic>-subunits, ATP synthase activity was high when the two introduced Asp residues were close to each other, and the activity decreased as the distance between the two mutations increased. If the kinetic bottleneck in the <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub>-ring rotation was only in one step of one <italic>c</italic>-subunit, the same activity would appear among double mutations with different relative separations. Alternatively, even if the <italic>c</italic>-subunit plays multiple roles, if each role works independently, the same activity would be obtained, irrespective of the mutational position. However, the experimental results showed that the activity was decreased when the two mutations were introduced farther apart. Thus, the data unambiguously indicate that the kinetic bottleneck in the <italic>c</italic>-ring rotation contains multiple <italic>c</italic>-subunits.</p><p>According to previously proposed models, proton release at <italic>c</italic>-Glu, electrostatic interaction between <italic>a</italic>-Arg and <italic>c</italic>-Glu, and proton binding at <italic>c</italic>-Glu drive <italic>c</italic>-ring rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Vik and Antonio, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Elston et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, based on the crystal structure of mitochondrial F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>, the <italic>c</italic>-subunits that face the <italic>a</italic>-Glu223 residue bridging a proton from IMS, the <italic>a</italic>-Arg residue involved in electrostatic interaction, and the <italic>a</italic>-Glu162 residue bridging a proton to the matrix are located apart; therefore, we hypothesized that the <italic>c</italic>-subunits on the <italic>a</italic>-Glu223 side of <italic>a</italic>-Arg play a role in proton release, whereas the <italic>c</italic>-subunits on the <italic>a</italic>-Glu162 side of <italic>a</italic>-Arg play a role in proton uptake in the ATP synthesis rotation. MC/MD simulations based on the F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> atomic structure have revealed that proton transfer causes <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub>-ring rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kubo et al., 2020</xref>). Here, MD simulation of <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub>-ring rotation during ATP synthesis was performed based on the aforementioned hypothesis, that proton release and proton uptake are both affected by <italic>c</italic>E56D mutation. Our results indicated that the rotation speed is higher when the mutation is introduced at adjacent positions, and that the rotation speed decreases as the distance between the two mutants increases. These results, which are consistent with the findings of our biochemical experiments, indicate cooperative proton uptake during the rotation of the <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub>-ring. Further analysis revealed that the waiting times for proton uptake in multiple subunits are shared. However, as the distance between the mutations increases, the degree of sharing of waiting time decreases, resulting in lower rotation speeds.</p><p>Overall, these findings suggest that at least three of the <italic>c</italic>-subunits on the <italic>a</italic>/<italic>c</italic> interface cooperate during <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub>-ring rotation in F<sub>o</sub>. This is consistent with the presence of two or three deprotonated carboxyl residues facing the <italic>a</italic>-subunit in the MC/MD simulation of WT F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kubo et al., 2020</xref>). In the WT, the <italic>c</italic>-subunit with deprotonated <italic>c</italic>E56 is considered to be the <italic>c</italic>-subunit waiting for proton uptake during ATP synthesis. Since the WT prefers pathways with two or three <italic>c</italic>-subunits waiting to uptake protons rather than only one <italic>c</italic>-subunit, the waiting time for proton uptake can be shared between two or three <italic>c</italic>-subunits. With respect to double mutation activity, the “ef” and “eg” mutants tended to have higher activity than the “eh–ej” mutants. This is consistent with the upper limit of three deprotonated <italic>c</italic>-subunits obtained from the WT simulations. The waiting time for protonation can be shared among three of sequential <italic>c</italic>-subunits of c(e), c(f), and c(g), but if they are located more than four subunits apart, the waiting time cannot be shared.

One unit of activity was defined as hydrolysis of 1 μmol of ATP per minute; the slopes of decreasing 340 nm absorbance in the steady-state phase (400–600 s) were used for calculating activity.

Since the <italic>c</italic>E59D mutation does not affect the role of <italic>a</italic>R176, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>176</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> should not be changed. The angle dependence g(θ) may be affected by the mutation. However, there is no direct structural information on the side chain of the mutated aspartic acid in its protonated/deprotonated states. Thus, we applied the same function as that for glutamic acid.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Symersky et al., 2012</xref> obtained the X-ray structure of the <italic>c</italic>-ring not embedded in the lipid bilayer and compared it with the previous <italic>c</italic>-ring structure embedded in the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Symersky et al., 2012</xref>). They found that the side chain of <italic>c</italic>E59 in the lipid environment has its tip facing inside of the <italic>c</italic>-ring (closed conformation), whereas the side chain of <italic>c</italic>E59 in water aqueous solution has its tip facing outside of the <italic>c</italic>-ring (open conformation). In addition, MD simulations confirmed that the orientation of the side chain of <italic>c</italic>E59 is reversible depending on the environment. Based on these results, they concluded that the orientation of the side chains of <italic>c</italic>E59 changes when <italic>c</italic>E59 moves from the environment in the lipid membrane to the environment facing the <italic>a</italic>-subunit, which would facilitate proton hopping. It should be noted that the sidechain reorientation depends on the proximity of <italic>c</italic>E59 with its proton-relaying partner (<italic>a</italic>E223 or <italic>a</italic>E162 in our case). Thus, in our coarse-grained model, this effect can effectively be included in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula>. For the case of the <italic>c</italic>E59D mutant, however, it is unlikely that the same degree of the reorientation occurs. Therefore, we decided to increase the decay rate A, of <italic>c</italic>E59D.</p><p>To examine the impact of this parametrization, we conducted the same simulation with the parameter A of <italic>c</italic>E59D set at 2.5/nm, the same value as in <italic>c</italic>E59. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a</xref> show that the velocity of the single mutant (e) was lower than that of the WT, but the extent of decrease (30%) was smaller than that of the experimental result (75%). Therefore, we set A=9.0/nm as the parameter of <italic>c</italic>E59D, which results in consistent results being obtained in the experiment for the single mutant (e).</p><p>Next, we assessed the pKa values of <italic>c</italic>E59 and <italic>c</italic>E59D. The intrinsic pKa of aspartic acid in aqueous solutions is smaller than that of glutamic acid. Also, the pKa values of the donor and the acceptor inside proteins are thought to be larger in water due to pKa shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Srivastava et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, pKa estimations by a standard tool, PROPKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2005</xref>), on the WT <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub>-ring and the <italic>a</italic>-subunit complexes showed that the pKa values of the <italic>a</italic>-subunit-facing chain-a, -h, -i, and -j have particularly large pKa values, with the largest being 8.03 for chain-i (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Therefore, based on the study by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Srivastava et al., 2018</xref>) and the PROPKA result, we set the pKa of <italic>c</italic>E59 at 8.0. Similarly, we used PROPKA for assessing the pKa values in the complex of the <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub>-ring with <italic>c</italic>E59D and the <italic>a</italic>-subunit, finding that the pKa value was, on average, 1.0 unit smaller than that in the <italic>c</italic>E59. Therefore, we set the pKa for <italic>c</italic>E59D at 7.0.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>pKa values predicted by PROPKA.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top"><italic>c</italic>-ring</th><th align="left" valign="top">a</th><th align="left" valign="top">b</th><th align="left" valign="top">c</th><th align="left" valign="top">d</th><th align="left" valign="top">e</th><th align="left" valign="top">f</th><th align="left" valign="top">g</th><th align="left" valign="top">h</th><th align="left" valign="top">i</th><th align="left" valign="top">j</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>c</italic>E59</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">7.40</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">6.10</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5.89</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5.89</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5.89</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5.89</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5.89</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">6.73</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">8.03</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">7.34</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>c</italic>E59D</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">6.49</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5.37</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5.16</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5.16</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5.16</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5.16</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5.16</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5.85</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">7.08</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">6.54</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Since the difference in the pKa values between aspartic acid and glutamic acid in the aqueous solution was 0.2, we also considered an alternative parametrization; the pKa value of the <italic>c</italic>E59D at 7.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>). The results showed no significant difference in the rotation velocity between the single mutant (e) and the double mutant (ej), which is inconsistent with the results of the experiment. Thus, we decided to consider the estimate made using PROPKA, and the pKa value for the <italic>c</italic>E59D was set at 7.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Simulations and their analyses</title><p>For each of the WT F<sub>o</sub><italic>ac</italic><sub>10</sub> and the six <italic>c</italic>E59D mutation patterns corresponding to the biochemical assay, we carried out 10 independent simulation runs with different stochastic forces. The mutants included the single mutant “e” and the five double-mutants “ef,” “eg,” “eh,” “ei,” and “ej.” The single mutant “e,” for example, has the <italic>c</italic>E59D substitution only in the “e” chain, whereas other chains contain the WT <italic>c-</italic>subunit sequence. The double-mutant “ef” harbors substitutions in the two neighboring subunits. Each simulation run contained 6000 rounds of MC/MD cycles (twice as long as in our previous paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kubo et al., 2020</xref>). Each round contained MC trial moves for all the protons involved and 10<sup>5</sup> MD steps. Thus, the entire trajectory corresponds to 6.0×10<sup>8</sup> MD (60,000 frames saved).</p><p>Notably, due to limitations in the computation time, we could simulate only one to a few turns of 360° rotations for each trajectory. As the mutant systems show asymmetric arrangements, the unbiased estimate of average velocities requires the rotation of multiples of 360°. Thus, we used the cumulative rotation angle and the MD time step at which the <italic>c</italic><sub>10</sub>-ring returned to the initial orientation for the last time in each trajectory. The rotation velocity was obtained as the ratio of the cumulative rotation angle to the MD time. This velocity was then averaged over 10 trajectories.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69096-transrepform1-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Nir Ben-Tal as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hiroyuki Noji (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. A main concerns is the accuracy of biochemical assays, ATP synthesis activity measurement and ATP-driven proton pumping activity measurement. To our knowledge, it is not easy to achieve highly accurate and precise biochemical assays such as error within a few % even if we use highly purified enzymes. In this paper, the authors reported very small experimental error: around 1 % or even less. However, we have not found description of the how the experimental errors were determined. The authors did not use purified enzymes but inverted vesicles of <italic>E. coli</italic> expressing the mutated enzymes. One of critical parameters for the accuracy is the quantification of the enzymes in the vesicles that were estimated from the decoupled ATP hydrolysis activity measurement. The error in this quantification should be substantially smaller than 1 % to achieve such a high accuracy. In addition, the ATP synthesis activity and ATP-driven proton pumping activity were measured from the time courses of the assays that should also include some experimental errors as found in the noise and drift in the time courses of proton pumping measurement (Figure 2c). Because the activity difference among the double mutants were subtle, the accuracy and precision of the biochemistry part are the critical points to prove the validity of their arguments. Detailed explanations on the estimation of experimental error as well as reproducibility are required.</p><p>2. Another concern is the validity of the simulation. The authors conduced Monte Carlo simulation for proton transfer step between c-subunit and a-subunit. The rate constant was represented in a simple exponential factor: exp(-A(r-r0)), where 'A' represents the decay rate, 'r' is physical distance between c-subunit and a-subunit and 'r0' is the offset value that represents the sum of sidechain length of the proton transferring residues on c-subunit and a-subunit. They assumed smaller 'r0' and larger 'A' for cE59D mutant. Although the smaller 'r0' would be reasonable considering the shorter side change of aspartic acid, the reason for higher 'A' for the mutant is not clear. In addition, different values for pKa were given to the glutamic acid in the wild type c subunit (cE59) and to the aspartic acid in the mutant (cE59D), without rationalization. These parameters should be critical for the simulation results. The validity of the different 'A' and pKa in the mutant should be explained.</p><p>3. Another concern is that cooperativity is shown here in case of mutants, but it is not so obvious how it relates to the WT enzyme. One clue, to which authors only briefly relate, is that according to their earlier simulations in WT the preferred pathway is when 2 or 3 Glu are unprotonated at any time rather than just one Glu being protonated/unprotonated. This kind of &quot;cooperativity&quot; in WT enzyme and its relation to the data presented should be discussed in greater detail.</p><p>Also, parts of the text, such as the Introduction, are not very clearly written and can be improved.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Show computations (Figure 3b) and experimental data (Figure 2d?) side by side to make it easy to evaluate the correspondence.</p><p>2. Simulation procedure should be explained in greater detail. Not just as a pointer to the previous publication.</p><p>3. &quot;Although the pKa value specific to the corresponding site is unknown, we empirically chose pKa = 8.0 for cE59 and 7.0 for cE59D considering the intrinsic difference in pKa values.&quot;: These values are much higher than the pKa of these amino acids in solution (around 4). Maybe justify the values based on calculation of the pKa shifts? PROPKA or something.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>l. 72 – there are now true atomic structures of F-ATPase, which should be quoted here (e.g. yeast, bovine, ovine).</p><p>Figure 1 – which structure was used for depiction? Quote PDB and species.</p><p>There is no comment at all why Glu to Asp mutation was used. Previous study from this group (ref 8) indicated that replacement of a single E with Q in c10 ring completely abolishes the activity, as discussed at the end of this manuscript. This should be mentioned at least briefly at a point in text when E to D mutations are introduced.</p><p>l. 170-175 – for mutants eh-ej there is no evidence for fluorescence quenching after ATP addition in Figure 2c, so there is no evidence for proton pumping activity. It is not clear at all why authors used quenching after FCCP addition as an apparent measure of pumping. In mutants ef-ej this signal is reversed compared to c10 and e. By the same token one could argue that eg-ej are more active than ef, as they show larger quenching after FCCP addition. It seems fair to say only that e to eg show decreased pumping as they show slow quenching after ATP addition, while eh-ej do not show any pumping.</p><p>Similarly, it is not clear if in Figure 2b eh-ej show genuine ATP synthesis or this is more of unspecific reaction. Authors could show here a control with their previous E56Q mutant which does not show such activity.</p><p>Figure 2 A – very poor blot, not clear at all that we are looking at a specific signal.</p><p>C – for c10 the steady level of fluorescence is not achieved, so it is incorrect to use it for comparison with other mutants.</p><p>Table 1 – would be good to include data for WT for comparison.</p><p>l. 249 – comment should be added on the increased values for g, h, i in Figure 4e, which are presumably linked to e behavior.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cooperation among <italic>c</italic>-subunits of F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATP synthase in rotation-coupled proton translocation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but one remaining issue still needs to be addressed.</p><p>The core data of this manuscript is the ATP synthesis activities of the mutants with double cE56E mutations: ef, eg, eh, ei, and ej in Figure 2b, on which all of arguments and the simulations are based. The main concern was the precision and accuracy of this measurement. This is because the ATP synthesis activity of the double mutants are remarkably smaller than that of the reference sample, c10. In addition, the difference in the activity among the mutants are also quite small, in the range from 1-4 % when standardized with the activity of the reference sample. Therefore, the biochemical measurement should achieve extremely high precision and accuracy to quantify the differences in the activity among the double mutants.</p><p>In the original manuscript, the error bars were represented with standard deviations (s. d.) that ranged 3-10 % as coefficient of variance (c. v.), that were extraordinarily small as a biochemical assay. Furthermore, the ATP synthesis activity measurement has multiple steps for calibrations and data corrections: baseline correction, calibrations for ATP quantification, and quantifications of ATP synthase protein in the inversed vesicles. Each step should have some experimental errors. Therefore, this reviewer asked the authors to provide experimental data to verify such small error bars.</p><p>Along this request, the authors re-calculated standard deviations in the revised version, considering the experimental errors in quantifications of synthesized ATP molecules and the enzyme molecules in the inversed vesicles. Resultant errors are 17-30 % as c. v. for each mutant. Although lot-to-lot variance of inverted vesicles and errors in baseline correction are still not considered, the error estimation seems to be relatively valid.</p><p>Then, the arising question is &quot;Are the differences among the double mutants statistically significant?&quot;. The revised manuscript does not mention this point at all, even though this is the most critical point and the basis of the main concern. The authors provide the p-values between double mutants that range from 10-68%, in the 'source data' file. At least, the authors should clearly mention the statistical uncertainties of the ATP synthesis activities of the mutants, providing the standard deviations (not standard errors) and p-values in the main text. Otherwise, readers are not able to judge the significance of differences in ATP synthesis activity among the mutants.</p><p>Arguments based on such subtle differences with large p-values might be misleading. The authors are asked to reconsider the statistical validity and to re-build the arguments as well as the title and abstract to avoid possible overstatements.</p><p>Lastly, we want to mention a point about data correction on ATP synthesis activity measurement from another angle: The fraction of coupled enzyme that can be estimated from DCCD sensitivity (Table. 1). When we consider the DCCD sensitivity in the quantification of 'coupled ATP synthase enzyme in the inverted vesicles', the resultant ATP synthesis activity of the mutants may differ from the present one, possibly showing a different trend. Did the authors correct the quantification of ATP synthase enzyme in the reversed vesicles with the DCCD sensitivity?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69096.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Another concern is the validity of the simulation. The authors conduced Monte Carlo simulation for proton transfer step between c-subunit and a-subunit. The rate constant was represented in a simple exponential factor: exp(-A(r-r0)), where 'A' represents the decay rate, 'r' is physical distance between c-subunit and a-subunit and 'r0' is the offset value that represents the sum of sidechain length of the proton transferring residues on c-subunit and a-subunit. They assumed smaller 'r0' and larger 'A' for cE59D mutant. Although the smaller 'r0' would be reasonable considering the shorter side change of aspartic acid, the reason for higher 'A' for the mutant is not clear. In addition, different values for pKa were given to the glutamic acid in the wild type c subunit (cE59) and to the aspartic acid in the mutant (cE59D), without rationalization. These parameters should be critical for the simulation results. The validity of the different 'A' and pKa in the mutant should be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. Indeed, the original manuscript did not explain, in depth, the reasoning behind the parameter choices for the cE59D mutant.</p><p>The decay rate, A, that appears in the proton transfer probability calculation represents the donor-acceptor distance dependence of the proton transfer. In the WT case, a previous structure study by Symersky et al. (Symersky et al. Nat Struct Mol. Biol. (2012)) suggests that the sidechain of the glutamic acid changes its orientation upon interaction with the proton-relaying residues in the <italic>a</italic>-subunit. Since this reorientation depends on the donor-acceptor distance, the sidechain reorientation can effectively be included in the evaluation of parameter <italic>A</italic>. On the other hand, the mutant cE59D is unlikely to show the same amount of the sidechain reorientation, which can be mimicked by the increased value of A, effectively; though no direct evidence of this is available. In our study, we chose a larger value of <italic>A</italic> when comparing velocity reduction in the single mutant (&quot;e&quot;). In this revision, to assess the impact of this parametrization, we performed extra-simulations with the decay rate A, for cE59D kept unchanged to that of cE59. The results in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 show that the results thus obtained were not consistent with those of the single-mutant (&quot;e&quot;).</p><p>The pKa values of the proton-carrying glutamic acids and cE59D were determined based on their intrinsic values, as in a previous study by Srivastava et al., and estimated using a standard tool, PROPKA. In general, the pKa values of the proton donor and acceptor inside proteins are thought to be much larger than the intrinsic pKa values of their amino acids in aqueous solutions. Indeed, PROPKA estimated that the pKa value of cE59 that faces the <italic>a</italic>-subunit is ~8, and that the difference in pKa values between cE59 and cE59D is ~1 (Table 2). To assess the importance of the pKa values, in this revision, we performed extra-simulations with the pKa value of cE59D at 7.8, which is 0.2 smaller than that of cE59. We obtained inconsistent results with those of the biochemical assays (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have added a subsection describing the validity of the simulation parameters (subsection heading: The validity of the simulation parameters&quot;).</p><p>&quot;For the former, the proton transfer efficiency is markedly reduced by the <italic>c</italic>E59D mutation because aspartic acid has a shorter sidechain than glutamic acid by one methylene-group and because the sidechain reorientation found in the corresponding glutamic acid<sup>13</sup> (Symersky et al. Mol. Biol. (2012)) may not occur in the aspartic acid mutant.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The decay rate was set to 2.5 (1/nm) for <italic>c</italic>E59 (the same value as reported previously<sup>23</sup>) and 9.0 (1/nm) for <italic>c</italic>E56D, assuming the absence of sidechain reorientation in the mutant (Figure 3—figure supplement 1c).&quot;</p><p>&quot;we empirically chose pKa = 8.0 for <italic>c</italic>E59 and 7.0 for <italic>c</italic>E59D considering the intrinsic difference in pKa values, a previous argument, and computational estimates of pKa value by PROPKA.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Another concern is that cooperativity is shown here in case of mutants, but it is not so obvious how it relates to the WT enzyme. One clue, to which authors only briefly relate, is that according to their earlier simulations in WT the preferred pathway is when 2 or 3 Glu are unprotonated at any time rather than just one Glu being protonated/unprotonated. This kind of &quot;cooperativity&quot; in WT enzyme and its relation to the data presented should be discussed in greater detail.</p><p>Also, parts of the text, such as the Introduction, are not very clearly written and can be improved.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewers for this comment. We have added the following explanation:</p><p>“In the WT, the <italic>c</italic>-subunit with deprotonated <italic>c</italic>E56 is considered to be the <italic>c</italic>-subunit waiting for proton uptake during ATP synthesis. Since the WT prefers pathways with two or three c-subunits waiting to uptake protons rather than only one <italic>c</italic>-subunit, the waiting time for proton uptake can be shared between two or three <italic>c</italic>-subunits. With respect to double mutation activity, the “ef” and “eg” mutants tended to have higher activity than the “eh-ej” mutants. This is consistent with the upper limit of three deprotonated <italic>c</italic>-subunits obtained from the WT simulations. The waiting time for protonation can be shared among three of sequential <italic>c</italic>-subunits of c(e), c(f), and c(g), but if they are located more than four subunits apart, the waiting time cannot be shared. Therefore, the activity of mutants “eh,” “ei,” and “ej” was lower than that of mutants “ef” and “eg”.”</p><p>In the introduction section in revised manuscript, we have added the following explanation:</p><p>“A more recent theoretical study using a hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics (MC/MD) simulation based on a high-resolution structure showed that there can be two or three deprotonated <italic>c</italic>-Glu residues facing the <italic>a</italic>-subunit concurrently<sup>23</sup>, suggesting that the waiting time for protonation of the deprotonated <italic>c</italic>-subunit is shared among the two or three of the <italic>c</italic>-subunits. However, the relationship between the sharing of deprotonation times among multiple <italic>c</italic>-subunits and the cooperativity of <italic>c</italic>-subunits for proton transport has not been discussed so far.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

It is not clear at all why authors used quenching after FCCP addition as an apparent measure of pumping. In mutants ef-ej this signal is reversed compared to c10 and e. By the same token one could argue that eg-ej are more active than ef, as they show larger quenching after FCCP addition. It seems fair to say only that e to eg show decreased pumping as they show slow quenching after ATP addition, while eh-ej do not show any pumping.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewer for this comment and for their advice.</p><p>In the original manuscript, since the degree of quenching after addition of ATP is small and the fluorescence shift after the addition of FCCP is relatively large, the fluorescence quenching degree was analyzed by assessing the fluorescence intensity immediately after the addition of FCCP and the fluorescence intensity at the steady level after the addition of FCCP. However, this analysis was not appropriate due to the inadequate time resolution of the experiment, and the unknown degree and time constant of fluorescence shift by the addition of FCCP.

The main concern was the precision and accuracy of this measurement. This is because the ATP synthesis activity of the double mutants are remarkably smaller than that of the reference sample, c10. In addition, the difference in the activity among the mutants are also quite small, in the range from 1-4 % when standardized with the activity of the reference sample. Therefore, the biochemical measurement should achieve extremely high precision and accuracy to quantify the differences in the activity among the double mutants.</p><p>In the original manuscript, the error bars were represented with standard deviations (s. d.) that ranged 3-10 % as coefficient of variance (c. v.), that were extraordinarily small as a biochemical assay. Furthermore, the ATP synthesis activity measurement has multiple steps for calibrations and data corrections: baseline correction, calibrations for ATP quantification, and quantifications of ATP synthase protein in the inversed vesicles. Each step should have some experimental errors. Therefore, this reviewer asked the authors to provide experimental data to verify such small error bars.</p><p>Along this request, the authors re-calculated standard deviations in the revised version, considering the experimental errors in quantifications of synthesized ATP molecules and the enzyme molecules in the inversed vesicles. Resultant errors are 17-30 % as c. v. for each mutant. Although lot-to-lot variance of inverted vesicles and errors in baseline correction are still not considered, the error estimation seems to be relatively valid.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for evaluating our manuscript and for your constructive comments and suggestions.

The revised manuscript does not mention this point at all, even though this is the most critical point and the basis of the main concern. The authors provide the p-values between double mutants that range from 10-68%, in the 'source data' file. At least, the authors should clearly mention the statistical uncertainties of the ATP synthesis activities of the mutants, providing the standard deviations (not standard errors) and p-values in the main text.

When we consider the DCCD sensitivity in the quantification of 'coupled ATP synthase enzyme in the inverted vesicles', the resultant ATP synthesis activity of the mutants may differ from the present one, possibly showing a different trend.
