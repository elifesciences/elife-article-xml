Each myofiber contains periodic myofibrils built by hundreds of contractile sarcomeres that generate large mechanical forces. To better understand the mechanisms that coordinate human muscle morphogenesis from tissue to molecular scales, we adopted a simple in vitro system using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human myogenic precursors. When grown on an unrestricted two-dimensional substrate, developing myofibers spontaneously align and self-organise into higher-order myofiber bundles, which grow and consolidate to stable sizes. Following a transcriptional boost of sarcomeric components, myofibrils assemble into chains of periodic sarcomeres that emerge across the entire myofiber. More efficient myofiber bundling accelerates the speed of sarcomerogenesis suggesting that tension generated by bundling promotes sarcomerogenesis. We tested this hypothesis by directly probing tension and found that tension build-up precedes sarcomere assembly and increases within each assembling myofibril. Furthermore, we found that myofiber ends stably attach to other myofibers using integrin-based attachments and thus myofiber bundling coincides with stable myofiber bundle attachment in vitro. A failure in stable myofiber attachment results in a collapse of the myofibrils. Overall, our results strongly suggest that mechanical tension across sarcomeric components as well as between differentiating myofibers is key to coordinate the multi-scale self-organisation of muscle morphogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>muscle</kwd><kwd>sarcomere</kwd><kwd>self-organisation</kwd><kwd>mechanical tension</kwd><kwd>human induced pluripotent

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human skeletal muscles display a very hierarchical and stereotypical architecture. At its distal ends, each muscle is mechanically connected to different skeletal elements, which are moved by the contracting muscle to achieve locomotion. Within each muscle, contractile muscle cells called myofibers are organised into myofiber bundles, several of which are combined to form one human muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hill and Olson, 2012</xref>). Within each muscle fiber, the contractile myofibrils are laterally aligned displaying the well-appreciated cross-striated morphology of skeletal muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huxley and Niedergerke, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huxley and Hanson, 1954</xref>). Each myofibril consists of a long chain of contractile machines called sarcomeres, which extend across the entire length of the muscle fiber to mechanically connect the attached skeletal elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schiaffino and Reggiani, 2011</xref>). As such, coordinated contraction of all sarcomeres shortens all myofibrils and thus shortens each muscle fiber. This results in force production powering the desired body movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lemke and Schnorrer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lindstedt, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Sarcomere architecture is highly regular. The plus ends of parallel actin filaments are cross-linked at the Z-discs bordering each sarcomere, while their minus ends point centrally where they overlap with large bipolar myosin filaments. The latter are cross-linked in the middle of the sarcomere building the M-band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dasbiswas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lange et al., 2006</xref>). Both types of filaments are stably linked together by the gigantic elastic protein titin, whose N-terminus is bound to α-actinin at the Z-disc, while its C-terminus is embedded into the M-band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lange et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Linke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tskhovrebova and Trinick, 2003</xref>). This results in a stereotypic sarcomere length, depending on muscle type ranging from 2 to 3 µm in relaxed human muscle in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehler and Gautel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Llewellyn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tskhovrebova and Trinick, 2003</xref>).</p><p>As most mature human muscles are several centimetres long, many thousand sarcomeres need to be concatenated into each myofibril to mechanically connect both myofiber ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lemke and Schnorrer, 2017</xref>). Assembling the correct number of sarcomeres will result in the optimal amount of passive tension present in the relaxed muscle. This is a prerequisite for effective active muscle force production during sarcomere contraction, powered by myosin forces pulling on actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dasbiswas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Linke, 2018</xref>). Hence, the complex hierarchical muscle tissue operates under continuous mechanical tension.</p><p>Optimal tension levels are not only important in the mature muscle, but also essential during its development. Insights from in vivo imaging of myofibrillogenesis during <italic>Drosophila</italic> flight muscle development sparked the tension-driven self-organisation hypothesis of myofibrillogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weitkunat et al., 2014</xref>): this hypothesis suggests that myotubes first attach to tendons. After successful attachment, they build up mechanical tension along the long axis of the muscle fiber. This tension build-up triggers the simultaneous assembly of long periodic myofibrils that extend through the entire fiber and thus mechanically connect the two attached exoskeletal elements of the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weitkunat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weitkunat et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, tension is key to coordinate myofibril self-organisation over long distances in insect muscles.</p><p>However, <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscles are simple, single myofiber muscles that do not form higher-order myofiber bundles. Hence, it is a limited model for understanding how myofiber attachment, myofiber bundling, and sarcomere assembly are coordinated during human muscle tissue morphogenesis. Furthermore, human muscle tissue not only connects to tendon and cartilage cells, which are the source of various guidance cues in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schweitzer et al., 2010</xref>), but also contains a complex muscle-associated connective tissue that may further instruct muscle development both mechanically and chemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helmbacher and Stricker, 2020</xref>). How precisely this complex interplay of cell types may coordinate muscle morphogenesis at different scales is not well understood.</p><p>Here, we set out to test the self-organisation capacity of human muscle tissue in vitro when developing on a substrate lacking any localised guidance, attachment, or other mechanical cues. We employed a recently developed human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation protocol that can efficiently generate myogenic precursors which further differentiate robustly into striated skeletal muscle fibers in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Tanoury et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). This method allowed us to obtain large quantities of isogenic human myogenic precursors of defined developmental history, in contrast to primary myoblast cultures from donors. Furthermore, CRISPR-based genome engineering enabled us to tag sarcomeric protein components of choice to follow their live dynamics in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Tanoury et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Using two-dimensional (2D) cultures of human iPSC-derived myogenic precursors, we found that despite the absence of attachment cues, myofibers elongate to self-restricted stable lengths. Concomitantly, they self-organise into large myofiber bundles that attach to shared attachment foci at both ends. As myofibers approach stable lengths, their sarcomeres emerge simultaneously over broad regions, suggesting that myofibril and myofiber morphogenesis are coordinated from tissue to molecular scales. We identified mechanical tension as a likely coordination mechanism as tension precedes sarcomere formation and further increases when myofibrils mature. Consequently, integrin-based adhesions between the bundled myofiber ends support stable myofiber attachment. Interestingly, faster bundling results in accelerated sarcomere assembly. Since tension can be transmitted across tissue, cellular, and molecular scales, we hypothesise that tension is key to coordinate muscle morphogenesis across scales.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human iPSC-derived myofibers follow a biphasic differentiation process</title><p>In order to study human muscle fiber morphogenesis on cellular and subcellular scales, we adapted a 2D in vitro culture system.

At day 3 we observed small swirly patterns in vector fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicative of short-range alignments of polarity. These aligned regions enlarge over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-F</xref>), which is supported by an increasing average nematic length during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>; nematic length was defined as the intersection of the initial linear decay of the spatial correlation function with the x axis, see Materials and methods). To visualise the local discontinuities of alignment, which often locate at the end of myofiber bundles, we calculated the nematic order for each vector grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A’-F’</xref>; nematic order is a parameter describing the alignment of local orientation of the vector field at a given position, see Materials and methods). This analysis defined regions of disorder in the cultures with a nematic order below a threshold of 0.5. The fraction of disordered regions decreases over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>), further supporting an expansion of aligned regions.</p><p>In order to better understand the development of individual myofiber bundles in the entire cultures, we manually traced a total of 34,962 individual myotubes or myofibers and applied an automated Hausdorff distance clustering algorithm to objectively define distinct individual myofiber bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, see Materials and methods). This analysis revealed that the number of bundles decreases within 4 days from about 240 bundles (in each 0.35 cm<sup>2</sup> well) at day 3 to about 75 bundles at day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A’–F’ and G</xref>). In turn, the average area occupied by each bundle increases about sixfold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). This strongly suggests that concomitant with myofiber elongation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), several smaller myofiber bundles merge into larger bundles.</p><p>Furthermore, myofiber ends present in the same bundle tend to point towards defined foci, which may serve as mechanical attachment sites to the surrounding matrix. In line with the reduction of bundle number over time, the number of these foci also decreases with similar temporal dynamics from about 140 foci at day 3 to about 50 foci at day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A’’–F’’1</xref>). This shows that these foci are dynamic and merge before day 7, suggesting that the myofiber bundles are not yet stably attached at their respective ends.</p><p>Next, we wanted to directly document the live dynamics of myofiber bundle and foci merging. Using a smaller culture format, we recorded the entire cultures by live phase-contrast imaging. Thus, we followed individual myofiber bundles over 4 days during differentiation and identified several examples in which one bundle elongates its extremity along a neighbouring bundle and finally merges with the neighbouring bundle to form shared attachment foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). This suggests that neighbouring myofiber bundles can offer orientation cues to nearby bundles during the dynamic bundle merging phase between day 3 to day 7 of the culture. This revealed that myofiber bundles can self-organise, potentially using mechanical orientation cues presented by their neighbours.</p><p>We noticed that myofiber bundles cease to merge after day 7 in our cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–G</xref>), coinciding with the end of myofiber extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Day 7 also demarcates a turning point for bundle area growth and foci fusion, both of which remain largely stable after day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H1</xref>). We conclude that myotubes and myofibers show a remarkable biphasic differentiation behaviour in vitro that is coordinated between cell and tissue scales. We hypothesised that the biphasic growth of myofibers and myofiber bundles may be caused by a switch in their mechanical status around day 7. This switch may further result in molecular changes in myofibers that enable myofibril and sarcomere formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A transcriptional switch to enable myofibril and sarcomere assembly</title><p>As a first step to investigate the molecular changes at day 7 of differentiation, we analysed a previously generated transcriptomics dataset comparing similar proliferative cultures (using the identical SKGM-2 culture conditions) with days 7 and 15 of myogenic differentiation (using the identical KCTiP differentiation conditions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Tanoury et al., 2021</xref>).

In search for clusters that may reflect the temporal dynamics of the biphasic myofiber extension behaviour, we found that three gene clusters are upregulated at day 7 of differentiation, while reaching a plateau or decreasing again at day 15 (clusters 1, 2, 7). Notably two of these clusters are enriched for muscle-specific GO-terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). In particular, cluster 1 contains many genes coding for sarcomeric protein components, whose expression shows a strong upregulation at day 7 and then plateaus until day 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Each fiber was then assigned to one of four morphologically distinct categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>): first, ‘myotubes’ display very low levels of titin in a salt-and-pepper pattern, muscle myosin levels are also low and actin does not yet form long continuous myofibrils. The lack of myofibrils is substantiated by the absence of periodic myosin or titin patterns on actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Thus, myotubes do not yet contain myofibrils. Second, ‘immature myofibers’ display higher levels of titin and myosin, both of which are recruited onto continuous actin structures, which do not yet display an obvious periodicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Thus, immature myofibers contain immature myofibrils that are not yet periodic. Third, ‘transitional myofibers’ show high titin and myosin levels, both of which display a periodic pattern on long continuous periodic actin structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Hence, transitional myofibers contain long periodic myofibrils built from chains of immature sarcomeres. Fourth, ‘mature myofibers’ display strongly periodic patterns of titin, myosin, and actin across the entire width of the myofiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Thus, mature myofibrils in mature myofibers have either aligned or laterally expanded to form large Z-discs. Generally, the patterns appeared homogenous throughout most of the length of the myotube or myofiber; hence, we were able to categorise each of them into a single morphological category.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Sarcomeres emerge as myofibers approach stable lengths.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Multi-channel fluorescent images of four morphological categories (myotubes, immature, transitional, and mature myofibers).

Myotubes and immature myofibers are largely present before day 7 in the differentiating cultures, whereas transitional and mature myofibers dominate after day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This fits well with the observed biphasic behaviour described above and suggests that periodic sarcomeres largely assemble around day 7, the time when myofibers become stably attached.</p><p>In order to analyse the time course of sarcomere assembly in an unbiased manner, we developed a semi-automatic image analysis pipeline to quantitate periodic titin signal intensity profiles in a 3D volume extending along a length of up to 200 µm using an autocorrelation function (ACF) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, see Materials and methods). After straightening the segmented myofibril to obtain a 1D titin intensity profile, we applied an ACF and monitored secondary ACF peaks position and prominence as a read out of the regularity of the pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dehapiot, 2022</xref>). We applied this pipeline to all myotubes and myofibers fixed at different time points in the differentiation time course. When averaging all ACFs for each time point, we found a secondary peak first emerging at days 5 and 7, with a period length of about 2 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This sarcomere length fits well with the length of human foetal muscle sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Racca et al., 2013</xref>). The peak prominence becomes higher at days 9, 12, and 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), demonstrating that the periodicity and thus the sarcomeres mature at later stages. This is also visible from individual ACFs in randomly selected myotubes or myofibers from each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E’</xref>). Finally, we sorted the ACFs based on our manually assigned morphological categories and confirmed that immature myofibers do not yet display any obvious periodicity. Periodicity is however clearly detected in transitional and mature myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and F’</xref>). We conclude that periodic sarcomeres assemble in transitional myofibers around days 5–7. This coincides with the time when myofibers have formed stable bundles with stable attachment foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).

If mechanical tension also provides a long-range coordination signal in human myofiber cultures, then one would predict that sarcomeres also emerge across broad regions after stable attachment.</p><p>In order to study how the first periodic myofibrils in human fibers are built, we performed local ACF analysis aiming to analyse sarcomere periodicity in 10-µm-wide windows sliding along the ‘straightened’ 1D titin intensity profiles ranging from 90 to 200 µm in length. This generated a 2D periodicity map for each myofiber, displaying the regularity of the pattern, measured by the peak prominence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, white line represents peak prominence), and distance between peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To minimise artefacts generated by our straightening procedure, we optimised the peak prominence threshold and allowed for short gaps (below 6 µm in length; see Materials and methods). This enabled us to quantify the periodicity of titin distribution in all our 810 myotubes and myofibers (red lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As expected from the global ACF analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, myotubes display almost no titin periodic region above the threshold, confirming that they do not contain any myofibrils or sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Similarly, immature myofibers contain on average less than one periodically patterned region per 100 µm, again verifying that they do not contain periodic myofibrils yet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Therefore, myotubes and immature myofibers have not yet assembled periodic myofibrils and hence do not yet contain sarcomeres. In contrast, our ACF analysis revealed that mature myofibers are periodically patterned across 80% of the analysed regions, showing mostly one or two large regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). This demonstrates that mature myofibers indeed contain highly regular periodic myofibrils that span most of the myofiber.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Sarcomeres emerge simultaneously over broad regions within myofibers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Local autocorrelation function (ACF) analysis for each morphological category (myotubes, immature, transitional and mature myofibers).

This is supported by the finding that ACF analysis scores about 30% of their length as periodic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Consistently, we find that transitional myofibers contain an average of 1.5 patterned regions per 100 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), some developed already into very long continuous regions (&gt;50 µm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This verified that transitional myofibers are the stage at which periodic sarcomeres assemble over long distances.</p><p>We next investigated the distribution of periodic regions along the length of transitional myofibers. If sarcomeres assemble simultaneously along the myofiber, our detection threshold should be reached at random positions, homogeneously distributed along the myofiber. Indeed, we find that patterned regions in transitional myofibers are homogeneously distributed throughout the entire fiber with no bias to the centre or to distal ends of the fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, this strongly suggests that sarcomeres emerge rather simultaneously over broad regions to form long periodic myofibrils in human myofibers.</p><p>To directly visualise sarcomerogenesis in human muscle cultures live, we tagged the endogenous α-actinin2 protein with mKate2 using CRISPR-Cas9 technology (see Materials and methods). Performing fluorescent time-lapse imaging, we were able to track individual myofibers in low-density cultures for up to 3 days, which enabled us to visualise myofibrillogenesis directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). As observed in fixed cultures, we found that initially unpatterned immature myofibers develop periodic myofibrils over a broad region of the myofiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>). This likely coincides with a strong increase in mechanical tension as we frequently found one end of the myofiber detaching from the substrate. Strikingly, detaching from the substrate results in a local collapse of the periodic myofibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>).

As it is well established that the recoil velocity speed after the cut correlates with the amount of mechanical tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behrndt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hutson et al., 2003</xref>), we tracked the recoiling ends of severed myotubes and myofibers (excluding the actively contracting ones) and fitted both a linear model and a viscoelastic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) to calculate the initial recoil velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and the viscoelastic relaxation time τ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), respectively. τ is comparable between all morphological categories, suggesting that they have comparable material properties. However, immature and transitional myofibers show a progressively higher initial velocity compared to myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), demonstrating that they are under higher tension levels.</p><p>To probe tension directly within the assembling myofibrils, we performed nano-lesions to only severe individual myofibrils without affecting the rest of the cell, taking advantage of the high spatial precision of the pulsed infrared laser (see Materials and methods).

This strongly suggests that the assembling and maturing myofibrils are the major source of the mechanical tension present in the myofibers.

This is consistent with the highly dynamic extension behaviour of myotube ends that we documented by live imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), resembling the dynamic focal adhesions of migratory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wehrle-Haller, 2012</xref>). Similar integrin and paxillin foci are detected at the ends of immature myofibers, however integrin also localises along the entire outline of the immature myofiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggests that the immature myofibers probe their environment over large areas, which is consistent with their above-described dynamics.</p><p>When the myofiber bundle foci stabilise and myofibers convert to transitional myofibers, we found a notable concentration of integrin and paxillin at the interface of neighbouring myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This fiber-fiber localisation of integrin and paxillin further increases in mature myofibers, which frequently form large clustered foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To better document the fiber-fiber proximity, we visualised the myofiber outlines with the cell surface marker NCAM1 and confirmed that immature as well as mature myofibers form immediate contacts at the bundle foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data suggest that the myofiber bundle foci of transitional and mature myofibers are indeed stabilised by force-resistant integrin-based fiber-fiber attachments to the surrounding ECM. These stable attachment foci can counteract the high tension produced in each transitional myofiber driving sarcomere assembly, and thus sarcomere assembly is coordinated with myofiber bundling at the supra-cellular level.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Multi-scale self-organisation in human myofibers in vitro</title><p>In vivo, human muscle tissue displays a very ordered organisation ranging from the molecular scale of sarcomeric proteins to the tissue scale of myofiber bundles. This ensures that molecular forces produced by myosin motors translate efficiently into body movement. Here, we used a 2D culture system to investigate how muscle cells can organise themselves in the absence of any external cues. We discovered that myofibers show an autonomous multi-scale self-organisation when cultured in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A tension-driven self-organisation model of human skeletal muscle morphogenesis across tissue, cellular, and molecular scales.</title><p>See text for description.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76649-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>At the tissue scale, myofibers self-organise into large bundles sharing one long axis, the future muscle contraction axis. Most myofibers within one bundle stably connect to one shared attachment focus on either end. This resembles the in vivo situation of muscle fiber bundles growing in the same direction and connecting to shared tendon and skeletal elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schweitzer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zelzer et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>At the cellular level, myotubes first elongate actively, then stabilise to a defined length, likely depending on the culture and matrix conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jensen et al., 2020</xref>). At this stage, myofiber ends start to establish stable connections with their environment, coinciding with their transition from immature to transitional myofibers. Again, this behaviour recapitulates the in vivo situation, in which myotubes first elongate towards their future tendons, then they stably attach to them, before they organise their contractile myofibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gros et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kardon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schnorrer and Dickson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weitkunat et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>At the molecular level, sarcomeres emerge homogeneously with first periodic regions distributed across a long part of the myofiber after its stable attachment. These immature myofibrils then mature into chains of hundred or more periodic sarcomeres that span most of the mature myofiber. Further maturation will result in the lateral expansion of the periodic myofibrils by lateral alignment of neighbouring myofibrils and incorporation of newly recruited components. A similar simultaneous myofibril assembly and maturation mechanism has been described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscles in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weitkunat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weitkunat et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, our human muscle in vitro system does recapitulate various aspects of muscle morphogenesis in vivo.</p><p>The alignment of neighbouring myotubes to a shared contraction axis has also been found when cultured C2C12 mouse myoblasts were differentiated on patterned substrates with a defined axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guillamat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Junkin et al., 2011</xref>). The alignment of myofibers in this system depends on the compliance of the substrate, with very soft hydrogels resulting in highly parallel myotubes that do not converge to shared attachment foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jensen et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, self-organised alignment appears to be a general phenomenon of differentiating myotubes. However, prior to our work it was unknown how myotube alignment at the tissue scale coordinates with muscle and sarcomere morphogenesis at cellular and molecular scales in human muscle.</p><p>Here, we have presented evidence strongly supporting mechanical tension as one key signal to coordinate the self-organisation across scales. First, we detected different levels of mechanical tension during the time course of myofiber differentiation, starting with low tension in myotubes and resulting in high tension in the assembled transitional and mature myofibers. Second, we demonstrated that this tension is present across the assembling myofibrils. Since myofibrils span the entire muscle fiber, tension likely communicates rapidly across scales. Third, we found a strong correlation of tension increase with maturation of integrin attachments at the myofiber bundle foci. It is well established in many cell types that mechanical load on integrin adhesions exerted by the actin cytoskeleton results in their maturation to better withstand increased forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Austen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bulgakova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lemke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). Fourth, we demonstrated that more efficient myofiber bundling and thus likely faster tension build-up accelerates sarcomere assembly. Finally, we found that releasing tension either acutely by laser cutting a myofibril or by long-term detachment of a myofiber tip results in a collapse of the periodic myofibrils, which will likely result in a disassembly of the ordered structure. Altogether, this strongly suggests that mechanical tension is a key signal that coordinates morphogenesis in myofibrils, myofibers, and myofiber bundles.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A self-organisation model across scales is coordinated by tension</title><p>How may tension coordinate muscle morphogenesis across scales? In our working model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), myotubes elongate during the initial culture phase via protrusive ends. At this stage, they are already forming first mechanical contacts with neighbouring myotubes using filopodial extensions, which in response align to form a small and short myotube cluster sharing a common axis. The tension level is low and sarcomeric genes are not or little expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> – Steps ①, ②). As myotubes elongate further, they convert to immature myofibers: sarcomeric proteins begin to be expressed and actin filaments assemble into continuous myofibrils that are under higher tension but are still not periodic. The elongating myofiber bundles start to merge with neighbouring bundles to form a common axis and shared attachment foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> – Step ③). The stable attachment enables a further increase in tension and the now high levels of sarcomeric proteins can assemble into periodic myofibrils throughout most of the myofiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> – Step ④). The self-organisation process is likely myosin-driven, with myosin being responsible for the tension build-up and the ordering of the sarcomeric components, as has been shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dasbiswas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loison et al., 2018</xref>) as well as in cardiomyocytes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chopra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fenix et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, we propose that tension-driven myofibril self-organisation is evolutionarily conserved across muscle types and tension can act as a compass to orient and coordinate between all the molecular components for coordinated assembly into continuous periodic myofibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lemke and Schnorrer, 2017</xref>). We hypothesise that a critical tension threshold needs to be passed to trigger effective sarcomere assembly because individual myofibers progress at different speeds from myotubes to mature myofibers in our cultures.</p><p>Importantly, we found that integrin-based attachments are concentrated at the ends of the myofibers, in particular at the contact interfaces between neighbouring myofibers. Likely these integrins are mechanically engaged as is the case at muscle attachments in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charvet et al., 2012</xref>) thus allow the bundling of the myofibers to large bundles with one large attachment focus at each end. Such each of the foci couples mechanically to the ECM to resist the active myosin-based contractions that become prominent in mature myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> – Step ⑤). Such active contractions are also essential for myofibril maturation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weitkunat et al., 2017</xref>), primary chick myofibers cultured in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kagawa et al., 2006</xref>), and in turn even for tendon and bone maturation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felsenthal and Zelzer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shwartz et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together, our model proposes a key role for mechanical tension to coordinate the self-organisation of muscle morphogenesis across scales.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Tension sensing</title><p>Which molecules may sense tension to signal a coordinated assembly of myofibrils and myofibers into bundles? It is likely that tension is sensed at the myofiber level, as sarcomeres appear homogenously across the entire lengths of myofibers. A myosin-dependent self-organisation of ordered periodic actomyosin structures has even been observed in non-muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dasbiswas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). However, in contrast to non-muscle cells, the sarcomeric striations are stable over long time periods and have period length of 2–3 µm. This is achieved by titin, which ‘locks’ actin and myosin filaments in place, fulfilling its established ruler function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brynnel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Granzier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Linke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tskhovrebova and Trinick, 2003</xref>). In turn, titin is the major source of passive tension present in mature muscle and is responsible for the mechanical integrity of sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rivas-Pardo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Swist et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, it is conceivable that the giant elastic titin molecules may serve as tension-sensitive catch bonds, whose incorporation into the myofibril subsequently triggers spatial segregation of actin and myosin domains into regular sarcomeres. However, molecular forces across titin during myofibril assembly have not yet been measured directly.</p><p>Another possible mechanism may exist at the ends of myofibers, where integrin-based attachment sites are mechanically linked to the actin cytoskeleton. Since myofiber elongation is mainly driven by actin dynamics of the myofiber ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schnorrer and Dickson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weitkunat et al., 2014</xref>), a tension-sensing mechanism located at the myofiber ends could transmit the tension signal via the actin cytoskeleton to negatively regulate dynamics of myofiber ends and initiate stable attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Richier et al., 2018</xref>). Recent work from <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle attachments revealed that high mechanical load on integrin does indeed recruit large amounts of the integrin adaptor talin, bridging from integrin to the actin cytoskeleton and the first sarcomeric Z-disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bulgakova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Green et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Luis and Schnorrer, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moser et al., 2009</xref>). The large amounts of talin can then share the high mechanical load amongst all the talin molecules to achieve stable long-term attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lemke et al., 2019</xref>). While we have not been able to detect costameric localisation of integrins in our cultured myofibers, likely due to their lack of maturity, we do not exclude a role of costameric integrins in mediating mechanical forces and promoting sarcomere formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schwander et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sparrow and Schöck, 2009</xref>), since it has been shown that costameres in mature myofibers play important roles in transmitting forces from the sarcomere to the sarcolemma and the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peter et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Finally, it is important that the transcriptional status of the differentiating myofiber fits with its morphological differentiation. Thus, tension may also feedback on the transcriptional machinery to boost expression of the sarcomeric components that are needed in large amounts to assemble myofibrils but are not present in extending myotubes. Such a feedback mechanism has recently been proposed in developing flight muscles, which use the mechanosensitive Hippo/YAP pathway to boost sarcomere gene expression before and during myofibril morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaya-Çopur et al., 2021</xref>). Tension could also be sensed directly at the nuclear envelope, which is linked by the LINC complex to the actin cytoskeleton, inducing changes of nuclear shape and position during myofiber differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janota et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, it is conceivable that in the developing human muscles tension is sensed to boost sarcomeric gene expression. Such a mechanism would ensure that sarcomeres only assemble from their components when the myofibers are properly attached.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Making even better muscle in vitro – towards a muscle-skeleton ‘organoid’?</title><p>The 2D myofibers generated in vitro are still immature compared to large adult human muscle fiber bundles attached to tendons and bone in vivo. Our myofibers show highest expression of embryonic (MYH3) and neonatal (MYH8) myosin isoforms (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schiaffino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Tanoury et al., 2021</xref>) and their myofibrils remain rather thin. However, longer-term culture often results in myofiber detachment followed by degeneration, likely because the attachment sites are not stable enough to withstand the even higher forces produced by more mature fibers. This could be partially solved by overlaying with second layer of Matrigel to provide additional mechanical support in 3D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roman et al., 2018</xref>). The successful differentiation of contractile human neuromuscular organoids from neuromesodermal progenitors in 3D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Faustino Martins et al., 2020</xref>) also suggests that 3D support of the myogenic cultures is advantageous.</p><p>In summary, our current study has uncovered a remarkable transition from an initial population of dynamic, elongating myotubes to stable and contractile bundles of myofibers that is likely coordinated across tissue, cellular, and molecular scales via mechanical tension. Given that muscle-generated mechanical forces are crucial for optimal patterning and morphogenesis in bones and tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felsenthal and Zelzer, 2017</xref>), it is tempting to hypothesise that mechanical tension may also coordinate the morphogenesis across muscle and connective tissue lineages, resulting in a self-organised musculoskeletal system. Introducing progenitors of tendon or other connective tissues at defined positions of the cultures will be a next step towards a minimal sufficient system that can recapitulate mature muscle-tendon-skeleton development in vitro.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials availability statement</title><p>Any newly created material in this manuscript can either be accessed online or requested from the authors.</p><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ACTN2 (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/88">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/88</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HGNC:HGNC:164</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NCRM-1 (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RUCDR, Rutgers University; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Tanoury et al., 2021</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GFP-titin (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Derived from PGP-1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharma et al., 2018</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">mKate2-α-actinin2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Derived from NCRM-1, this study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rabbit-anti-titin (N-term)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma, Cat.

Then, line ROIs were grouped as bundles with a custom script in R using a simple clustering algorithm based on the Hausdorff distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borchers, 2021</xref>). The Hausdorff distance is defined as the maximum distance of a set of points to their nearest point in the other set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rote, 1991</xref>). The Hausdorff distance is chosen to quantify the distance between two line ROIs, as it takes into account every point and is thus superior than simply comparing average distances of line ROIs. Briefly, each set of line ROIs is represented by a set of xy coordinates. A Hausdorff distance is then calculated between each set of xy coordinates to obtain a distance matrix between pair-wise line ROIs. Line ROI pairs with Hausdorff distances below arbitrary thresholds are grouped into one myofiber cluster. One unique distance threshold is chosen for each time point, based on best matching between automatically generated clusters with visual inspections. Once segmented, the number of myofiber clusters is automatically counted.

Four further quantities were calculated for each 1D titin intensity profiles: the proportion of periodic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), the average length of consecutive periodic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), the number of periodic regions per 100 µm of fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), and the homogeneity score calculated as the standard deviation of periodic window positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Autocorrelation analysis of 1D titin intensity profiles was performed in Matlab (version 2019b) with custom scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dehapiot, 2022</xref>). Autocorrelation analysis detects periodicity from temporal or spatial series, and displays the period as the distance of the secondary peak from the y axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, panel ④).</p><p>Autocorrelation analysis reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D–G</xref> was performed in R using the acf() function from the ‘stats’ package on manually segmented 1D intensity profile of fixed titin and live ɑ-actinin-mKate2 signals at several time points matched by myofibril morphology.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall the reviewers found the paper to be important, timely, well executed and beautifully presented. There is only one issue the reviewers would like the authors to try and provide more clarity about, hopefully with additional data. Specifically, the reviewers would like the authors to try and address the questions of first, whether bundling is necessary for myofibril formation and second whether fiber bundling increases attachment forces and thus tension inside the cells. As reviewer #2 notes &quot;Previous reports, using primary muscle cells, showed rather isolated myofibers with myofibrils formed and functional. Is it due to the cells' origin or the culture method? Does myofibers' bundling increase attachment forces?&quot;. Reviewer #2 proposes some avenues to explore this which overlap with related comments by the other reviewers. Although the reviewers made suggestions that may extend the scope of the paper and strengthen the conclusions somewhat, these are not deemed essential for a revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Laser microsurgery is indeed a powerful method to study tension but it is rather invasive. Can the authors vary tension using another approach (for example grow the cells on stretchable media, or vary cell density or media viscosity). I do not mean for a comprehensive study just a proof of principle.</p><p>–The behaviour, placement and positioning of nuclei is a topic of great interest in the field of muscle development. The authors have a powerful system to study these questions. The authors already use nuclei markers and track nuclei behaviour. Can they comment about nuclei behaviour and mobility during myofiber fusion, data which they already have access to?</p><p>– The authors use terms like &quot;high tension&quot; or &quot;increasing tension&quot;; these are not very precise terms. Measuring force is not trivial but the authors should give some thought and discuss how relative tensions are measured and give rise to different outcomes. Questions such &quot;as is there a universal value that initiates developmental transitions or is the relative increase what triggers the change.&quot; should be explored.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The data presented here shows a solid temporal correlation between intracellular formation of myofibrils and maturation of myofibers, associated with the tension exerted on adhesion sites and inside the cells. I would like to make some comments and raise some questions that I hope will improve the article.</p><p>Authors describe that fibers coordinate themselves into bundles. However, is bundling necessary for myofibrils formation? Previous reports, using primary muscle cells, showed rather isolated myofibers with myofibrils formed and functional. Is it due to the cells' origin or the culture method? Does myofibers' bundling increase attachment forces? I think answering those questions will comfort the statement made in the article's title. Tension on substrate can be rather easily monitored using beads embedded in the matrix and follow their displacement over time.</p><p>If substrate stiffness is involved, and thus attachment forces, could the authors try to grow their cells on stiffer or softer substrate and monitor the appearance of periodic structures (sarcomeres)? Alternatively, cells could be grown on a deformable substrate (stretchable) which will give the authors the possibility to increase or reduce the tension forces between cell adhesion sites.</p><p>In the transcriptional analysis, it is rather surprising that clusters 8 and 9, which contain endoplasmic reticulum genes, appear to be downregulated during the differentiation process. The ER is becoming the SR in muscle cells and associates periodically with the sarcomeres; do not we expect a different outcome for the genes involved in ER biogenesis?</p><p>I am a bit concerned about the experiments using lasers to perform nano-lesions of the myofibrils, while in fact the whole cell is cut (cf methods). The observation of cell recoiling is thus a result of the ablation of both the membrane and the myofibrils and everything that was inside, the other cytoskeletons for instance. In a recent paper, Roman W et al. (Science 2021) have used a similar technique but only to sever a few myofibrils and not cut the whole cell. I suggest the authors use a similar approach and look at the sarcomeres on both sides of the damage to see how they initially contract towards the damage and if they go back to their initial state later, after myofibril repair.</p><p>Authors wrote that costameres are not present in their culture system. It is surprising and unlikely because myofibrillogenesis is dependent on the presence of costameres, which are providing a scaffold for sarcomere attachment. I suggest performing α-5-integrin, vinculin or FAK stainings to ascertain this.</p><p>In the discussion, authors wrote that &quot;myotubes elongate during the initial culture phase via protrusive ends&quot;. While myoblast and myotube fusions can occur anywhere along a myotube, I do not understand the point made here. Myotubes mostly elongate by fusing with other cells at the initial phase; actually, the ratio between the number of nuclei inside a myotube and its area remain constant over time in this phase.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. Author's conclusions are based on temporal correlation between the appearance of sarcomeric pattern, clustering of myofiber's ends and an increase in tension and I am wondering whether there is a way to test this functionally. In Figure 5 they show that when one of the ends of mature myofiber detaches from foci sarcomeres collapse at the side of detachment. This however doesn't provide a functional link between tension and sarcomerogenesis as the detaching myofiber is already mature. It would be important to document whether sarcomeres form in the case detachment occurs earlier, at day 7 or so. Do authors see such kinds of events in their time-lapse experiments and/or could they by applying nano-lesions induce early detachment and then film detached myofiber in vivo?</p><p>2. Both Actin and B-integrin levels increase in differentiating myofibers and this is nicely documented, however I am less convinced by their accumulation at the myofiber ends with respect to the internal part of myofibers (as suggested in the scheme in Figure 8). This end-enrichment needs to be better illustrated and quantified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76649.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall the reviewers found the paper to be important, timely, well executed and beautifully presented.

We tried to minimise this effect by cutting with a very focused two-photon laser beam. This enabled us to only cut the myofibril without cutting the cell. These results showed that more mature myofibrils are under high tension (original Figure 6 —figure supplement 2, now Figure 7—figure supplement 2).</p><p>The additionally suggested experiments are all interesting to pursue. We do not have the cell-stretcher established yet. However, we have been able to plate the cells at varying densities (from 2.5K to 20K per cm<sup>2</sup>, formerly we used 10K for all experiments) and monitored their behaviour. We rationalised that bundling speed should be a readout of tension build-up and should be modified by varying cell density. Hence, we should see an effect on sarcomere assembly speed. In support of this hypothesis, we found that higher cell density indeed resulted in more efficient muscle fiber bundle formation, as analysed by unbiased vector field analysis that quantifies myofiber bundle alignment (new Figure 5 and Figure 5 —figure supplement 1). Importantly, our semi-automated autocorrelation analysis found that more efficient bundling in the denser cultures results in faster of assembly of their sarcomeres. At 10K and 20K seeding densities on day 5, we have seen significant advancement of sarcomere formation compared to 2.5K and 5K densities (new Figure 5C-E). At the 20K seeding density, we can even occasionally observe well-formed sarcomeres on day 3 (new Figure 5C). These new data further support the hypothesis that increased tension is responsible for efficient myofiber bundling and sarcomere assembly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>–The behaviour, placement and positioning of nuclei is a topic of great interest in the field of muscle development. The authors have a powerful system to study these questions. The authors already use nuclei markers and track nuclei behaviour. Can they comment about nuclei behaviour and mobility during myofiber fusion, data which they already have access to?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that myonuclear behaviours are an exciting avenue of research in the future. However, we have not quantified nuclear movements in our live movies. We can see the nuclei in the phase contrast movies (not in the fluorescent spinning disc movies), but our current time resolution (30 min) does not always allow us to reliably track the nuclei between all the frames. Hence, we refrained from a detailed analysis of nuclear movement during or after fusion. Nuclear movements after fusion have been excellently quantified by the lab of Edgar Gomez using primary mouse myoblasts that more easily differentiate into mature fibers to quantify movement of the nuclei to the fiber surface after myofibrils have assembled (PMID 28892082). Our cultures are not yet reaching this level of maturity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors use terms like &quot;high tension&quot; or &quot;increasing tension&quot;; these are not very precise terms. Measuring force is not trivial but the authors should give some thought and discuss how relative tensions are measured and give rise to different outcomes. Questions such &quot;as is there a universal value that initiates developmental transitions or is the relative increase what triggers the change.&quot; should be explored.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. When revising the manuscript, we have tried to most accurately describe the tension values or tension changes over time and the possible impact of this change on for muscle morphogenesis. We hypothesise that it is rather a certain level of tension that needs to be reached to proceed to the next step of sarcomerogenesis. The evidence for this is that similarly looking myofibers have a comparable tension level. However, as we can measure tension only once per fiber and not over time, this is still a hypothesis, which we have extended in our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The data presented here shows a solid temporal correlation between intracellular formation of myofibrils and maturation of myofibers, associated with the tension exerted on adhesion sites and inside the cells. I would like to make some comments and raise some questions that I hope will improve the article.</p><p>Authors describe that fibers coordinate themselves into bundles. However, is bundling necessary for myofibrils formation? Previous reports, using primary muscle cells, showed rather isolated myofibers with myofibrils formed and functional. Is it due to the cells' origin or the culture method? Does myofibers' bundling increase attachment forces? I think answering those questions will comfort the statement made in the article's title. Tension on substrate can be rather easily monitored using beads embedded in the matrix and follow their displacement over time.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is drawing attention to an important and critical point. Certainly, myofibrils can develop without the cells integrating into large bundles, even in our cell culture system. For the laser cutting experiments we have often chosen fibers that were only in small bundles to reduce the complexity of the imaging. So, tension is generated even if bundling is minimal. However, we are suggesting that bundling results in a higher build-up of tension, thus triggering sarcomerogenesis more effectively. This hypothesis is now further supported by new data gained from cultures with varying seeding densities. As explained above for reviewer 1, we have varied the seeding density from 2.5k to 20k cells per cm<sup>2</sup>, and found that denser seeding results in more efficient bundling and as a consequence faster sarcomere assembly (new Figure 5 and Figure 5 —figure supplement 1). This is consistent with the hypothesis that bundling promotes efficient sarcomere and myofibril assembly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If substrate stiffness is involved, and thus attachment forces, could the authors try to grow their cells on stiffer or softer substrate and monitor the appearance of periodic structures (sarcomeres)? Alternatively, cells could be grown on a deformable substrate (stretchable) which will give the authors the possibility to increase or reduce the tension forces between cell adhesion sites.</p></disp-quote><p>These are both excellent suggestions by the reviewer, which are currently beyond our technical capacity. We plan to embark on these experiments in the near future to further probe the detailed mechanism of how substratum stiffness may impact upon tension and instruct bundling and sarcomere assembly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the transcriptional analysis, it is rather surprising that clusters 8 and 9, which contain endoplasmic reticulum genes, appear to be downregulated during the differentiation process. The ER is becoming the SR in muscle cells and associates periodically with the sarcomeres; do not we expect a different outcome for the genes involved in ER biogenesis?</p></disp-quote><p>Good point! We do not know why the ERAD pathway is down-regulated during maturation of the cultures. ERAD is targeting misfolded ER proteins for degradation. How well the SR has matured in our cultures has not yet been analysed. It is well possible that the expected up-regulation of SERCA, RyR and other core components of the SR is only happening at later stages that our cultures cannot reach yet (see below our response regarding costameres).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am a bit concerned about the experiments using lasers to perform nano-lesions of the myofibrils, while in fact the whole cell is cut (cf methods). The observation of cell recoiling is thus a result of the ablation of both the membrane and the myofibrils and everything that was inside, the other cytoskeletons for instance. In a recent paper, Roman W et al. (Science 2021) have used a similar technique but only to sever a few myofibrils and not cut the whole cell. I suggest the authors use a similar approach and look at the sarcomeres on both sides of the damage to see how they initially contract towards the damage and if they go back to their initial state later, after myofibril repair.</p></disp-quote><p>The infrared two-photon laser that we have used here can indeed cut very precisely. Hence, we had already done the experiment the reviewer is favouring, it was presented in old Figure 6 —figure supplement 2 (now Figure 7 —figure supplement 2). With this method we only cut one or a part of an aligned myofibril bundle inside the cell and not the cell membrane. With this method we could document the fast recoil and hence large tension in the mature myofibrils but we did not investigate a possible repair. Such a repair can occur over a long duration (5 – 25 hours in Roman et al. Science 2021), thus it would be a major investment to look into this in detail, which was not our point with this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors wrote that costameres are not present in their culture system. It is surprising and unlikely because myofibrillogenesis is dependent on the presence of costameres, which are providing a scaffold for sarcomere attachment. I suggest performing α-5-integrin, vinculin or FAK stainings to ascertain this.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed failed to detect clear costameres. We looked with anti-paxillin and antibeta1-integrin, and also with anti-vinculin and anti-alpha5-integrin (not shown). alpha5-integrin pairs with beta1, so we do not show the additional negative data. Our explanation is that our cultures are not yet mature enough to form proper, welldefined costameres recapitulating the sarcomeric spacings. We do find lots of integrin on the fiber surface, which we document. Regarding the assembly, we would argue the role of costameres is unclear. In insect flight muscle they are certainly not required, even mature flight muscles do not have costameres and the myofibrils purely span across the muscle cell from attachment to attachment (PMID 24631244). Here, we show that immature myofibrils assemble also across long distances, this argues that they are mechanically anchored throughout and not only locally at the next costameres. We argue they are mechanically anchored at the ends of the fibers or occasionally at lateral attachment sites, at which we do see large clusters of integrin-based attachments to the ECM and other fibers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion, authors wrote that &quot;myotubes elongate during the initial culture phase via protrusive ends&quot;. While myoblast and myotube fusions can occur anywhere along a myotube, I do not understand the point made here. Myotubes mostly elongate by fusing with other cells at the initial phase; actually, the ratio between the number of nuclei inside a myotube and its area remain constant over time in this phase.</p></disp-quote><p>We have documented the inverse relationship between myotube width and myotube length during the initial phase of myofiber elongation (Figure 1K, first 7 days). To explain this correlation, we proposed that myotubes elongate by one or two leading edges that move apart the cell centre (hence “extending”). This is supported by our live observations in phase contrast movies (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1B). We believe the new myoblasts largely fuse at the long axis of the cell and hence provide material that allow the leading edges to move further apart.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. Author's conclusions are based on temporal correlation between the appearance of sarcomeric pattern, clustering of myofiber's ends and an increase in tension and I am wondering whether there is a way to test this functionally. In Figure 5 they show that when one of the ends of mature myofiber detaches from foci sarcomeres collapse at the side of detachment. This however doesn't provide a functional link between tension and sarcomerogenesis as the detaching myofiber is already mature. It would be important to document whether sarcomeres form in the case detachment occurs earlier, at day 7 or so. Do authors see such kinds of events in their time-lapse experiments and/or could they by applying nano-lesions induce early detachment and then film detached myofiber in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide new data that show that increased seeding density promotes more efficient bundling which promotes faster sarcomerogenesis (new Figure 5). On the one hand, we have never seen sarcomeres in detached fibers, it is hard to image detached fibers over time. They collapse, round up and swim away. However, most of the collapse indeed only occurs when tension is high after immature sarcomeres have assembled. On the other hand, long-term imaging after nano-lesions is an excellent suggestion. We are implementing this exact new experimental setup to investigate the consequence of tension release in a controlled manner in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Both Actin and B-integrin levels increase in differentiating myofibers and this is nicely documented, however I am less convinced by their accumulation at the myofiber ends with respect to the internal part of myofibers (as suggested in the scheme in Figure 8). This end-enrichment needs to be better illustrated and quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>The integrin end-enrichment is most obvious at the fiber-fiber contacts of large bundle ends. However, the reviewer is entirely correct that integrins are also found around the fibers in medial positions. The exact amounts are hard to compare as mature bundles are very dense, making quantitative imaging very tricky. As a compromise, we have added integrins also to the middle sections in our model in Figure 9 to better recapitulate these observations.</p></body></sub-article></article>
