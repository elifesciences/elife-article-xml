flexibility in changing environments is critical for normal neuronal functioning. However, to what extent individual neurons and neuronal populations maintain internal firing properties remains largely unknown. In this study, we show that distributions of spontaneous population firing rates and synchrony are subject to accurate homeostatic control following increase of synaptic inhibition in cultured hippocampal networks. Reduction in firing rate triggered synaptic and intrinsic adaptive responses operating as global homeostatic mechanisms to maintain firing macro-stability, without achieving local homeostasis at the single-neuron level. Adaptive mechanisms, while stabilizing population firing properties, reduced short-term facilitation essential for synaptic discrimination of input patterns. Thus, invariant ongoing population dynamics emerge from intrinsically unstable activity patterns of individual neurons and synapses. The observed differences in the precision of homeostatic control at different spatial scales challenge cell-autonomous theory of network homeostasis and suggest the existence of network-wide regulation rules.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04378.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04378.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04378.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human brain contains more than 80 billion neurons, which are organised into extensive networks. Changes in the strength of connections between neurons are thought to underlie learning and memory: neuronal networks must therefore be sufficiently stable to allow existing memories to be stored, while remaining flexible enough to enable the brain to form new memories.</p><p>Evidence suggests that the stability of neuronal networks is maintained by a process called homeostasis. If properties of the network—such as the average firing rate of all the neurons—deviate from a set point, changes occur to return the network the original set point. However, much less is known about the effects of homeostasis at the level of individual neurons within networks: do their firing rates also remain stable over time?</p><p>Slomowitz, Styr et al. have now addressed this question by recording the activity of neuronal networks grown on an array of electrodes. Applying a drug that inhibits neuronal firing caused the average firing rate of the networks to decrease initially, as expected. However, after 2 days, homeostasis had restored the average firing rate to its original value, despite the continued presence of the drug. By contrast, the individual neurons within the networks behaved differently: on day 2 almost 90% of neurons had a firing rate that was different from their original firing rate.</p><p>Similar behavior was seen when Slomowitz, Styr et al. studied the degree of synchronization between neurons as they fire: the average value for the network returned to its original value, but this did not happen at the level of individual neurons. Surprisingly, however, the ability of the network to undergo short-lived changes in average strength of the connections between neurons—which is thought to support short-term memory—was not subject to homeostasis. This suggests that the loss of short-term memory that occurs in many brain diseases may be an unfortunate consequence of the efforts of neuronal networks to keep their average responses stable.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04378.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04378.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>homeostatic plasticity</kwd><kwd>presynaptic plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>281403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Slutsky</surname><given-names>Inna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001742</institution-id><institution>United States–Israel Binational Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2007199</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Slutsky</surname><given-names>Inna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>993/08, 170/08 and 398/13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Slutsky</surname><given-names>Inna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006986</institution-id><institution>Legacy Heritage Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>865/11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Slutsky</surname><given-names>Inna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neuronal networks balance flexibility with stability by allowing the firing rate of individual neurons within a network to vary over time, while ensuring that the average firing rate across the network remains constant.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural circuits achieve an ongoing balance between flexibility and stability to enable plastic adaptations to environmental changes, while maintaining neuronal activity in a stable regime over extended timescales. The balance between stability and plasticity has rarely been addressed in the past due to the technical challenge of monitoring the activity of the same neurons over extended timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lütcke et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, great efforts have been made to establish a system for the monitoring of neuronal activity at long timescales in the hippocampus of freely moving mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ziv et al., 2013</xref>). That study, performed by monitoring Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in thousands of CA1 cells over weeks through a miniature head-mounted microscope, revealed a remarkable degree of instability in the coding of space: only 25% of cells with place fields at one recording session exhibited the same properties 5 days later. Importantly, the diverse activity patterns at the single-neuron level gave rise to largely invariant spatial representations at the population level. Such results raise the question of whether inter-neuronal dynamics of spiking patterns stems from intrinsic variability of the hippocampal network and its constituent neurons, or whether they reflect extrinsic changes in hippocampal modulation by higher-order brain structures, adaptations to environmental changes, or subtle changes in animal behavior states.</p><p>Diverse homeostatic negative feedback systems operate to stabilize ongoing spiking properties in neuronal populations around a predefined ‘set point’ in face of constant environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</xref>). Extensive research lead to compelling evidence on a wide repertoire of possible homeostatic mechanisms, including adaptations of synaptic strength, changes in excitation–inhibition balance, and modulation of intrinsic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Turrigiano, 2011</xref>). Despite progress in understanding the homeostatic mechanisms that underlie the stability of network firing properties, several key questions remain open. First, what are the basic properties of neural networks that are subjected to homeostatic control? Second, are homeostatic control systems equally precise at the level of individual neurons and neuronal populations? Third, what is the trigger of synaptic homeostatic mechanisms? And finally, how do compensatory changes in synaptic strength affect the network's functions?</p><p>To address these questions, long-term measurements of spiking activity over several days from the exact same neuron or population of neurons are required. While long-term monitoring of spiking activity cannot be reliably performed from the same neurons in vivo due to technical limitations, greater stability can be achieved in vitro. Therefore, we combined long-term extracellular spike recordings at the population and single-neuron levels using micro-electrode arrays (MEAs) and calcium imaging, together with intracellular patch-clamp measurements of synaptic responses and imaging of synaptic activity. We utilized cultured neuronal networks that represent an excellent experimental tool to study internal variability vs stability in a highly controlled environment. Here, we describe the basic relationships between ongoing spiking properties of individual neurons, population dynamics, and neuronal adaptive mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantifying GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated inhibition at synaptic, single neuron, and network levels</title><p>While the majority of homeostatic mechanisms have been studied following complete pharmacological blockade of spikes or AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), we decided to examine long-term effects of neuromodulation on firing properties of the network. Specifically, we examined how use-dependent synaptic inhibition via G-protein-coupled receptors, a widespread mechanism of neuromodulation in the central nervous system (CNS), affects firing properties of the network over long timescales. As a perturbation, we chose a suppression of synaptic activity via widely expressed GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs) using a selective GABA<sub>B</sub>R agonist, baclofen. GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs mediate presynaptic inhibition via inhibition of presynaptic calcium transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu and Saggau, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laviv et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we first conducted experiments to determine the dose–response of baclofen at the level of presynaptic terminals utilizing FM1-43 dye in primary hippocampal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abramov et al., 2009</xref>). As GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated inhibition is frequency-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Varela et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kreitzer and Regehr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ohliger-Frerking et al., 2003</xref>), we quantified the effects of baclofen for two types of input: low-frequency single spikes (30 stimuli at 1 Hz) and high-frequency spike bursts (30 stimuli delivered as 6 bursts; each burst contains 5 stimuli at 100 Hz), while maintaining the mean spiking rate constant at 1 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, baclofen inhibits synaptic vesicle release, displaying preferential effects during low-frequency stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Quantitatively, IC<sub>50</sub> for single spikes was ∼23-fold lower than for bursts (0.33 and 7.6 μM, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As a result, short-term facilitation was enhanced in a wide range of baclofen concentrations (0.01–10 μM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating a conversion of synapses to a high-pass filter mode. Similar results were obtained using voltage-clamp experiments in acute hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04378.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Quantifying GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated synaptic inhibition at synaptic, single neuron and network levels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative Δ<italic>F</italic> images obtained by single (30 APs@0.2 Hz) and burst (30 APs@6 bursts, each burst contained 5 APs; inter-spike-interval, 10 ms; inter-burst-interval, 5 s) stimulations before and 10 min after 10 µM baclofen application.

For this purpose, we grew high-density hippocampal cultures on MEAs for ∼3 weeks. Each MEA contains 59 recording electrodes with each electrode capable of recording the activity of several adjacent neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Spikes were detected and analyzed using principal component analysis to obtain well-separated single units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Unit firing rates were highly heterogeneous and skewed towards low frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) as has been previously reported in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mizuseki et al., 2012</xref>). As expected, baclofen caused a fast and robust drop in single-unit firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>), leading to a reduction of the population mean firing rate to 25 ± 4% (1 µM baclofen, see raster plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and to 1.2 ± 0.4% (10 µM baclofen) of baseline values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Thus, we can use this system to study how chronic changes in the GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated neuromodulation impact properties of individual synapses, single neurons, and neural networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Stability of firing rates at the population level</title><p>To assess how GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation affects firing properties of the population at long timescales, we measured spiking activity during a baseline recording period and for 2 days following the application of 10 μM baclofen. As expected, baclofen caused a fast and pronounced drop in firing rates to 1.2 ± 0.4% of baseline values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C,D</xref>). We hypothesized that if the network has an intrinsically regulated firing rate ‘set point’, as suggested by theories of homeostatic plasticity, we would see an increase in firing rates back to baseline values after administration of baclofen. Indeed, firing rates gradually returned to baseline values, reaching 57 ± 8% and 103 ± 14% of baseline after 1 and 2 days, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Notably, the average firing rates of networks under control conditions showed changes of similar magnitude during two recording days (without baclofen application, 113 ± 9% of baseline after 2 days; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). Moreover, the characteristic log-normal distributions of single-unit firing patterns were essentially identical before and 2 days after baclofen application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, p = 0.66; Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). Importantly, baclofen remains potent after over 2 days of exposure to recording conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, washout of baclofen following 2 days caused a significant increase in firing rate, indicating sustained activity of both baclofen and the GABA<sub>B</sub>R-induced G-protein-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Moreover, the magnitude of the GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated presynaptic inhibition, as measured by FM dyes, was not reduced following washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>), indicating that GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs did not undergo desensitization under our experimental conditions. Taken together, these results demonstrate a robust and precise compensatory response at the level of population averages, confirming the idea that neuronal networks grown in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>), similar to the circuits in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hengen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keck et al., 2013</xref>), have the ability to homeostatically regulate their mean firing rate.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04378.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Homeostatic regulation of firing rates is more precise at the network, than the single-unit level.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis of the firing rate of each unit in a representative MEA experiment over the course of 2 days of recording in the presence of 10 µM baclofen.

First, we analyzed firing rates of individual units during 2 days of recording under control condition. While a high correlation was observed between firing rates at the baseline and after 2 days (Spearman r = 0.8, p &lt; 0.0001, n = 490), a large fraction of units did not return to their baseline values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, left). Only 23 ± 3% of units remained significantly unchanged during 2 days of control recordings, while 77 ± 3% changed their firing rates significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This phenomenon became even more pronounced after the application of baclofen, with only 11 ± 2% of units returning to the baseline, while 89 ± 2% were significantly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> right and 2G). The change in firing rate after 2 days of recordings was negatively correlated with the initial firing rate of the same unit under both control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>; Spearman r = −0.29, p &lt; 0.0001, n = 490) and baclofen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>; Spearman r = −0.47, p &lt; 0.0001, n = 305) conditions, due to a larger relative variability of low firing units. Notably, when analyzing multiunit recordings per electrode, firing rates after 2 days of recording displayed statistically significant change from the baseline in ∼80% of the cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). To ensure that per unit variability is not due to a possible movement of neurons in and out from recording electrodes, we measured the movement of individual neurons over the course of 2 days and found that the mean movement of neurons (1.6 ± 0.1 μM) was negligible in comparison to the size of the electrode (30 µM) and neuron's cell body (11.4 ± 0.3 µM). These results confirm that the observed variability at the level of single units does not result from imperfect spike sorting or neuronal mobility.</p><p>Taken together, these data indicate the existence of significant dynamics at the level of the individual hippocampal neurons in mature hippocampal cultures, operating under the constraint that the overall firing rates do not change. The observed instability of firing rates at the individual neuron level becomes even more pronounced following the perturbation. Thus, the same mean firing rate of the population arises from variable firing rates of individual neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Calcium imaging confirms the variability of individual firing rates</title><p>As fluorescent calcium sensors are widely used to image neural activity, we performed somatic calcium imaging in visually identified individual neurons to verify whether the stabilization of population mean firing rates emerges from variable firing rates of single neurons following chronic perturbation.

Despite a transient GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated blockade of population firing rate with a simultaneous increase in firing synchrony, population activity was precisely restored to a ‘set point’ level after a period of 2 days. Interestingly, restoration of firing synchrony displays a faster kinetics than rebound of mean rates. In contrast to the observed firing macro-stability, single-unit behavior appears to be extremely dynamic. Only 23% of units displayed stable firing rates without perturbation, and this fraction was reduced to 11% following the perturbation. A complementary method, based on long-term recordings of somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, reflecting firing rates, in identified neurons showed that 46% of neurons returned to their baseline firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, two independent methodologies suggest that the majority of neurons display unstable firing rates even at extended timescales, confirming scale-invariant rate dynamics observed in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gal et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, stability, as well as the compensatory feedback response, is greater at the population compared to the single-unit level. Moreover, quantal excitatory synaptic strength and intrinsic excitability were significantly affected by the perturbation and, thus, differ between the baseline and rebound periods. These results highlight the idea that similar network properties may arise from multiple configurations of individual components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prinz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</xref>).

A variety of synaptic compensation mechanisms have been found following pharmacological or genetic perturbations in hippocampal and cortical neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burrone et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thiagarajan et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Branco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jakawich et al., 2010</xref>), following sensory deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maffei et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hengen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keck et al., 2013</xref>) or in a more physiological context of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vyazovskiy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lanté et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, synaptic homeostasis hypothesis proposed by Tononi and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tononi and Cirelli, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2014</xref>) states that population firing synchrony, a hallmark of slow-wave sleep, contributes directly to homeostatic synaptic scaling. To examine if changes in population synchrony per se can trigger adaptive responses, we compared two perturbations producing similar (inhibitory) effects on the mean firing rate, while differentially affecting firing synchrony. For this purpose, we used baclofen that increases firing synchrony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and CNQX that induces firing desynchronization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H,I</xref>). Both perturbations trigger the same types of synaptic adaptation at a comparable timescale: increase in the amplitude and the frequency of mEPSCs and in release probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig9">Figures 6 and 9F,G</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thiagarajan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jakawich et al., 2010</xref>)). Based on these results, we may conclude that (1) firing rates and patterns are independently regulated; (2) homeostatic systems generally sense a drop in spiking rates to induce an adaptive increase in excitatory synaptic transmission. Thus, our results in cultured neural networks don't support a causal relationship between firing synchrony and homeostatic synaptic response, suggesting that other factors, occurring during slow-wave sleep, may play a role in down-scaling of synapses in behaving animals.</p><p>Why network firing rates and patterns were not compensated following the AMPAR blockade requires future investigation. On the one hand, complete silencing of excitatory drive might exceed the capacity of the homeostatic system to compensate. On the other hand, the drop in the firing rate following baclofen application was even more pronounced; nevertheless, firing rate homeostasis was achieved. Similarly, blockade of GABA uptake via GAT-1 transporter resulted in a transient blockade of firing rates that were precisely compensated 2 days following the perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We can exclude the necessity of population bursts for induction of a proper profile of adaptive response since other treatments, such as ACh exposure, induce a reduction in synchrony that can be successfully compensated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaufman et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, our results indicate that adaptations at the level of intrinsic neuronal excitability and inhibitory drive are not sufficient to compensate the blockade of AMPAR-mediated excitatory drive. It is conceivable that AMPAR blockade might perturb the relationship between the firing rate and the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, causing a failure in the regulatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">O'Leary et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Changes in neuronal properties do not always impact network performance</title><p>It is generally assumed that experience-dependent modifications of synaptic strength or intrinsic excitability are associated with functional changes in the network performance. Nevertheless, under some circumstances, synaptic and intrinsic modifications may have little effect on network functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prinz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Thirumalai et al., 2006</xref>). For example, networks utilizing uniform and multiplicative forms of postsynaptic scaling as a main compensatory response to the perturbation may preserve learning rules and information content transferred between neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004</xref>).</p><p>While changes in neuromodulation via GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs caused a profound increase in synapse release probability, intrinsic excitability, mEPSC frequency and amplitude, spontaneous spiking activity of the network returned to the baseline level during 2 days in the constant presence of the perturbation. However, the sensitivity of synaptic population to bursts was profoundly modified: while acute GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation by baclofen shifts synapses towards high-pass filters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>), chronic baclofen application results in complete abolishment of short-term synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,E</xref>), potentially reducing discrimination of input patterns by synaptic mechanisms. The reduction in the selectivity of synapses to afferent input may represent a trade-off between population firing stability and synaptic metaplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Bear, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thiagarajan et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, robust homeostatic control of ongoing population dynamics may coexist with unstable short-term synaptic plasticity.</p><p>In summary, our results suggest that invariant population mean rate and temporospatial coherence of spontaneous spiking can emerge from highly diverse combinations of synaptic strength and intrinsic neuronal properties. The observed micro-instability of individual neurons was truly intrinsic, taking place in a highly-controlled environment, irrespective of changes in experience, behavioral states, and interactions with higher-order supervising circuits. While firing macro-stability is robustly and accurately maintained by homeostatic control systems in the face of perturbations and uncertainties, the ability of synapses to discriminate input patterns was sacrificed. Thus, impairments of short-term synaptic plasticity and working memory functions, characterizing initial phases of numerous brain disorders, may be the tradeoff resulting from the system's efforts to maintain phenotypic stability of spontaneous population firing patterns. It remains to be seen whether hippocampal short-term synaptic plasticity can be maintained without sacrificing critical parameters of population dynamics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>MEA preparation and recordings</title><p>Primary cultures of CA3–CA1 hippocampal neurons were prepared from newborn BALB/c mice on postnatal days 0–2, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32a">Slutsky et al., 2004</xref>).

Spikes cutouts were then detected, offline, using MC Rack software (MCS) based on a fixed threshold set to between 4–5 standard deviations from noise levels. In order to ensure the veracity of the detected spikes, TTX was added at the end of some experiments, resulting in an immediate loss of all spiking activity. Only the first 20 min of each hour were used for all analyses in order to reduce computation time. We showed that 20 min can reliably represent the MFR of a full-hour by comparing the MFR of 792 20 min segments to the MFR of the full hours represented by those segments. We found that only 9.6% of segments were more than 10% different from their full hour and none were more than 20% different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Furthermore, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) for 104 units over the course of 8 consecutive hr using different bin sizes. The CV represents the variability of MFRs within each unit over a given time-frame. We found that small bin sizes resulted in significantly higher CVs compared to 1 hr bins while bins larger than 10 min were not significantly different from bins of a full hour (CV = 121.3% ± 8.4, 53.4% ± 4.1, 25.1% ± 2, 19.2% ± 1.4, 14.8% ± 1.1, 13.5% ± 1, 11.60% ± 0.8, for bins of 10 s, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>).

Spikes were plotted in 2-D or 3-D principal component (PC) space and unit clusters were semi-automatically detected using K-means clustering algorithm followed by template sorting. Clusters were then manually inspected to insure stability throughout experiment. Only clusters that fulfilled the following requirements were considered units and used for analysis: (1) there was no spiking during the absolute refractory period. (2) The clusters were well defined relative to other clusters from the same electrode throughout the entire experiment. (3) There were no sudden jumps in cluster location on PC axes. (4) The cluster is not centered around the origin of the PC axes. (5) Auto-correlation histograms showed a distinct peak at t ≠ 0.

We use this fact as a cue to detect network bursts—every peak higher than a certain threshold is considered a candidate burst. Spike density threshold is estimated as the 95% percentile for a random Poisson process producing the same quantity of spikes. The timelines for each unit and thus for the entire network are divided into hourly intervals; we assume that throughout each interval the physiological state of the network and thus the spike statistics do not change. Thus, a different threshold is calculated for each hourly interval. Since we are looking for collective behavior modes, as a concluding filtering stage, we eliminate candidates generated by a small number of units. A unit is considered active if during the candidate burst it contributed at least a predefined number of spikes (usually 2–3). Then, for each hourly interval, a histogram of number of active units in a burst is calculated. The threshold for candidate burst elimination is set at the predefined percentile. In practice, choosing any value between 20–30% produces very similar results.</p><p>For detection of bursts at the single-unit level, bursts were defined as 3 or more spikes at a minimum of 50 Hz (see ‘single_unit_bursts.m’ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Source code 1</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Sacha Nelson, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the issue of whether or not firing rate homeostasis occurs primarily in individual neurons or at the network level is highly important and that the findings in your study may force revision of the dominant view that homeostasis is primarily cell autonomous. They also agreed that the data are of high quality. However several points need clarifying or shoring up.</p><p>The major concerns are primarily technical:</p><p>1) Some of the reviewers were concerned about how exactly firing rate variability was quantified and what it reflects. The text states that “time-points to be compared were divided into one minute bins”, but does not make clear the intervals used: was it an hour divided into minutes or some other interval? The key question is whether individual neurons are tending to different rates over long time scales (the implied interpretation) or are moving randomly up and down over shorter time scales (could even be hours) such that repeated sampling finds them in different states.</p><p>2) There is also a technical concern over the stability of the recordings. It is known that neurons in culture can move, thus potentially changing the set of cells sampled at each electrode. More should be done to convince the reader that sufficient stability has been achieved to rule out the possibility that variability reflects variability of the neurons recorded. The finding that multi-units also show variability is not a sufficient control for this.</p><p>3) The authors demonstrate that baclofen is still effective after two days but have they ruled out the possibility that the relevant G-protein signaling is highly desensitized? One way to address this is to monitor activity during the washout period. The prediction is that activity should rebound. This would then offer the opportunity to observe bi-directional changes in activity of single neurons to further demonstrate the concordance, or lack thereof, of single neuron and network activity. It would also be useful to do this for the CNQX experiment.</p><p>In addition, the reviewers felt that the Introduction and Discussion could be shortened and some hyperbole reduced. For example, appeals to more “physiological” manipulations may not be warranted, since it is not clear that massive GABA-B inhibition is physiological. It is also not correct that prior vertebrate in vitro studies have not looked at network activity, while it is certainly true that these studies did not monitor activity of individual neurons over time.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04378.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Some of the reviewers were concerned about how exactly firing rate variability was quantified and what it reflects.

The key question is whether individual neurons are tending to different rates over long time scales (the implied interpretation) or are moving randomly up and down over shorter time scales (could even be hours) such that repeated sampling finds them in different states</italic>.</p><p>We regret that the issue of time segments used was not clear. These issues are now addressed under the “Spike sorting” header of the Materials and methods section and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref>. All analyses of MEA recordings were performed using the first 20 minutes of each hour of recording. This was done because of the large volume of data collected during each experiment. In order to ensure that 20 minutes is a reliable representation of a full hour we compared the mean firing rate (MFR) of 792 20-minute segments with the full hour that they represent. We found that on average, the 20-minute average segment was only 5.1 ± 0.4% different from the full-hour average. Out of the 792 segments analyzed, 90% were within 10% and none was more than 20% different from the corresponding full hour average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4A</xref>).</p><p>In order to determine the statistical significance of the difference in MFR between two time-points we used a bootstrapping method. This was done by dividing the two time segments to be compared into bins of equal duration (for example, all data in the paper uses 20 minute time segments that were divided into 1 minute bins for bootstrapping analysis). MFR for each bin was then calculated. The bins were then randomized into two equal groups and the difference between the means of the randomized groups was calculated. The randomization was repeated 10,000 times to produce a null-distribution. The real MFR difference was significant only if it fell outside of the 95% confidence interval of the null distribution. To further ensure the validity of our data, we performed bootstrapping analyses of MFR while changing the different variables of the analysis. First, we tested whether the length of the time segment analyzed influenced the results. If 20 minute time segments are not sufficiently long to accurately represent the MFR over one-hour segments, increasing the duration of the time segments should change the results of the bootstrapping analysis. We saw no changes when performing bootstrapping analysis using time segments of 20 minutes, 1 hour or 2 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4C</xref>) and, therefore, conclude that our results are not due to sampling errors. Likewise, we ran the bootstrapping analysis while changing the bin size and the number of iterations used to create the null-distribution. The results were extremely stable to changes in these parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4D, E</xref>). We therefore conclude that our bootstrapping analysis is robust and represents true differences between MFRs of different time-points.</p><p>In order to further assess the minimal time required to avoid sampling errors we divided 8 consecutive hours of recording into time segments ranging from 10 seconds to 1 hour. We then calculated for each unit the coefficient of variation (CV) of the MFR for each segment size. Since CV assesses the variability of a given sample, we expected to reach a plateau for segment sizes long enough to reflect the intrinsic variability of the units. We found that the CV, when using time segments shorter than 10 minutes, indicated significantly higher variability compared to one-hour long segments. When increasing segment duration above 10 minutes, the CV stabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4B</xref>). From this, we conclude that 20 minutes is sufficient time to accurately represent the basal, intrinsic, firing rate variability while allowing us to make comparisons to other time-points.</p><p><italic>2) There is also a technical concern over the stability of the recordings. It is known that neurons in culture can move, thus potentially changing the set of cells sampled at each electrode. More should be done to convince the reader that sufficient stability has been achieved to rule out the possibility that variability reflects variability of the neurons recorded. The finding that multi-units also show variability is not a sufficient control for this</italic>.</p><p>A) In order to ensure stability of recorded populations we employed two complementary methods:</p><p>First, we acquired images both at the beginning and following 2 days of consecutive recording. In order to quantify the movement of single neurons we marked cells that appear well isolated and that could be reliably identified in both images. We then created a composite image using pairwise stitching in ImageJ (Preibisch et al., 2009) using the immobile electrodes as a reference points and measured cell-by-cell movement. In order to establish the accuracy of our measurements we repeated the measurement of 11 cells 10 times to establish the standard deviation of our measurement technique. The mean SD of the 11 cells was 0.29 ± 0.02 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>), showing that the measurements have a submicron level of accuracy. We next measured the movements of 100 cells and found a mean movement of 1.6 ± 0.1 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>). This is exceedingly small compared to the size of the neurons (11.4 ± 0.27 µm) and the 30 µM diameter of the recording electrode and therefore should not have a significant effect on the population recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-04378-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>Second, since spike waveforms are dependent, among other things, on the distance of the cell from the recording electrode (Nam et al., 2011), we would expect to see changes in waveform shape over time if there is significant movement. While performing spike sorting we indeed saw small drifts of waveform shape. However, in order to ensure the population stability, we only used units whose waveform remained highly separated throughout the recording. Units whose waveforms suddenly appeared or disappeared during the recording were not used for analysis.</p><p>The combination of these two methods, showing both physical and electrical evidence of population stability, suggest that the single-unit variability we observed was not contaminated by analysis of different sets of cells to any significant degree.</p><p>B) We used a different methodology—somatic calcium imaging—to directly address this question in visually identified neurons. We chose genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6f that displays single-action-potential sensitivity and broad dynamic range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). We showed that the Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic> amplitude of calcium transients is proportional to the number of spikes that triggered it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</xref>). To examine the stability of single neurons and neuronal populations at extended timescales, we performed time-lapse imaging of somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics during a baseline recording period, 10 minutes and 2 days following baclofen application. Our results show that while Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics at the population level was stable, 54% of neurons did not return to their baseline values following 2 days baclofen incubation. Thus, calcium imaging in visually identified neurons confirms electrophysiological data, strengthening our conclusion on stabilization of population dynamics despite imprecise homeostatic compensations of single neurons.</p><p><italic>3) The authors demonstrate that baclofen is still effective after two days but have they ruled out the possibility that the relevant G-protein signaling is highly desensitized? One way to address this is to monitor activity during the washout period. The prediction is that activity should rebound. This would then offer the opportunity to observe bi-directional changes in activity of single neurons to further demonstrate the concordance, or lack thereof, of single neuron and network activity. It would also be useful to do this for the CNQX experiment</italic>.</p><p>In order to fully rule out desensitization of G-protein signaling following prolonged exposure to baclofen, we recorded MEAs for 2 days in the presence of baclofen and subsequently washed the baclofen out of the recording chamber. We observed a significant increase in MFR to approximately 300% of MFR during both baseline and 2 day after baclofen addition (relative to baseline: 306% ± 67; relative to 2 days baclofen: 296% ± 38). This increase was observed at both the single unit and the network level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1B-D</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we saw no change in presynaptic sensitivity to baclofen, as measured using FM-dyes, after 2 days of baclofen incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1E, F</xref>).</p><p>Likewise, CNQX washout caused a significant increase in MFR to 212 ± 28% relative to baseline MFR and to 442 ± 67% relative to the MFR after two days of CNQX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We therefore conclude that both GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated G-protein signaling and AMPARs remain sensitive following two day exposure to baclofen and CNQX, respectively.</p><p><italic>In addition, the reviewers felt that the Introduction and Discussion could be shortened and some hyperbole reduced. For example, appeals to more “physiological” manipulations may not be warranted, since it is not clear that massive GABA-B inhibition is physiological. It is also not correct that prior vertebrate in vitro studies have not looked at network activity, while it is certainly true that these studies did not monitor activity of individual neurons over time</italic>.</p><p>Thanks, we followed these suggestions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
