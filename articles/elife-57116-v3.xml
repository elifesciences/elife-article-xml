genes for their survival. The Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) is an ongoing project to uncover these gene dependencies in hundreds of cancer cell lines. To make this drug discovery resource more accessible to the scientific community, we built an easy-to-use browser, shinyDepMap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://labsyspharm.shinyapps.io/depmap">https://labsyspharm.shinyapps.io/depmap</ext-link>). shinyDepMap combines CRISPR and shRNA data to determine, for each gene, the growth reduction caused by knockout/knockdown and the selectivity of this effect across cell lines. The tool also clusters genes with similar dependencies, revealing functional relationships. shinyDepMap can be used to (1) predict the efficacy and selectivity of drugs targeting particular genes; (2) identify maximally sensitive cell lines for testing a drug; (3) target hop, that is, navigate from an undruggable protein with the desired selectivity profile, such as an activated oncogene, to more druggable targets with a similar profile; and (4) identify novel pathways driving cancer cell growth and survival.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DepMap</kwd><kwd>shinyDepMap</kwd><kwd>precision medicine</kwd><kwd>essential genes</kwd><kwd>synthetic lethality</kwd><kwd>selectivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H29-814</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shimada</surname><given-names>Kenichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50GM107618</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shimada</surname><given-names>Kenichi</given-names></name><name><surname>Mitchison</surname><given-names>Timothy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM131753</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitchison</surname><given-names>Timothy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W911NF-15-1-0544</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bachman</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54-CA225088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muhlich</surname><given-names>Jeremy L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>shinyDepMap helps users explore the essentiality, selectivity, and function of the genes across hundreds of cancer cell lines and identify cancer drug targets.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer is a disease of the genome. Hundreds, if not thousands, of driver mutations cause cancer in different patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">MC3 Working Group et al., 2018</xref>), and extensive collaborative efforts such as the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) have helped discover them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2019</xref>). Targeted therapies, a type of precision medicine, aim to treat cancer by selectively killing cancer cells with a specific genotype and spectrum of driver mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Friedman et al., 2015</xref>). The underlying hypothesis is that cancers depend on essential genes that are not the same for all tissues, and that these conditionally essential genes constitute a druggable dependency—an ‘Achilles’ heel’—that can be exploited to develop targeted drugs with minimal toxicity. To achieve this goal, it is important to identify conditionally essential genes for all cancers. It is also important to group these conditionally essential genes into functionally related sets to maximize the chance of finding a druggable target within each set, such as a kinase or other enzyme.</p><p>The concept of essential vs. non-essential genes arose largely from genetic research in model organisms. Traditionally, it was considered a binary distinction that held across any genotype. However, loss of a given gene can decrease cell growth without killing the cell, so it is more realistic to assign a numerical value to the degree of essentiality, that is, the extent to which loss of a gene, or inhibition of its product, influences fitness. In cancer, this value may depend on the genotype, transcriptome, and lineage of the cell. In principle, genes that are only essential in a few cell types might make better drug targets since inhibiting their function is less likely to cause toxicity in non-cancer tissues. For example, the epidermal growth factor receptor is strongly required in certain cancer cells, but not in normal bone marrow stem cells, making it a potentially good target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) is an ongoing project to identify essential genes across hundreds of cancer cell lines using genome-wide CRISPR and shRNA screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behan et al., 2019</xref>). It has already been used successfully to discover cancer cells’ genetic vulnerabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sandoval et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>). These data represent a gold mine of useful information for biologists and drug developers, but can be challenging for non-bioinformaticians to manipulate and interpret.</p><p>The DepMap portal website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org/portal">https://depmap.org/portal</ext-link>) provides a range of information for each gene, including (1) the cell lines and lineages dependent on the gene; (2) co-dependent genes (i.e., other genes whose effects on growth are strongly positively or negatively correlated with the gene); and (3) basal transcript abundances, copy numbers, and mutations for the gene. However, the DepMap portal has no native tools to integrate CRISPR and shRNA or to examine functional relationships among essential genes beyond pairwise comparisons.</p><p>Here we describe shinyDepMap, a web tool to enable researchers to rapidly determine the essentiality and selectivity of a given gene across cell lines and to find groups of functionally related genes with similar essentiality profiles. shinyDepMap integrates data from both CRISPR and shRNA screens, yielding robust measures of the effects of gene loss on cell viability. From these combined effect scores, we derive two measures for each gene: the degree to which loss of the gene reduces cell growth in sensitive lines (‘efficacy’), and the degree to which its essentiality varies across lines (‘selectivity’). To help researchers identify potential therapeutic targets, we clustered genes with strong efficacy scores into functional units, many of which represent complexes or biological pathways, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). The results of this analysis are accessible via a simple interactive web tool at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://labsyspharm.shinyapps.io/depmap">https://labsyspharm.shinyapps.io/depmap</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Assessment of consistency between CRISPR and shRNA dependency scores</title><p>The DepMap project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org/">https://depmap.org/</ext-link>) provides two separate preprocessed genome-wide genetic perturbation datasets for hundreds of cell lines using either shRNA or CRISPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Meyers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McFarland et al., 2018</xref>). In both datasets, the preprocessed scores represent the growth effects of knocking the gene down or out, with a strongly negative value in a particular cell line indicating essentiality. Though the preprocessing algorithms for the shRNA data take ‘off-target’ genes into account when generating essentiality scores, we nevertheless expected that the essentiality profiles would differ somewhat between shRNA and CRISPR due to their distinct mechanisms of reducing gene expression.</p><p>To assess the consistency between CRISPR and shRNA dependency scores, we first compared the gene/cell line combinations tested with both methods (15,847 genes in 423 cell lines, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) and computed essentiality thresholds for each distribution such that a dependency score more negative than the threshold is considered essential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; 'Materials and methods'). These thresholds define the subsets of cell line/gene combinations that are determined to be essential by either CRISPR or shRNA but not both (areas A and B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The two methods were somewhat consistent on average, with both methods yielding approximately normal dependency score distributions with mean zero and a left-skewing tail corresponding to the subset of essential genes (Pearson correlation 0.456, Spearman correlation 0.201).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Systematic biases in CRISPR and shRNA dependency scores.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of normalized CRISPR and shRNA dependency scores of 15,847 protein-encoding genes in 423 cell lines. The density and contour plot corresponds to the distribution of the scores from all gene perturbations.

First, CRISPR tends to detect weak to moderate gene deletion effects more sensitively, as evidenced by the greater density of CRISPR-essential genes above the diagonal in the joint distribution plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For example, while both methods identify RAN, CRISPR identifies CCND1 as more essential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Second, some genes were shown essential only by CRISPR or shRNA, but not by the other method (e.g., FOXD4 and EIF5B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To better understand these inconsistent dependencies, we used Fisher’s exact test to determine which genes, across their perturbations in all 423 cell lines, were enriched for inconsistent dependencies. We found that 958 and 20 genes were claimed commonly essential only by CRISPR or shRNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, these two sets of inconsistently essential genes are enriched for involvement in distinct pathways: for example, tRNA metabolic process and mitochondrial translation are overrepresented in the CRISPR-only set, whereas cytosolic translation initiation is overrepresented in the shRNA-only set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This suggests that CRISPR and shRNA have distinct biases in assessing some genes’ essentiality, affecting different classes of genes. While CRISPR is considered to be less susceptible to off-target effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Smith et al., 2017</xref>) and thus now generally preferred over shRNA, the results and their therapeutic relevance may also depend on the genes of interest. For example, EIF5B, a gene involved in translation initiation, is highly conserved throughout Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, suggesting that it may be essential for most human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sørensen et al., 2001</xref>). However, only shRNA, but not CRISPR, highlighted it as an essential gene. A method that can combine the two dependency scores would compensate for each other's artifacts and give more robust scores.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A new dependency score combining CRISPR and shRNA</title><p>To summarize both CRISPR and shRNA dependency scores, <italic>S<sup>C</sup></italic> and <italic>S<sup>R</sup></italic>, we developed a new dependency score by combining them.

Overall, we found that 1050 genes are commonly essential across all the lineages, 670 genes are essential in at least one lineage, and 2581 essential genes were not lineage-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

We found that most genes with high selectivity scores were also identified as targets for one or more lineages in their analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). On the other hand, targets proposed for multiple lineages in Behan et al.

Conventionally, high selectivity is interpreted as being commonly essential within a few lineages but non-essential in others. Some genes do manifest this type of selectivity (e.g., broad dependence on CTNNB1 in colorectal cancer, MYB in leukemia, IRF4 in multiple myeloma, KRAS in pancreatic cancer, and SOX10 in skin cancer, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), but such common essentiality within a lineage is relatively unusual. In many more cases, a gene that shows high selectivity is selectively essential within each lineage (e.g., only partial dependence on CTNNB1 in liver, lung, and pancreatic cancers, or on IRF4 in skin cancer). CDK4 is a particularly strong example of this pattern as it is not commonly essential in any lineages, but is selectively essential in many.

When a set of genes comprise a functional unit (e.g., a pathway or a complex) that regulates cell viability, these genes would be expected to have similar dependency profiles. Gene-wise cluster analysis of the dependency data should therefore reveal functional units that connect essential genes into pathways or protein complexes. It may also be easier to relate the essentiality of pathways to cancer genotypes than to interpret the essentiality of individual genes. Pathway analysis can help identify druggable vulnerabilities at the pathway level that might be missed by single-gene analysis.</p><p>We clustered essential genes based on the similarity of the combined CRISPR-shRNA dependency scores across 423 cell lines. Our approach is based on a related pair of popular algorithms, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and density-based spatial clustering and noise (DBSCAN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">van der Maaten, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ester et al., 1996</xref>). t-SNE is a technique that reduces the dimensionality of multidimensional data while preserving the pairwise distances between data points at high dimensions as much as possible. It has been widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data, such as single-cell RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mass et al., 2016</xref>). DBSCAN is a clustering algorithm that detects regions where the data points are gathered at high density and clusters them; it is often used to cluster data points based on their coordinates in the t-SNE plot. The combination of t-SNE and DBSCAN (expressed as ‘t-SNE + DBSCAN’ hereafter) is a powerful clustering algorithm for high-dimensional data, such as single-cell transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Haber et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>One limitation of this approach is that the t-SNE algorithm is stochastic, producing different results and clusters with different initial seeds. However, when we compared clusters yielded by t-SNE + DBSCAN from multiple runs, we found that strongly positively correlated points are always clustered together while weakly positively correlated points are less consistently so. To obtain robust cluster assignments from t-SNE + DBSCAN, we therefore used a workflow we call <italic>e</italic>nsemble <italic>c</italic>lustering with <italic>h</italic>ierarchy <italic>o</italic>ver <italic>D</italic>BSCAN <italic>o</italic>n <italic>t</italic>-SNE with <italic>S</italic>pearman distance matrix (ECHODOTS).</p><p>Briefly, ECHODOTS consists of four steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>): it (1) computes the pairwise Spearman distance matrix among essential genes, (2) feeds the distance matrix as input to run t-SNE with different initial seeds 200 times, (3) clusters data points based on their coordinates in the t-SNE plot with DBSCAN, and (4) identifies the sets of genes assigned to the same cluster consistently across the 200 sets of clusters using a technique called ensemble clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hornik, 2005</xref>).

Genes in the same cluster tended to be close to each other on t-SNE maps from individual runs, and some clusters were enriched for genes known to be members of specific biological pathways or complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). The median efficacy and selectivity of the clusters varied widely, suggesting that some represent more promising sets of drug targets than others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>).</p><p>In examining the clusters, we found that they often included genes that were not all mutually correlated with one another. While strongly positively correlated genes tend to be located in the same neighborhood on the t-SNE map and subsequently clustered together in ECHODOTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), for a gene to be added to a cluster it only needs to be correlated with at least one other gene in the cluster. The structure of the correlations among the genes within a cluster can therefore highlight subtle functional relationships. For example, we plotted the correlations among six highly essential genes in cluster S152, with an edge between genes indicating a Spearman correlation greater than 0.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In this cluster, KEAP1 and KCTD10 are both strongly correlated with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL3 (with correlations of 0.387 and 0.29, respectively), but have no correlation with each other (correlation −0.002). This is likely due to the fact that KEAP1 and KCTD10 interact with CUL3 in a mutually exclusive manner: both serve as adaptor proteins binding the same site on CUL3 but the resulting complexes degrade distinct target proteins (NFE2L2 and RHOB, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cullinan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kovačević et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Perhaps more intriguing are clusters that appear to show a connection between specific cellular processes and genes not otherwise known to be involved in that process. We offer two examples. One is cluster L119 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), which comprises three small clusters. Clusters S369 and S745 contain the core MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway proteins, including KRAS, RAF1, BRAF, and MAPK1, while cluster S641 consists of CTNNB1 (β-catenin) and TCF7L2, which form a bipartite transcription factor complex that is a key effector of the Wnt signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jin and Liu, 2008</xref>). These small clusters are within the same large cluster, suggesting that MAPK and Wnt signaling are functionally related in dependent cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jeong et al., 2018</xref>). Cluster L119 also contains SHOC2, which was positively correlated to KRAS, RAF1, BRAF, and MAPK1. Multiple KRAS-mutant cancers were recently shown to be vulnerable to the loss of SHOC2 in the context of MEK inhibition, confirming the link between SHOC2 and MAP kinase pathway-driven cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sulahian et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A final example is the cluster L91 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), also consisting of multiple smaller clusters. Cluster S154 contains the selenoprotein GPX4. GPX4 encodes glutathione peroxidase 4, an antioxidant enzyme, that reduces cytotoxic lipid peroxides and protects cells from a non-apoptotic cell death, called ferroptosis. Intriguingly, we found that the other genes in cluster S154 were involved in selenoprotein synthesis (SEPHS2, SEPSECS, PSTK, EFFSEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Squires and Berry, 2008</xref>), suggesting that the primary role of these genes in dependent cell lines is to synthesize GPX4. S572 contains another selenoprotein TXNRD1 and its substrate, TXNDC17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Espinosa and Arnér, 2019</xref>), both of which are also strongly correlated with four selenoprotein synthesis genes. Overall, L91 seems to represent a gene set related to the sensitivity to ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdalkader et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ingold et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Comparison between different dependency scores</title><p>We have so far computed the efficacy, selectivity, and clusters of essential genes using <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf61"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> with the fixed mixing ratio, <italic>θ</italic> = 0.6, since this <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf62"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup> <mml:mi/></mml:math></inline-formula> retains the largest variance of the original CRISPR and shRNA scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Since the number of discovered essential genes varies with different <italic>θ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), we expect the number of clusters to be different.

By further selecting a matched gene from the dropdown menu (<bold>2</bold>), one can see the combined dependency scores of the gene in 423 cell lines in the ‘Dependency scores’ tab on the right (<bold>5</bold>). The definition of combined dependency scores, efficacy, and selectivity can be changed by tuning the mix ratio (equivalent to <italic>θ</italic>; <bold>6</bold>) and efficacy threshold (X-th percentile, <bold>7</bold>) from the input panel. We set them <italic>θ</italic> = 0.6 and X = 1 by default.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Gene cluster (essential genes) </title><p>This app allows a user to explore gene clusters among the essential genes. When a user first selects an essential gene from the top-left dropdown menu (<bold>8</bold>), genes clustered with the query gene will be shown on the output panels. There are three output panels in the app. The top-center is the efficacy–selectivity plot for the essential genes (<bold>9</bold>). The bottom-center shows the t-SNE plot, indicating the similarity of the dependency scores among essential genes (<bold>10</bold>). The list of ‘Clustered genes’ will be shown in the right panel (<bold>11</bold>). ‘Connectivity’ tab will show how the clustered genes are connected (i.e., strongly correlated) (<bold>12</bold>). The graphs can be downloaded in the GraphML format. ‘Correlation’ tab shows the Spearman correlation coefficients between the selected gene and other essential genes grouped by the clusters (<bold>13</bold>). While all the genes in the small cluster are shown by default, one can change it by tuning the ‘cluster size’ parameter (<bold>14</bold>) and the probability threshold (<bold>15</bold>) in the left input panel. In ECHODOTS, we computed a probability at which each gene belongs to the assigned cluster. By setting the probability threshold close to one, one can show only genes that are assigned to the same clusters consistently across many runs of t-SNE + DBSCAN. This app allows the users to tune the mix ratio (<bold>16</bold>) and efficacy threshold (<bold>17</bold>) like the Gene essentiality app. Essential genes were defined based on these two parameters. Consequently, modifying these parameters affects the clusters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we described an interactive software tool, shinyDepMap, that allows users to rapidly determine the efficacy and selectivity of a gene of interest and thereby find highly selective genes that may offer promising therapeutic targets. shinyDepMap is based on both the CRISPR and shRNA genome-wide screening DepMap datasets, which we combined to generate a unified dependency score that is more informative than data from either dataset alone. Using this combined dependency score, we computed ‘efficacy’ and ‘selectivity’ scores for each gene and highlighted how these scores can be used to characterize the therapeutic potential of targeting different genes across cell lines and lineages. Finally, we performed robust clustering of commonly and selectively essential genes to highlight functional relationships. shinyDepMap allows users to interactively explore both the essentiality and clustering results and is available as a deployed web-based application at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://labsyspharm.shinyapps.io/depmap">https://labsyspharm.shinyapps.io/depmap</ext-link> and via source code or Docker image.</p><p>Our cluster analysis of the dependency scores highlighted genes comprising complexes and pathways, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). Our research complements published work in the area of complex and pathway annotation, in part because we were able to combine both DepMap datasets. We provide cluster information in a browsable form in shinyDepMap, including the ability to tune the size of clusters. One application of this tool is ‘target hopping’, that is, moving from one drug target to another while keeping the selectivity profile similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Schenone et al., 2013</xref>). One goal of target hopping is to identify druggable targets with similar dependency score profiles to genes of interest that are not conventionally druggable. A classic example is KRAS, which is essential to many cancers but until recently has been considered ‘undruggable’. KRAS appears in cluster L119 with the druggable kinases RAF1 and MAPK1, highlighting these proteins as relevant alternative targets. One goal of shinyDepMap is to help researchers identify similar therapeutic opportunities among less well-studied genes.</p><p>Despite its potential value for therapeutic discovery, the DepMap dataset and our corresponding analysis in shinyDepMap have important practical limitations. The DepMap data characterizes the genetic requirements for cells grown in culture, which differs from the in vivo tumor environment in critical ways: the presence of nutrient-rich media, a two-dimensional rather than a three-dimensional substrate, and the lack of a functional immune system or physiological microenvironment. In addition, the effects of genetic perturbations (knockdown and knockout) do not necessarily correspond to those of chemical inhibition, a discrepancy that makes target identification from datasets like the DepMap less straightforward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weiss et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, because the DepMap includes only cultured cancer lines and no wild-type cell lines or tissues, a highly selective gene in our analysis is not guaranteed to be less toxic to normal tissues when inhibited. Provided these limitations are kept in mind, the DepMap is a powerful resource and we hope the shinyDepMap tool makes it accessible to a broad community of researchers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data and code availability statement</title><p>The following data of the 2019 Q3 release were downloaded from the DepMap project website: CRISPR (avana) (‘Achilles_gene_effect.csv’), combined RNAi (‘D2_combined_gene_dep_scores.csv’), and the cell line metadata (‘sample_info.csv’). The CRISPR and shRNA efficacy data provided by the DepMap project were normalized with CERES and DEMETER2 algorithms by the Broad Institute, respectively. To compute the combined dependency score, we use the data of 15,847 genes in 423 cell lines, which were examined with both CRISPR and shRNA.

In total, 15,847 genes were perturbed using both methods in 423 cell lines, and we compared 4,846,055 conditions that were non-missing values. Here, one condition is defined as a perturbation of one gene, either using CRISPR or shRNA in one cell line. We next imputed missing values in CRISPR and shRNA datasets using non-missing data from the other method. In total, 1,345,642 conditions (20%) were tested using CRISPR, but not shRNA. Also, 19,001 (0.28%) were tested using shRNA, but not CRISPR. In these cases, the missing values were imputed from the other data using local polynomial regression (loess) function in R. In total, 4457 (0.066%) conditions were not tested by either CRISPR or shRNA, which were left as missing. After missing values were imputed, the combined dependency score from two values was computed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Computing the dependency score combining CRISPR and shRNA data</title><p>In this method section, we use <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf65"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> instead of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf66"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> to represent the dependency score of gene <italic>G</italic> in cell line <italic>L</italic> to make the argument clearer.

We sorted all the genes by efficacy and selectivity in descending order and ran gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with the sorted genes against the pathways from MSigDB. GSEA was performed utilizing fgsea package with 10<sup>7</sup> permutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sergushichev, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Identifying lineage-specific and universally essential genes</title><p>To compute the lineage specificity, we utilized ADaM. ADaM calculates the minimum number of dependent cell lines that are required for a gene to be considered as commonly essential among the cell lines in question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behan et al., 2019</xref>). It is implemented in the ADAM2 R package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/DepMap-Analytics/ADAM2">https://github.com/DepMap-Analytics/ADAM2</ext-link>).

We then provided a subset of the matrix attributed to each lineage as input and calculated the minimum number of dependent cell lines for the lineage. Each lineage is considered dependent on <italic>G</italic> when the number of dependent cell lines in the lineage is equal to or greater than the minimum number of dependent cell lines. To compute universally essential genes utilizing ADaM, we calculated the binary essential matrix for the 17 lineages instead of cell lines and the minimum number of dependent lineages providing the matrix as input.</p><p>Behan et al. also provide a list of genes that are good targets for chemotherapies for each lineage. We counted the number of lineages they suggested was a good target for each gene and mapped them onto the efficacy/selectivity plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Robust cluster analysis utilizing t-SNE and DBSCAN: ECHODOTS</title><p>We implemented a new cluster algorithm, ECHODOTS, extending the combination of t-SNE and DBSCAN. It is graphically summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, and its pseudocode is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>First, we computed the Spearman distance matrix or 1-Spearman correlation coefficient across all pairs of essential genes (line (1) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This matrix was provided as input, and the coordinates of each data point in a 2D plane were computed with t-SNE (line (2)). Next, we clustered data points based on their coordinates with DBSCAN such that any two points whose distance is smaller than the neighborhood threshold ε are assigned into the same cluster (line (4)). We note that the range of the coordinates, <italic>L</italic>, varies among different runs of t-SNE. It is more reasonable to make the denominator <italic>d</italic> constant rather than to make ε constant; therefore, we determined ε relative to <italic>L</italic>: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf106"><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (line (3)). The resulting cluster set <italic>C</italic> was computed by DBSCAN using <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf107"><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> derived from the preset parameter <italic>d</italic> (line (4)), which we set an integer ranging from 30 to 200. We ran t-SNE and DBSCAN to compute <italic>C</italic> 200 times using different initial seeds.</p><p>Next, we computed consistent clusters <italic>CC</italic> across 200 cluster sets <italic>C</italic> for each <italic>d</italic> (or equivalently ε) using ensemble clustering available in clue R package (line (5)). When <italic>d</italic> is too small, (ε is too large), most of the points are erroneously connected. The mean size and total number of consistent clusters depend on the neighborhood threshold ε. The smallest ε yields the largest number of small clusters, in which data points within each cluster are most tightly connected. The largest ε yields the smallest number of large clusters, in which data points within each cluster are most loosely connected. When ε is too large (correspondingly, <italic>d</italic> was too small), most genes form one massive cluster in an extreme case. To avoid this, we set a lower bound for <italic>d</italic> or equivalently upper bound for ε such that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf108"><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> (line (6)). We determined <italic>d<sub>0</sub></italic> by looking at the ratio between the sizes of the first and second largest clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). When ε gets smaller (<italic>d</italic> gets larger), clusters get smaller and tighter. With smaller ε, some genes are not clustered with any other genes. We called these genes forming clusters only by themselves ‘noise’ and distinguished them from other clusters containing more than one gene. Eventually, all the genes become isolated or noise, but we stopped our analysis far ahead (<italic>d</italic> = 200). When <italic>θ</italic> = 0.6, we chose three different values of <italic>d</italic> (<italic>d</italic> = 65, 100, 141), which discovered 338, 608, and 879 clusters (line (7)). Most of the smaller clusters derived with larger <italic>d</italic> were contained in the larger clusters derived with smaller <italic>d</italic>. Therefore, we constructed a hierarchical relationship between the three sets of clusters. There were a few cases where a gene belongs to distinct clusters with different <italic>d,</italic> but the smaller cluster is not a part of the larger cluster and thus the hierarchy is not constructed.</p><p>Note that DBSCAN is a hard clustering algorithm that assigns each gene into only one cluster. Once clustered, both strongly and weakly correlated genes become indistinguishable in hard clusters. On the other hand, ECHODOTS performs a soft clustering that can assign each gene to more than one cluster. It conducts the ‘majority vote’ among 200 runs of the clustering and computes the probability of a point being assigned to each cluster, which provides us with the strength of evidence for the cluster assignment of each gene. Thus, ECHODOTS produces more reliable clusters than a single run of t-SNE + DBSCAN by seeking data points that are consistently clustered together.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Implementation of shinyDepMap website</title><p>shinyDepMap was built using shiny package.

However, all of the reviewers have identified multiple weaknesses in the submitted work, bearing on the capacity of the tool to yield a measurable benefit over what is currently available; the significance of the biological insights reported; and the clarity of the presentation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The main strength of the work is combining into a single measure CRISPR and shRNA screening data from DepMap and providing a very convenient interface to explore these data. The approach is plausible and the trade-off between streamlining the exploration vs increased difficulty in interpretation is reasonable. The web-based interface is easy to use, and most of the limitations in the data analysis are clearly described. As such, the tools could be used by the community and the paper deserves to be published after a revision.</p><p>The biggest problem with the paper itself is the way it is written, which appears to be in a big haste. Multiple terms are used to describe the same thing (like &quot;dependency score&quot; and &quot;perturbation score&quot;). Sometimes the sentences appear to have self-contradictions (like &quot;The median cluster size is 6, 4, and 3 genes for small, medium, or large clusters, respectively&quot;).

The approach is plausible and the trade-off between streamlining the exploration vs increased difficulty in interpretation is reasonable. The web-based interface is easy to use, and most of the limitations in the data analysis are clearly described. As such, the tools could be used by the community and the paper deserves to be published after a revision.</p><p>The biggest problem with the paper itself is the way it is written, which appears to be in a big haste. Multiple terms are used to describe the same thing (like &quot;dependency score&quot; and &quot;perturbation score&quot;). Sometimes the sentences appear to have self-contradictions (like &quot;The median cluster size is 6, 4, and 3 genes for small, medium, or large clusters, respectively&quot;). References in text to Figure panels are frequently not matching (e.g., the sentence &quot;We developed a new gene dependency metric, termed &quot;perturbation score&quot; &quot; refers to Figure 2B, which is just a set of violin plots showing &quot;The perturbation score profiles of the same four genes as in A.&quot;).

We described the thresholds using “percentile” instead of “number of cell lines” in the manuscript. Moreover, we now allow users to choose from five different thresholds, namely the X-th percentiles where X = 1, 2.5, 5, 10, and 25, to define the efficacy and selectivity in shinyDepMap; small (large) X identifies genes that are required by the small (large) number of cell lines for survival.</p><p>As for the second point, genes whose loss promotes growth have the efficacy close to zero and the large positive selectivity. These 45 growth-suppressing genes (which tend to be well-known tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53, PTEN, CDKN1A) are shown as red points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> (overlaid in Figure 3C).

What is the relation between genes identified as such in this study and in DepMap? A supplementary figure (Venn diagrams) and/or table may illustrate the overlap.</p></disp-quote><p>The designations (common essential and strongly selective) in the DepMap portal are determined as follows: a common essential gene is a “gene which, in a large, pan-cancer screen, ranks in the top X most depleting genes in at least 90% of cell lines. X is chosen empirically using the minimum of the distribution of gene ranks in their 90<sup>th</sup> percentile least depleting lines.” A strongly selective gene is defined as a “gene whose dependency is at least 100 times more likely to have been sampled from a skewed distribution than a normal distribution.”</p><p>The designations given by this definition is often inconsistent between CRISPR and shRNA and unintuitive. For example, the CCND1 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>) is marked as common essential and non-essential, according to CRISPR and RNAi (<italic>i.e.</italic>, shRNA). In our definition, the CCND1 gene was one of the most selectively essential gene, based on the distribution of the perturbation score, which we think is a more appropriate designation based on the distributions of both CRISPR and RNAi. Their designations are not available to download in the DepMap data repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org/portal/download/">https://depmap.org/portal/download/</ext-link>), so we did not incorporate the comparison between our analysis and their analysis in this paper.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57116-resp-fig2-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is not quite clear what in Figure S1B is illustrated which would be not clear from S1A.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript, Figure S1A shows that there are more conditions (i.e., combinations of gene targets and cell lines) on that CRISPR induced more negative scores than shRNA. Box A corresponds to conditions that only the CRISPR found essential, but shRNA did not, while Box B corresponds to conditions that shRNA found essential, but CRISPR did not. Figure S1B looks at the same thing at the gene level; we assessed whether each gene that was targeted by both CRISPR and shRNA are found essential only by CRISPR but not by shRNA, only by shRNA but not by CRISPR. It is equivalent to ask whether data points (CRISPR and shRNA scores) from targeting one gene in all the cell lines are more overrepresented within Box A or Box B using Fisher’s exact test. Figure S1B shows that more genes were overrepresented within Box A than within Box B, confirming that more genes were found essential only by CRISPR than only by shRNA.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we rewrote this section (Figure 1) entirely. We first compared CRISPR and shRNA and discovered genes that were found commonly essential by only one of the two methods, and showed that their biases were not random but represent distinct biological functions. We next showed that the new dependency score combining the two methods were more beneficial that cover most of the commonly essential genes found by either method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Selectivity is already a very vague notion, because it can arise from differences between cell types, or from the presence/absence of mutation in certain gene(s), etc. Median selectivity, used in Figure 4F, is trickier still, because different genes in the cluster may have different sources of selectivity. While Figure 4F is, indeed, a good way to illustrate a diversity of identified clusters, a word of caution would help to avoid overinterpreting the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer on this point. As suggested by reviewer #2, we explained whether the genes’ selectivity can be explained by the tissue-specific dependency or not, using the ADaM algorithm in the revised manuscript. In short, we see highly selectivity is due to strong lineage-dependence in some cases while in in many more cases it cannot be explained solely by that. In the latter case, mutations in certain genes might be a more significant determinant of the dependency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the application itself, Gene Clusters are very nicely presented in the Connectivity view.

While CRISPR tends to have much less off-target effect than shRNA, it still cannot be completely independent of artifacts, just like any other experimental techniques. The combination of the two methods should reduce the biases of either. As mentioned above, we also looked at genes that were found essential only by CRISPR or shRNA, but not the other method.

Both?</p></disp-quote><p>We relied on the combination of t-SNE and DBSCAN, which we would say an emerging state of the art cluster algorithm. But we combined them with ensemble clustering to overcome a couple of issues. First, t-SNE was a stochastic algorithm, and some genes can be erroneously assigned to wrong clusters in one run, and second, this is a hard clustering algorithm (<italic>i.e.</italic>, each gene assigned to a one and only one cluster, so we cannot tell which genes are mistakenly clustered). Our rationale for implementing ECHODOTS is to compute a probability of a gene belonging to each cluster, making the hard cluster algorithm into a soft cluster algorithm. Our approach reasonably eliminates genes that are not clustered to the same cluster reproducibly. To emphasize the soft clustering feature of ECHODOTS more clearly, we introduced “probability threshold” selection bar in the shinyDepMap; genes assigned to a cluster with the high probability guarantees that the assignment of the gene to the cluster is highly consistently among multiple runs of t-SNE and DBSCAN.</p><p>We understand that the reviewer’s concern that each cluster may not always have more than one gene. We simply defined that each cluster should have more than one gene and we treated clusters containing only one gene as “noise”. We inherited this definition from original DBSCAN (M Hahsler, <italic>et al.</italic>, Journal of Statistical Software, 2019). There are also other cluster-with-noise algorithms. For example, the finite mixture model, also known as model-based clustering, implements this (Fraley and Raftery, Journal of Classification 20:263-286, 2003).</p><p>The data used for clustering was the perturbation scores (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the linear combination of CRISPR and shRNA dependency scores) of essential genes.

Our most significant contribution is the creation of shinyDepMap, which is to remove a barrier for experimental biologists to access the DepMap resource with the right questions in mind. Among the three areas pointed out by this reviewer, we emphasize that the clustering of essential genes (not all the genes) is our significant scientific contribution. The introduction of the perturbation score and the efficacy is the building blocks for it. Our clustering approach is an extension of t-SNE + DBSCAN, as mentioned above. The unrivaled quality and scale of the DepMap data helped us perform outstanding clustering compared to what was performed by others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the shiny app itself, it is a very basic exploratory tool.

However, users are satisfied with what we provide through our personal communication, and we would like to keep it simple and straightforward for broader users. We are also concerned about the quality of information we would provide if we add biomarkers to the tool. We have performed the biomarker discovery from functional (chemical treatment) and transcriptome data in the past (<italic>e.g.</italic>, Shimada K, et al. <italic>Cell Chem Biol</italic>. 2016 and 2018), and it is technically infeasible. In the previous works, we validated the findings experimentally. However, in the analyses, we realized that the transcriptional or genetic biomarker search generates a lot of false-positive hypotheses, which can be distinguished from true-positive hypotheses only through experimental validation. Thus, we think the quality of biomarker prediction should be substantially lower than that of our clustering, and we cautiously decided not to add them to shinyDepMap because not all the users of the tool would be experienced to distinguish their difference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, Shimada et al. develop a tool called shinyDepMap to enable the non-expert bioinformatician to analyze cancer dependency datasets through a user friendly interface.

Moreover, shinyapps.io’s dynamic architecture is scalable and is supposed to handle copes with the larger bandwidth and demand expected upon its publication without decreasing the performance. Regarding the domain name, we believe the searchability on Google is more important than the domain name. Currently, our manuscript uploaded on biorxiv is seen on one of the top hits when the term “depmap” is searched on Google, and it will likely be replaced by the paper published on a peer-reviewed journal. Thus, we do not plan to get a new domain name. When we access to shinyDepMap, it usually takes 5-20 seconds before the landing page is shown, which is considerably fast for a shiny app. If this reviewer constantly experiences longer wait time than this, we would like to figure out why the delay is caused.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful if in addition to the interactive graphs which are very helpful, if the tool would export data in PDF/JPG for publication purposes as well as a tabular format for each cell line/perturbation score.

If the data exists, it would be extremely helpful to recompute selectivity comparing cancer/non-cancer cells and reproducing Figure 3E for such a comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We examined whether the selectivity is due to tissue specificity or not. Unfortunately, the dependency data of the corresponding normal cells are not available in DepMap, so we could not perform the analysis as this reviewer suggested although we agree that such analysis would be strongly valuable if feasible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, it would be very helpful for the user to be able to select a subset of cell lines to perform pairwise analysis. For example if a user would like to ask what genes are essential for cell lines harboring a KRAS mutation vs cells without a KRAS mutation, having the ability to perform pairwise analysis and displaying the data for pre-selected cell lines based on a specific feature/histology would be extremely helpful and significantly expand the value of this tool. I realize that this would necessitate incorporating the mutational annotation and copy number annotation of each cell line but perhaps the effort would be well worth it if feasible.</p></disp-quote><p>We do agree that such analysis would be strongly beneficial, but we think that it is beyond the scope of this paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
