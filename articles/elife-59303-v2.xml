transcribed as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) acting in the cytoplasm with largely unknown functions. Surprisingly, lncRNAs have been shown to interact with ribosomes, encode peptides, or act as ribosome sponges. These functions still remain mostly undetected and understudied owing to the lack of efficient tools for genome-wide simultaneous identification of ribosome-associated and peptide-producing lncRNAs. Here, we present AHA-mediated RIBOsome isolation (AHARIBO), a method for the detection of lncRNAs either untranslated, but associated with ribosomes, or encoding small peptides. Using AHARIBO in mouse embryonic stem cells during neuronal differentiation, we isolated ribosome-protected RNA fragments, translated RNAs, and corresponding de novo synthesized peptides. Besides identifying mRNAs under active translation and associated ribosomes, we found and distinguished lncRNAs acting as ribosome sponges or encoding micropeptides, laying the ground for a better functional understanding of hundreds of lncRNAs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LncRNA</kwd><kwd>proteogenomics</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>RIBO-seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Autonomous Province of Trento</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LP6/99</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Minati</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name><name><surname>Firrito</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name><name><surname>Del Piano</surname><given-names>Alessia</given-names></name><name><surname>Peretti</surname><given-names>Alberto</given-names></name><name><surname>Bernabo</surname><given-names>Paola</given-names></name><name><surname>Clamer</surname><given-names>Massimiliano</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Detection of translated lncRNAs through selective isolation of active ribosomes, ribosome-associated RNAs and corresponding de novo synthesised peptides.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An incredibly small fraction of the mammalian genome is protein-coding (&lt;3%), while the number of potentially functional non-coding genes remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Djebali et al., 2012</xref>). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as non-coding RNA exceeding 200 nt. They have gained much attention because of their role in a variety of cellular processes, from chromatin architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Minajigi et al., 2015</xref>) to mRNA turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kleaveland et al., 2018</xref>) and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>). Typically, lncRNAs are abundant transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iyer et al., 2015</xref>) that display short and not evolutionarily conserved Open Reading Frames (ORFs with minimal homology to known protein domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guttman and Rinn, 2012</xref>). The majority of lncRNAs are localized in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carlevaro-Fita et al., 2016</xref>), where they are supposed to remain untranslated. Ribosome profiling (RIBO-seq), which provides positional information of ribosomes along transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clamer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ingolia et al., 2012</xref>), identified several ribosome-associated lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bazzini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). A handful of lncRNAs have been shown to be involved in translation regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carrieri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yoon et al., 2012</xref>), while others are themselves potentially or partially translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aspden et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bazin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ruiz-Orera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Heesch et al., 2019</xref>). As coding RNAs, lncRNAs can be associated with actively translating or translationally silent ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chandrasekaran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jiao and Meyerowitz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kapur et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, the potential involvement of lncRNAs in translation increases the complexity of the mammalian control of gene expression at the translatome and proteome level. Unfortunately, classical RIBO-seq approaches barely distinguish between lncRNAs producing peptides from those that sequester ribosomes (lncRNA bound to ribosomes without translation) and act as ribosome sponges. Proteomics approaches, such as mass spectrometry, can help to define and quantitatively monitor the production of peptides, but are less sensitive techniques than RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Slavoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Heesch et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, proteomics and RIBO-seq alone cannot unravel the wide functional range of cytoplasmic lncRNAs associated with the translation machinery.</p><p>To fill this gap, we developed AHA-mediated RIBOsome isolation (AHARIBO), a combination of protocols that simultaneously isolate RNAs and nascent proteins associated with translationally active ribosomes. AHARIBO is based on the isolation of ribosomes trapped with their nascent peptides by incorporating the non-canonical amino acid L-azidohomoalanine (AHA), followed by parallel RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and proteomics.</p><p>We applied AHARIBO to human and mouse cells and showed that it enables to (1) purify translating ribosomes via nascent peptide chains, (2) co-purify RNAs and proteins for transcriptome/de novo proteome-associated studies, and (3) detect the regulatory network of lncRNAs translated or associated with ribosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nascent peptide labeling and separation of the ribosome complex with AHARIBO-rC</title><p>To simultaneously purify ribosomes under active translation, associated RNAs, and corresponding growing peptide chains, we optimized a protocol in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Briefly, the protocol consists of the following phases: (1) incubation with a methionine-depleted medium, (2) addition of the methionine analog AHA, (3) on-ribosome anchorage of nascent peptide chains with a small molecule, (4) cell lysis and AHA ‘copper-free click reaction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jewett and Bertozzi, 2010</xref>) for (5) ribosome capture with magnetic beads. We reasoned that the protocol for isolating ribosomes through AHA can be used to obtain information about nascent peptides, constitutive components of ribosomes, mRNAs, and lncRNAs associated with them. For this reason, we optimized several parameters from washing steps to nuclease treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to isolate (1) the full translational complex (AHARIBO-rC, <italic>r</italic>ibosomal <italic>c</italic>omplexes: ribosomes, ribosome-associated proteins, nascent peptides, and RNAs), (2) the de novo synthesized proteome (AHARIBO-nP, <italic>n</italic>ascent <italic>p</italic>roteome), and (3) ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) (AHARIBO RIBO-seq: <italic>RIBO</italic>some profiling by <italic>seq</italic>uencing).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>L-Azidohomoalanine (AHA) labeling of nascent peptide chains and ribosome separation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of AHA-mediated RIBOsome isolation (AHARIBO) workflow.

Anisomycin is known to inhibit the activity of eukaryotic ribosomes, while keeping polypeptides bound to translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garreau de Loubresse et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grollman, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seedhom et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We observed that 30 min is the optimal incubation time for sufficient AHA incorporation and maximum RNA recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Next, we compared the efficiency of CHX and sBlock in stabilizing the nascent peptide by co-sedimentation analysis of AHA-tagged polypeptides with ribosomes along the sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As a control, cells were treated in parallel with puromycin to cause ribosome disassembly and release of the growing peptide chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blobel and Sabatini, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Enam et al., 2020</xref>). In agreement with literature, we found that both CHX and sBlock are able to stabilize AHA-peptides on ribosomes and polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biever et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mathias et al., 1964</xref>). The efficiency of anchoring polypeptides on ribosomes in CHX- and sBlock-treated cells was about 50% higher compared to untreated cells, confirming that the treatment effectively stabilizes nascent polypeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The high signal observed in lighter fractions is likely caused by AHA-labeled proteins released from ribosomes. To overcome this problem, it is possible to perform a pre-cleaning of the cell lysate by sucrose cushioning. This step can increase the efficiency of total RNA isolation with AHARIBO compared with the control (no AHA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). As expected, in puromycin-treated samples, the AHA signal was mainly detected in the first two fractions of the gradient, proving that the signal observed in the heavier fractions of CHX- and sBlock-treated cells was not caused by diffusion of AHA-labeled peptides from lighter to heavier fractions. Since sBlock outperformed CHX in anchoring efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we used this compound in all further experiments.</p><p>Prompted by the evidence that nascent peptides can be stably anchored on ribosomes by a small molecule, we isolated RNAs and proteins associated with the translation complex. To this aim, we performed a label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of AHARIBO-captured proteins relative to the input, to the background biotin-DBCO<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) or AHA<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) and to a sample treated with puromycin (AHA<sup>+</sup> puromycin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), which causes the release of nascent chains. We observed that ribosomal proteins belonging to both the large and small ribosome subunits are indeed more abundant in AHARIBO-rC samples than in controls. LC-MS results were confirmed by western blot analysis of proteins that are component of the large and small ribosomal subunits (RPS6, RPL26) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that terms related to translation (biological process), nucleic acid binding (cellular function), and ribonucleoprotein complex (cellular component) are enriched in AHARIBO-rC compared to the control (no AHA), confirming efficient pulldown of translation-related proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).</p><p>Then, we used AHARIBO-rC to determine the translational status of cultured cells. To this aim, we downregulated protein synthesis by treating HeLa cells with puromycin, heat shock (HS) (10 min at 42°C, during AHA incubation), or arsenite (Ar) treatment, which induces translational inhibition and stress granules formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). We observed a reduction of RNA captured in puromycin-, HS-, and Ar-treated cells relative to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). In line with this finding, qRT-PCR analysis showed about 50% reduction in 18S rRNA levels when translation was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>).</p><p>To further validate AHARIBO-rC, we took advantage of a micropeptide (176 aa) originating from an open reading frame of the TUG1 lncRNA, called TUG1-BOAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lewandowski et al., 2020</xref>). The wild-type (WT) ORF has a non-canonical start codon and a methionine 75 nt upstream of the stop codon. We ectopically expressed the WT TUG1-BOAT transcript and two mutant constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>): (1) the ΔTUG1-BOAT, without the methionine 75 nt upstream of the stop codon and (2) the +1Met TUG1-BOAT with an ATG (methionine) as start codon. The +1Met TUG1-BOAT has two methionines, one at the N terminal and the other at 25 aa (75 nt) before the C-terminal. Our RT-qPCR analysis performed 24 hr or 48 hr after transfection showed a good efficiency of AHARIBO in capturing the TUG1-BOAT RNA when methionines are present (about 50 times more in +1Met TUG1-BOAT than in ΔMet TUG1-BOAT after 24 hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>), confirming the efficiency of AHARIBO-rC in capturing translated RNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>AHARIBO-nP: genome-wide portray of the de novo synthesized proteome</title><p>Motivated by the evidence that AHARIBO-rC can be used to isolate bona fide active ribosomes, we further tested our method genome-wide in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) under basal condition and after differentiation into early neurons (ENs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tebaldi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Of note, 74% of proteins identified through AHARIBO-nP is in common with the pSILAC dataset. The smaller number of proteins identified with AHARIBO-nP compared to pSILAC is most probably related to the shorter time of incubation with AHA (30 min) compared to pSILAC (24 hr) and is consistent with previous observations from similar pulldown enrichment strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bagert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rothenberg et al., 2018</xref>).

This value represents the extent to which AHARIBO-rC RNA differs from the standard method. Our results confirm that AHARIBO captures transcripts encoding for polypeptides in a wide range of length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Since in all eukaryotes proteins are initiated with a methionine residue and the average protein size in eukaryotes is about 300 aa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frith et al., 2006</xref>), virtually any protein can be captured as soon as the nascent peptide exits the ribosome (i.e., when it reaches a length of about 35–40 aa). In about 70% of the proteome, the N-terminal methionine is co-translationally cleaved when the peptide is at least 50 aa long by the enzyme methionine aminopeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wild et al., 2020</xref>), while the remaining 30% retains the methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martinez et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, there is a reasonable probability for at least one AHA residue to be available for each peptide when the inhibitor of translation (sBlock) is added to the cell medium, enabling the capture of the polypeptide outside the ribosome exit tunnel.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>AHARIBO-rC RNA versus de novo proteome analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Enrichment of a given transcript obtained with AHA-mediated RIBOsome isolation (AHARIBO) versus global translatome (x-axis) as a function of the theoretical protein length (y-axis) for mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) (left) and early neurons (ENs) (right).

For protein-coding genes, both standard and AHARIBO RIBO-seq show an enrichment of RPFs in the coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The two datasets show high correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and the expected codon periodicity in the coding sequence in AHARIBO RIBO-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These results further confirm the capability of AHARIBO in capturing ribosomes. With AHARIBO RIBO-seq, we identified a list of lncRNAs covered by ribosome footprints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). By intersecting our AHARIBO RIBO-seq data with those obtained from standard methods (RIBO-seq and RNA-seq after sucrose cushioning) or AHARIBO-rC, we identified 125 common putative translated lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Some of these lncRNA (n = 19) are known to be translated in mouse tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Heesch et al., 2019</xref>). The vast majority of these lncRNAs do not have a known function. Two of the identified lncRNAs (9330151L19Rik and Gm9776) were detected only by standard RIBO-seq and RNA-seq but not with AHARIBO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This result may be due to the absence of translation events (i.e., transcripts loaded with idle ribosomes). Next we validated the coding potential of lncRNAs that are in common between AHARIBO and standard RIBO-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We translated in silico the transcripts in all frames to find potential ORFs with a canonical start codon (AUG). Translated sequences were semi-trypsin-digested in silico and then manually annotated to find confident matching spectra from the AHARIBO-nP protein dataset. Out of the about 46,000 collected spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>), our MS-based proteomics analysis detected peptides with highly corresponding ribosome footprints (e.g., Gm42743, Gm26518, B230354K17Rik, D030068K23Rik, 1810058I24Rik). From the list of 129 lncRNAs that are in common among all AHARIBO protocols and standard RIBO-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), we identified by MS analysis a micropeptide (Mm47) of 47 aa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) at a high degree of confidence. This micropeptide derives from a lncRNA expressed in murine macrophages, and recently characterized by an independent group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatta et al., 2020</xref>) as a relevant peptide able to modulate the innate immunity in mice. Several other lncRNAs show high confidence of translation events with in silico prediction even if they were not perfectly matching our proteomic spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), paving the way for a better characterization of translatable lncRNA that has not been reported before. These results, combined with (1) AHARIBO’s efficiency in detecting an ectopically expressed micropeptide (TUG1-BOAT) and (2) concordance with recently published data, prove that our approach could be useful to unravel translation events in lncRNAs that are misannotated as non-coding. Altogether, our data confirm that our three diverse and complementary AHARIBO approaches represent a unique method to identify ribosome-associated and translated RNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>LncRNAs localize in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm. In the nucleus, they modulate transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, or act as scaffold for protein interaction during chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). In the cytoplasm, the majority of lncRNAs is associated with polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carlevaro-Fita et al., 2016</xref>), where they either can or cannot produce proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>).

Despite these advantages, available technologies hardly capture in a single experiment the dynamics of translation across multiple biological conditions, the translation of unannotated coding transcripts, and translation-related functions of lncRNAs. Now that it is widely accepted that a portion of the genome annotated as non-coding can result in a complex transcriptome partially engaged with ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Djebali et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iyer et al., 2015</xref>), RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling should include micropeptide detection.</p><p>Our data show that AHARIBO serves as a flexible tool to detect translated RNAs, identify lncRNAs bound to elongating ribosomes, and detect de novo synthesized proteins. The intersection of standard RIBO-seq, RNA-seq, and AHARIBO approaches allowed us to identify translated lncRNAs. We demonstrated that AHARIBO is efficient in capturing short translated open reading frames, both native or ectopically expressed. Although LC-MS technologies are not as sensitive as RNA sequencing, we successfully identified a mouse-specific micropeptide reported to originate from a native lncRNA ORF, confirming the effectiveness of AHARIBO. To overcome existing limitations in LC-MS detection, many other translation events on lncRNAs can be predicted combining AHARIBO approaches with in silico translation of the identified leads. This approach would likely allow to selectively validate a list of still uncharacterized lncRNAs. Although the unlabeled background cannot be avoided, a pre-cleaning of the cell lysate with a cushioning step can help to increase the resolution with difficult samples. Moreover, a puromycin treatment instead of sBlock could be added as control in proteomic experiments. A unique feature of AHARIBO is the possibility to simultaneously isolate ribosomes, RNA engaged with ribosomes, and the corresponding proteins produced. Besides the versatility of the method, AHA labeling has the advantage of minimal interference with protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hodas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tom Dieck et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The most prominent limitation of the method relies on the methionine starvation required for efficient AHA incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Calve et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hodas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saleh et al., 2019</xref>). This step can modify the physiological conditions of the cell and needs to be taken into consideration when planning experiments requiring certain stimuli (e.g., drug treatment) during methionine depletion. The conditions used in the AHARIBO protocol give robust protein labeling, but AHA concentration can be conveniently tuned based on specific cell types or biological questions. Additionally, we observed that there are still challenges for LC-MS verification of putative lncRNA peptides identified with AHARIBO. Of note, a potential contribution from background signal needs to be taken into consideration in LC-MS and Ribo-seq analysis.</p><p>With AHARIBO we introduce a strategy for the selective isolation of active ribosomes using the nascent peptide chain as bait for a more comprehensive interrogation of lncRNA biology and proteogenomic studies. Overall, we provide evidence that AHARIBO is a comprehensive and reliable toolkit suitable for downstream parallel RNA-seq, RIBO-seq, and LC-MS analysis, empowering scientists to shed light on the functional complexity of translation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Papillomavirus-related endocervical adenocarcinoma</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0030">CVCL_0030</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">46C embryonic stem cells</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_Y482">CVCL_Y482</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Quattrone A.

Then, 20 µL of 10% SDS and 5 µL of Proteinase K (Qiagen #19131) were added to each sample, and samples were incubated at 37°C for 75 min in a water bath. Subsequently, suspensions were transferred to a new vial, and acid phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (pH 4.5) RNA extraction was performed.</p><p>For both approaches, protocol steps starting from RNA extraction were performed as follows. Briefly, an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol was added, and samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 14,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Aqueous phases were then transferred to new vials, 500 µL of isopropanol and 2 µL of GlycoBlue (Thermo Scientific #AM9516) were added, samples were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 3 min, and then stored overnight at −80°C. The following day samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 30 min, supernatants were removed, 500 µL of 70% ethanol were added to each sample, and samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. Finally, pellets were air-dried and resuspended in 10 µL of nuclease-free water. Extracted RNA was then resolved by electrophoresis through denaturing TBE-urea gels, and fragments between 25 nt and 35 nt were excised. Libraries were prepared using the RiboLace kit_module 2 (IMMAGINA BioTechnolgy #RL001_mod2) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer with a single-end 50 bp run.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>RIBO-seq data analysis</title><p>Reads were processed by removing 5' adapters, discarding reads shorter than 20 nucleotides, and trimming the first nucleotide of the remaining ones (using Trimmomatic v0.36). Reads mapping on the collection of <italic>M. musculus</italic> rRNAs (from the SILVA rRNA database, release 119) and tRNAs (from the Genomic tRNA database: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/">gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>) were removed. Remaining reads were mapped on the mouse transcriptome (using the Gencode M17 transcript annotations). Antisense and duplicate reads were removed. All alignments were performed with STAR (v020201) employing default settings.</p><p>The identification of the P-site position within the reads was performed using riboWaltz (v1.1.0) computing the P-site offsets from the 3' end of the reads. The percentage of P-sites falling in the three annotated transcript regions (5' UTR, CDS, and 3' UTR) was computed using the function <italic>region_psite</italic> included in riboWaltz (v1.1.0). Transcript counts were normalized using the TMM method implemented in the edgeR Bioconductor package. Transcripts displaying 1 CPM in at least one replicate were kept for further analyses.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>L.M. is an employee of IMMAGINA BioTechnology S.r.l.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>C.F. is an employee of IMMAGINA BioTechnology S.r.l.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>A.D.P. is an employee of IMMAGINA BioTechnology S.r.l.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>A.P. is an employee of IMMAGINA BioTechnology S.r.l.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf5"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf6"><p>P.B. is an employee of IMMAGINA BioTechnology S.r.l.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf7"><p>A.Q. is a shareholder of IMMAGINA BioTechnology S.r.l</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf8"><p>G.G. is shareholders of IMMAGINA BioTechnology S.r.l</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf9"><p>G.V. is a scientific advisor of IMMAGINA BioTechnology S.r.l.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf10"><p>M.C. is the founder of, director of, and a shareholder in IMMAGINA BioTechnology S.r.l., a company engaged in the development of new technologies for gene expression analysis at the ribosomal level.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing - first workflow and methods</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-59303-transrepform-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: John L Rinn (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Minati et al. reported a method called AHARIBO to detect RNAs with active translation. Using L-azidohomoalanine (AHA) to label nascent polypeptides, the authors purified the translation complex via click chemistry followed by high-throughput analysis including RNA-seq. LC-MS, and Ribo-seq. The authors compared translatome between ESC and differentiated neurons (EN) using AHARIBO and found some long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that could encode peptides.</p><p>The overall methodology is straightforward and useful. The authors claim that AHARIBO is able to distinguish ribosome-associated lncRNAs and ribosome-translating lncRNAs. This is indeed an important question in the field since a growing body of evidence suggests that a substantial amount of lncRNAs contain functional open reading frames. Although the title, Abstract, and Introduction primarily focus on this topic, the result section did not serve this goal at all. A revision needs to address the key issues below, as well as temper claims and list the potential limitations and interpretations in a revised Discussion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) AHARIBO detection of nascent peptide vs. mature protein association with RNA.Nascent peptide capture does seem to offer a new approach to measure translation. The core strategy is not adequately validated, however, and so it is not clear that these techniques are capturing proteins and RNAs through nascent-chain labeling. Further, individual applications of this technique for proteomics or sequencing are not subject to incisive tests that clearly distinguish the proposed nascent chain capture mechanism from alternative explanations. It is in fact unclear if there is a straightforward path to address these central concerns.</p><p>a) It is clear that the great majority of AHA label is found in completed free proteins rather than in nascent proteins (Figure 1B). Capture of ribosomal proteins (along with a range of other unspecified proteins) in AHA- controls doesn't exclude the possibility that this (Figure 1D) reflects enrichment of new proteins. In addition to labeling of mature proteins, it seems that only 2- to 3-fold enrichment is achieved in comparison with AHA- samples (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). This means that a large fraction of captured protein, including captured ribosomes/polysomes - is unlabelled background.</p><p>b) Likewise, AHA labeling is often used to measure nascent protein synthesis, much like pSILAC labeling. What is the evidence that the concordance in pSILAC and AHARIBO-nP doesn't simply reflect the labeling of fairly new but completely synthesized protein in AHARIBO-nP lysates?</p><p>c) If AHARIBO is capturing nascent peptides, certain strong polarity effects are expected: peptides should be strongly enriched near the N-terminus of proteins relative to the C-terminus. Ribosome footprints should be absent from the first 30 – 40 codons, because these proteins should not expose nascent peptide.</p><p>2) Evidence for newly detected lncRNA encoded peptides via epitope tagging. Can the authors express a tagged version (even if ectopically) of some of the newly identified peptides. This would be a complimentary validation to the mass spec performed and provide spatial localization information. For example, the lncRNA TUG1 was recently reported in Cell and Genome Biology to encode a peptide and is highly abundant in both cell types. Cell : DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.05.010) and genome biology: in press, currently: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/562066v1. Do the authors find TUG1 translated in these cells (the RNA is abundant in both) that would be another validation of a &quot;validated&quot; new peptide that is larger than 100a.a</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;One-shot analysis of translated mammalian lncRNAs with AHARIBO&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The validation of TUG1 peptide strengthens the original conclusion. Since TUG1 cannot be identified from AHARIBO, it will be highly desirable if the authors could show any newly identified peptides from lncRNA, i.e., translatable lincRNA that has not been reported before. At least, a thorough discussion about this potential is needed.</p><p>2) The puromycin treatment resulted in ~15-20% reduction in AHARIBO signal rather than the &gt;80% seen in ribosome profiling experiments, which implies that a substantial fraction of the AHARIBO signal comes from nonspecific background. Please incorporate text to explicitly address this point – should puromycin treatment always be done to confirm AHARIBO screen hits?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59303.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) AHARIBO detection of nascent peptide vs. mature protein association with RNA.Nascent peptide capture does seem to offer a new approach to measure translation.

This is also mentioned in our original manuscript: “The high signal observed in light fractions is caused by AHA-labeled proteins released from ribosomes”. Proteins fully synthesized could affect AHARIBO’s efficiency in different ways. Therefore, we approached the problem as follow:</p><p>1) We check if a sucrose cushioning of the cell lysate could increase AHARIBO’s efficiency in terms of total RNA recovery. Hence, the separation of free full-synthesized proteins from ribosomes before performing AHARIBO, could help to reduce the background.</p><p>2) We performed additional controls to further demonstrate the robustness of the method, even without the need of a sucrose cushioning of the cell lysate</p><p>1) Sucrose cushioning of the AHARIBO cell lysate</p><p>Starting from a HeLa cell lysate, we compared the efficiency of AHARIBO before and after sucrose cushioning in terms of total RNA capture (calculated as the fold change enrichment between AHA treated and control, AHA+/AHA-). As a matter of fact, a clarification of the cell lysate from full length proteins allows better AHARIBO-rC efficiency expressed as RNA recovery.</p><p>The cushioning step could help to improve the AHARIBO efficiency in highly proliferative cells, when protein synthesis rate is maximized and a larger amount of protein can be produced and released from ribosomes during AHA incubation. We included this information in the manuscript and in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. It is important to note that the cushioning step can be relevant for the identification of translated lncRNAs. In fact, the differences between AHARIBO and global translatome for the enrichment in lncRNA are more pronounced after sucrose cushioning (Figure 4A) than without sucrose cushioning (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>That being said, since (i) AHARIBO is meant to be a fast protocol with low instrumental needs (e.g. ultracentrifuge) and (ii) we further confirmed that a clarification of the cell lysate is not essential in low proliferative cell lines (primary neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>); for the sake of clarity, we preferred to not include this step in the standard experimental setup of Figure 1.</p><p>We included this sentence to the manuscript: “To overcome this problem it is possible to perform a pre-cleaning of the cell lysate by sucrose cushioning. This step can increase the efficiency of total RNA isolation compared with the control (no AHA) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D).”</p><p>2) Additional controls to prove the robustness of the method (sections A, B and C)</p><p>A) We reasoned that AHARIBO’s effectiveness could be affected by free AHA-tagged in the cell lysate, if the AHA-tagged proteins are RNA binding proteins (RBPs). In this case, a possibility of co-isolation of RNAs bound to AHA-tagged RBPs cannot be excluded. If this is the case, we should observe a bias toward specific subtypes of isolated mRNAs. In particular, we should expect that RBPs binding sites are significantly overrepresented in the isolated AHARIBO mRNA when compared with the global translatome. To rule out this hypothesis, we analyzed differentially expressed genes during cell differentiation (mESC/EN), searching for specific enrichment of sequences known to be recognized by RNA binding proteins. We screened 1000 differentially expressed mRNA (P value &lt; 0.005) from AHARIBO-rC and from the global translatome, and we mapped the RBP motives in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of the selected transcript (http://aura.science.unitn.it/about/) by using the Atlas of UTR Regulatory Activity (AURA, mouse database) (Dassi et al., 2014).</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>AHARIBO-rC.</title><p>UTR regulatory elements enrichment</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td><bold>Regulatory factor/element</bold></td><td><bold>Regulated query genes</bold></td><td><bold>Enrichment p-value</bold></td><td><bold>BH-corrected p-value</bold></td></tr><tr><td>Tardbp</td><td>119 ( 11.90 % )</td><td>&lt; 1.0E-07</td><td>&lt; 1.0E-07</td></tr><tr><td>Nova2</td><td>175 ( 17.50 % )</td><td>&lt; 1.0E-07</td><td>&lt; 1.0E-07</td></tr><tr><td>Srsf3</td><td>201 ( 20.10 % )</td><td>&lt; 1.0E-07</td><td>&lt; 1.0E-07</td></tr><tr><td>Ezh2</td><td>159 ( 15.90 % )</td><td>1.1E-07</td><td>0.00000034</td></tr><tr><td>Ptbp2</td><td>22 ( 2.20 % )</td><td>1.9E-07</td><td>0.00000057</td></tr><tr><td>Apobec1</td><td>21 ( 2.10 % )</td><td>6.3E-07</td><td>0.0000019</td></tr><tr><td>Mbnl2</td><td>24 ( 2.40 % )</td><td>1.26E-05</td><td>0.00003775</td></tr><tr><td>Ago</td><td>21 ( 2.10 % )</td><td>7.72E-05</td><td>0.00023166</td></tr><tr><td>Srsf2</td><td>68 ( 6.80 % )</td><td>0.001378</td><td>0.00275579</td></tr><tr><td>Elavl4</td><td>2 ( 0.20 % )</td><td>0.001655</td><td>0.00331066</td></tr><tr><td>Elavl2</td><td>2 ( 0.20 % )</td><td>0.003259</td><td>0.00651716</td></tr><tr><td>Elavl1</td><td>3 ( 0.30 % )</td><td>0.004874</td><td>0.00974701</td></tr><tr><td>Rbms3</td><td>1 ( 0.10 % )</td><td>0.023689</td><td>0.02368882</td></tr><tr><td>Rbm3</td><td>15 ( 1.50 % )</td><td>0.036423</td><td>0.03642291</td></tr><tr><td>Rbm8a</td><td>1 ( 0.10 % )</td><td>0.046817</td><td>0.04681703</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="resptable2" position="float"><label>Author response table 2.</label><caption><title>Global translatome.</title><p>UTR regulatory elements enrichment</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td><bold>Regulatory factor/element</bold></td><td><bold>Regulated query genes</bold></td><td><bold>Enrichment p-value</bold></td><td><bold>BH-corrected p-value</bold></td></tr><tr><td>Tardbp</td><td>96 ( 9.60 % )</td><td>&lt; 1.0E-07</td><td>&lt; 1.0E-07</td></tr><tr><td>Nova2</td><td>139 ( 13.90 % )</td><td>&lt; 1.0E-07</td><td>&lt; 1.0E-07</td></tr><tr><td>Srsf3</td><td>168 ( 16.80 % )</td><td>&lt; 1.0E-07</td><td>&lt; 1.0E-07</td></tr><tr><td>Srsf2</td><td>56 ( 5.60 % )</td><td>2.95E-06</td><td>1.77E-05</td></tr><tr><td>Apobec1</td><td>19 ( 1.90 % )</td><td>9.13E-06</td><td>3.65E-05</td></tr><tr><td>Ptbp2</td><td>19 ( 1.90 % )</td><td>1.08E-05</td><td>4.33E-05</td></tr><tr><td>Srsf1</td><td>59 ( 5.90 % )</td><td>7.26E-05</td><td>0.0002177</td></tr><tr><td>Elavl2</td><td>2 ( 0.20 % )</td><td>0.00325858</td><td>0.00651716</td></tr><tr><td>Elavl1</td><td>3 ( 0.30 % )</td><td>0.0048735</td><td>0.00974701</td></tr><tr><td>Ago</td><td>15 ( 1.50 % )</td><td>0.01949888</td><td>0.03899777</td></tr><tr><td>Rbms3</td><td>1 ( 0.10 % )</td><td>0.02368882</td><td>0.02368882</td></tr><tr><td>Rbm8a</td><td>1 ( 0.10 % )</td><td>0.04681703</td><td>0.04681703</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>We noticed that AHARIBO and global translatome retrieve similar results for highly represented regulatory elements. Therefore, we can exclude any major bias due to the co-isolation of RNAs through AHA-tagged RBPs. The only significant and robust difference between the two datasets is related to the regulator factor <italic>histone-lysine N-methyltransferase, Ezh2</italic>. This protein is present in actively dividing cells, widely expressed in early embryos and in central and peripheral nervous system. Since we did not identified this protein in AHARIBO-nP, we can claim that the protein is not AHA-labelled and the related RNA motive is enriched because it probably binds UTRs of differentially expressed transcripts during translation.</p><p>In conclusion, our analysis on UTR regulatory elements did not show a strong difference between the two datasets (AHARIBO and global translatome), suggesting that full length AHA-tagged RNA binding proteins do not affect AHARIBO RNA results.</p><p>B) A possibility to reduce the free protein content is to reduce the AHA incubation time. Unfortunately, a compromise in the time of incubation is required when cell lines have different protein synthesis rates. We tested AHARIBO on different cellular models (HeLa, mESC) and differentiation state (mESC differentiate into early neurons). Early neurons (EN) have a protein turnover slower than embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and proliferative (HeLa) cells. In this work, we empirically defined the optimal time point for RNA enrichment on AHARIBO beads. To be consistent, we set a constant incubation time of 30 min among all experiments. This time is required to maximizing the recovery of both RNA and ribosomal proteins in HeLa, mESCs, and mESC differentiated in early neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This time point is probably more than enough for a proper nascent protein labeling of human immortalized cancer cells (HeLa) and mESCs (where at 30 min a lot of proteins are produced and released) but it is the minimum requirement for a good efficiency in EN without additional step of sucrose cushioning.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Total protein staining.</title><p>Left, total proteins from mESC and early neurons (EN) cell lysates (20 µg total protein for each sample measured by Bradford assay) loaded on a SDS-PAGE and the membrane stained by biotin-cycloaddition followed by streptavidin-HRP.

In the first case, due to a reduced protein synthesis. In the second case, due to the inhibition of protein synthesis and a release of the nascent chain from the ribosome.</p><p>i) Heat shock. First, we checked if the heat shock was effective by performing a RT-qPCR to monitor the RNA level of a member of the 70 kilodalton heat shock proteins (HSPA4 ), a family of proteins known to be involved in the response to heat shock (Richter et al., 2010). We observed that HSPA4 is upregulated in AHARIBO-rC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>) for both HeLa and mESC. Then, we checked if the heat shock affects global protein synthesis by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B</xref>). As a consequence of the heat shock, we observed a decrease of the AHA-labelled proteins (representing de-novo protein synthesis) compared with untreated cells (no heat shock).</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>a) HSPA4 fold change (ΔΔct) measured by qPCR in mouse embryonic stem cells and HeLa with or without heat shock (10 min at 42°C).</title><p>For each sample, HSPA5 AHA+/AHA- signal ratios were normalized to the control and to the housekeeping gene. b) Left, quantification of AHA content before (control) and after heat shock.

Experiments were performed in triplicates.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59303-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>As reported in the original manuscripts, when protein synthesis is inhibited (e.g. arsenite treatment), AHARIBO-rC captures less ribosomes and associated RNAs. According to that, and after having established that the heat shock condition was effective, we applied AHARIBO-rC on HeLa cells with or without heat shock followed by RNA extraction form AHARIBO-rC. We observed that the total AHARIBO-rC RNA is reduced after heat shock, as expected due to the reduction in protein synthesis.</p><p>In conclusion, a down-regulated protein synthesis by heat shock results in a reduction of RNA captured relative to the control, as reported in the main text for the arsenite treatment. We included these results in Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</p><p>ii) Puromycin treatment. We performed AHARIBO experiment in HeLa cells treated with 50 μm of puromycin. Puromycin reacts with the nascent chain, terminating translation and causing ribosome disassembling. Therefore, AHA-tagged nascent chains will no longer be available on ribosomes for AHARIBO capture. Strikingly, we observed a strong improvement of the signal-to-background ratio for AHARIBO RNA enrichment as further validated by LC-MS and western blot analysis (see below, answer to reviewer #1b).</p><p>In conclusion, the release of the nascent peptide chain from the ribosomes by means of puromycin results in a reduction of RNA captured relative to the control. We included this additional validation of AHARIBO in Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Capture of ribosomal proteins (along with a range of other unspecified proteins) in AHA- controls doesn't exclude the possibility that this (Figure 1D) reflects enrichment of new proteins. In addition to labeling of mature proteins, it seems that only 2- to 3-fold enrichment is achieved in comparison with AHA- samples (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). This means that a large fraction of captured protein - including captured ribosomes/polysomes - is unlabelled background.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to the unlabeled background present in AHARIBO. A main source of this background could be generated by unwanted reactions of the biotin-dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) reagent in the cell lysate when AHA is not present. In fact, the kinetic of the reaction of DBCO with AHA is fast and efficient, but when AHA is not present (as in the “AHA-” control) the ligand can react more efficiently with other chemical groups (van Geel et al., 2012). To better understand the problem, we performed AHARIBO with two different controls:</p><p><italic>control 1</italic>: AHARIBO with AHA but without DBCO</p><p><italic>control 2</italic>: AHARIBO with AHA but with puromycin treatment instead than sBlock treatment.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we strengthened and validated our manuscript by adding new set of experiments (data included in Figure 1—source data 1):</p><p>i) New LC-MS analysis with <italic>control 1</italic></p><p>After isolation of the ribosomal complexes with AHARIBO-rC from HeLa cell lysates, we extracted all proteins captured. In parallel the same experiment was performed without biotin-DBCO, therefore no specific pull-down of AHA-tagged nascent peptides and ribosomes is possible. After trypsin digestion and LC-MS analysis on all proteins co-purified with AHARIBO-rC we selectively identified all ribosomal proteins. We observed from a 4-fold (e.g. RPL23A) to 18-fold (e.g. RPL4, RPL7) enrichment is achieved for AHARIBO-rC in comparison with “control 1” samples. This means that a portion of the unlabeled background is DBCO related.</p><p>ii) New LC-MS analysis and western blots results with <italic>control 2</italic></p><p>We reasoned that an additional experiment to account for the DBCO-related background is to include a control where the nascent peptide is released from ribosome instead of being stabilized on it with sBlock. We treated cells with puromycin instead of sBlock and we repeated the LC-MS analysis (in this case AHA is present in both control and puromycin treated sample). Our results show that less background and a stronger enrichment is obtained in LC-MS and in western blot data compared with the AHA<sup>-</sup> control (no AHA). This result is in agreement with our data on the RNA recovery reported at the reviewer answer 2cii.</p><p>iii) Dedicated experiments with an ectopically expressed micropeptide.</p><p>See answer to reviewer #2. The ectopic expression of the short peptide Tug1-Boat demonstrates that in the absence of methionine in the nascent peptide chain, the Tug1-Boat transcript is not efficiently co-purified with AHARIBO (50-fold signal-to-background).</p><p>Although the DBCO-related background is hardly removable, these additional experiments confirm the robustness of the method. We changed Figure 1 and the main text according to the new results and we added this to Figure 1 and Figure1—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Likewise, AHA labeling is often used to measure nascent protein synthesis, much like pSILAC labeling. What is the evidence that the concordance in pSILAC and AHARIBO-nP doesn't simply reflect the labeling of fairly new but completely synthesized protein in AHARIBO-nP lysates?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in highlighting the relation between pSILAC and AHARIBO-nP. We apologize that this point was not clear enough.</p><p>We tackled the question comparing 100 differentially expressed proteins (mean of triplicate sets of data) detected by pSILAC and AHARIBO-nP, whose transcripts were detected by AHARIBOrC RNA as well. Our data show a poor concordance between the two datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Therefore, AHARIBO-nP is not reflecting the total protein turnover as measured by pSILAC, but it is capturing only a fraction of the pSILAC proteome.</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Protein fold change (log2) of differentially expressed proteins during cellular differentiation of mESCs to early neurons.</title><p>Comparison between pSILAC(black) and AHARIBO proteome (red).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59303-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Additionally, we compared differentially expressed genes detected using the global translatome versus the protein turnover (pSILAC). The analysis revealed a poor concordance between pSILAC and global translatome RNA variations (Pearson’s r = 0.27), differently from what we observed with AHARIBO (main Figure 3).</p><p>Therefore, we can conclude that AHARIBO protein does not mostly reflect all pSILAC data, but only a fraction of the them represented by translated mRNA during AHA incubation. We modified the Results section and we add to Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) If AHARIBO is capturing nascent peptides, certain strong polarity effects are expected: peptides should be strongly enriched near the N-terminus of proteins relative to the C-terminus. Ribosome footprints should be absent from the first 30 – 40 codons, because these proteins should not expose nascent peptide.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting the possibility of a polarity in our ribosome profiling data. Related to that, other groups reported a reduced coverage of ribosome footprints at the beginning of the transcript in selective ribosome profiling experiments to capture ribosomes engaged with chaperon proteins. For example, the Bakau’s lab (Figure 3A in Oh et al., 2011) reported that the <italic>E. coli</italic> trigger factor (TF) engages with the polypeptide emerging from the exit channel after the first 100 amino acids are translated. A similar result was observed in yeast (Figure 1B in Döring et al., 2017) where a selective Ribo-seq revealed a reduced read density in the first 50 codons reflecting the interaction of chaperon proteins with the nascent chains beyond a length of 50 aa.</p><p>Given that the first 30 aa are buried inside the ribosome exit tunnel and chaperon proteins need a certain number of amino acid to support the proper folding of the newly synthetized polypeptide, it is clear that these proteins engage with nascent chain when at least 20 residues are exposed from the exit tunnel of the ribosome.</p><p>To understand if this was the case for AHARIBO as well, we analyzed the differences between the P-site density of AHARIBO Ribo-seq and total RIBO-seq (input).</p><p>First, we looked at the ratio between the average P-sites density distribution in AHARIBO RIBO-seq and the average number of P-sites on the whole CDS, in the first 120 nucleotides from initiation. Strikingly, we observed a significant (measured with two-sided Wilcoxon– Mann–Whitney test) lower P-site density for AHARIBO in the first 120 nt, confirming that the first 40 amino acids are less covered by reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>, left).</p><fig id="sa2fig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Left, P-site density initiation/CDS ratio for total RIBO-seq (input) and AHARIBO Ribo-seq.</title><p>Right, metagene profiles showing the ratio between the AHARIBO density and input read density within the first 450 codons from the start codon.

This could be explained by the different type of engagement with the nascent chain. Unlike experiments published for chaperon proteins, AHARIBO captures the nascent chain through a small molecule, i.e. AHA reaction with biotin-DBCO followed by beads pulldown. We cannot exclude that the small biotin-DBCO molecule reacts with the N-terminal AHA-tagged nascent chain just outside the exit tunnel, or partially inside the main exit tunnel. According to that, we speculate that the molecule could bind the nascent chain, much before large chaperon proteins interact with the nascent chain.</p><p>In support of this hypothesis, we observed that Joachim Frank’s lab (Gabashvili et al., 2001) and Song’s lab (Dao Duc et al., 2019) reports that the ribosome exit tunnel have a dynamic behavior and multiple exits to facilitate the extrusion of nascent peptides (Figure 1 in Duc DK et al., 2019) from ribosomes. In particular, by comparing 20 different cryo EM and X-ray crystallography structure of the ribosome from all three domains of life, D. Duc. et al. observed that the first 25-30 aa buried inside the ribosome exit tunnel are passing through two main constrictions. A first, at about 30 Å (about 9 aa) from the PTC and made by the uL4 and uL22 protein loops. The second, at about 50 Å (about 15 aa) from the PTC formed by an extended arm of uL4 (Figure 4A in Duc DK et al., 2019). The radius of the constriction is about 4 Å at the first troughs and 3-4 Å at the second (in human). While the radius at the exit is about 7-8 Å.</p><p>With a length of 32 Å and a radius of 7 Å, biotin-DBCO can potentially reach the internal part of the tunnel at about 60-80 Å from the PTC. This ribosome architecture at the exit tunnel may influence the interaction of small molecules with the ribosomes. Therefore, we should expect a reduction of the Ribo-seq signal in the first 75 nt from the start codon. This is in agreement with our meta-profile reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref> (right) and with the Tug1-boat micropeptide ectopic expression experiment (Reviewer answer #2).</p><p>3) We still observed some signal at the start codon, although less than in the input. This can be related to the background or to a possible capture of the tRNAi<sup>met</sup> (substituted by tRNAi<sup>AHA</sup> in AHARIBO) within the 48S translational initiation complex. This complex could generate signal at the start codon as previously reported for selective 48S profiling experiments (Bohlen et al., 2020).</p><p>At the present stage, the hypothesis on ribosome profiling data reported above are not supported by additional biochemical and structural data. For the sake of clarity we did not include these information in the manuscript. Nevertheless, we further discussed this point in the answer to reviewers essential revision 2.</p><p>We are aware that AHARIBO for ribosome profiling could have a better mechanistic description, but this topic is out of the scope of this work and could result in a separate publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Evidence for newly detected lncRNA encoded peptides via epitope tagging. Can the authors express a tagged version (even if ectopically) of some of the newly identified peptides. This would be a complimentary validation to the mass spec performed and provide spatial localization information. For example, the lncRNA TUG1 was recently reported in Cell and Genome Biology to encode a peptide and is highly abundant in both cell types. Cell : DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.05.010) and genome biology: in press, currently: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/562066v1. Do the authors find TUG1 translated in these cells (the RNA is abundant in both) that would be another validation of a &quot;validated&quot; new peptide that is larger than 100a.a</p></disp-quote><p>The suggestion of the reviewer is extremely useful for a better understanding of AHARIBO mechanism and efficiency. Unfortunately, we did not find TUG1 transcripts in our mESC and EN RNA-seq and Ribo-seq datasets. Hence, a proper discussion about the capture TUG1 with AHARIBO in mESC and EN is not possible.</p><p>We, therefore, decided to ectopically express the putative protein produced by the open reading frame of TUG1, called TUG1-BOAT (Tug1-Bifunctional ORF and Transcript) in HeLa cells as reported in (Lewandowski et al., 2020).</p><p>Construct generation and transfection was performed as in Lewandowski J.P. et al., 2019 with some minor changes (reported in the updated Materials and methods section of the manuscript) to adapt the experimental setup to the AHARIBO method. Briefly, we synthesized three different constructs for human Tug1 ORF1 (Thermo Scientific):</p><p>1) The first (called <italic>WT TUG1-BOAT</italic>) is the one reported in Lewandowski J.P. et al., 2019. It has a non-canonical start codon and a methionine at 75 nt (25 aa) upstream the stop codon.</p><p>2) The second (called ΔTUG1-BOAT), is deleted by the only methionine of the sequence present at 75 nt upstream the stop codon</p><p>3) The third (called +1Met TUG1-BOAT), has the non-canonical CTG start codon exchange with an ATG codon (methionine). Therefore, the third construct has two methionines, one at the N terminal and a second one at 25 aa before (75 nt) the stop.</p><p>We performed target TUG1-BOAT qPCR analysis on AHARIBO pull-down and input for each experiment/construct after 12 and 24 hours of transfection, to validate the efficiency in capturing short translated ORF deriving from a lncRNA (TUG1).</p><p>Our RT-qPCR analysis shows a good efficiency (10x – 50x compared with the control) of AHARIBO in capturing TUG1-BOAT RNA when a methionine at the N terminal of the encoded peptide is present (about 50 times more in +1Met TUG1-BOAT than with ΔTUG1-BOAT).</p><p>We observed that the WT transcript is captured as well, although the methionine is only 25 aa far from the stop codon. The 25 amino acids are just enough for the polypeptide to protrude from the exit tunnel (25 aa = 75 nt = about 90 Å) This is in agreement with our ribosome profiling data (showing a lower density in the first 25 codons) confirming that AHARIBO can engage with short nascent peptides at the exit of the ribosome tunnel (answer to reviewers essential revision #1c).</p><p>The expression of the exogenous small ORF TUG1-BOAT is a valuable demonstration of the AHARIBO efficiency. We described this result in the main text of the manuscript and we included this in Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</p><p>Next, to gain more insights into the function of thee lncRNAs in mESCs and early neurons we:</p><p>i) Compared our results with a dataset of experimentally validated lncRNA producing short peptides (van Heesch et al., 2019) in rat and mouse heart.</p><p>We noted that 19 lncRNAs detected by AHARIBO-rC in mESCs, are present in the dataset reported by Heesch S. et al., 2019, highlighting the fact that AHARIBO can capture translated lncRNA. Since most of these lncRNA are tissue specific (Heesch S et al., 2019), we expected that only a small subset of mESC and EN lncRNAs captured by AHARIBO were in common with the lncRNAs identified by Heesch S et al. in rat and mouse heart.</p><p>ii) Analyzed the lncRNA differentially expression level after heat shock in mESCs</p><p>We exposed mESCs to a short heat shock (42°C for 10°C), to induce the expression of a subset of genes involved in the adaptive response. First, we confirmed that cells react to heat shock by monitoring the upregulation of the heat shock transcript (HSPA4). Next, we confirmed that AHARIBO can successfully detect changes induced by the stress (see answer reviewer #1).</p><p>Then, we performed AHARIBO-rC RNA-seq in mESCs before and after heat shock and we analyzed differentially expressed lncRNAs. We did not observe any significant change in lncRNAs differential expression at the level of the global translatome, while in AHARIBO-rC we detected 11 lncRNA (Table 3) differentially expressed after heat shock. Unfortunately, none of them has been validated by other groups or is known to produce micropeptides. Therefore, we decided to not include these data in the manuscripts, but they further demonstrate the potential of our technique. In fact, this experiments could help further investigation on the effect of lncRNAs in heat shock, as previously reported on other species (Bernabò et al., 2020), since only a few data related to human cells are published so far (Place and Noonan, 2014).</p><p>Additional proteomic analysis are needed to better characterized potentially translated lncRNA after heat shock in human cells, which may result in a separate work.</p><table-wrap id="resptable3" position="float"><label>Author response table 3.</label><caption><title>lncRNA differentially expressed in mESC after heat shock and captured by AHARIBO-rC.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>geneSymbol</th><th>logFC</th><th>logCPM</th><th>PValue</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gm28592</td><td>4.045326</td><td>-0.18544</td><td>1.01E-07</td></tr><tr><td>Gm26635</td><td>2.237428</td><td>0.055059</td><td>7.37E-08</td></tr><tr><td>1110019D14Rik</td><td>-2.13009</td><td>3.224659</td><td>4.19E-07</td></tr><tr><td>4930467D21Rik</td><td>-2.46151</td><td>2.567217</td><td>2.90E-07</td></tr><tr><td>Gm26776</td><td>-2.6145</td><td>0.752226</td><td>1.83E-07</td></tr><tr><td>Malat1</td><td>-2.65273</td><td>11.84434</td><td>1.38E-08</td></tr><tr><td>AC162181.1</td><td>-2.81543</td><td>1.301371</td><td>1.40E-10</td></tr><tr><td>Gm30551</td><td>-3.16013</td><td>0.589125</td><td>4.86E-09</td></tr><tr><td>Gm5432</td><td>-3.70264</td><td>-0.11255</td><td>1.06E-07</td></tr><tr><td>mt-Rnr2</td><td>-4.56884</td><td>15.37853</td><td>2.27E-10</td></tr><tr><td>4930440I19Rik</td><td>-4.61188</td><td>0.014935</td><td>3.90E-07</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The validation of TUG1 peptide strengthens the original conclusion.

At least, a thorough discussion about this potential is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for having appreciated our additional experiments and for the constructive comment and thorough suggestion about the TUG1 results.</p><p>We addressed the question raised by the reviewer through additional analysis of our AHARIBO RNA-seq, RIBO-seq and proteomic data.</p><p>In AHARIBO RIBO-seq, we identified numerous lncRNAs covered by ribosome footprints. By intersecting AHARIBO RIBO-seq data with those obtained from standard methods (RIBO-seq and RNA-seq after sucrose cushioning) and AHARIBO-rC RNA-seq, we identified more than hundred common putative translated lncRNAs (Figure 4B, new version of the manuscript). To validate the coding potential of lncRNAs identified by AHARIBO RNA-seq (Figure 4D, new version of the manuscript) and Ribo-seq, we translated <italic>in silico</italic> the transcripts in all frames to find potential ORFs. <italic>In silico</italic> peptides were used to match confident matching spectra obtained from the AHARIBO-nP protein dataset.

Among these lncRNAs we identified a micropeptide (Mm47) of 47 aa (Figure 4D, new version of the manuscript) with a high degree of confidence in mass spectroscopy data.
